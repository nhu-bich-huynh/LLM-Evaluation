"The regulation adopted in April 2009 promotes their transparency, submits the agencies themselves to European supervision, and begins to deal with issues relating to their responsibility and quality, tackling some of the conflicts of interest in their operations; the Commission's new proposal continues along these lines."
"I am convinced that we in Parliament are going to contribute to the existence of supervision from 1 January 2011 and, furthermore, cooperate in supervision projects in order for there to be a stricter regulatory framework."
"The role that the credit rating agencies are playing in the debt and public deficit crisis, revealing the discretional nature of the methods used for their ratings, how they are prepared and how they are communicated; the highly pro-cyclical impact of the ratings of agencies that have sometimes been described as pyromaniac firemen who stoke the fires even further; and their clash with the positions of the main international and European financial institutions to the extent that the European Central Bank has decided to disregard their ratings in sovereign debt transactions: all of these make it necessary to reconsider their role in a more in-depth way and match them up to the general interests."
"Questions are now being openly raised as to whether the credit rating agencies are capable of making objective and responsible evaluations, in particular, of sovereign debt."
"The questions that are being asked are of a deeper nature - as you said, a structural nature - and affect their compatibility with democratic principles, because they have a bearing on the efforts that pensioners, workers and vulnerable parts of the population are making, and which they do not wish to see wasted and trampled on by irresponsibility in how the markets operate."
"They are questions that affect independence."
"Are public credit rating agencies compatible with private ownership?"
"Is it possible to be both judge and interested party?"
"Is it possible to have a credit rating as a business model based on payments by the very actors who are to be examined?"
"Can the actors themselves choose who examines them?"
"The United States Senate is already tackling these issues and we need to tackle them here too; they are issues that affect responsibility and sustainability."
"Can responsible governance be ensured, that avoids short-term perspectives and ensures stability?"
"Can the agencies remain indifferent to the commitments of the European authorities and the efforts of the main international public actors?"
"Will they respond to the effects of the market, above all, of their consequences that could - as you have said - be classified as harmful?"
"Will the privileges of regulation be maintained?"
"Will the regulator be bound by the rules that call for their ratings to be used?"
"Will there continue to be a lack of competition?"
"As far as legitimacy is concerned, can agencies maintain so much influence over our economies with such little control?"
"Is it necessary to go beyond supervisory control and go to the internal control of the structure of governance itself, and even the structure of business itself?"
"A public European credit rating system should be established and a new role imposed on the existing European agencies, while new agencies should be promoted and the need for a global rating system following new principles should be considered."
"These are the questions to which answers are needed, Commissioner."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, not so long ago, voices were raised to say that rating agencies should not have downgraded Greek and other bonds."
"'Look at what it has done to the euro,' they said."
"Now I was going to say whether any more needed to be said to prove the huge conflict of interest that there would be if countries effectively rated their own debt."
"Then this morning, in the debate on statistics, Commissioner Rehn said yesterday's downgrade by Moody's was not 'conveniently timed' and that that would influence Commission thinking on credit rating agency regulation."
"I am sorry, I do understand frustration, but my thoughts were: have you gone mad?"
"I do not want ratings that are 'convenient', whether that be 'convenient' for investment banks or 'convenient' for central banks."
"Indeed, ratings have been a bit too 'convenient' for regulators to lean on too, driving out proper due diligence."
"Now, a public agency for non-sovereign assets has some attractions, but how do we get over the implied guarantee?"
"How do we get over political interference if bank capital is at risk with the macro-economic consequences of that?"
"We have some way to go in the search for capacity, independence and integrity, but of one thing I am sure, and that is that corporate governance principles play a part, be it in the public or private sector, and that should apply to ESMA and the other ESAs too."
"Mr President, Mr Barnier, thank you for speaking in German."
"Firstly, I would like to say that the crises that we have yet again experienced once more raise certain key issues."
"In addition to what has already been said, I would like to particularly re-emphasise certain aspects."
"One is that the rating agencies have frequently turned out to be guessing agencies; in other words, agencies that were no more capable of assessing the risks than anyone else."
"Consequently, we must considerably reduce the importance that is placed on the assessments made by these rating agencies as compared with other assessments in the market."
"A second central problem that has emerged is the oligopolisation of this market."
"There are only a few serious providers."
"As a result, it makes sense to expand the number of providers and also their backgrounds."
"To this extent, your comments, Mr Barnier, on bringing more players into the market - which have also been echoed by others here - make sense."
"Thirdly, we have the central problem of incentives, about which little has been said so far in this debate."
"For what do we find among the rating agencies?"
"A situation in which those who give the ratings are selected by their clients from among the few agencies that exist and are paid for doing so."
"It is as akin to university students visiting their professor before their exams and negotiating payment with him, with everyone wondering afterwards why the grades were systematically so high."
"We need to look at this problem of incentives."
"I know that the Commission is also giving some thought to how we can ensure that those that offer a financial product can no longer select, as it were, their rating agency."
"This takes us to the heart of the reforms required in those sectors where private providers are involved - those that are subjected to rating; in other words, in the areas other than government bonds."
"We need to remove this false incentive system."
"Rather than replacing a private oligopoly with a public monopoly, as has sometimes been suggested by those on the left, we should ensure that a public agency ensures that different players are continually selected to provide ratings and that the quality of the ratings is made public and systematically checked."
"Mr Barnier, I look forward to your proposals."
"I hope that these proposals will result in us being able to systematically resolve the problems that remain in this area following previous efforts, including those of Mr Gauzès and the previous Commission and the Council - for which we are grateful; and that we are able to do so without creating a new monopoly, but rather by consistently getting to grips with the problems of incentives and regulation."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, it was clear very early in the financial crisis that there had been huge failings on the part of credit rating agencies."
"Hence, it was one of the first things addressed by the EU last year."
"Updating the directive to cast responsibility for the EU activities of the predominantly US-based agencies is to be welcomed as a move to monitor their activity more closely here in Europe."
"Credit rating agencies are extremely powerful organisations and have the ability to move the markets with a change of rating."
"Their independence needs, therefore, to be ascertained and maintained at all times."
"However, any rating decisions that trigger a flow of billions of euros should not come as a surprise to the market."
"For example, credit rating agencies should publish their ongoing stress tests and scenario analyses so as to improve market transparency and minimise shocks."
"However, we must remember what it is credit rating agencies are set up to do: to assess the risk of default of an entity, be it a product or a corporation, especially a publicly listed company including financial institutions or even sovereign states."
"In the same way that we should not blame credit rating agencies for responding to legitimate information on the state of our banks, we should not use them as an excuse for the market's reaction to the dire state of our public finances."
"Although monitoring their activity more closely is to be supported, a more critical proposal needs to be framed around a different question, namely: why have the markets, investors, corporations and sovereign states relied so heavily on credit rating agencies rather than conducting adequate due diligence and collecting information for themselves?"
"In particular, why is the credit rating market dominated by three names when there are many more available to the marketplace?"
"When we have answered these broader questions, then the way credit rating agencies are held to account will become more meaningful."
"With their great power and influence in the markets, there should also be significant responsibility."
"Mr President, I would just like to remind you that the rating agency Moody downgraded Greece again last night."
"We all know that the Greek Government has placed enormous pressure on its people in recent weeks, in order to get the crisis under control."
"We all know that the European Union has put together a package worth EUR 750 billion in order to support the countries that have found themselves in crisis and to help them out of it."
"Nevertheless, Greece has been downgraded."
"In fact, the same fate has befallen Spain, as well, because it, too, has been downgraded after adopting a savings package."
"Mr Barnier, you have just used the metaphor of a thermometer and said that it must not be broken."
"I do wonder, however, if a thermometer is really a suitable metaphor for rating agencies."
"A thermometer obviously does nothing to help improve the condition of the clients, the patient in question - which is something it just cannot do."
"After all, the thermometer is no drug and is obviously making the patient's condition even worse."
"However, it is unacceptable that the countries which are making these efforts should end up being downgraded even further, despite everything they have done."
"This raises the question about what these rating agencies actually do."
"It has already been said that they failed to spot the crisis coming."
"Therefore, rating agencies did not help predict or diagnose the crisis."
"Shortly before it collapsed, Lehman Brothers received quite a positive rating."
"So, with the methods they used, they were not able or did not want to recognise what we had in store."
"In that respect, this instrument has been a total failure."
"Nor have they helped us manage the crisis."
"I have just given you a newspaper quote on that: 'Ratings have not helped improve the crisis situation despite all the efforts made and there is concern' - as the media put it - 'that we will not be able to see through the packages we have put together'."
"This means they will pull us down and downgrade us even further."
"To conclude, I would like to point out that countries and companies are just not comparable."
"We have to take a closer look at these ratings."
"Just doing a bit of window dressing is not enough."
"What we need is a root-and-branch reform of rating systems."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, credit rating agencies sold their souls to the devil some years ago when they started to rely on those companies whose bonds needed grading for payment."
"He who pays the piper calls the tune."
"It inevitably led to misgrading."
"Most credit rating agencies employ children who can barely read a balance sheet."
"They only change their gradings when a disaster is apparent to all."
"Paradoxically, it is usually the hedge funds who find out the truth behind the numbers."
"They exposed Enron, for example."
"But the truth about numbers can be unpopular, especially here, which is why we hate them."
"However, even the coke-sniffing youngsters at the credit agencies know that Ireland, Greece, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom and Portugal are broke."
"Kaput is kaput in any language!"
"So what does this House propose?"
"Our own credit rating agency paid for by us, guaranteed to dance to our tune."
"It can stick AAA ratings to junk bonds issued by the eurozone's failed economies. The question is, who would these fool?"
"I suggest, with the exception of some English county councils and the BBC economics correspondents, virtually nobody."
"When the people of Europe realise that they have been the guinea pigs in a gigantic failed currency experiment, they will burn this place down and guillotine the lot of us, and who could blame them?"
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the harm caused by credit rating agencies is now plain to see."
"The sovereign debt crisis has just confirmed their pro-cyclical nature."
"Blind as they were before the fire started, credit rating agencies are acting like real arsonists, fanning the flames of the crisis."
"The Commission regulation of September 2009 has, as ever, gone unheeded."
"Due to their inherent lack of foresight, the European bodies are being forced, once again, to take urgent action."
"The proposals being submitted to us range from maintaining the law of the market, which is perverted by obvious conflicts of interest, to the Soviet-style excessive regulation beloved of the European Commission."
"We are jumping out of the frying pan into the fire."
"The desire recently expressed by Mr Barroso to place credit rating agencies under the supervision of the European Central Bank and of the Commission is simply unrealistic, especially after the astounding statement made by Mr Trichet in February 2010, and I quote: 'The efforts to consolidate bank balance sheets require a high degree of confidentiality'."
"In other words, they require obscurity and secrecy."
"It is clear that we are tackling the effects of the problem and not the causes."
"Knowing whether it is investors or issuers that have to pay the agencies, and whether the latter have to be private or public, independent or supervised, solves nothing."
"As Maurice Allais says, until such time as it is no longer possible to use credit ex nihilo to buy without having and to sell without owning, capitalism will go from boom to bust, with increasingly devastating consequences for nations and economies."
"Above all, then, we need to ban the creation of any money or bonds without real and tangible compensation."
"In so doing, we will put an end to the wild and irrational speculation of the markets, which means that there will no longer be a need for credit rating agencies."
"Mr President, the recent attack by European leaders on credit rating agencies, regarding the timing and degree of downgrades being meted out to countries' sovereign debts, may be seen by some as somewhat exaggerated."
"However, the failures of credit rating agencies are now well known - I think there is general agreement from all sides of Parliament on this."
"They have given high ratings to bonds that subsequently defaulted."
"Now that the tide has turned, and the economic outlook across Europe remains bleak, they are guilty of overreacting in the opposite direction."
"Not even an impressive and unprecedented EUR 750 billion package seemed to convince them."
"Having said that, we have to be careful when reacting to this, and not appearing to shoot the messenger just because he brings bad news."
"One thing is for sure: whether they overrate or underrate a financial product, the influence of the rating agencies on global financial markets is enormous."
"In effect, they can and do hold a country and its people to ransom, including workers and pensioners."
"This cannot but have political implications, which need to be addressed."
"We need to understand how rating agencies create and sell their ratings."
"The arrangement between the security issuer and the agencies is an obvious problem."
"Secondly, there is the question of the number of agencies themselves and the degree of effective competition between them."
"If banks and financial institutions are to be regulated, as they must be, why should rating agencies be treated any differently, especially given the oligopolistic structure of the rating agency market?"
"The causes of the problem, including the conflicts of interest, are therefore clear."
"The solutions, however, appear less straightforward, so let us keep level-headed and find the right solution, being careful not to overreact with serious consequences."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, rating agencies have played an appalling role in the global financial crisis and in the euro difficulties and are far from deserving of praise."
"Lack of transparency, conflicts of interest, financing through contracting entities and the publication of ratings at questionable times with a procyclical effect, or shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted, speak for themselves."
"Rating agencies have been, and continue to be, oblivious to this and do not see these problems."
"I personally have proposed that the EU should act now and I am pleased that you, too, feel the same."
"We should establish a European rating agency on the basis of a foundation model."
"Obviously, this foundation model must be financially independent."
"It must not be subject to any political interference, either from the European Central Bank, the Commission or any Member States."
"As an independent foundation, this European agency could become a serious competitor to the oligopoly, or indeed the monopoly, of the three rating agencies we are discussing now."
"It should be the case that any product offered in Europe and all issuers operating in Europe be required to give two ratings, one of which must come from this European agency."
"In order to be independent, this foundation must also be financially independent."
"This means that we need seed-funding that could be provided by the European Investment Bank or perhaps the Commission, and from that point on, this European foundation would have to finance itself."
"The question of whether such financing should come from contracting authorities or users remains to be clarified."
"This was raised earlier on by Mr Giegold."
"We have to reach a decision on this as well."
"On a general note, we should also consider whether we could restrict our reliance on rating agencies somewhat because it seems to me that we are much too dependent on them at present."
"Mr President, I welcome the debate on rating agencies."
"We do need to look at the reliance on ratings and how to encourage more agencies so that there is more competition, as well as the issue of conflict of interest with respect to borrower-paid ratings."
"However, I would say that it has always been well known to every investor that this potential for conflict existed and that credit ratings are themselves not a recommendation to buy or sell."
"We should also remember that, to achieve our 2020 goals, the EU needs investment and that needs market confidence, and rating agencies are a vital part of market confidence."
"When ratings work, they increase capital markets' access for borrowers, lower interest rates and thus, for sovereign issuers, save taxpayers' money."
"They also serve to give investors some guidance but, as I said, not buy and sell decisions."
"Please remember that in Europe, no AAA-rated sovereign or corporate issuer has ever defaulted."
"Even in this crisis, the level of AAA defaults in structured credits in Europe is less than 0.3%, which means that 99.9% of AAAs have not defaulted."
"We do need this investor confidence."
"We do need to look at our rating agencies, but please remember that they have not got everything wrong."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that credit rating agencies should be made more transparent and accountable, but I do not agree with all those who would like to limit their scope and functions."
"The failings of credit rating agencies in terms of forecasting risks and of warning the market about them are simply a reflection of the far more pronounced failings of the existing public financial institutions and authorities and of the banking system as a whole."
"I believe in the free market and I believe that a greater degree of openness and competition is desirable in the credit rating sector too."
"However, the creation of a European public rating agency would be an oxymoron, a disgraceful, authoritarian venture designed to extend public control over the market."
"In short, it would be overly simplistic to restrict our analysis to the issue of credit rating agencies' responsibility for the current financial crisis when the crisis is, above all, an economic one."
"The data and the policies adopted demonstrate how, in Europe and in many countries, there was a belief that we could substitute the real economy with finance, thus, in effect, abandoning the entire manufacturing sector."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, today's debate on the framework for the supervision and operational control of credit rating agencies is, unfortunately, even more topical following yesterday's decision by Moody's to downgrade Greece's credit rating by a full 4 points."
"Of course, this is not the first time over recent months that Greece's credit rating has been seriously downgraded."
"However, yesterday's downgrading is obviously provocative and unwarranted, given that it takes no account either of the progress made in applying the financial restructuring programme, which was welcomed by the representatives of the troika who have been in Athens since yesterday, or the creation of the Financial Stability Fund, or the fact that EUR 110 billion have been earmarked to finance the needs of the Greek economy."
"Does it make sense, at a time when the President of the European Central Bank, the head of the Deutsche Bank and the representative of the European Commission are congratulating the Greek Government on the implementation of the memorandum, thus helping the euro to recover against the dollar and the European money markets to recover, for Moody's to downgrade Greece even further by making exactly the opposite assessment?"
"I think this move clearly proves that there is a conflict of interests, given that it is not simply undermining Greece's efforts at financial restructuring; it is also fuelling continuing speculative attacks by the markets on the Greek economy and on the euro area as a whole."
"This again confirms that these agencies issue ratings without ensuring that they are reliable and without any controls on the incentives for and results of their ratings, which raises serious issues of democracy and national and European sovereignty, given that we are talking about the evaluation of economies in the euro area."
"One could cite numerous other examples."
"However, what we need to know is what we are doing to protect the European economies from the speculation caused by these dubious and non-transparent ratings."
"Immediate action is needed on two levels: the first is to take action to create a competitive European rating agency and the second is to set up a strict and reliable operating framework for these agencies, an operating framework that lays down transparent and uniform standards for rating criteria, for the time at which ratings are published, in conjunction with the resulting market reaction and, finally, for the evaluation of ratings over time in terms of their accuracy and reliability."
"(LT) Against the general backdrop of the crisis, the crisis that has come about in the area of credit rating agency allocation reveals the dangers of this system."
"The most important thing is that no one feels responsible for the final result of risk assessment, although the activities of these agencies have a significant impact on the stability of the financial market, and very significant opportunities to obtain credit and the cost of credit depend on them."
"On the other hand, it is good that the Commission, understanding that we need to restore faith in the market and increase investor protection, is providing new EU-wide rules laying down general procedures for the regulation of credit rating agencies."
"The amendment of credit rating agency rules means better supervision at European Union level and greater transparency in this sector, but it is necessary to analyse this sector further and in more detail."
"It is necessary to ensure adequate credit rating agency controls and to issue appropriate penalties for infringements."
"Loans in rating agency activities must become more transparent so that investors and rating users are better protected and, most importantly, so that the credit rating sector becomes more competitive."
"(DE) Mr President, the incomprehensible decision by Moody yesterday clearly shows the dominance and power of rating agencies and the lack of transparency surrounding decision making."
"Every rating agency must be registered and their activities and the bases for their decisions scrutinised."
"We have to guarantee the independence of rating agencies and this means that we must not allow rating agencies to be financed by those whose credit worthiness is being checked."
"The incompatibilities and conflicts of interest must be eliminated: we cannot have credit agencies both providing consultancy to companies and rating them at the same time."
"Transparency is necessary, which means that models and the basis for valuation must be disclosed."
"We must counter monopolistic dominance with a second opinion and increased competition, which is why we also need agencies that are based in Europe."
"The foundation model has been proposed, but the limited company model could provide another alternative."
"In the autumn, the Kangaroo Group will be able to present the Commission's proposal together with Mr Klinz."
"(RO) The issue is that the activities of credit rating agencies not only led to the current financial crisis, but have also helped make it worse."
"The regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on Credit Rating Agencies introduced in 2009 was devised as a response for regulating their activities."
"This regulation has introduced compulsory registration for all credit rating agencies doing business within the European Union and is focused on three main aspects: supervision, transparency and conflicts of interest."
"However, we are far from resolving the issue of transparency and that concerning the oligopolistic structure of the credit rating agency market."
"It is not normal for Member States' economies and, by extension, their companies, to rely on the rating from just three agencies."
"Speculation about a country's rating can push states which are somehow in a critical situation towards bankruptcy."
"In these circumstances, I think that an exclusive European credit rating agency needs to be created, which will provide real competition and an alternative instrument for existing companies."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, we all know that it is downright absurd that two private US firms and one from the UK should be making decisions about the bankruptcies of EU Member States."
"In my opinion, this oligopoly of rating agencies is highly volatile."
"Another astounding thing is the times at which these agencies become active."
"The euro has scarcely begun to recover before someone is downgraded."
"All the talk about the awareness among these agencies of their responsibilities can be put into perspective when you consider the fact that the loans of unemployed US citizens packaged as securities were often awarded the triple A rating and were thus declared completely safe."
"On closer inspection, the apparent non-partisan position of the awarders of ratings has been exposed as fallacy, because they are getting paid by issuers of securities."
"The quality of the rating valuations is also doubtful."
"After all, before the international financial crisis, they gave the banks which would subsequently collapse the highest ratings."
"It is therefore high time that rating agencies were kept in check."
"However, the enhanced supervision of rating agencies should not be limited to the EU level alone."
"(RO) Against the backdrop of the current crisis, the activities of credit rating agencies are being subject to ever-mounting criticism due to the fact that they have failed to be objective in evaluating the level of credit risk for companies and even states."
"These agencies did not provide any early evaluations indicating the risk of a crisis, but have actually downgraded the rating for several European states, thereby exacerbating the crisis."
"The major problem is the lack of competition on the credit rating services market because it is controlled by just three US companies."
"In this regard, I support the proposal from President Barroso to set up a European Credit Rating Agency."
"As you are all aware, one of the three agencies changed Germany's credit rating last week on the back of an unacceptable error."
"I wish to end by saying that the European Union must ensure that the activities of credit rating agencies will be better regulated in future."
"(CS) Mr President, Commissioner, I have been listening very carefully to this afternoon's debate on rating agencies, and I am definitely no supporter of rating agencies, nor am I their advocate."
"On the other hand, I have no concerns whatsoever about some form of monopoly or oligopoly emerging among rating agencies."
"I have not heard a single speech here talking about how it could be possible that certain States where these enormous debts were incurred got into such a financial mess that there was no way out."
"I think it would be a very good thing to consider a system of state intervention in the running of the free market."
"Perhaps if we were to develop our ideas further in that direction, we would have fewer concerns over rating agencies."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you once again for giving me the opportunity to speak in this debate, which comes days after yet another downgrading of the Greek debt by a credit rating agency."
"The issues linked to the nature and the governance of these agencies, which have now become almost institutionalised on account of their importance in our economic system, are currently dominating political debate due to their role in the global financial crisis and in the current crisis in the euro area."
"An economic system such as ours cannot function without independent bodies analysing public accounts and the accounts of private companies."
"The challenge lies in ensuring that these credit rating agencies carry out their activities transparently and in accordance with common standards, because an error on their part could actually cause a company to go bankrupt or could be a significant factor in the onset of a new crisis."
"I believe that we absolutely must not nationalise credit rating agencies but rather seek to strike a balance between their independence and the need to guarantee an adequate level of accountability towards governments."
"Finding a balanced solution is therefore, in my view, the right way to ensure a better future, including in Europe."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, yesterday's downgrading of Greece's credit rating by Moody's does indeed raise numerous questions, as other members have said."
"At this point, I should like to add an element, so that we can try to understand if the operating framework for these agencies is ultimately clean, if it is transparent and if it is formalised."
"Most action taken by private individuals against these specific agencies in the United States of America is unfounded, due to a 1933 law which stipulates that rating agencies are not liable for money lost as a result of erroneous ratings."
"Action by these specific agencies therefore tends to be uncontrolled."
"The game of speculation has no limits, it has no borders and the lack of a European legislative framework causes major ructions in the European Union and every country."
"We must understand that a free economy does not mean the law of the jungle, it does not mean unaccountability."
"Where this is not understood, we need to respond with our legislation; we need to impose it by law."
"You spoke, Mr President, of more competitive, more numerous agencies."
"We expect a great deal of the Commission in the immediate future."
"Mr President, I am grateful to each and every one of you for the quality and the candour of your speeches."
"I shall not go back over the role of these agencies or the importance of the ratings that they issue;"
"Mrs Comi gave a very good account of this just now."
"My second preliminary remark, to echo the comments made just now by Mr Papanikolaou and Mr Strejček, is that we must improve the way in which these agencies operate."
"There has to be transparency - I will come back to this - and these ratings have to be as conclusive and as objective as possible."
"We shall achieve this, we must achieve this, but it does not mean that undertakings, especially financial undertakings, will not have to be managed properly, will not have to have both internal and external supervision systems, and crisis management tools - this also forms part of the proposals drawn up by the Commission - and it does not mean, either, that States will not have to govern themselves properly, will not have to manage their public finances properly and will not have to control their spending."
"I will now turn to credit rating agencies."
"We hope that the new proposed amendment to the regulation on these agencies will be adopted without delay so as to ensure their more effective monitoring by ESMA."
"She is no longer here, but, Mrs Le Pen, you should revise your information."
"Neither the Central Bank nor the Commission will supervise these agencies."
"We wanted more supervision and more transparency on the market, and it is only logical that the new independent authority, ESMA, should be the one to assume that role."
"As Mr Klinz put it so well, we need this transparency when we see what has been happening over the last few years."
"However, as I said just now at the start of my speech, these proposals, together with the existing legislation - Mr Cutaş mentioned this legislation on credit rating agencies, which should be duly implemented between now and the end of the year, but which will only be fully applicable in December 2010 - do not address all of the issues."
"Certain issues, for example, have not been thoroughly examined."
"Diversification, greater competition - Mrs Swinburne and Mr Scicluna referred to this need for a market of agencies that is not concentrated in the hands of a few people."
"Mr Giegold also spoke very clearly about the now widespread 'issuer pays' model: is it a healthy model?"
"Is it sustainable?"
"Mr Karas also raised this issue."
"We must focus on this issue at the same time as evaluating the rules that appear in the new legislation, which is due to enter into force by December, since we have specifically targeted conflicts of interest in a bid to reduce them."
"Will this legislation be enough?"
"We must, in any case, reflect on this issuer pays model mentioned by Mr Giegold."
"The third issue that we must address as part of our new efforts is European and national laws."
"Is it not the case that these laws are, as I believe, too reliant on the credit ratings of credit rating agencies?"
"Lastly, Mrs Băsescu just raised the issue of the particular methodology for sovereign risk: here too, we must carry out some detailed work."
"I should like to thank Mr Sánchez Presedo for supporting a swift agreement on the supervision package."
"This is one of the key aspects, in fact, since we need ESMA to supervise these agencies, and to do other things besides."
"Yes, we need a more structural response."
"That is why we are closely examining all the issues that I have just raised, and more specifically: independence, which Mrs Bowles was anxious to see, and I too want independence - by which I mean credibility - for these agencies; all the actors who are not performing well enough; the structures of the markets; and competition, including the idea - a legitimate one, in my view - of a European agency, in particular, for addressing the issue of sovereign risk, and perhaps other issues too."
"I have not mentioned the status of that agency."
"Will it be a public agency, a private agency, a private-public partnership, or the interesting idea mentioned by Mr Klinz of a foundation?"
"We are going to work on all these issues, too, over the coming weeks."
"Many of you, including Mrs Bowles, Mr Chountis just now, and Mrs Podimata a moment ago, mentioned the recent downgrading of the Greek rating."
"I, as Commissioner, am not going to start commenting in detail on each rating issued by a given rating agency."
"It would take up a great deal of time, and that is not our role; we should not be overdramatic when it comes to the credibility of ratings that have been, or are, issued."
"That does not stop me, or my colleague and friend, Mr Rehn, who addressed you this morning, from saying that I was surprised - and Mr Mölzer also expressed his surprise - at the timing of this latest rating of Greece by one of the agencies yesterday."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are very aware - and we must say so to the outside - that, as Mr Klute mentioned, Greece is currently making a huge effort to stabilise its public finances and to restore strong, healthy growth."
"The Commission has complete confidence in this process, which is not easy but which is necessary and which must succeed."
"It is also important to point out that Greece is not alone."
"It has the benefit of European solidarity - this solidarity was shown at the highest level by the Heads of State or Government, by the Commission, by the Central Bank and by the International Monetary Fund a few weeks ago, and it will continue to make itself felt and to prove itself."
"The various ratings, and all the attention focused on them, the disputes, too, over the methodologies and the timings: all of that encourages me in our work of reforming the agencies, work that we have begun, as I indicated in our communication of 2 June, and I would point out that we will be tabling some legislative proposals on these issues at the latest by the end of the year or at the start of next year."
"Finally, Mr Klute, you mentioned that, when we talk about all these issues, we are talking about more than just rating agencies."
"We must integrate this element, this tool that absolutely must be improved - more transparency, control, credibility and diversity - into an overarching structure that is one of intelligent regulation and effective supervision."
"These are the lessons from the crisis, which is not over, and we are going to learn from all these lessons."
"I reiterate, I repeat: not one actor, not one product, not one market, not one region must escape effective supervision and intelligent regulation."
"It is this very agenda that was proposed by the Commission on 2 June, supported by the Council of Ministers in Luxembourg a few days ago, and supported too, I hope, and as President Barroso wants, by the European Council."
"Moreover, ladies and gentlemen, you can count on me and on us to make proposals to you, one by one, step by step, between now and the start of next year, on all the undertakings we have made, so that we may learn, at European level and in good cooperation with the other regions of the world and, in particular, with the United States, every single lesson from this crisis affecting citizens, consumers and businesses."
"The debate is closed."
"Securities to be offered to the public and harmonisation of transparency requirements (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Wolf Klinz, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directives 2003/71/EC on the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading and 2004/109/EC on the harmonisation of transparency requirements in relation to information about issuers whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market - C7-0170/2009 -."
"Mr President, Commissioner, if I take a little more than four minutes, I will make my concluding remarks shorter so that I do not overrun my six minutes."
"The Prospectus Directive was originally put together in 2003 with the condition that it be reviewed in September 2009."
"That has been the case."
"The Prospectus Directive concerns the completion, approval and publication of prospectuses as a prerequisite for the public offering of securities or their emission into a regulated market within the European Union."
"In general, the current review concerns technical aspects and is intended to eliminate legal uncertainties and unjustifiably onerous requirements."
"First of all, I would very much like to thank all the Members who have worked together with us on this, as well as all the shadow rapporteurs."
"We have had very good cooperation, and that includes with the Commission."
"Without such good cooperation, we would not actually have been able to see this package through to a successful conclusion at first reading in less than ten months."
"I would now like to present briefly the agreement we have forged - and this includes the tripartite talks - in the form of eight principal points on which we were able to reach agreement."
"Firstly, one of our objectives was to facilitate access to capital in the market for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"You know that in the US, there is a much higher percentage of companies, including SMEs, that obtain finance through the market, whereas in Europe, the common practice, especially amongst small businesses, is to obtain finance through bank loans."
"What we want to do here is open up the opportunity for small businesses to use the market more often than before."
"We have therefore raised the threshold for exemption from the threshold requirements, which ultimately saddle SMEs with red tape and costs, from EUR 2.5 million to EUR 5 million."
"My second point concerns investor protection: we want to make sure that, in the course of such facilitation, we can provide sufficient safeguards to the small private investor."
"This is why we have raised the threshold for exemption from the prospectus requirements for securities denominated in 50 000 to a denomination of 100 000."
"The third point I would like to raise concerns the issue of how to enable employees to participate in a company's share capital without that company needing to bear the relatively high costs of launching a prospectus."
"So, this is about relaxing the prospectus requirement when offering employee participation programmes."
"Here, we have introduced a proportionality clause in that we have eliminated the unnecessary disclosure requirement."
"At the same time, however, we have made sure that we have a document detailing basic information so that those employees who benefit from this form of participation can have an idea about what it is they are getting."
"We have also made sure that companies listed in a third country, that is, a country outside the European Union, be exempted from the prospectus requirement as well - just like European companies - where they offer their employees shares, on the condition that they are able to prove equivalence with the disclosure requirements."
"The fourth area we discussed and on which we have reached agreement concerns what is commonly known as a 'prospectus summary'."
"You can look at it this way: typically, a prospectus is a thick and voluminous document frequently containing several hundred pages."
"However, there is also the summary which frequently contains another 50, 60 or 70 pages."
"What we want Parliament to do is to shorten this to what is known as 'key investor information' or a document with essential information for investors of the kind provided by traditional investment funds, the UCITS."
"The Commission did not, in fact, consider this, wanting merely to ensure that key information really is contained in the summary."
"We have now agreed that, while keeping the summary in its present form, we should also ensure that it does indeed contain key information which will eventually be set out through directive requirements and a level 2 elaboration."
"This will help shorten the summary considerably, cutting it down from the current 60, 70 or 80 pages to some 20 or 30, perhaps, and help make it an easy read, especially for the small investor."
"This is important, because we do not want to leave the small investor out of the picture."
"Fifthly, the issue of liability: when a prospectus is drawn up, who is it that guarantees the accuracy of the contents?"
"In particular, if an intermediary uses this prospectus, if he makes arbitrary changes to the contents, then the liable party is the intermediary."
"The prospectus requirement expires either when the offer period has expired or when the trading has begun, whichever is the later date."
"Seventhly, the review clause: as with the previous one, this directive will also be reviewed in five years' time."
"My last point is that, in this document, we have the first piece of legislation that has been brought into line with the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Last but not least, allow me to point out that the Chair of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has managed to ensure that Parliament is given sufficient time."
"We have three months to respond to the Commission and another extension of three months, if necessary."
"Having said that, we have undertaken, in the event that all other options fail, to grant early approval, that is, to push this piece of legislation through within the shortest time."
"This satisfies all parties."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when I had the honour of being heard by the European Parliament on 13 January, before being appointed as European Commissioner, I undertook to improve protection for investors and to reduce administrative costs to enterprises, especially small and medium-sized enterprises which, as we know, account for 80-90% of the economic fabric within the single market."
"I am therefore delighted that Parliament has adopted this revised directive on prospectuses at first reading."
"This is a modified directive, which simplifies and clarifies the rules for issuing securities, which supports small and medium-sized enterprises, as Mr Klinz just very properly reminded us, in accessing the capital markets, and which will help to reinforce the internal capital market."
"Negotiations on this directive benefited from close collaboration with Parliament and even more than that, given that important improvements were proposed by Parliament and the Council and, obviously, the Commission played its part."
"I should therefore like, on behalf of the Commission, to extend my warmest thanks to your rapporteur, Mr Klinz, and to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for their efficient work and constructive cooperation."
"We are happy with this compromise text that we now have in our hands, which respects the spirit of the initial proposal."
"The 2003 directive on prospectuses had very clear and undeniable merits."
"It laid down harmonised rules as to what European companies must publish when issuing securities, with one major innovation."
"Once a prospectus has been approved in one Member State, it is valid throughout the Union."
"However, the 2003 framework needed to be readjusted in order to improve the legal clarity and efficacy of the prospectus system and reduce administrative costs."
"That is why, henceforth, thanks to you and thanks to this review, certain types of security issues will be subject to reduced declaration obligations for small enterprises, for small lenders and for rights issues and government guarantees."
"The form and content of the prospectus summary will be improved."
"Exemptions from the obligation to publish a prospectus have been clarified in cases where companies sell via intermediaries or retail chains or allot shares to staff."
"Finally, declaration obligations that currently overlap with the requirements of the transparency directive will be repealed."
"Here is the result of our joint work."
"This revised directive will therefore provide a balanced tool adapted to the complex questions raised by investors and issuers on the capital markets, be they small and medium-sized enterprises or large, well-established companies."
"The adoption of this text at first reading will send out a strong signal that the Union respects its undertaking to simplify and reduce the administrative burden, while at the same time maintaining and even improving the level of protection for investors."
"That is why I should like once again to thank your rapporteur and to thank you for approving this dynamic compromise in favour of this simplification and, in particular, in favour of small and medium-sized enterprises throughout Europe."
"I would like to begin by mentioning the good work that has been possible within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, thanks to proposals by its various members, and to highlight the role that the rapporteur, our colleague, Mr Klinz, played in bringing about a positive result."
"When we speak of prospectuses we are, of course, speaking about the idea of publicity, market security and better access to investment."
"For this very reason, I have sometimes felt that there is a distinct conflict between the protection which consumers need and the protection of investors, which is also necessary."
"We were able to find a balance."
"Often, the solutions were not identical, but more importantly, it is worth emphasising that in the end, this review paid attention to the situation of small and medium-sized businesses, the need to respect small investors regarding the possibility of greater simplification, greater clarity on exemptions and lower costs for businesses by reducing what is often an excessive administrative burden."
"Obviously, the respective positions of the Council, the Commission and Parliament are often not exactly the same in trialogue."
"However, it was possible to reach a balance on the future of market security at EU level, and I would like to stress here that this is a positive thing."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur and all the shadows for their cooperation."
"I believe that the compromises reached are accepted by the S&D Group as they are fair and we believe will lead to greater investor protection, in particular, for small retail investors."
"I think, as the Commissioner said, it is in the spirit of the original directive."
"If we look at the summary and the key information document - Dr Klinz has spoken about that and the need to have clarity - I think we have reached a wording which will ensure clarity, whilst being clear that civil liability remains with the base prospectus."
"In addition, we have clarified the period when publication of a prospectus or supplementary information to it is required; we have also clarified the requirement for and liabilities of the prospectus when securities are sold via intermediaries and not directly by the issuer."
"On threshold: I would say it was more a tweaking exercise than dramatic change, but the compromises reached were fair and balanced and the S&D Group supports these."
"I think it is a welcome step to be clear about the definition of a qualified investor as is the effect of supervision of third country trading."
"In line with better regulation, the decision that no prospectus will be required for employee share schemes would appear to be sensible."
"After all, if employees are not willing to invest in their own firm, maybe the management should take heed."
"The work on delegated acts - Dr Klinz has mentioned this."
"The three months compromise is vitally important and is a move in Parliament's direction."
"I will certainly be using the prospectus directive decision as a benchmark for the work I will be doing as the rapporteur on construction products, while the benchmark that is being used by the Council is the Pets Directive rather than the Prospectus Directive."
"On the electronic publication of the prospectus: I think that is welcome too."
"The review clause of five years is also welcome."
"So all in all, Mr President and rapporteur, the S&D Group supports the compromise reached and we look forward to supporting the first reading deal in tomorrow's vote."
"Mr President, in the wake of the financial crisis, justified demands are being made for greater transparency and better regulation of the financial market."
"I have no problem with this, but, as always when new regulations are to be introduced, it must be done in a balanced way."
"The capacity of the European economy for growth will not be increased by ill-thought-out proposals, even if they have legitimate purposes."
"I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur, my colleague, Dr Klinz, for his excellent work, which takes a stand against these excessively detailed rules and regulations."
"His proposal increases legal certainty and removes unjustifiably stringent requirements in order to reduce companies' administrative burdens by 25% by 2012."
"My group and I are, of course, happy with the compromise that has been negotiated by Dr Klinz and others."
"The proposal reduces the administrative burden on small and medium-sized enterprises, but - and I think it is important to say this - it does this without reducing investor protection."
"This is also something that Mr Barnier mentioned."
"The discussion has, of course, centred on the thresholds that are to be applied on publication of prospectuses, in connection with rights issues, for example."
"I think they are well-balanced and will enable the internal market to function better."
"The proposal will, of course, mean that small and medium-sized enterprises will not need to produce a prospectus and it will therefore be easier for them to attract capital."
"The threshold is being raised from EUR 2.5 million to EUR 5 million."
"This is a well-balanced proposal."
"It will also make it easier for regional banks to take out bonds, as the thresholds are being raised from EUR 50 million to EUR 75 million for non-equity securities, such as interest-bearing debt and structured products."
"Overall, like my fellow Member from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I would like to thank Dr Klinz for a truly excellent piece of work."
"This report is an important step towards improving conditions for millions of small businesses in Europe."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, I know that this is not one of our most headline-grabbing reports, but it deserves to be, because this Prospectus Directive has actually been crucial to regulating European firms' access to capital."
"That, in itself, is vital for Europe's potential for economic growth in the future."
"It has been a delight to work with the shadow rapporteurs but most delightful under Mr Klinz's guidance."
"He has added real value to the original Commission proposal and the Council's position."
"I believe the resulting text is not only technically workable, but is a good balance between investor protection and easing the access to capital markets for enterprises in Europe."
"We have worked hard to get legal certainty and there is a clear process for updating and supplementing prospectuses."
"We have tried to help investors with the contents of the summary and the concept of key information."
"I am particularly pleased that there will be a lighter disclosure regime for rights issues."
"I think that this will help not only larger companies, but smaller ones too."
"At a time when markets are volatile, it can be the cost of a prospectus that would put someone off even trying to raise additional capital."
"We do need to especially bear that in mind at this moment."
"It is a very welcome precedent."
"I look forward to further analysis of the sector when we look at the MiFID Directive later on this year."
"As I said, this is an example of a concrete measure we are taking to improve Europe's environment for entrepreneurs and for investing in our future."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, we know a number of things."
"We know that this crisis has been like a mutating virus: it began as a property crisis, later becoming a banking crisis, then an economic crisis, and ended up as a sovereign debt crisis that could bring other crises in the sector in its wake."
"We also know that this crisis has been very expensive."
"According to your services, aid commitments to the financial sector total EUR 3.5 billion: in other words, one third of the EU's gross domestic product."
"We also know that one of the root causes of the crisis was the lack of transparency in products, institutions and markets."
"That is why the report that we are discussing at the moment is so important."
"However, if you want a statistic, I would remind you that in the United States alone, in the years 2000-2006, asset-backed securities increased by a factor of four and mortgage-backed securities by a factor of seven; moreover, in a very recent court appearance, the advisors of a reputable bank said that they did not have a very good idea of what they were selling."
"We also know - and this is the third statement - that many of the commitments that we made at the G20 have not gone, to quote a Spanish poet, 'from the Muses to the theatre' - they have not gone from imagination to the written word."
"We also know that throughout this remodelling of the financial sector, there are three principles which I see as key: Pan-European entities must be supervised by pan-European authorities; we must have the necessary measures at our disposal to detect the virus and avoid infection; and, finally, we must prevent the public from having to pay by itself for those infections that it has not caused."
"Commissioner, you have a major job to do if we do not want the next crisis to catch us with our pants down."
"I will end by saying in French that I recommend 'de l'audace, encore de l'audace et toujours de l'audace' in your mission - boldness, more boldness and forever boldness."
"(RO) Abolishing the double transparency obligations and reducing the disclosure requirements for companies with reduced market capitalisation will generate estimated overall savings of EUR 110 million per year."
"The review of the Prospectus Directive will therefore help boost the competitiveness of small and medium-sized businesses in the European Union."
"We must not forget that small and medium-sized companies are the driving force of the European Union's economy."
"They created 9.4 million jobs in the European Union between 2002 and 2008 and currently provide jobs for 90 million European citizens."
"At the same time, financial transparency requirements need to be harmonised at European Union level in order to reduce the administrative burden on European companies."
"As a result, the newly created European Securities and Markets Authority will have to monitor the harmonisation of Member States' legislations with regard to examining and approving prospectuses."
"Madam President, we have seen a great deal of turbulence in the European markets in the last number of years, with many having suffered great losses."
"So, we must ensure that investors, especially retail investors, receive adequate protection within the European Union."
"Investors should be able to gain the information necessary to make informed decisions."
"Having a well-structured framework in place also makes the European market more secure and, therefore, attractive to serious investors."
"The Prospective Directive has been fundamental in setting industry standards across the European Union, as has been the case with the UCITS Directive."
"Technical legislation that regulates this dynamic industry should frequently be reviewed, fine tuned and updated so as to ensure that it remains relevant and current."
"I agree that certain provisions within the directive were unnecessary and a number of obligations to which organisations must comply should be removed."
"The benefits that they give to the investor are negligible, while they place a significant burden on the business itself."
"The streamlining of definitions to avoid problems of interpretation in different Member States will also further streamline the sector."
"Finally, I would like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Klinz, for his excellent work."
"I would also like to congratulate all the shadow rapporteurs."
"I believe that this report is well-balanced and proportionate."
"(FI) Madam President, Commissioner, I think the report on the amendment to the Prospectus Directive is a positive one because many of these amendments reduce the administrative burden of companies, so the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs have together done an excellent job."
"As a counterweight to reducing the requirements of a prospectus, we must always take into account the matter of the investor's protection."
"The legal basis for the prospectus summary was clarified and the idea of a broad legal basis was dropped, which is good, because a long prospectus summary would have been difficult to understand, and the investor might have had the feeling that there was no need to read carefully though the actual prospectus itself."
"Now the prospectus summary must simply correspond to the summary; there cannot be a contradiction between the two."
"The actual legal responsibility lies with the truthfulness of the information in the prospectus proper."
"I also applaud the move that the requirements concerning the content of the prospectus are to be clarified, as having a uniform structure can only serve to promote the comprehensibility of these summaries."
"In the second amendment that I tabled, I wanted to ensure that the prospectus requirement remained in place in the case of staff placements."
"This was based on the notion that all investors should be treated equally."
"It cannot always be assumed consistently that a small investor on the staff knows enough about the company and its securities."
"This is perhaps something we should return to and consider in the future."
"This directive has an important purpose: that an investor can base his or her investment decisions on clear and comprehensible information that is easily accessible."
"I believe that amending the directive, despite the problem I mentioned, will bring its own contribution, with a change in the right direction."
"(RO) I would like to congratulate Mr Klinz for his exceptional efforts on this report and make the following clarifications."
"The Commission's proposal for simplifying and improving the Prospectus Directive provides a better level of protection to investors, giving them sufficient, suitable information."
"The unique passport is valid in any European Union market, once it has been registered and approved by the relevant authorities in a Member State."
"With a view to cutting red tape, I think that an appropriate legal framework is required to remove the uncertainty regarding host Member State notification."
"In addition, by getting rid of superfluous tasks which impact on companies, we can achieve a reduction of 25% in the unjustifiably high costs involved and in the administrative burden by 2012."
"Finally, I wish to say that the new regulations will provide better protection for investors, offering them the chance to carry out a better analysis of the risks associated with a security prior to making an investment."
"(DE) Madam President, clear regulation of the liability issue is obviously part and parcel of a transparent securities market."
"In this respect, we must first and foremost pay attention to protecting the small investor."
"When it comes to the resale of securities, the investor needs to know who to hold accountable for the accuracy and currency of information."
"If we regard the investor as a consumer who is worth protecting, then it is vital that he or she is given access to the essential information needed in order to price the product, in this case, securities."
"Only then will he or she be able to make informed decisions."
"Equally, in the EU's common capital market, it is important that we draw up a comparative list of differences between liability regulations of national civil law."
"In these times of crisis and uncertainty in particular, what this means is re-establishing for the investor a real sense of confidence through corresponding transparency in the securities market."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the prospectus regulates the public offering of securities and their emission into a regulated market in the Community."
"It is a sort of passport which allows access to all EU markets."
"In the interests of scrutiny and transparency, I welcome the protection afforded to the small investor and, in particular, the notification requirement."
"I see improvement of access to securities for small and medium-sized enterprises through the elimination of administrative hurdles as an investment in the future."
"Madam President, may I once again thank each and every speaker for their approval and additional remarks."
"Clearly, the text that will be passed is a dynamic compromise."
"As such, it cannot include every idea and every suggestion made but, at the same time, I think that Parliament, Mr Klinz, your committee, the Committee on Legal Affairs and others have good reason to be satisfied, because the current text has benefited greatly - and I speak as I find - from your comments, proposals and constructive criticism throughout the process of negotiation."
"A large number of amendments that you introduced, together with other colleagues from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, have been integrated into the text; especially, and I repeat, ladies and gentlemen, regarding the scope of the directive, provision on key information to be included in the prospectus summary, the regime applicable to employees or even the 'lisbonisation' - to coin a phrase - of the Prospectus Directive."
"Mr Feio mentioned the conflict between protection for investors and the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"May I remind him that a proportionate prospectus will be developed for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Mr Cutaş also raised this commitment, this particular treatment for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"A proportionate prospectus will therefore be developed, Mr Feio, for small and medium-sized enterprises, a level 2 prospectus, but which respects the need for investors to be protected."
"Another point which Mrs Essayah raised just now was qualified investors and the treatment of private individuals."
"The directive takes full account of the difference between the two."
"I would remind you that the summary will be instrumental in safeguarding proper and fair protection for private individuals."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is able to accept all the amendments and therefore supports the text, as do - I have noted - Mr Klinz, the various speakers from the groups, Mr Feio, Mrs Stihler, Mr Schmidt and Mrs Ford, who approved this excellent compromise on behalf of their groups."
"We are certain that this directive will make a difference in strengthening protection for investors and reducing the administrative costs for issuers, that it will make an even bigger contribution towards developing a real capital market in the European Union."
"We must not miss this opportunity."
"I should like to finish by thanking Mr García-Margallo for his contribution because, over and above this text, which marks real progress, he has set this progress in a much more general context, on which, moreover, he is working very efficiently in the supervision package, the transparency package under discussion."
"May I remind you that this review will improve the elements of transparency and adapt it to issuers, especially small and medium-sized enterprise, while at the same time - I repeat - respecting protection for investors."
"The element of supervision was included in the supervision package, the omnibus text, and it is that text that Mr García-Margallo is working on, with other colleagues, while calling on us to demonstrate collective boldness."
"You have demonstrated that in this text, which marks real progress, and I trust that, all together, we shall prove that, with the Council, in compromises that are just as dynamic, compromises that we shall need to find over coming days on other texts currently under discussion, on the regulation on hedge funds and private equity and, above all, on the major European supervision project that we need for this text, on the credit rating agencies we were talking about earlier and on numerous other questions of regulation, transparency and control, which are the lesson that we must learn from the crisis."
"It is our responsibility."
"Madam President, I will make just a few brief comments."
"First of all, I wish to thank the Commissioner and all the Members for their friendly comments."
"I am pleased that you share my views."
"Our cooperation has actually enabled us to balance out various objectives, namely easier access to capital for SMEs and the removal of administrative hurdles, on the one hand, and improvement and securing of investor protection and making progress in terms of creating a genuine European internal market, on the other."
"I hope that, when this new version of the Prospectus Directive comes up for review in a few years' time, we will be able to establish a link between the Prospectus Directive and the Market Abuse and Transparency Directives, and that we might perhaps go so far as to choose, in terms of non-equity securities, not the home market, but another Member State of the European Union as a starting point for emission."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday, 16 June 2010."
"Revision of the Multiannual Financial Framework (debate)"
"Τhe next item is the debate on the following oral questions:"
"the oral question to the Council by Reimer Böge, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the review of the Multiannual Financial Framework 2007-2013 - B7-0310/2010) and"
"the oral question to the Commission by Reimer Böge, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the review of the Multiannual Financial Framework 2007-2013 - B7-0311/2010)."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets we are putting to the Commission and the Council these oral questions concerning the review of the Multiannual Financial Framework at a time of incredible economic and EU policy challenges and at a time when questions are also being asked about the sustainability of the European Union project."
"We are tabling these oral questions because they are linked to the joint statements and promises made in May 2006 as part of the interinstitutional budget agreement, which no longer appear to apply."
"That, at least, is our impression."
"On top of this, there is the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon, with new priorities for foreign trade, sport, space research, climate change and energy, to name but a few."
"That means that we also have to find room in our budget for these new priorities."
"Article 311 states explicitly that the Union must provide itself with the means necessary to achieve its objectives and carry through its policies without taking on debt."
"You could say that the Statement on the Budget Review of 17 May 2006 contains everything that is necessary for a thorough review of the decisions made then and for their revision, if necessary, as well as an express assurance of the involvement and participation of Parliament in the opinion forming process associated with that."
"As the rapporteur in charge of this issue at the time, with disappointment, I have to ask the question today whether these agreements and commitments were genuine or whether they were just a sham from the very start, a sham that was needed simply to achieve an agreement in the Council."
"Commissioner Lewandowski, is the Commission hesitating with the analysis and proposals envisaged just because the Council does not want to budge on this?"
"You need to decide whether you want to side with the Council or with Parliament."
"To this I would add that Article 4 of the interinstitutional agreement makes it expressly clear that, in the case of any review of the treaty that has budgetary implications, the Multiannual Finance Framework and the interinstitutional agreement would need to be revised accordingly."
"It is these commitments, starting with the European External Action Service, and the aforementioned priorities that are making revision necessary, not only that of a technical nature but, most definitely, also the political revision of Budget IIV and the Multiannual Financial Framework."
"While they will not all need to be carried out in the first year, they will most certainly affect multiannual planning."
"At this juncture, I would add that we are affronted by the decision that was hastily made during the Stabilisation Rescue Package, although it was, of course, necessary and there was no alternative but, at the same time, it has, to some extent, ridden roughshod over the rights of Parliament in budgetary matters."
"The Commission should consider whether it should make use of Article 124, that is, whether it should take the initiative to arrange regular meetings at the highest level, the level of presidents of the institutions, as part of the budgetary procedure, in order to finally move these delicate issues forward."
"This is because we should also, hopefully in time for or during conciliation, talk about the revision of the Multiannual Financial Framework - Article 312 concerning the Approval Procedure - and the political revision of Budget IIV, also from the perspective of political necessity, about making adjustments in line with the Treaty of Lisbon, about the margins, the reviews, flexibilities, political projects of the future, such as Galileo and ITER, and the European External Action Service, in order to define projects with European added value and, where possible, to exercise restraint of course."
"Speaking here today, I have to ask both the Commission and the Council very seriously if they think that all these agreements should now be regarded as dead letters."
"Or are you genuinely prepared to consult Parliament?"
"It is in the interests of the Treaty of Lisbon that we take all necessary measures during the financial framework adoption procedure to facilitate adoption of this act."
"I have not seen any signs of this to date, which is why I need to ask you the following question: are you prepared and do you consider yourself able to revise the Multiannual Financial Framework while, at the same time, working with us, reconciling it with the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon?"
"Your replies, both those of the Commission and the Council, will decide our future cooperation on budgetary matters in the next few years."
"Good afternoon."
"My thanks to the Members of the European Parliament for the opportunity to answer your questions on this issue, which is so important."
"I must start by stressing that there was no agreement at the European Council of December 2005 that the Multiannual Financial Framework should be revised."
"Rather, the Commission was asked to carry out a full and in-depth examination of all the components of the European Union's expenditure and resources, and then submit a report on that."
"The European Council also established that decisions on all aspects of the report could be taken on the basis of the report itself, and that it would be taken into account for the purposes of the preparatory studies for the subsequent financial framework."
"As yet, the Commission has still not presented this examination."
"The Council does not believe that there is currently an enormous or great need to revise the current Multiannual Financial Framework; this is, above all, because of the need to consider the budgetary and macro-economic situation through which the Member States are currently struggling."
"The position adopted by the Council is therefore that any new need must be financed by prioritising or redistributing the credits that are currently awarded."
"In any case, any decision to revise the Multiannual Financial Framework requires a Commission proposal and this proposal has not been received."
"Nevertheless, it is clear that, if a decision to revise the financial framework had to be adopted, it would - obviously - have to be done with respect for the treaty, including Article 312 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
"I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate the Council's position, included in its budgetary guidelines for 2011, which were adopted on 16 March and presented to Parliament during the tripartite dialogue held on 25 March of this year."
"Specifically, the Council agrees with the Commission that the Lisbon legislative package must constitute a technical exercise and cannot mean a modification of the content of the interinstitutional agreement on budgetary discipline and sound financial management of 17 May 2006."
"I must stress the importance of adopting the Lisbon legislative package as soon as possible so that the new requirements established by the new treaty can be transposed to legislation without excessive delays."
"As part of this process, the Council is prepared to enter discussions with the European Parliament on the Lisbon legislative package."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful for the opportunity offered by the question to give the position of the Council on this issue, and I will be delighted to answer any other questions that Members consider it appropriate to ask."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I will start directly with serious answers to the questions, as, if Reimer Böge is asking the questions, that is sufficient reason to take them seriously."
"As regards the question on the revision of the financial framework, the report on the functioning of the interinstitutional agreement is now in your hands."
"This analyses the flexibility and the margins - not as a goal in itself, but in the context of possible new developments."
"The conclusion is very clear that the margins are very tight in almost all the headings."
"We cannot expect, for example, Heading 2 (Agriculture) to supply additional needs whenever there are new needs to be financed."
"The Commission can only present proposals for the revision of the financial framework when the precise needs are known and cannot be covered by other means, which is not the case so far."
"Even with ITER, we need commitment for the long-term financing of this large-scale project."
"As regards the lines identified as conducive to the 2020 strategy for green, smart and inclusive growth, we have identified around EUR 58 billion in the 2011 draft budget, which is 40% of the budget conducive to these goals listed in the 2020 strategy."
"Moving on to the second question about the procedure, the Commission's basic logic was to align the provisions of the current interinstitutional framework with the new framework of the Lisbon Treaty."
"The goal was to preserve as much continuity as possible and make as little change as is needed by the new treaty, but on the basic assumption of preserving the same level of flexibility and the same balance of powers between institutions."
"We know what is pending given our assumptions."
"The pending issue is the so-called 'zero zero free flexibility' that has been conducive to conciliation since 2007."
"Everybody who was part of the conciliation is aware that this was necessary and that is why we should defend it."
"This was the provision about the Council acting by qualified majority to compensate and revise, which has been done on several occasions since 2007."
"I think there is nothing in the letter and spirit of the new treaty to contradict that level of flexibility, and we are going to be very flexible when it comes to the new innovative drafting of this flexibility article in the Multiannual Financial Framework."
"The new budgetary review that is delayed should be the occasion to rise up to the political vision for the future, as clearly stated by Reimer Böge."
"This is the vocation, not the report on interinstitutional agreement, so we hope to be up to the expectations of Parliament and are, as usual, ready to cooperate."
"(DE) Madam President, I realise this might be inappropriate of me, but I am afraid I have to raise a point of order."
"For me, photography is basically a nice leisure pursuit."
"However, I do wonder whether this new practice in the House of Members taking photographs of others, especially secretly and from behind, is appropriate."
"I know that, for the Hans-Peter Martin List, the use of hidden cameras has been common practice."
"Madam President, can you please explain this situation?"
"Anyone who would like to have a photo of me is welcome to have it."
"I will be happy to send them a photo by PDF or e-mail."
"However, when I am sitting here alongside a member of the Martin List, I do find it immature when photos are secretly being taken from behind to document that fact."
"Madam President, I ask that you rectify this in future as it is unbecoming for this House and I ask that you pass on this concern of mine."
"Thank you Mr Obermayr."
"We have noted your request and will pass the matter on for examination."
"As Mr Böge said, the Treaty of Lisbon commits the European Union to new priorities."
"It is therefore necessary to secure the finances required to achieve the objectives and implement the EU's policies in this context."
"This situation obviously requires a wide-ranging review, which will include every aspect relating to the European Union's spending and funding, including technical and political adjustments to the Multiannual Financial Framework and the interinstitutional agreement, as well as the revision of certain budgetary envelopes agreed up until 2013."
"However, we must not overlook the fact that we are in the midst of an economic crisis and that we must use every resource available to us to overcome this crisis."
"Apart from the wide-ranging review, which needs to be carried out prudently and in detail, I think that a pragmatic approach is also required to facilitate the tasks ahead of us and help us emerge from this period more quickly."
"As the Presidency of the Council said, I think that any money which has not been spent so far should be reallocated to areas promoting job creation and helping to overcome the crisis."
"Additional funds are not required; the only thing needed is to reallocate funds which have not been used."
"Within the European programmes, Member States must be provided with the opportunity to transfer funds from areas where there is insufficient demand to areas where applications have exceeded the resources allocated."
"In addition, there are various initiatives which have been approved after 2007, such as the Eastern Partnership or the future Danube Strategy."
"Reallocating funds to these instruments would make a considerable contribution, along with the contribution of each Member State involved, to launching and implementing projects of paramount importance to the states located in the region, but not only them."
"Madam President, the debates we have been attending in the European Parliament in recent months have been of great importance."
"We are setting out nothing more and nothing less than the future of the European Union."
"For example, we are debating the Europe 2020 strategy to prevent us from falling behind in terms of research, development and innovation, job creation, world competitiveness, and the environment."
"I would like to know if the Commission and the Council believe that these goals can be achieved without substantially increasing the EU budget, or if we are instead going to once again go no further than making declarations that sound good."
"Nor can we forget - and we have already recalled it here - that the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force a few months ago and that, as a result of it, the European External Action Service has been launched, which also has a financial cost;"
"I would like to know how we are going to finance it."
"I will give you an example of what I believe we must not do and what I have unfortunately heard here."
"For example, the Commission has just presented an amending budget to compensate banana-supplying African, Caribbean and Pacific states with EUR 190 million over four years."
"Do you really believe that meeting this commitment should be at the expense of other types of aid to third countries?"
"Are we really going to finance new commitments by cutting ones that we had previously made?"
"I believe that the needs are clear and the answers should be so."
"Nevertheless, just in case, I am going to recall what the Council said when it adopted the current financial framework, and I am citing the actual text: 'The increasing pace of globalisation and rapid technological change continues to offer new opportunities and present new challenges."
"Against this background, the European Council agrees that the EU should carry out a comprehensive reassessment of the financial framework, covering both revenue and expenditure, to sustain modernisation and to enhance it, on an ongoing basis."
"The European Council therefore invites the Commission to undertake a full, wide-ranging review covering all aspects of EU spending, including the CAP, and of resources, including the UK rebate, to report in 2008/9'."
"Well, here we are in mid-2010 and Parliament is having to ask the other two institutions an oral question in order to find out whether or not they are going to meet the commitment that they should have met last year."
"It has already been said and could, in a way, be right: we are in a difficult economic situation; we are in an economic crisis in which the majority of countries are cutting their budgets, and it will be thought of as preposterous to ask for more money for the European Union."
"However, I would like to say two things to you about that."
"Firstly, these cuts that EU Member States are making are being made in order to cut the deficit and the budgets of the European Parliament and the EU are not in deficit."
"In fact, they are not in deficit because this is a requirement of the treaties."
"Secondly, and much more importantly, if we really believe in the European project and if we want to carry on being relevant, we must react now."
"There will be winners and losers and if we do not want to belong to the losers' group, we must set out a clear and ambitious strategy."
"I hope that this does not get stuck as a declaration of intentions, because we cannot let ourselves allow that."
"Madam President, I would like to start by reminding the Council that it was the one that suggested we have this mid-term review."
"It was the Council that demanded that mid-way through the period, we should see whether the funds could potentially be used elsewhere, whether we could revise how the funds are used."
"Now the Council is saying that it would rather not talk about this."
"The ball is in the Commission's court."
"The Commission claims that it has, of course, looked at the funds and at how much flexibility there is."
"I would like to thank Mr Lewandowski, because we have an excellent report that shows that, on the whole, there is no flexibility."
"We therefore need to get our act together and consider what options are available."
"We need to consider not only how much flexibility we have but also whether there are any programmes that are not working."
"Are there any opportunities for making savings?"
"That was presumably also one of the Council's intentions."
"Is it possible to re-prioritise some things?"
"We are, of course, thinking not only in terms of spending more money but also of possibly being able to spend the money in a better way."
"That could also be a possibility."
"Should we not open up this debate?"
"The problems will not necessarily solve themselves if we do not talk about them."
"It might be a good idea to get started on this debate."
"I have been surprised by the Member States' willingness recently to contribute outside the EU budget."
"I visited the Community Fisheries Control Agency in Vigo."
"There, they have chartered a boat to carry out fisheries control, and this is very much needed."
"The Member States are happy to pay for this outside the budget."
"Let me tell you, it will involve a lot of bureaucracy for such a small agency to collect money from 27 Member States."
"It is therefore not the right way to go."
"We need to get our heads out of the sand."
"We need to have an honest debate on this issue and see how we can solve the problems."
"Madam President, Commissioner Lewandowski, Mr Espadas Moncalvillo, I am disappointed both by today's reply from the Spanish President-in-Office of the Council and that of Commissioner Lewandowski."
"What you are doing here is passing the buck."
"Mr Espadas Moncalvillo says: yes, we need the Commission to draw up something."
"Then, Commissioner Lewandowski quite rightly says: we need a political vision for the future of the European Union, and yet he does not tell us what that might look like."
"Today, he simply said again: yes, we have to talk about it and we will submit a paper."
"Commission and Council, you have had many years to make progress on this political initiative."
"May I remind you that, in 2006, when the majority of the European Parliament voted through the current financial perspective, that was on the condition that there would be a mid-term review and that all income and expenditure would be put to the test."
"Austrian Chancellor Schüssel said on that occasion: 'If we do not come up with a new system, we will be at each other's throats when the next financial perspective comes along'."
"We have to stop the UK rebate and we really have to know where we stand in terms of our political objectives, but obviously we also need to agree a budget."
"So far, this action has failed to materialise and I regret that deeply."
"What we really need is a debate about the sources of finance for the European budget."
"Do we not, for example, need the CO2 tax and the financial transaction tax, precisely so that we can prevent the new tax burden falling on our citizens, while setting up a transparent basis for the European budget?"
"On the subject of income, everyone is saying that we cannot simply blunder on with our agricultural policy, especially after the health check study, and that it must be more environmentally friendly and more sustainable."
"No proposals for this have been mentioned as yet."
"In terms of the structural funds, if we are talking about climate policy, then it is patently clear that we have to change our structural policy, too, and that it has to become more sustainable, if we are seriously to take on our common climate change objectives."
"That is the case, too, with all our education policy objectives, which means the Europe 2020 strategy."
"Or, consider our research policy: if we want to encourage our European talent in a different way and invest more in intelligence and education, then that needs to be reflected in the next financial perspective."
"Likewise, if we want to play a responsible role in foreign policy and crisis prevention, that too needs to be reflected in the European budget."
"While we are now all aware that Member States are responsible for reducing their debt, we must have a European understanding for our common global interests in the world, and that must be reflected in our next financial perspective."
"We should not waste any more time because we have already wasted years on the old structures."
"For that reason, we urgently need to get this review under way so that we really can identify new priorities."
"The budget perspective for 2007-2013 adopted by the European Parliament in 2006 is, without doubt, a success of the entire Union."
"I say success, because a financial framework established for six years is another step towards ever greater integration of individual Member States."
"I do not need to remind everyone of the importance of cohesion policy - especially as concerns the European Union's internal affairs - which, in large measure, is helping to raise the standard of living, especially in the 12 recently accepted Member States."
"Of course, we must not forget, either, the funds designated for developing the competitiveness of the European economy or the financial resources being given to farmers."
"Recently, more and more is being said about assigning greater resources to, among others, boosting innovation and the development of green technologies."
"Undoubtedly, these are important questions for the Union's economy, particularly during the crisis."
"However, such announcements are causing the greatest anxiety in countries such as Poland, because there is a real danger that the resources available for cohesion policy will be reduced, whereas cohesion policy is, in principle, one of the foundations of the European Union."
"Therefore, we should do everything to make sure that Union policy does not lose its most important feature."
"While respecting and understanding the differences between regions, we must strive with might and main for the elimination of negative contrasts and gross social disproportions."
"Only a Europe of equal opportunities will be respected in the international arena and become a significant partner for the most important political and economic powers of today's world."
"Therefore, I have a question: is it possible that a review of the Multiannual Financial Framework influenced by current financial and economic problems might seek to breach one of the fundamental principles of European solidarity and hit Member States whose presence in Union structures has been the shortest?"
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Madam President, the revision of the Multiannual Financial Framework comes at a time of severe economic and financial crisis in Europe."
"We are not therefore in a position to cover the requirements of the Lisbon Treaty and the Europe 2020 strategy."
"The President of the European Commission has dramatically announced that democracy could disappear in Greece, Spain and Portugal unless urgent action is taken to tackle the debt crisis."
"Does anybody think that these countries are in a position to finance an increase in the EU budget?"
"Does anybody think that the rest of the Member States are in a position to bail out these countries and, additionally, to finance an increase in the EU budget?"
"The answer to both questions is 'no'."
"Some difficult choices will have to be made at this point to allow a reduction in the EU budget."
"It is now time to get rid of programmes that have not proved efficient, of which we have many in the present EU budget."
"(NL) Madam President, a while ago, I put written questions to the Council and the Commission on the Regulation and the Multiannual Financial Framework."
"These concerned, in particular, the proposed Article 8(3) of this regulation, and the judgment of the European Court of Justice of 6 May 2008 in Case C-133/06."
"The Council said it was still dealing with the regulation, and so I should like to know whether it has now adopted a position on Article 8(3)."
"The Commission, on the other hand, says that the regulation, and therefore Article 8(3), does not have a second legal basis, and refers in this connection to Article 312 of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Could the Commission elaborate on this point?"
"After all, it has not yet managed to convince me."
"As far as I am concerned, there is manifestly a second legal basis, as no mention is made of unanimity in the Council, which is required under Article 312(2)."
"As I see it, therefore, an illegal decision-making process is being created that was forbidden by the Court in the judgment mentioned earlier."
"In addition, I should like to emphasise that the passerelle clause of Article 312(2) was, in any case, blocked by the Dutch Parliament in November 2009 and cannot be an option."
"(ES) Madam President, I welcome the Council and the Commissioner."
"We are going to change the focus."
"In the draft budget for 2011, the 2020 strategy talks about EUR 58 billion, or some 40%, to finance seven flagships, as the Commission calls them."
"However, in the draft budget for 2011, it talks about 85% on cohesion and natural resources."
"Moreover, in the 2020 strategy, expressed in terms of the draft budget for 2011, at no point does the Commission include the word 'cohesion' or the word 'agriculture'."
"This means that there will be grey areas and overlaps in the budget, because I am sure that everyone thinks that cohesion and agricultural policy should be included in the 2020 strategy."
"This will involve tensions between the Member States and will involve, as it has done up to now, unofficial proposals that appear suddenly, are criticised, and are then hidden away and not mentioned again."
"Commissioner, the Council has also made new commitments outside of the current Multiannual Financial Framework, such as the 'Food facility', Galileo, the economic recovery programme, the international thermonuclear experimental reactor, financial supervision, and the financial stabilisation plan, that are taking us a long way away from the Multiannual Financial Framework that we adopted in December 2005."
"We need clarification to know, first, if it will be possible to finance all these flagships without damaging agricultural and cohesion policy, and whether we will have to face cuts to traditional policies to finance the new priorities with which the Council is presenting us."
"The special committee for the next Multiannual Financial Framework will start work this July."
"Commissioner, we need this review that - as I say to a fellow Member who has now left the room - does not necessarily involve increasing the necessary resources, but possibly reorganising them."
"Commissioner, we need this revision precisely in order to be able to put this special committee in place at the same time as preparing this financial review."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the economic, social and financial crisis of the last few months and years, the new Treaty of Lisbon with its new powers, and the challenge we have set ourselves with Europe 2020, require the mobilisation of massive new financial resources."
"The paradox we are witnessing, including in this debate, is that right now, both the Commission and the Council appear to be silent and incapable of deciding and making choices."
"However, we know that if we want to come out of this difficult economic and social phase, if we want to address the major issues of the environment, the development of cohesion policy and agriculture in the coming years, then we need to invest more heavily in Europe and Europe's function, and hence its essential function, which is to say, its budget."
"To do so, we must not be afraid to discuss, even at a time of budgetary restrictions, the idea of investing more heavily in resources and to have the strength and ability to develop debate and discussion that tackle the issue of increasing resources and that of more effective and flexible use of resources."
"This is the challenge we face."
"(DE) Madam President, we urgently need this review."
"It is a few years too late and, because of this delay, the European Commission is, of course, getting caught up by one political reality after another."
"These changes which were ushered in by the Treaty of Lisbon must obviously now also be viewed in the light of the financial and economic crisis."
"When the Commissioner repeatedly says that we should now set ourselves political goals and priorities, I can tell him what, in my view, our priority should be: it lies in saving, specifically saving on administrative expenditure under heading 5."
"We have a situation where we do not know the exact scale of the European Union's administrative expenditure."
"The administrative expenditure of EU agencies, the decentralised agencies, is not covered by heading 5."
"That brings me on to my question: what are you going to do to ensure that we can finally have transparency in our administrative expenditure?"
"What specifically are you going to undertake to ensure that expenditure is dramatically reduced?"
"(PT) In the resolution on the budget for the current year, Parliament approved the possibility of extending the Multiannual Financial Framework for 2007-2013 to 2015-2016."
"We are all aware that in seeking to control the deficit and reduce public debt, the Member States are cutting back on investment."
"This means that the implementation of EU funds will be further delayed."
"However, these resources are vital for social, economic and territorial cohesion."
"Are the Commission and the Council therefore willing, like Parliament, to extend the Multiannual Financial Framework to 2015-2016?"
"The challenges posed by globalisation, the ageing population and climate change have to be overcome."
"With the implementation of the 2020 strategy, I am sure that we will make the right choice and defend employment, quality of life and our social model."
"However, if we are to cope with these investments, how can we increase the European Union's budget?"
"In 2009, the surplus was more than EUR 2.2 billion."
"Are the Commission and the Council willing for these surplus funds from the EU budget to be used to strengthen the following year's budget or to constitute a fund to finance the EU's priorities?"
"How would they proceed in relation to Parliament concerning the establishment of EU priorities?"
"They advocate a clear escalation of EU priorities so that we can decide, in a transparent and consensual manner, what we want to support, in a concrete form and with financial support, and what we are supporting from a strictly political point of view, but will this have any impact on the budget?"
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, it is a pity that the European budget, which should be a symbol of solidarity and the will to act together, has become a rigid tool, which the citizens do not understand and which lags behind the expectations of European society, incapable of being deployed to fight the social repercussions of the crisis."
"From this point of view, not a day passes without the media or a top-ranking politician talking about the need for a stronger European budget."
"Tension is increasing between revenue that is too modest, too dependent on the contributions of the Member States, and the money that the Union needs to spend in order to kick-start growth."
"For example, in the draft budget for 2011, the Commission simply presents a margin for manoeuvre of EUR 50 million to support new projects linked to employment and corporate competitiveness, which are top priorities."
"The revision of the financial framework is therefore a serious challenge for the future of the Union if we want to make it a real political and economic leader and also, and above all, a player that is closer to its citizens at a time when nearly 25 million of them are affected by unemployment."
"(NL) Madam President, the debate further to Mr Böge's question has not actually borne a great deal of fruit."
"The envisaged mid-term review has failed to materialise and, in addition, what is now being promised is extremely meagre."
"Against that background, Parliament too must become involved in steering things."
"I should like to make three suggestions."
"Firstly, if there is no new money, we must simply reprioritise within the budgets."
"We must take a good look at where the big money is to be found within agriculture and the Cohesion Fund and focus it much more on the necessary aspects such as the agreements on the EU 2020 strategy."
"Secondly, more flexibility must be introduced, as the Commissioner has already indicated."
"Without flexibility, we could never have raised the funds for the recovery plan in connection with the crisis."
"We must step up the search for any areas where leeway remains, for opportunities for deploying funds differently."
"Thirdly, we need to innovate."
"An example is the transfer of funds from the Seventh Research Framework Programme to the European Investment Bank (EIB)."
"These funds were then used to provide subordinated loans to the business community and universities, thus giving tremendous momentum to investments for the coming years at this point in the crisis."
"I should like to know what your approach is to the matter, how the substance and the funds are to be linked."
"A final thought: perhaps you could go along with the ideas that have been expressed so often in this House."
"Madam President, I would like to thank my colleague, Reimer Böge, for these questions and this debate on the budget."
"Earlier today, we voted on Budget 2011 and we all know how difficult it was to manoeuvre within the very tight margins in the budget."
"We also know that we were due a mid-term review of the budget."
"Regarding the non-paper which I read from the Commission, I would like to ask what status it has now."
"I know it is slightly off this point, but are some of the ideas contained in it still within the Commission's framework for further discussion?"
"I am particularly concerned about attitudes to agriculture spending and any attempts to renationalise that policy."
"Others have, of course, discussed the realities for Member State budgets and Member State governments as well as the concern about looking for additional funding when all our Member States are having financial and economic problems."
"However, if we are to have more Europe, there is a requirement for more resources."
"I think one of the great difficulties we have in this Parliament is that we have not communicated enough the value of a European Union budget and what it does."
"If you recall - again in the votes today - we voted on the Globalisation Fund."
"When citizens are in difficulty, whether it is from flooding or a jobs crisis, they turn to the European Union for support and they turn to it for budget support."
"That provides solidarity to the European Union, which is something that you cannot put a price on."
"I think we have to be conscious of this."
"If we continue to measure and count euros, rather than looking at what we are trying to create in the European Union, I think we will limit our vision for the future of what we all hold dear at the European Union."
"That said, perhaps the analogy of a cake is appropriate at this point - that people look at the European Union budget in the shape of a cake."
"If we have more demands on it, we will continue to slice it ever thinner unless we increase the resources."
"(IT) Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the revision of the Multiannual Financial Framework is a process that is essential for the future of the Union."
"Under the Treaty of Lisbon, a set of new responsibilities is transferred to EU level, and those responsibilities demand resources."
"However, in the light of the present Multiannual Financial Framework and of the reduced margins appearing under the various headings, I do not think we will be able to finance the new responsibilities provided for by the treaty."
"In an economic crisis such as the one we are experiencing, it is unlikely that Member States will increase their contributions, but we can review the current economic framework."
"This means we can look at how to make best use of the resources that we do have available."
"It is in this context, then, that we must re-examine the new Multiannual Financial Framework, because the alternative option of burying our heads in the sand and pretending we cannot see the problem does not strike me as being the best strategy for dealing with it."
"(RO) You are right, Commissioner, when you say that the Multiannual Financial Framework 2007-2013 and its review must project a political vision, and we must have the courage to embrace this new political vision."
"The EU 2020 strategy has to form the basis for reviewing the Multiannual Financial Framework and for the future financial outlook."
"Unfortunately, the economic and financial crisis is having an impact on both the EU and national budgets."
"We need solutions to resolve the social crisis as well, which has evolved as a result of the economic and financial crisis."
"The mid-term review of the Multiannual Financial Framework provides a good platform for the European Union's economic recovery."
"I wish to mention, in particular, the development of the transport infrastructure and energy efficiency in buildings."
"Just in April 2009, we amended the regulation so that all Member States enjoy a rate of 4% of the ERDF allocation to be used for energy efficiency in residential buildings and for the building of social housing."
"Has the Commission started to adjust operational programmes along with Member States in order to adapt them and increase the level of absorption of European funds?"
"Madam President, do you think, Commissioner, that the Lisbon Treaty is the greatest political achievement for our House?"
"I do."
"Do you agree that the Lisbon Treaty's new competences are our best means to modernise our economy?"
"I do."
"Do you think this is the way for us to achieve jobs and growth?"
"I do."
"If your answers are the same 'yes' as mine, then you have to agree that to manage the more general financial framework and to provide the financial means to achieve our targets laid down in the Lisbon Treaty has to be priority number one for this House and for the Council and Commission too."
"Mr President, I think the Commissioner said at the outset, and he was correct, that we need to learn the lessons from the financial crisis and take measures to ensure that it does not happen again."
"He is absolutely right in that and, obviously, the Lisbon Treaty gives us stronger control over those situations because, in the recent past, the real lesson to be learnt is that politics and politicians were not in control, that we allowed bankers, regulators and rating agencies to do as they wished and we see now where we are as a result of it."
"We must ensure that that never happens again and we, as politicians, and particularly here in the European Union, have to take control because we are supposed to be in control and everybody else should fall into line beneath that, observe the law and ensure that proper practices are operated on a daily basis."
"Madam President, I would like to respond to some of the speeches; not all of them, because there have been a great many, but I would like to respond to some of them briefly."
"To Mr Lewandowski in particular: I would like to express my agreement with his concern that at this time of economic uncertainty and difficulty, all available resources should be used by the Member States and by the European Union itself to combat unemployment and get out of the crisis as soon as possible."
"I would like to say to Mr Marinescu that it was indeed agreed in the Council's guidelines that strengthening the External Action Service would not result in higher costs."
"In other words, it should not, under any circumstances, involve greater expenditure and devoting more resources for this purpose, but rather budgetary neutrality would be maintained."
"To Mrs Gardiazábal Rubial, I would like to say that the current budgetary framework provides sufficient flexibility mechanisms to cover some of the initiatives that she is proposing, and that the European Union budget is not in deficit, but it is, of course, fed by contributions from the Member States, and especially from the gross national income resource."
"It is easy to appreciate that more intensive use of this resource would aggravate the individual situations faced by each of the Member States which, as you are all aware, are very delicate at the moment."
"Using this channel to increase the EU budget would therefore be contradictory in the crisis situation that we are experiencing."
"This initial position does not, however, mean that a review cannot be considered if exceptional circumstances exist or arise, as has happened in the past on several occasions, in this planning period."
"This can, however, only be done if the other financing options have been considered."
"I would like to say to Mrs Trüpel that it may indeed be interpreted externally that the Commission is suggesting that the Council is not being accurate about the need or the path that needs to be followed in order to change the financial framework and, in turn, the Council could be asking it for a document to serve as a platform for launching that review."
"The fact is, however, that we are all immersed in a very complicated macro-economic situation, as I said before, which requires two things: firstly, making it a priority to solve the problems at national level, and secondly, maintaining the EU's efforts, as they are now in the current financial framework, without any changes until we have a sufficiently documented and agreed study."
"I would like to stress to Mr Wlosowicz that I support him in his defence of the cohesion policy."
"The Council has always defended this policy as an emblem of the European Union and a platform for achieving the convergence targets that the EU has set itself."
"It should therefore be understood that the Council will always fully support this policy."
"I would like to say to Mrs Andreasen that I do indeed agree with her that in the current situation, it is not possible to increase the EU's resources."
"Therefore, as I said before in my first speech, we need to use those resources by prioritising and redistributing allocations to make spending increasingly efficient and achieve our objectives in the most intelligent way."
"This does not in any way mean that there is a risk of democracy being lost in any of the countries that you mentioned, and I therefore think that we should eliminate even the possibility of a risk of that happening, even if it is very remote."
"With regard to Mr van der Stoep, I would like to say that we are going to propose that the possibility of flexibility in the Financial Framework Regulation be looked at."
"To Mr Cozzolino, I would like to say that my position is the same as I expressed before, i.e. that in the current mindset, it will be difficult for the Member States, who are making a huge effort to reduce the deficit, to put more resources in the European Union budget."
"I would like to say to Mr Ehrenhauser that we are going to prioritise and redistribute heading 5 as far as possible and reduce its size or allocation, provided that this does not negatively affect control or intelligent and efficient allocation of expenditure."
"This measure is therefore part of the general move towards flexibility and prioritisation that I was talking about before."
"I must say to Mr Fernandes that under no circumstances are we considering postponing the Multiannual Financial Framework."
"On the contrary, things are progressing normally and the new financial framework will be adopted at the appropriate time."
"I say the same to Mrs McGuinness: it is not possible to allocate more resources at the moment, given the shortages, the worsening of the economic situation and the difficulties that many countries are experiencing, and what we therefore need to do is try to find a way to use those resources better."
"I would also like to say, in response to another speaker, that the EU budget has been adapted in order to respond to the crisis and has not been stagnant in the face of this new situation that has arisen in the last two years, and it has also responded to the social challenges that have arisen."
"This is what happened, for example, with the European Economic Recovery Plan."
"In addition, and finally, I will pass on the remainder of the comments from Members to the Council and would like to thank them personally and also on behalf of the Council for their speeches."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to thank Members for their interventions."
"Listening to your comments, I can hear the clear voice in favour of revision that is, in your understanding, fresh money to finance the new challenges."
"On the other hand, I can also hear the concern as to the implications of the present financial crisis that is enforcing deep reductions in public expenditure in the Member States."
"There were many questions on the review - which is no longer the mid-term review as it is delayed in agreement with the two arms of the budgetary power."
"It will come in September and will include quantifications of new own resources of the possible candidates to replace the national contributions that have been dominant so far."
"It will not be so much a technical report as a political one, concerning also the consequences of the Lisbon Treaty, which finds a strong supporter in Mrs Herczog."
"I believe that Lisbon should not be associated only with additional administrative expenditure - which is the case nowadays - and should prove that this is value added, not only regarding the new posts and new type of administrative expenditure that is normally least loved by taxpayers in the European Union."
"As to Article 8.3, deleted by the Council, we are to defend flexibility in one form or another."
"This is the clear conclusion from our conciliations since 2007."
"Mr Garriga Polledo has enumerated several major challenges."
"It is not about supervisory agencies but mainly about ITER, Galileo and other large-scale projects, difficult to place within the existing multiannual framework."
"However we have quantifications."
"For ITER, it is very clear what will in come in 2012-13."
"However, we need long-term commitment before budgeting with this need to find the solution."
"As to the administration, I cannot promise Mr Ehrenhauser full answers about transparency, but I can promise that we are very serious in the Commission about zero growth."
"There will be no additional posts until 2013."
"That is my understanding of the self-restraint that is needed in the time of crisis."
"I cannot respond fully to the questions on how to operate with surpluses under the present regime, but it might be a contribution to the discussion of the rules of the next financial perspective."
"Ms McGuinness asked about the non-paper."
"This is already forgotten, passé, non-existent!"
"New papers should appear in October or November on the two big spending areas - cohesion and the common agricultural policy - and should be of a different nature to the one that has been leaked, the so-called non-paper."
"I am looking forward to cooperating on further steps."
"The calendar is very clear, with a vote on the Lisbon package in November in the Parliament and possible culmination with the conciliation."
"That is, a vote in October and conciliation in November."
"Madam President, I do apologise, but since we have a couple of minutes before the next item, I would just like to make two concluding comments."
"I understand the difficult plight of the Member States from some of the arguments put forward by the Presidency-in-Office."
"However, the Council's replies still do not fully reflect the necessities and budgetary challenges facing the European Union as a whole, nor its future direction."
"That is why we have to work together."
"From the Commissioner's replies, I take it that he has opened the door an inch for further talks and we will now be trying to get a foot in that door."
"The Committee on Budgets will, therefore, present an interim report on the procedure for approval of the review of the Multiannual Financial Framework on the basis of Article 81 of the Rules of Procedure, so that plenary is given the negotiating mandate for further talks in September."
"The debate is closed (Rule 149)."
"in writing. - (EL) The Treaty of Lisbon sets new priorities for the EU, while the EU 2020 strategy contains ambitious targets in crucial sectors for the future of the EU, which change the data on which the current Multiannual Financial Framework is based."
"More importantly, the consequences of the recent economic crisis, which are not yet fully understood and continue to expand, have shown that the challenges which we are being called on to respond to are changing drastically year on year and require adjustments at numerous levels if our policies are to be effective."
"However, we all know that every new policy, initiative and programme developed by the EU cannot be implemented without the necessary funds."
"The margins of the current Multiannual Financial Framework are very narrow, even suffocating I would say, and they leave no room for manoeuvre in coming years; for example, on the basis of the margins under Titles 1a and 4, unforeseen requirements cannot be met."
"We therefore urgently need to revise the current Multiannual Financial Framework in order to make provision for the necessary resources that will allow the EU to honour its undertakings and respond to the increased demands of European citizens."
"In wasting time, we are wasting opportunities."
"Question Time (Commission)"
"The next item is Question Time (B7-0307/2010)."
"The following questions are addressed to the Commission."
"Part one"
"Subject: Process and outcome of local elections in Belarus"
"Belarus held a round of elections to its local councils at the end of April 2010."
"There were a number of reports on violations of democratic electoral principles and procedures."
"Although more than 21 000 seats on local councils were being contested, there were only an estimated 360 opposition candidates competing against the pro-government candidates."
"What position has the Commission taken vis-à-vis the above-mentioned elections?"
"Has there been any improvement in terms of democratic standards as compared to the previous elections?"
"What is the position of the Commission concerning the ongoing violations of human rights in the country?"
"How does the Commission assess the political and human rights situation in Belarus in the run-up to the presidential elections in 2011?"
"Member of the Commission. - In response to the important and topical question from Ms Andrikienė, let me say that the Commission is fully aware of all the violations of the democratic principles and procedures which have been reported by a number of NGOs in the context of the local elections in Belarus."
"The European Union's heads of mission in Minsk have also pointed to inconsistencies and indeed discrepancies, in particular, in the ballot counting."
"Some amendments were made, ahead of the elections, to the Belarus electoral code."
"According to the opinion of the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, which was issued on 3 June 2010, this represented, and I quote, 'a step towards removing some flaws' in the electoral code."
"However, the report states that these amendments are unlikely to resolve the concerns that the electoral code continues to fall short of genuinely democratic elections."
"In the light of this, during the visit I intend to pay to Minsk in July, I will convey to the authorities the clear message that progress needs to be made in a number of areas which are key to democratisation if Belarus is serious about re-engaging with the European Union."
"One of these areas is electoral legislation, which is one of the most evident tests of democratic standards."
"In this respect, I will urge Minsk to continue to cooperate with the OSCE order on the reform of the electoral code ahead of the next presidential elections."
"In the run up to these elections, the Commission will also pay particular attention to other key aspects of democratisation, notably freedom of assembly, of the media and of NGOs and civil society, more generally, where no progress has been reported in recent times."
"(LT) Thank you very much for your answer, but I have an additional question."
"The world is reacting in different ways to events in Belarus."
"On 8 June, the US administration took the decision to extend for another year financial sanctions against high-ranking Belarusian officials, including President Alexander Lukashenko."
"I feel that this is a response to the undemocratic local elections in Belarus and I would like to hear your assessment."
"Also, does the European Union intend to take similar action as a reaction to violations of civil, political and other human rights in Belarus?"
"In other words, what position does the European Union plan to take?"
"Member of the Commission. - In the past, we have tried a policy of engagement and we have tried a policy of isolation, and, frankly, none of these policies worked perfectly; nor did they achieve what we wanted in the relationship with Belarus."
"What we are trying to do now is set up a basis for what I would call critical engagement."
"The Commission is working on the joint interim plan, which I would describe as a framework for both good and bad weather in the relationship between the European Union and Belarus."
"It provides a framework for the steps towards democratisation and gradual engagement from the European Union side."
"It will be shared with the European Council and, of course, with the European Parliament, and I strongly believe that this is the most proper answer to the violations of human rights we witness in Belarus."
"(PL) Mr Füle, I would like to thank you for this information, but I must raise two issues."
"Firstly, you are planning a visit to Belarus soon, and we have a particular request concerning national minorities."
"We have a situation there in which Belarusian citizens are often people from very different national groups."
"The problem concerns the treatment of Belarusian citizens of Polish origin."
"The second issue is a request that in all these measures, more emphasis be placed on setting up scholarships for Belarusian youth, because that is the most important course of action today."
"Member of the Commission. - Part of the programme is to focus attention on people contact, with young people and with students."
"On the other hand, what is very much on my agenda for the talks in Minsk is not only the general issues related to human rights violations, but also the specific questions concerning minorities."
"I am paying particular attention to this issue."
"I had a meeting with Ms Andżelika Borys and other representatives of the Belarus opposition, discussing not only the state of the Polish minorities in Belarus, but also the ways in which the Commission and the European Union could help them."
"I do not consider this an isolated issue."
"I do not consider this a ballot issue, as some might portray."
"It is indeed a serious question."
"The relationship between the authorities and minorities is going to be raised during my talks in Minsk."
"Subject: Effects of fiscal adjustments on the credibility of the common European currency"
"In order to gain acceptance for the euro on the part of European governments and the European public, the Commission launched a large-scale information campaign in all countries of the euro area with favourable results."
"Today, principally as a result of economic problems in these countries, accompanied by uncontrolled market speculation, the credibility of the euro is being seriously undermined, creating widespread public concern and uncertainty in Europe according to national surveys."
"Can the Commission provide the following information:"
"Have special public opinion soundings been taken in Europe by population category?"
"What measures are being envisaged to improve the image of the common currency and its credibility in the eyes of the public?"
"Will the euro area continue freely to admit new member countries?"
"Member of the Commission. - I want to thank Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou for a very pertinent question - or rather a set of questions - because the image and credibility of the euro is an issue of major concern for all of us Europeans at this critical juncture and these difficult times."
"The euro is not only a monetary arrangement; it is also a core political project - if not the core political project - of the European Union."
"Therefore, the fate of the euro, the image of the euro, the credibility of the euro has major implications for the overall European project."
"I have here a carefully calibrated draft answer of four pages which I asked my services to prepare."
"I am tempted to read it out, but it would take some 12 minutes of your time."
"However, I am ready to make this available and I can also put it on my website."
"This is not only a matter of media actions and campaigns - no matter how important they are - it is also a matter of policies and concrete actions in order to defend the euro from the systemic attacks it has been under recently."
"I would just say in passing that we are carrying out regular quantitative surveys."
"We have regular flash Eurobarometer surveys which we conduct in all Member States - we have done it in different waves."
"We are using every opportunity to actively communicate the latest developments and policy actions taken in respect of the euro and economic and monetary union."
"The concerns of the general public are addressed through all available channels, such as the website, publications, questions and answers, leaflets as well as various networks dealing with economic policy making, trade unions, employers' organisations and so on and so forth."
"We are working on all fronts together with the Member States in order to get the message across concerning the euro."
"As regards the policies which are at the heart of the matter, and this deals with part 'b' of Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou's question: What measures are being envisaged to improve the image of the common currency and its credibility in the eyes of the public?"
"I want to make three points on this."
"First, we have decided on a very substantial financial backstop called the European financial stability mechanism and facility - almost EUR 500 billion - which, together with the rescue package for Greece on coordinated and conditional financial assistance, has helped to stop the bush fire of financial uncertainty before it has turned into a forest fire all over Europe."
"We are taking concrete steps in order to safeguard financial stability and the euro in Europe."
"Secondly, our Member States are making great efforts in fiscal consolidation."
"In fact, there is a wave of fiscal consolidation and structural reform going on in Europe in order to restore and reinforce confidence and credibility in the euro and economic and monetary union."
"We are not doing it without careful calibration; we are doing it in a coordinated and differentiated manner so that those countries with no or little fiscal space, such as Greece, Spain and Portugal, have to accelerate fiscal consolidation."
"While many other countries still have fiscal space, they should not start consolidation before next year - this is to ensure that we do not suffocate the current ongoing economic recovery."
"Just today, we presented a total of 15 excessive deficit procedures, and on the basis of our assessment, our Member States' strategies of fiscal consolidation are in line with this coordinated and differentiated fiscal exit strategy."
"Finally, reinforcing economic governance is absolutely essential in order to reinforce the credibility of the euro and I do indeed count on your support when you vote on the resolution on Europe 2020 and on reinforcing economic governance."
"We need your support in order to convince the European Council - convince the Member States - and keep up the momentum so that we can have these more rigorous systems of budgetary and economic surveillance and policy coordination in place by the beginning of next year."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, thank you very much for your reply and for giving us all a chance to remember the policy to support the single currency and the survival of the euro area."
"The spirit of my question related more to the communication that we need to apply, because the citizens do not understand these unprecedented technical issues in the economic life of Europe and they do not share them and there is a risk that they will feel that support for the euro has a price rather than a secure future."
"This is fuelled by scenarios and threats of some countries leaving the single currency."
"It is the joint responsibility of the Member States and the European bodies to support the achievement of the euro, but public opinion needs supportive measures which have nothing to do with financial adjustments in their countries."
"Member of the Commission. - I agree with your way of reasoning and I think it is essential that we see the euro as a key policy instrument for economic policy and sustainable growth in Europe and, at the same time, that we look at it not only as a symbol but also as a bond for Europeans in building the common European home."
"In this regard, we have organised a broad range of communication activities."
"For instance, in the first half of 2010 - I will just give you the highlights - we carried out an information campaign on the key benefits of the euro in 10 euro area countries: Germany, France, Italy, Portugal, the Netherlands, Spain, Austria, Finland, Malta and Belgium."
"We also organised the Brussels Economic Forum, devoted to economic and financial issues, which took place two weeks ago."
"A record number of policy areas, more than 1 000, were agreed on and the event was widely reported by the media."
"This was clearly a case of reaching out to the opinion makers and trying to have a multiplier effect through this important forum."
"I could continue the list."
"We are engaged in these activities and I think we will achieve the best results by having the right policies and having the right kind of campaigns in order to ensure that our people are well informed."
"In my youth, I trained as a spare parts salesman;"
"I started at 12 and I ended that career at 20."
"We always had a very clear philosophy: that you have to have the product right before you can market it well: you need both."
"You need a solid product, solid policies and you need a sound marketing campaign in order to win the hearts and minds of our people."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I have listened to your reply very carefully."
"I do not know if the twelve page memorandum which you mentioned includes a reply to one part of my fellow Member's question, to be precise, the integration of new countries into the euro area and the prospects for such integration."
"I know - and you know - that the new member is Estonia."
"What we are seeing is that, in order for these countries to enter the euro area, harsh financial restructuring programmes are being applied, with the result that in Estonia today, drastic cuts in civil servants' wages are being applied, unemployment has reached 20% and unemployment among young people is many times higher."
"My question is this: is this image of an ante-room to the euro area attractive?"
"Is it reliable?"
"Does it create preconditions for further viability?"
"Member of the Commission. - The reason why Estonia has had to enforce budgetary discipline is not primarily the euro, but the fact that Estonia's economy faced a very serious financial crisis, like all of us, and economic growth stalled."
"There was negative economic growth, which meant that Estonia's public finances were simply no longer on a sustainable basis."
"Estonia's debt level is very low: 7.2% for the moment, while the European average is 75%, but the gradient was very worrying and it was only common sense in economic terms to ensure that Estonia will be able to continue its stability-oriented policies and ensure the sustainability of its public finances."
"This was the democratic decision of the Estonian Parliament recently and this has been the policy followed in Estonia with quite some success."
"(LT) Commissioner, as we know, Greece is the weakest link in the euro chain and it took two months for Greece to be granted an aid package."
"That delay was largely down to Germany and cost EUR 100 million, and undoubtedly weakened the euro currency itself."
"How does the Commission view such matters and what steps would it take to prevent such delays from being repeated in the future?"
"Member of the Commission. - I do not want to enter into any kind of blame game."
"My view is that politics, and economic policy making in the European Union, is always a matter of political will but also the art of what is possible."
"This time, it became possible at some point to take those decisions, to provide conditional and coordinated financial assistance for Greece, and later on to create the European Financial Stability Mechanism."
"These are now working."
"Concerning Greece, the first tranches of a total of EUR 20 billion from the EU and the IMF were sent to Greece in mid-May."
"Greece is implementing its joint EU-IMF programme in time and according to the memorandum of understanding."
"Moreover, the recently decided European Financial Stability Mechanism and Facility are readily available, so that the Community instrument, which is up to EUR 60 billion, can use the Union budget as loan guarantees for possible operations."
"This is up and running."
"It is readily available, if requested and if genuinely needed."
"Meanwhile, the Special Purpose Vehicle of up to EUR 440 billion, the intergovernmental arrangement which is also called the European Financial Stability Facility, is going to be ratified by 90% of the volume, which is the criterion, by the end of this month and it will be operational a few weeks after that."
"This means that, if we have an immediate and pressing need, we have the tools to tackle this with this mechanism and this facility."
"My final point is that this only buys us time, and the essence is that we have to engage in a very serious campaign of fiscal consolidation in Europe, where the past two years have wiped out 20 years of fiscal consolidation in the past two decades."
"Subject: EU Structural Funds - funding exclusion"
"The EU, as signatory to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities reflects the core elements - of anti-discrimination, equal opportunities and active inclusion measures - in its own disability strategy."
"In March 2010, the Commission was represented at a conference in Brussels hosted by the European Coalition for Community Living which addressed the issue of 'Funding exclusion while promoting inclusion?"
"The use of European Union funding to maintain the institutionalisation of people with disabilities'."
"The Commission is aware of the concern among NGOs that European Structural Funds are being used to renovate existing, or build new, long-stay residential institutions for people with disabilities, in contravention of the rights of these citizens."
"Given the strong convergence of objectives between the overall EU Disability Strategy and the UN Convention, what action will the Commission take to address this problem and ensure that EU funds are not used in this inappropriate way, but are rather directed towards the provision of community-based living for persons with disabilities?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - I would like to answer the oral question tabled by Mrs McGuinness by saying that, although the responsibility of organising and administering residential care lies with Member States, the Commission is keen to promote the right of people with disabilities to live independently by supporting services in the community as an alternative to living in institutions."
"By the end of this year, the Commission will have adopted a European disabilities strategy for the years 2010-20, which will set out a coherent framework for implementing the UN Convention on the rights of persons with disability."
"Providing support for people with disabilities to live independently and de-institutionalising all the systems will be among the priorities."
"In particular, it will highlight the potential role of the Structural Funds in this regard."
"Priorities for the use of Structural Funds are, of course, set at national and regional level, but the Commission will work with the Member States on the exchange of good practice and guidelines as to how best to use those funds in order to promote the personal autonomy and the right of persons with disabilities to live independently."
"I would also like to mention the European Social Fund as an instrument to eliminate the barriers to the participation of people with disabilities as equal members of society."
"The Social Fund can finance, among other things, counselling, training adapted to the specific needs of people with disabilities, rehabilitation, job creation in sectors such as social economy, special support to promote entrepreneurship among persons with disabilities, and awareness raising campaigns to combat discrimination."
"It can also provide training and retraining of staff to facilitate the transition from institutional care to community-based services."
"The European Regional Development Fund can be used concurrently to develop social infrastructure to support such new services."
"In this regard, the Commission has drawn up a tool kit for using the Structural Funds in order to ensure access for, and non-discrimination against, people with disabilities."
"This tool kit is designed in order to allow the management authorities, the intermediate bodies or the project promoters to prepare, implement, monitor and evaluate the Structural Fund programmes and projects."
"On behalf of Mrs McGuinness, who tabled the question, I thank you for your frank and detailed response."
"I have just one or two brief questions."
"Firstly, is the Commission taking any action against those who have used structural funds inappropriately, particularly in the area where we are discussing the provision of facilities for people with disabilities?"
"Secondly, how soon can we actually eliminate such practices, if at all, in the Member States?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - If there is a misuse of structural funds in general, the Commission can intervene, but there is, of course, the primary obligation and responsibility of the Member State in order to bring forward their policy agenda and organise their own social protection systems, including those people in long-term care institutions."
"The question, of course, is: could we veto it if the Member States are continuing to invest in a different way?"
"You know that the Structural Funds are spent on a system of shared responsibility between the Commission and the Member States."
"However, it is up to the Member States and their regions to manage the programmes and to implement them by selecting programmes and projects."
"Nevertheless, even if we cannot veto, we have already been working together with Member States in order to change the policy in the Member States."
"For instance, with the Bulgarian Government, we have, for two years, had a cooperative approach under which the government did not use the money in residential institutions, but undertook that no EU funds would be spent on investing in existing residential institutions and that for any investment in these sectors, the principle of de-institutionalisation would be followed."
"(HU) First of all, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her answer and for her commitment to the cause of people with disabilities."
"I have two additional related questions."
"The main problem regarding the use of Structural Funds did come up, which is primarily an issue in Eastern Europe."
"In the past, castles nationalised in the Communist era housed people with disabilities, primarily with mental disabilities."
"One of the problems is that money from Structural Funds was spent on the renovation of these castles, and then the castles were closed and the disabled were moved out."
"What will happen to these buildings?"
"Does the Commission have a plan to examine this issue from a broader perspective, in relation to tourism and job creation?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - I am very well aware that a change of regime also means a change in the way you approach the remnants of past policy."
"Of course, it is up to the governments to decide how they are going to care for their institutions and whether or not they want to renovate their property and give it another use."
"I can only tell you that, as regards de-institutionalisation to bring disabled people into society and not leave them in institutions, we have tried to make the Commission staff responsible for discussions with the Member States aware of these aspects."
"On 29 April 2010, DG Regio held a seminar for Commission staff called 'Would you call this home?', where best and worst practice in the use of EU funds for dismantling long-stay institutions were presented, so that our staff could understand which policies need to be applied in trying to change the mentality in their contacts with the administrations in the Member States."
"There has also been very good interaction between DG Regio and DG Employment on further steps which could be taken, because we believe that Social Fund investment should serve the population in those areas."
"It should not only be used for renovating houses, but should also be used for creating jobs and growth in the areas concerned."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to bring your attention to what I believe is a very topical and specific issue."
"In my country, in Greece, and probably in other countries too, due to the austerity programmes, social spending is being cut and often funding for centres and foundations which provide services to the disabled is being stopped."
"I have before me one such recent example: a single centre providing services to people, mainly children, with visual problems and other disabilities."
"Fifty children have been left to their fate due to a lack of money."
"My question is: can these fifty children hope that this foundation will be eligible within the framework of funding under the European Social Fund?"
"What can we do about this?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - It is very clear that in the area of social policy, the Member States are responsible for organising their own social protection systems, including the design, financing and quality control of services provided in long-term care institutions."
"We cannot intervene or force a government to change its policy."
"We can only take general measures to push a government into caring for its population."
"One of the things we can of course do with the Social Fund is to train the staff and help have better care for those people, but the basis decision on whether or not to have a foster house lies with the national governments."
"Part two"
"Subject: Securing EU environmental goals"
"Does the Commission accept that excessive internal debate within the EU, and a failure to coordinate its full range of diplomatic sources across the world, contributed to the failure to secure EU objectives both at the UNFCCC Copenhagen climate change conference and at the meeting of the parties to CITES at Doha?"
"Will the Commission outline the steps it is taking to improve its advance planning and coordination with the object of raising its game and securing a more positive outcome at future environmental conferences?"
"Member of the Commission. - Mr Davies, your question raises the important issue of the effectiveness of European Union diplomacy in international environmental negotiations, against the background of the disappointing results of the meetings in Copenhagen on Climate Change and in Doha on Trade in Endangered Species."
"We obviously need to learn a number of lessons from these experiences, against the background of the relevant provisions in the Lisbon Treaty."
"Having said that, in order to draw a balanced set of conclusions for the future, I think we must recognise that the reasons for the outcomes of these meetings are manifold and need to be analysed on a case-by-case basis."
"It is, obviously, not an easy task to agree on a common position among 27 Member States, representing 500 million citizens, for international negotiations on complex issues that have a direct impact on the economy and society of the European Union."
"Nonetheless, both for the CITES and the climate change negotiations, this did not prevent the EU from agreeing on a common line and carrying out a range of outreach activities towards its international partners."
"For the CITES Conference of Parties, the EU position on many issues had been established more than six months before the meeting, outreach activities have been undertaken by EU and Member State delegations all around the world on important EU proposals on sharks and tigers, and internal EU discussions before and during the CoP on those topics ran smoothly."
"But I fully recognise that, in the case of bluefin tuna, these conditions were, unfortunately, not met to the same extent."
"On a more general note, the Commission considers that the EU will be able to act more effectively within CITES once it is a full party."
"The Commission will, therefore, step up its efforts to convince third countries, which have not yet done so, to ratify the Gaborone amendment to CITES, which allows the EU to join the convention."
"With respect to the climate change negotiations, the EU's internal debate in the context of Copenhagen was not excessive and the EU has significantly improved the coordination of its diplomatic sources across the world."
"The EU had an intensive outreach schedule to third countries in the run-up to Copenhagen and prepared and presented a common position across all key issues during the Copenhagen meeting."
"In the run-up to Copenhagen, the EU used multiple coordinated EU Troika demarches in more than 40 countries, effected a range of joint Troika outreach missions, as well as attending various bilateral and multilateral informal dialogues."
"Its technical negotiating teams discussed and further developed EU positions during various bilateral visits to third countries."
"Looking beyond the examples of the Copenhagen and Doha meetings, it is important to see that one of the key objectives of the Lisbon Treaty is to strengthen the Union's voice in the world."
"The implementation of the Lisbon Treaty will notably reinforce the EU's external representation in international environmental affairs."
"In this field, the treaty tasks the Commission with ensuring the Union's external representation."
"In case the Council considers it politically opportune that the Union engages in negotiations on international agreements, the treaty obliges the Council to authorise the Commission to conduct such negotiations on behalf of the Union for matters falling under Union competence."
"The Council may complement such authorisation by negotiating directives."
"The European Parliament shall, of course, be immediately and fully involved at all stages of the procedure."
"The Commission is currently discussing with Member States in the Council how to implement this framework."
"In those discussions, the Commission is very vigilant that the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty effectively results in reinforcing the unity and the coherence of EU representation in multilateral negotiations."
"Any other interpretation of the Lisbon Treaty simply risks and, in fact, weakens the EU's standing on the international arena, which is certainly not what the Lisbon Treaty was meant to bring about."
"What is at stake is the future of the EU organisation and efficiency in global environment negotiations, and the Commission counts on the support of Parliament on this issue."
"The Commissioner and I will share objectives without question, and I support the Commission in its battle with the Council, but, as we look at conferences like CITES, I see the Japanese apparently going round from one embassy to another with a bag of gold."
"You would describe it as outreach work."
"So let me put a specific question to you, as you touched upon the strengthening of the European Union's diplomatic abilities."
"What meetings have you had or will you have with Catherine Ashton to discuss how the External Action Service can be brought into the service of the Commission as a whole to ensure that our diplomatic abilities are played to the full?"
"Member of the Commission. - In answer to the specific question you asked: I have not had a meeting with Catherine Ashton on that issue."
"I think one thing is pretty clear as regards CITES, especially on the bluefin tuna; we have made a series of miscalculations - if I can put it that way."
"Firstly, the position of the Commission was simply adopted too late."
"Secondly, I believe the discussion in the Council was held at the very last Coreper; and, even if I could discuss this issue with Catherine, it would still be too late."
"Therefore, I think we should learn from these experiences."
"But, as you rightly pointed out, this is one of the tasks which we will have to do together, and we have to also use our future - hopefully well-functioning - External Service for that purpose."
"Subject: Dealing with EDC mixtures"
"Studies from Denmark and Germany have shown that children, in particular, are exposed to a whole cocktail of different chemicals, and especially hormone disrupting chemicals, such as the phthalate plasticisers."
"These scientific findings mean that the REACH authorisation process for single hormone disrupting chemicals - which is based on the grounds that their concentrations would stay below their effect level - is no longer safe or effective, because together, these chemicals form a dangerous mixture."
"How does the Commission intend to close this gap in the REACH provisions and ensure that hormone disrupting chemicals are not authorised on the flawed assumption that we are only exposed to one chemical at a time?"
"Subject: EU action on endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs)"
"The EU strategy for action on hormone-disrupting chemicals was adopted over 10 years ago, largely as a result of an initiative report by the European Parliament in 1997."
"Science has since then shown increasingly strong links between some endocrine disruptors and cancer, lower fertility and possible impacts on behaviour and development."
"Yet despite various political statements in support of the EU action plan on EDCs, and an agreed priority list of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), no practical action has yet been taken at EU level to remove hormone-disrupting chemicals from our environment."
"Will the Commission now take action to make use of the results from the publicly-funded research and ensure that these chemicals with a high risk to human health can be dealt with as a priority under REACH?"
"What concrete measures will the Commission propose in its forthcoming report on implementation of the EU EDC strategy?"
"Member of the Commission. - The Commission is aware of a number of studies concerning the combined effects of different chemicals."
"In particular, at the end of 2009, the Danish authorities published the results from a number of studies that examined the cumulative impact of different endocrine-disrupting substances on sensitive groups such as young children and female workers, as you mentioned in your question."
"The Danish study gave rise to the Council conclusions adopted in December 2009, in which the Commission was asked to examine how current EU legislation addressed the cumulative effects of different endocrine disruptors and, more broadly, to look at the general problem of how to deal with the cumulative effects of these types of chemicals."
"Concerning the general question of the cumulative effects of chemicals, the Commission recently made available through the Internet a state-of-the-art report on mixture toxicity which was the result of the two-year study funded by DG Environment."
"The Commission is now engaged in consulting stakeholders on this report and has also submitted a formal request concerning mixture toxicity to the Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks, the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Risks and the Scientific Committee on Consumer Products."
"By early 2012 at the latest, the Commission will, on the basis of the study and the associated consultation process, finalise a report assessing how and whether relevant existing Community legislation, including REACH, adequately addresses risks from exposure to multiple chemicals from different sources and pathways and, on this basis, it will consider appropriate modifications, guidelines and assessment methods."
"Since the launching of the Community strategy on endocrine disruptors in 1999, we have invested heavily through the Community research budget to increase our understanding of the mechanisms by which substances affect the functioning of endocrine systems."
"Over the same period, we have included specific measures to address endocrine disruptors in two key pieces of chemicals legislation, REACH and the Plant Protection Products Regulation."
"The Commission has also participated actively in international initiatives to develop testing methods and testing strategies for the identification of endocrine disruptors."
"Finally, the Commission has recently launched a major study to consolidate all the latest scientific information and to make recommendations concerning testing strategies and criteria for the identification of substances with endocrine-disrupting properties."
"The study will be finalised by the second half of next year."
"The results from this study will be taken into account in reviewing the existing Community strategy on endocrine disruptors and to provide input to the implementation of the existing EU legislation, by which I mean both the Plant Protection Products Regulation and also REACH."
"So, in summary, the Commission is aware of the seriousness of the questions you both raised and it is working intensively to address it in the most effective ways."
"It is not an easy thing because a lot of knowledge is still missing, but it is certainly a complex problem which deserves our attention and utmost consideration in the future."
"(DA) Commissioner, you say that in 2012, you will present a report in which you will reach a conclusion as to whether there are grounds to revise the legislation on account of the fact that it does not take account of cocktail effects."
"In this respect, I can save you the trouble, as we are already now able to confirm that this is the case."
"The legislation does not take account of cocktail effects."
"Those of us who have worked on REACH and those who know REACH in detail - as I know you do - know only too well that cocktail effects have simply not been taken into account when it comes to the most hazardous substances: carcinogenic substances and endocrine-disrupting chemicals."
"Moreover, REACH is based on two fundamental principles: the precautionary principle and the principle of protecting the most vulnerable consumers in our market, in other words, children and pregnant women, among others."
"So, should the Commission not present proposals now for revising REACH and perhaps also other types of legislation in order to stipulate that cocktail effects must be taken into account in the authorisation process on the basis of the substitution principle?"
"Member of the Commission. - As I have said, the real problem in this area is the lack of solid science and facts."
"You rightly mention the precautionary principle."
"We are bound by the treaty to follow the precautionary measures in the area of the environment also, but I would still like to get as much data as possible and to base the proposals on as much solid science as possible."
"Since 1999, the year when this approach started, we have already had 84 studies within the Community, with approximately two million involved."
"However, when I discussed that with my colleagues yesterday in order to get a brief outline of the details, their main message was actually exactly this: that we still lack knowledge to have very concrete measures."
"But certainly you can be reassured that this will be actively under my consideration in the future."
"I thank you, Commissioner, for your reply, but I have an immense feeling of frustration because this is 13 years that this has been under consideration - 84 studies over 13 years."
"There are certain parts of the population, particularly unborn children, who are extremely vulnerable to these chemicals, and the changes have been shown to be irreversible, so people's lives have been blighted from before birth as a result of this."
"Given what you have said about the precautionary principle, what is stopping the Commission from at least putting forward names for the list under REACH for going forward with banning these substances?"
"Member of the Commission. - I could actually repeat the answer."
"The fact is that when we talk about the precautionary principle, I think it is extremely important how we consider it and what we consider it to be, under that activity."
"I would simply like to have more data gathered."
"With the study we launched, we did not launch the study through which we would like to get the cumulative knowledge of what we have accumulated through the EU research programmes, but to have an overview of everything which is going around - all the knowledge we have globally."
"That is the whole intention, but I can fully understand your frustration."
"As you know, I have been in this area for half a year and I will certainly look fully into all the things which you have underlined and try to see how we can best handle that in the future."
"Mr President, current EU regulations on food contact materials still allow quite high levels of bisphenol A. As a result, there is a risk that it could migrate into food or, in wider consumer uses involving daily exposure, also move into the body."
"How will the results of the European Food Safety Agency opinion on bisphenol A due at the end of May 2010 - I think it has been presented now - be taken into account for future actions on bisphenol A under REACH?"
"I am thinking about our babies, our bottles and so on."
"Member of the Commission. - Like all the scientific knowledge which we are getting on board, of course, if there is any in existence, we will take it seriously into account in the preparing of the future policy actions or in explaining how we should implement things via the current legislation which we have currently on board."
"So, simply, step by step, we should increase the quality of the knowledge we have, which is lacking in this area."
"The problem is serious and, when we get this knowledge on board, I can reassure you that we will act."
"Subject: Floods Directive Implementation"
"Can the Commission give an update as to the implementation of the Floods Directive (2007/60/EC), with special reference to Ireland?"
"Member of the Commission. - Mr Kelly, the Floods Directive was adopted in 2007 and the process of implementation is under way."
"In the last month, new floods have reminded us of the serious consequences of floods and of the importance of flood risk management which focuses on prevention, preparedness and protection."
"The Floods Directive requires all Member States to prepare comprehensive plans to reduce flood risks."
"Importantly, the public and interested parties need to be consulted on these plans, and Member States need to cooperate in transboundary waterways."
"The first two implementation deadlines have already expired."
"Firstly, the legal transposition into national law was due by November 2009."
"To date, 12 Member States, including Ireland, have met this deadline."
"Ten Member States have not yet notified their transposition of the directive, and five Member States have only notified partial transposition."
"The Commission is pursuing infringement cases to respond to this situation."
"As regards the notification by the Member States to the Commission of administrative arrangements, the deadline expires on 26 June of this year."
"Twenty three Member States, including Ireland, have notified."
"The Commission is now checking that all relevant information on the responsible authorities and the geographical coverage of the units of management is in compliance with the directive."
"The main implementation milestones are still some time away."
"Across the European Union, Member States are preparing these steps, which are: firstly, to carry out a preliminary flood risk assessment in 2011 and to identify areas of potential significant flood risks; secondly, to prepare detailed flood hazard maps and flood risk maps by 2013; and, thirdly, to prepare the first flood risk management plans in 2015."
"The public and interested parties must also be consulted on these plans before they are adopted."
"As regards Ireland, we understand the implementation is well under way and we have no reason to believe Ireland is delayed in implementing the directive."
"Ireland has notified the legislation transposing the directive and has reported administrative arrangements."
"We furthermore welcome the fact that Ireland has already undertaken pilot exercises in the Dodder catchment in the Dublin area as well as in the Lee catchment in the south of Ireland - where a draft catchment flood risk management plan was prepared and submitted to public consultation."
"Ireland also takes an active role at the European level in promoting valuable information exchange between the Member States on different topics related to the implementation of the directive, such as on how to deal with flash and pluvial floods, flood mapping and development of flood risk management plans."
"I shall be brief out of respect for others."
"Firstly, Commissioner, thank you for a very detailed and comprehensive response, which I deeply value."
"I have just one supplementary."
"In the event of countries not meeting deadlines, would the Commission not consider making the Solidarity Fund available in the event of flooding taking place in the future - or in the past, because we have an application in at the minute regarding flooding?"
"I note what has been said about the information exchange and, in particular, with relation to flash flooding."
"I happen to live near the River Dodder in Dublin, and relatively small rivers can cause terrible devastation in cities in a relatively short period of time."
"Can I ask that a manual be prepared, which would include such things as, for example, making sure sluice gates are cleared, not blocked by debris, because things like that cause this sort of damage."
"If there were a manual, it really should be applied by local authorities, but it could be best practice which could be shared throughout the European Union, and I would encourage that that be done."
"(RO) Flood prevention and management require the European Union's river-related issues to be resolved at transnational level, along with huge investments."
"I wish to ask the Commission whether it is considering drawing up a common policy on inland waters, just like the common maritime policy, which will deal with, in an integrated manner, territorial planning, environmental protection, marine environment protection, maritime transport and the development of areas bordering inland waters or of coastal regions."
"(GA) Mr President, the flooding during the summer did a lot of damage in Ireland, particularly to the infrastructure, to shops and to housing."
"In total, it cost almost EUR 1 billion."
"However, all the blame cannot be attached to the rainfall; the biggest problem in Ireland was that the waterways have not been maintained."
"The Waterways Directive is a very important directive."
"As well as that, a lot of damage has been done - and is still being done - to wildlife, particularly to rare birds, because the Birds Directive has not been implemented either."
"Member of the Commission. - Firstly, many of you have mentioned funding."
"There are two possibilities: one is prevention, when we should look to the Cohesion Fund; the second relates to the funds at European level - Interreg and all the activities connected with that."
"When disaster occurs, there is certainly another possibility - mentioned by an honourable Member - namely the European Solidarity Fund."
"The European Union Solidarity Fund has very clear guidelines concerning implementation and the nature of the damage."
"In the case of the Irish application for the Solidarity Fund, the damage caused was below the threshold but the Commission is in the process of assessing that application."
"When the amount of the damage is below the normal threshold for mobilising the Solidarity Fund of 0.6%, the specific criteria for exceptional mobilisation must be met."
"If this is assessed to be the case, then the aid can be guaranteed."
"However, we should not simply mix the two things - the purpose of one and the purpose of the other."
"I also agree about the sharing of best practice, which was mentioned - I think it is important that management plans are drawn up in a proper and correct way."
"Regarding the cross-border effect, we are very much in support of this in the Water Framework Directive."
"The river basin approach is one which looks across borders and which is establishing a kind of connection where the Member States should cooperate."
"They are asked to cooperate and, in fact, are bound to do so in preparing their cross-border solutions."
"Finally, I would mention that in 2012, we want to produce a blueprint on waters and their management."
"Within that blueprint, there will be three topics which we want to address."
"One of the topics to which we will give our attention will be droughts."
"Subject: Revision of the EIA Directive (85/337/EEC)"
"From time to time, we hear of problems arising during the planning and implementation of large-scale infrastructure projects, especially in the energy sector."
"Most of the problems arise because of the lack of transparency and impartiality in the environmental impact assessments of such projects."
"Current legislation (Directive 85/337/EEC), as can be seen from the recent Commission report, does not provide for the environmental assessment to be genuinely independent."
"Two main solutions to this issue are put forward: first, closer Commission involvement in the environmental assessment procedure or, second, ensuring that the financing of the environmental assessment is independent of the developer of the project being assessed."
"When is the Commission planning to present the reviewed text of the EIA Directive?"
"Which option is the Commission likely to choose in order to guarantee the independence of the environmental assessment?"
"Member of the Commission. - It is true that under the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Directive, the responsibility for gathering the necessary environmental information and submitting it to the public authorities is given to the developer."
"However, this does not result in an opaque and partial EIA process as the directive contains several safeguards which ensure a transparent and objective environmental assessment of projects."
"These safeguards are to be found, firstly, in the description of the minimum information to be included in the environmental impact assessment report which is required by the EIA Directive and, secondly, in the consultations with the competent environmental authorities and the public."
"Indeed, all the information provided by the developer has to be made public to the environmental authorities and the public, which have to be consulted."
"The accuracy of this information can be challenged at any point of the consultations, before the final decision is taken."
"This means that the competent environmental authorities can use their own capacity to proceed with a proper assessment of the information provided, while NGOs or interested parties can - and very often do - challenge the whole assessment on the basis of the data provided, in case they do not reflect the real situation or omit clearly to conform to the requirements of the EIA provisions."
"The final decision to grant or refuse development consent must take into consideration the results of consultations and the information gathered and must contain the main reasons on which it is based."
"All this is also made available to the public."
"But, to be honest, your question is very relevant."
"After more than 20 years of implementation, we have identified the areas where improvements are needed and reached the conclusion that the EIA Directive should be reviewed."
"My objective is to present a new text which will further improve environmental protection, take on board the challenges in the areas of climate change, energy and biodiversity, integrate the ECJ case-law and harmonise and simplify, to the extent possible, existing procedures."
"In this context, the overall quality of the environmental assessments will be a central issue, and there is certainly room for improvement."
"On the one hand, the quality control of the EIA documentation submitted by the developer could be improved."
"On the other hand, the quality of the EIA process itself could be reinforced."
"My services have already started working on the review of the EIA Directive."
"By the end of June, a broad consultation of the public and of the stakeholders will be launched."
"You are, of course, invited to participate and also express your views."
"Once all the relevant data and information are on the table, the Commission will identify the appropriate policy options for amending the EIA Directive, including ways of ensuring the independence of the environmental assessments."
"Any Commission proposal will have to be subject to a legislative impact assessment."
"I am not yet in a position to give you a date for the Commission's proposal, but my intention is clearly to present this proposal during my mandate, better sooner than later, though of course, there is still some quite serious work to be done before then."
"(LT) This problem is important for Member States, important in the sense of projects being carried out locally in Member States and important in terms of international projects, an example of which would probably be energy infrastructure projects, like the Nordstream project in the Baltic Sea."
"As you mentioned, society has the right to participate and operators should take account of society's concerns, but somehow, not even information from independent scientists was taken into account."
"That is why today, we are discussing the need to establish an independent impact assessment mechanism and I would like to ask whether you think that the European Commission could regulate Member State national law in this matter, or, supposing it is an international project, whether the European Commission itself could intervene in such things?"
"Member of the Commission. - In essence, once again you have pointed to the right direction."
"If the project or the investment does not have cross-border effects, then it is pretty clear how the thing should be done."
"Subsidiarity is clearly at stake here and I would have nothing to add."
"If the process is transparent, if everybody can have a view - this, by the way, was the intention of the EIA Directive amendments in the past and, in 2003, this was aligned with the Aarhus Convention which should provide exactly that - then the process should lead to the things you mention."
"Things are a bit more complicated when you talk about cross-border."
"What the directive is currently asking with regard to cross-border is that negotiations or better information exchange take place with the parties concerned."
"That should happen already under the EPSA Convention, but if it is in the context of the European Union Member States then, of course, this EIA Directive applies."
"To be honest, the Commission has more or less a procedural role in that respect."
"We have to take care that all the necessary procedures are taken into account, necessary procedures which ideally should lead to an independent impact assessment, done first hand by the developer, checked if necessary, and looked at by the Member States' authorities."
"This is what we are guaranteeing."
"We should know that we have brought two important things to the floor through inclusion of the EIA concept."
"One is that the environment is brought seriously into consideration when any kind of investment happens, and second that public consultation occurs in all cases so that things are transparent."
"But you are pointing in the right direction."
"I think the question, or what is implicitly behind your reasoning, is one of the issues I believe needs to be addressed in the future, in the revision of the EIA Directive, but I cannot give you an answer now as to which direction we will take."
"The discussion is starting now and I will certainly look into those details in the future."
"Mr President, I will be very brief."
"I just want to ask the question as to why you decided to ask five questions from one Commissioner and only one question from another."
"Is there a reason for this?"
"It is legitimate that we might expect that two to three questions would be asked from each Commissioner."
"I just want to know what the reason for this is."
"That is the order in which they were tabled."
"What about Commissioner Dalli?"
"Do we lose him entirely?"
"There does not seem to be very good management of Question Time if you entirely blot out one Commissioner."
"In fact, two Commissioners."
"Mr President, I would like you to report back to the Bureau, and I speak as Chairman of the Committee on the Internal Market, because two of the lead Commissioners for my committee have not had the chance this evening to respond to questions both from members of my committee and others."
"If you knew at the beginning of this sitting, as you clearly did, and the sessions secretariat did, that time was going to be limited, first of all, it was absolutely unnecessary to take the two questions at the beginning that were not allocated to any Commissioner."
"Members of this House table questions specifically to the Commissioners because they are here, and so those two could have been dispensed with straightaway."
"If this arises again, I suggest we have to have a proper change to the Rules of Procedure on this subject."
"Secondly, it was quite clear what time was available, in which case you should have shared the questions between the three Commissioners who have taken the trouble and have the courtesy to come here."
"It is outrageous that this Parliament ignores the fact that two Commissioners come here and will not now get any time."
"So, as chairman of a committee, I insist that you as President of this sitting report back fully to the Bureau and express our strong displeasure at the appalling organisation of this sitting."
"In every chamber in the world, Question Time runs out of time, and that has happened tonight."
"It happens every single time."
"(EL) Mr President, I too should like to note that time has not been apportioned rationally."
"I had a meeting in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and votes at the same time and I left the Committee on Agriculture and the votes in order to be present at this time of parliamentary control."
"You obviously have not allocated the time correctly between the parties to parliamentary control."
"You have allowed supplementary questions in a very flexible manner."
"I think that we need to show the Commissioners and Mr Barnier some respect."
"That is required by parliamentary order."
"I say this to you, Mr President, for whom I have a great deal of personal respect."
"You are from the country in which modern parliamentary democracy was born."
"However, parliamentary democracy has order and rules and principles."
"I am truly sorry about what has happened this evening."
"It does no one any honour; it does no honour to Parliament and it does no honour to the Bureau, Mr President."
"We did in fact start late because some Commissioners and some Members were not present."
"That is part of the reason for this occurring."
"(DE) Mr President, I have participated in every question time since 1994, but I have never seen a scandal of this magnitude."
"The proper procedure is that, if you reduce speaking time, you do so for each Commissioner."
"I put the first question to Commissioner Dalli, so I was sure that I would get my turn."
"As we speak, President José Barroso is speaking to my group and, since leaving that discussion three quarters of an hour ago, I have been sitting here for 45 minutes waiting for my turn."
"Might I point out that you should have informed me that that would be the case."
"I really have to say that I disagree with this procedure and demand that you do not reduce question time even more."
"It is the most important thing in a parliament."
"We are not a voting machine for the establishment!"
"Each individual Member of Parliament is entitled to participate in question time, it is a fundamental right that we have borrowed from the British parliamentary system, in particular."
"As I said, in all chambers, in all countries, Question Time runs out of time - and we have run out of time."
"I am going to take one final question."
"Subject: Birds and Habitats Directives"
"The Birds Directive (79/409/EEC) and the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) permanently come under pressure."
"It is fashionable to maintain that they stand in the way of economic development."
"However, the example of the port of Antwerp demonstrates the contrary."
"Almost the whole of the port area is designated as a special protection area under the Birds Directive, but nature conservation and development go hand-in-hand here with economic development, as the Commissioner himself recently ascertained."
"Given the pressure which exists to relax these directives, it seems to me appropriate in this Year of Biodiversity to ask the Commissioner what is his position on the Birds and Habitats Directives:"
"Does the Commissioner agree with President Barroso, who stated in a letter to Prime Minister Balkenende that revision of the aforementioned directives was not needed but, on the contrary, stability in the relevant legislative framework, and that these directives allowed sufficient room for economic development?"
"Member of the Commission. - The EU Habitats and Birds Directives as they stand provide the necessary flexibility to ensure compatibility between nature protection and economic development."
"The Commission does not believe that a review would be justified at this stage."
"The reasons are as follows:"
"The EU nature legislation sets a global model for nature protection - science-driven, legally enforceable and based upon ecosystems as the basic unit."
"The Natura network is one of the most advanced, most extensive and most flexible systems of nature protection in the world."
"It is one of the greatest achievements of European Union environmental policy."
"Biodiversity is a key environmental priority for the Commission during its present term."
"In March this year, the Council reaffirmed that protected areas and ecological networks are a cornerstone of our efforts to preserve biodiversity and stressed the need to fully implement the Birds and Habitats Directives and speed up completion of the Natura 2000 network."
"We are now at a crucial stage of implementation of the legislation."
"Across Europe, the process of designation of Natura 2000 sites is nearing completion and the priority is now to ensure that the Natura 2000 network is effectively managed and properly resourced so that it can fully achieve its objectives."
"The EU Habitats Directive is a unique, flexible tool, which allows farming, fishing, forestry, hunting and even major development projects to be carried out in a way that does not destroy the ecological value of our natural heritage."
"Natura sites are not no-go areas where human activities and economic development are to be excluded."
"Most sites are living landscapes which have been shaped as a result of many years of human intervention."
"Designation of a Natura site does not mean that economic activities within the site must be frozen."
"On the contrary, there are many examples such as the Port of Antwerp - which I visited recently and which is also mentioned in your question - where economic development successfully continues side by side with nature protection."
"Correct implementation of the provisions of the nature directives, early integration of environmental concerns into the planning process and broad information and involvement of all stakeholders are key to such success stories."
"Finally, in view of the fact that we have not met the political target of halting the loss of biodiversity in 2010, we will have to assess the reasons why we have failed."
"In that context, we will also need to evaluate in detail whether implementation of our existing legislation is effective in delivering biodiversity protection and reflect on what improvements should eventually be made."
"I will be extremely brief; this was the answer that I wanted to hear."
"I think all environmental organisations, and a lot of economic actors, who do believe that this is a very good directive, will be very happy to hear that from you."
"Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will receive written answers (see Annex)."
"That concludes Question Time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 20.35 and resumed at 21.00)"
"Gender aspects of the economic downturn and financial crisis - Assessment of the results of the 2006-2010 Roadmap for Equality between women and men and forward looking recommendations - Charter for Women's Rights - follow up (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the report by Mr Romeva i Rueda, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on gender aspects of the economic downturn and financial crisis,"
"the report by Mrs Figueiredo, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on assessment of the results of the 2006-2010 Roadmap for Equality between women and men and forward-looking recommendations [2009/2242 (INI)], and"
"the oral question to the Commission by Mrs Gurmai and Mrs Thomsen, on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, Mrs Figueiredo and Mrs Svensson, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, Mrs Parvanova, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, and Mrs Cornelissen, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance on the Charter for Women's Rights - follow up - B7-0305/2010)."
"Mr President, I would like to thank you for the opportunity to discuss this issue."
"Allow me to begin with a question; a very simple question, but one which I think highlights the problem that we are talking about very well: if we had had Lehman Sisters instead of Lehman Brothers, would we be here today talking about this?"
"We do not know because that is not the case, but what is clear is that the situation would have been very different from the one that we have today in the context of the credit crunch and the economic and financial crisis."
"There is an extremely clear consensus among economists, both feminist and non-feminist, that the current crises have been caused by a series of institutions that are fundamentally, basically, run by men."
"We therefore have objective data that points to men being directly responsible for this situation."
"We cannot say whether, if the majority had been women rather than men, the situation would have been the same, but I do believe that it is obvious that there would have been differences in both the cause and the management of the crisis and, of course, also in the current recovery."
"I do think it is important to highlight another significant fact: the financial agencies, for example, that have a greater proportion of women in their management bodies have suffered much less from this type of situation."
"I think that this compels us to stop and think, which is what we are doing in this report."
"To some extent, what we want to do is suggest that as well as being an extremely serious problem, this crisis is and must be an opportunity to correct some of the issues that led us along what was clearly an erroneous path."
"Bad policies and a lack of equality in many of those policies is one of those problems."
"In this respect, I would like to point out and highlight very clearly some of the shortcomings of the political responses to the crisis."
"They are not taking advantage of this opportunity: for example, at no point has a gender perspective been used in what is known as the 'post-Lisbon perspective', which is the 2020 strategy."
"So far, at least, there has not been an explicit drive for clear macro-economic policies and guidelines on employment with a clear and obvious gender perspective to be established."
"It is one thing to have declarations, but what we are interested in here are tangible commitments."
"The aim of this report is to at least open up the debate and put a few questions on the table that we feel are important."
"We are aware that there are some Member States, some governments - including the Presidency's government: the Spanish Government - that have led the debate on this issue and put some issues on the table."
"As well as highlighting and acknowledging this, I also wish to support the coming presidencies, which are going to or will want to raise similar issues."
"I do, however, think it is important to point out something else."
"If we really want to correct some of these mistakes, it is very important that we understand that the causes include a series of key elements, and the first of them is the lack of political will to make clear equality policies."
"What we are therefore asking for in this report is firstly political will; secondly, imagination, which I think is important to highlight; and thirdly, and this is the key aspect of the report, measures that are tangible, clear and, if you will, binding and compulsory."
"We have had enough of good intentions."
"What we need are clear commitments, and I will say it once again: binding, mandatory commitments that have to be fulfilled."
"For example, establishing full employment, in terms of both men and women, but especially in terms of women, should be an objective in itself."
"In short, a tangible objective is to aim for 75% female employment by 2020 or to reduce the salary gap to zero or to a maximum of 5%; something for which we have been asking for a long time."
"These are measures that are, at least, already being discussed and which some of us would like to be - and I repeat - mandatory."
"We are aware that both Commissioner Reding and the Spanish Presidency have repeatedly raised these issues, and we want to invite not only the rest of the groups but also other countries to understand that this is not just a whim, it is an obligation and a need and - I repeat - it is an opportunity in relation to the crisis that we are experiencing."
"In any case, I would like to conclude by acknowledging the work, the support and all the contributions made by the different groups so that this text could be a consensus and a compromise, and could clearly highlight the problem as well as what is and should be the solution."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the report which I am presenting here is the result of collaboration under the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, which also included a hearing with women's organisations and experts, and participation by the European Commission itself."
"My thanks to everyone involved."
"According to our analysis of the 2006-2010 Roadmap for Equality, we believe that some progress has been made, and prominence has been given to some key aspects of equality between women and men."
"In actual fact, however, they have not been fully realised because the political force needed has not been there."
"It is especially worth emphasising the inequalities that persist in real life, such as difficulties in accessing jobs with rights and decent wages, poverty, continuing discrimination and stereotypes which help to perpetuate inequalities, including access to training and professional advancement to leading positions, and in economic and political life."
"Existing contradictions in EU policy also contribute towards this, and have given rise to more than 85 million people in poverty, most of them women and children, as a result of unemployment, job insecurity, low wages, pensions below the minimum subsistence income, and poor access to quality public services."
"The current economic and social crisis has particularly serious consequences for women, and this exacerbates inequalities and discrimination."
"This is the case with unequal pay between men and women, which is over 17% on average, and indirect discrimination, which tends to worsen when employment rises, affecting women and young girls."
"The jobs created in recent years, particularly those for young people and women, have been largely insecure and poorly paid, without respecting basic rights, especially for maternity."
"This has also contributed to the low birth rate."
"The widespread discrimination to which specific groups of women are subjected is particularly serious."
"The groups worst affected are the elderly, women with dependents, immigrant women or those from a minority, and women with disabilities."
"Besides the high levels of poverty and unemployment, violence and discrimination have also contributed to the persistence and even the increase in trafficking of women and children and to prostitution in various EU countries."
"This requires an urgent response."
"Unfortunately, the proposals contained in the Europe 2020 strategy presented by the Commission did not deal with the gender perspective in a satisfactory way."
"We therefore hope that this situation will be revisited and that, above all, in developing the Strategy for Equality, the Commissioner will seek to respond to these issues."
"However, this goes beyond a single area of the European Commission, and there needs to be much greater involvement."
"Of the numerous measures outlined in the report, therefore, I would like to emphasise four areas."
"At institutional level, we propose that the new strategy on equality should be an agenda for action and a political commitment, based on the Beijing Platform for Action and the progress that it has made, and acknowledging that the human rights of women and girls are an unalienable, integral and indivisible part of universal human rights."
"We also advocate the Council's adoption of the Commission's new proposal on the Strategy for Equality, having consulted Parliament."
"This seeks to give equality policy greater political force and provide it with new impetus, as well as assigning Union funds to it, with a view to its effective achievement."
"We believe the annual tripartite meeting between the Council, the Commission and Parliament to be vital, as it looks into the progress of the strategy for gender equality in the European Union, along with an annual conference on gender equality involving women's organisations and trade unions in various Member States, and, of course, MEPs and national MPs, paying particular attention to a predetermined theme every year."
"I would also like to draw your attention to the need to include the mainstreaming of the gender perspective during the preparation of all the proposals."
"Finally - I am about to conclude, Mr President - I would like to mention our insistence on the application and implementation of measures that have already been announced, be it the Institute for Equality, the Centre on Violence or the full application of existing directives, so that we can make the emancipation of women and their personal and professional fulfilment the central goal of our initiative and the strategy itself."
"Thank you very much."
"Please be sure to consider the recommendations that we have made here."
"author. - Mr President, the fact that the Commission has chosen to reiterate and strengthen its commitment to making equality between women and men a reality is a welcome development."
"The form chosen is a document entitled a 'Women's Charter' presented on the occasion of International Women's Day."
"This document follows the commitment made to the European Parliament by Commission President Barroso to produce a women's charter, during discussions prior to his election for a second term in office."
"The document is additionally in commemoration of the 15th anniversary of the Platform for Action at the Beijing UN World Conference on Women and the 30th anniversary of the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women."
"In summary, the document fills many roles and all of them important."
"How does the Commission envisage involving the other EU institutions, civil society and other stakeholders in this initiative?"
"A recent Eurobarometer survey on gender equality showed that 62% of Europeans believe that gender inequality still exists in many areas of society."
"How will the Women's Charter tackle this perception of inequality?"
"How can the content of the Women's Charter be translated into measurable goals and clear targets?"
"As is customary, the Commission will continue to work on the basis of a five-year strategy for equality between women and men."
"The current road map covers the period 2006-2010."
"How will the Commission's forthcoming five-year strategy for gender equality be linked to the Women's Charter and how will the stakeholders be involved in this work?"
"Concerning the future, the report clearly shows that our current problems include the need for more data and the fact that gender equality achievements are not assessed properly due to the lack of clear targets."
"If you are determined to obtain results, we need to evaluate the causes of inequality and assess the result of our actions."
"The report is about the assessment of the gender equality road map between 2006 and 2010 but, of course, we have to be more ambitious."
"Lastly, I would just like to mention the European protection order; we cannot wait any longer to give all women victims in Europe the best protection."
"Under the lead of the Spanish Presidency, I urge the Commission and the Council to come to a progressive and effective agreement as soon as possible."
"Mr President, in a perfect world, we would not have needed to have this debate this evening."
"We would live in a society that was equal."
"Well, we do not live in a perfect world and that is why we are having this debate."
"However, it must not stop at a debate."
"Concrete measures are needed to boost women's rights and for our work to promote gender equality."
"A Charter for Women's Rights, a charter that takes a comprehensive approach in all political areas, is something that is sorely needed."
"I think and believe that it is not enough to make statements and to utter fine words about equality."
"It is not enough to implement separate, isolated measures in different areas."
"No, the work on equality issues - the equality strategy, the report tabled by Mrs Figueiredo - needs to take a comprehensive approach, but we also need a comprehensive Charter for Women's Rights."
"In order to draw up such a charter, I believe that we need to make use of the knowledge, skills and experience that are also found outside Parliament."
"In women's organisations, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and civil society in general, there are skills, knowledge and experience that we should utilise when drawing up a comprehensive charter."
"The Commission has the opportunity to start and coordinate a process between the EU institutions, national parliaments, NGOs and others to draw up such a charter."
"I am certain that, with the commitment shown by Mrs Reding to the work to promote equality, we have an opportunity to produce such a charter together with the Commission."
"I should also like to say that we often - ahead of every election to the European Parliament in any case - discuss how we can get more women to take part in parliamentary elections and how we can get more women involved in political decision making in general."
"In this regard, I believe that it is not enough for us to go out and urge women to take part in the elections."
"No, women, and our citizens in general, are more intelligent than that."
"They, of course, look at what we have done to change the reality of their lives and what we have done in Parliament to improve their circumstances and so on."
"That is why we should now use this parliamentary term to show women in the EU and in the world that there is somewhere where we really do make a difference to the reality of life for most women."
"author. - (BG) Today, when we are evaluating the results that have been achieved from the road map for equality between women and men, while, at the same time, outlining future guidelines in this area, we must focus particular attention on the policies exerting a direct or indirect influence on gender equality."
"We expect the European Commission to put forward a policy for women who have become victims of injustice, discrimination, hunger, poverty, human trafficking, as well as of any other forms of violence."
"We must take into account that even though gender equality is an absolute requirement for exercising fully our basic human rights and a fundamental principle of the European Union, inequalities persist in the political sphere and in women's lives."
"This is why it is particularly important for us to work on consolidating gender equality policies which offer an instrument for economic development and social cohesion."
"We must take into account the need for a new, socially sustainable model, which must integrate the full range of skills that women have to offer into the economy, restore the balance in terms of women's and men's responsibilities in public and private life, and guarantee such a work/life balance."
"While examining the report on the road map for equality between women and men, the present oral question is particularly indicative of the European Parliament's attitude to policies for promoting gender equality."
"I think that the Charter for Women's Rights, followed later this year by a strategy on its enforcement, make it necessary for the progress achieved in this area over recent decades to be consolidated and for a stable European policy to be devised on creating a more complete society."
"We expect the Commission to suggest measures to be included in the strategy for gender equality which guarantee specific legislative initiatives for tackling violence against women and legislative and non-legislative instruments for eliminating discrimination on the labour market, wage differentials and pushing women into unskilled work."
"Effective measures are also required to increase the employment rate and social gains for women as part of the Europe 2020 strategy, as well as programmes for encouraging the involvement of women in the green economy, policies promoting greater representation for women in the managerial decision-making process, and lastly, suitable legislative amendments to get more women into management positions."
"It is our common duty to raise awareness about women's rights in Europe."
"I also believe that our united efforts will produce an effective European policy intended to promote gender equality, supported by proper strategies, enforcement measures and specific programmes."
"I wish to draw particular attention to the fact that, against the backdrop of a global economic crisis, the role of women in agriculture is becoming crucial."
"Our joint actions aimed at removing the disparities in employment and getting more women involved in managing commercial companies and in every social sphere, in general, will guarantee positive results."
"Achieving gender equality will have a beneficial impact on productivity and economic growth, offering our societies numerous social and economic benefits."
"We simply lack the ambition, Commissioner."
"We are reluctant to prove the European Parliament's strength."
"We are accountable to our voters."
"They specify gender inequality as the number one unresolved problem in the European Union and we expect support from you so that we can work together on resolving this problem."
"author. - Mr President, it is almost a year since our new European Parliament was elected."
"It is almost half a year since Commissioner Reding was appointed."
"So we have four years left together to really make a difference for women and men."
"How we as a Parliament, and Ms Reding as Commissioner, are judged at the end of those four years will depend on the action that we take and on the support that we can muster in society."
"No one will be impressed by mere words."
"I do not want to have to say in four years' time, 'Look, this is a piece of paper from Ms Reding, and here is a huge stack of Parliament resolutions'."
"I want to be able to say, 'Yes, we have secured two weeks' paternity leave for all European fathers."
"Yes, we have adapted our equality laws to include all terrains, to include transgender people."
"Yes, we have a system in place that ensures gender parity for the next European Commission.'"
"I want to say, 'Yes, the gender pay gap is closing, with more women with decent jobs and decent pay."
"And yes, the gender care gap is closing, with more men who take their share of unpaid care'."
"I hope that all groups in this Parliament are united to deliver two strong reports tomorrow - the Figueiredo and the Romeva i Rueda reports - and I hope that Ms Reding will have the courage to turn these reports into action, even when there is not an easy majority in Council beforehand."
"We cannot do this alone."
"We need to involve those to whom this is important."
"I am not too happy with how the Women's Charter up to now has been drafted, with no involvement of Parliament or of civil society, but I will accept that this is the way that the European Commission has made an opening statement to lay down its commitment to gender equality."
"It is more important what happens next."
"In answer to our questions, I would very much like to hear from Ms Reding how she will draft an ambitious strategy for our coming four years."
"Good evening, Mr President."
"I would like to express my thanks for the opportunity to participate in this debate with the honourable Members this evening."
"On behalf of the current Presidency of the Council, I wish to congratulate you on these reports that you have presented to us this evening."
"There is no doubt that they clearly set out the problems of European women, the problems that we are facing in these difficult times and the challenges that we must tackle as politicians over the next few years."
"I have been working on these matters - these problems that you have highlighted here this afternoon - for the last six months on behalf of the Spanish Presidency of the Council, and for some years before that on behalf of the Commission."
"Indeed, I have dedicated, as I say, part of my work, part of the work of the Spanish Presidency of the Council, to working on the gender perspective of the new growth and employment strategy, the EU 2020 strategy, which will foreseeably be adopted this Thursday, 17 July."
"This is undoubtedly a crucial instrument that is going to mark all of our policies over the next decade."
"In addition to incorporating the gender perspective into this strategy, I have also sought to place the fight against gender violence at the top of the agenda."
"The fact is that this issue, which undoubtedly reflects the cruellest aspect of inequality, remains a serious social problem in all our Member States, as is also acknowledged in the reports that have just been presented."
"Thus, we have adopted some conclusions that advance the goals and instruments of the Commission and the Member States in eradicating violence against women."
"The text that has been adopted commits the 27 Member States, as well as the Commission, to developing common initiatives and instruments to tackle jointly the blot that is violence against women."
"One of these conclusions is the drawing up of a European strategy to prevent and combat gender violence."
"Indeed, the Commission has already started work on this strategy, the primary aim of which must be to acquire information that can be compared on a European scale, to establish common objectives and the resources to meet them, and to take the first steps towards setting up a European watchdog on gender violence."
"Furthermore, as regards violence, you are aware that these conclusions also proposed setting up a free helpline for victims of gender violence, in addition to a series of measures that will serve to strengthen the social protection of women victims."
"We have also asked the Commission to study the legal basis for possible new legislative instruments to enable us to combat these offences more effectively in all our Member States."
"On the other hand, on 7 June last, equality once again became a subject of European debate at the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council, because of the adoption of the employment policy guidelines for Member States."
"As I have just said, they will be brought before the European Council on 17 June."
"These guidelines include equality between men and women as an essential factor, not only in restoring employment in the current climate of economic crisis, but also in putting into practice the new, intelligent, sustainable and integrating growth model for the next decade."
"That is because what must also be sustainable is a social model that has to look after a population that is expected to age considerably over the next 20 years, and the care of this population cannot be allowed to continue to fall exclusively into the voluntary hands of women."
"If one thing has become clear from these preliminary considerations on the reports that you have presented, and from all the discussions we have had during the course of our Presidency, it is that, if we want to rebuild growth on a sound basis, Europe needs to be able to count on the potential, the capacity and the knowledge of all of its citizens, including all of its women."
"In spite of being the majority among those who gain higher-education degrees in the European Union (60%), women do not manage to develop their full potential owing to certain structures in our production systems, which are as unfair as they are inefficient."
"In order to overcome all these inequalities in our labour markets, which represent a genuine obstacle to collective progress, the target of a 75% employment rate by 2020 will have to take both men and women into account."
"It is not merely a question of fairness."
"If we compare the employment rates for men and women in the European Union, it can be seen that 76% of the former have a job, while the percentage of working women stands at 63%."
"Consequently, a special effort will have to be made in this respect over the next few years in order to have a greater number of women join the labour market."
"As we have agreed, this increase of women on the labour market will also have to be brought about, as Mr Romeva i Rueda pointed out, by taking action on the pay gap, which last year reached an average of practically 18% in the European Union."
"Other questions concerning gender equality, which will form part of this EU 2020 strategy, must also be highlighted, such as overcoming gender stereotypes in education, as well as in vocational and academic guidance."
"We know that such stereotypes are currently leading to a segregated labour market, as well as the need to seek a balance between work and private life."
"As far as social inclusion and the fight against poverty is concerned, a topic of tremendous importance, Mrs Figueiredo, we have also paid special attention to the case of women, given that they run a greater risk of poverty than men as a result of receiving lower wages and pensions and as a result of assuming responsibility, on their own, for unpaid care work."
"We are also greatly pleased with having reached an agreement with Parliament concerning the proposal for a directive on equal treatment for self-employed men and women."
"This agreement will make it possible to adopt this directive at a forthcoming Council meeting."
"It is a directive that will acknowledge new rights for self-employed women and their collaborating spouses or partners."
"As I have said, we have held several meetings at which we have discussed options and proposals about the problems that we are debating here today."
"Finally, and no doubt Commissioner Reding will refer to this, we have also discussed the future 2011-2015 strategy for gender equality, a subject that will doubtlessly give rise to intense debate in this House over the coming months and for which the Commission will present a road map in the next few months."
"I am convinced, and with this I will conclude, Mr President, that the debate on the crisis and economic recovery must not make us stray from strengthening our European social model."
"That would be a mistake."
"It would be a great mistake at this moment in time, and that is why I believe that it is important to keep alive these debates and policies on equality, which, over so many years, have enabled us not only to grow, but to grow and maintain an enviable and impeccable social cohesion model."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I was very impressed by the work which has been done by your rapporteurs."
"I was also very impressed by the way the different political groups are going in the same direction, with small differences."
"These are not important as the road and the destination is the same and that is very important."
"Thank you also for underlining - all of those who have spoken, the rapporteurs and also the authors of the oral question - that we do not need any other papers, we need action."
"I agree with you because, actually, we know what we want and we know why we want it."
"We know that the only way for our society to advance is to have gender equality, not only in women's affairs but horizontally."
"That was exactly the reason why, for the first time in its history, the Commission started its five-year mandate with an opening statement, as it has been called, with a Charter which is a political commitment of each member of the Commission to advance equality between men and women within his or her portfolio and thus, a commitment by the Commission as a whole to have gender equality high on the agenda."
"That is one thing."
"The second thing is: how do we get the action?"
"How do we put the flesh on the bones of this Women's Charter which the Commission pledged itself to in March?"
"Here we come to the implementation."
"Firstly, I have asked all my fellow Commissioners to provide an input into the strategy, so it will not only be the Commissioner speaking to you now who is responsible for gender equality, but it will also be the other 26 Commissioners who will put on the table their contributions in their specific departments and responsibilities."
"This is very important because it has never happened before, and I believe that it is in the spirit of what all the political groups have presented here."
"How did we come up with these ideas?"
"The five priorities in the Charter have not appeared out of the blue."
"They reflect the result of the broad stakeholder consultation we conducted in 2009 in preparation for the new strategy."
"I will come back to the strategy later on."
"Let me first speak about the very important reports that have been presented by the European Parliament."
"First, Mr Romeva i Rueda's report."
"It is line with the Commission's position on how the crisis affects women and how responses to it should take into account the impact on women."
"I have already drawn attention to this issue in the latest annual report on equality between women and men, underlining that this crisis affects women more than the previous recessions did because women now participate more in paid employment and are often at the weak end of the job chain."
"At the beginning of the crisis, we saw that male unemployment was rising very strongly, mostly because of the problems in construction and in industry."
"Now we see that the unemployment of men and women is rising at the same level and the risk is that due to public budget costs and - hopefully not too much, but also - cuts in spending on gender equality, this will certainly have an impact on women's employment."
"So it is very important that we are aware of this and that we have to put measures forward."
"That is why I am firmly supporting efforts to incorporate gender equality considerations into recovery measures."
"I believe that the crisis is a unique opportunity to implement the policies which will make the labour market and our society more gender-equal in the future."
"It has been already said very clearly by the Presidency that the employment rate of 75%, which is our goal, cannot be obtained if we do not have women participating."
"Turning to the gender perspectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, in the three main elements of this, nothing can be obtained without women."
"Women make up 60% of university graduates and we do not 'utilise' them in the labour market but, if we are going for the smart growth, the green economy where we need the minds and where we cannot leave those very well trained intellectual women aside, we will never reach our goals without women."
"That is why I believe that women need to be helped in order for the 2020 strategy to have a positive result."
"The targets cannot be reached if we do not significantly improve the inclusion of women in the labour market."
"That is why I think it is very good that the European Parliament has constantly underlined the strong gender dimension of the strategy - rightly so because we really need to ensure that women contribute to the strategy and also reap the benefits of the strategy."
"Our gender equality strategy, which I will present in the autumn of this year, will contain many very concrete elements - not for the next few months but for the next years."
"We will have to have a real road map regarding how we want to implement the very concrete elements between 2010 and the end of our mandate - your mandate as European parliamentarians and my mandate as European Commissioner."
"The strategy will therefore aim to improve governance and policy dialogue and will be implemented in close cooperation with the main partners at European level."
"Something which was said in this Chamber, and which is absolutely right, is that we could write a gender equality strategy now, but they must be put into practice in the Member States."
"We see how all the instruments of the stakeholders which have been constructed over the years - since the Beijing Platform - are functioning well."
"In times of crisis, we have to see that they continue to function well and that nobody will try to eliminate them."
"I count on Parliament to help."
"If something like this occurred to a government, I am sure that we would at once speak up in this House."
"So this cooperation on which the ideas of the future strategy have been built - as I said at the beginning, it was the stakeholders who came in on the public consultation on this - has to be brought to a fruitful dialogue and what you call for - a regular dialogue."
"I therefore underline the report on the new strategy drafted by Mrs Figueiredo."
"I think your idea, rapporteur, of an annual tripartite meeting between Parliament, Council and Commission to review what we have done in the course of the action is an excellent one."
"I think it will be very good to take it up because it will give everybody an incentive - the Commission, Council and also Parliament - to do more to help."
"Such a gender equality dialogue could be based on the annual report on gender equality drafted by the European Commission."
"I think that could be a very active and concrete way to proceed."
"I also count on the Member States to support the Commission's action in the area of gender equality, first by endorsing the new strategy, of course, after having heard what Parliament has to say about the proposals I will put on the table at the end of September, and also by renewing the EU Pact for Gender Equality."
"In summary, there are three areas in which I want EU action to be very effective and very tangible, although when I speak of three areas, that does not mean that they are the only three areas, but I think we could perhaps make out of those three areas our main goals."
"First, we will have to take decisive action to tackle violence against women and ensure effective protection of victims."
"Our common judicial area must be an area where victims feel treated with dignity, respect and a high standard of protection and support, not only in one domain but in many domains."
"I have made it a priority to ensure that in the first half of 2011, the Commission presents a comprehensive package in that respect."
"I know that the Belgian Presidency wants to take stock of what has already been done, what is in the pipeline and what needs to be done in an important conference which will take place some time in November."
"There will be a progression from the preparatory work done under the Spanish Presidency, the stocktaking and the preparation for complementary actions in the autumn, and then a comprehensive package at the beginning of 2011."
"I would like to reconfirm what I said during my hearing and what has been clearly said also in the Commission's Charter: the Commission will use all possible instruments, including criminal law if needed, to eradicate female genital mutilation."
"We believe that this is a brutal practice which can, under no circumstances and with no excuses, continue to be a reality in Europe."
"I will also be preparing a legal instrument to enhance the participation of women in decision making."
"You are right: women are, except in university studies, severely under-represented in decision-making positions at all levels, both in public and in private companies."
"Europe will have to act to close that gap as much as possible."
"I know that I have not spoken about all the other elements, such as the various kinds of leave we might add to maternity leave, the targets on child care facilities, the pay gap and the options we have in order to introduce more transparency on these problems."
"The labels, the charters, the award and so on are all going to be on the agenda; all of this will be on the table at the end of September."
"Regarding those concrete actions, you should then really come in and say that this is nonsense, this is not strong enough and say what you think we need on them."
"We are working on this together with my collaborators."
"We have heard the input of all the stakeholders."
"We have seen the input of your reports, of your resolutions and we have got the input from the Ministers who have been meeting in a very important conference during the Spanish Presidency."
"Altogether, I think we will manage so that you will say, four years from now, 'Yes, we have done it'."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, despite the achievements of the EU gender equality policies in the last half century, which we have talked about today, there is still a lot to accomplish, as many speakers have said."
"The ambitious goals of the 2006 and 2010 EU road map - and many of the MEPs were here at the time when we were talking to the Commission about the older road map - where we called for economic independence, reconciliation of private life and professional life, equal representation, eradication of violence, elimination of stereotypes and the promotion of gender equality in external policies, need to be further pursued."
"We can all see this."
"In fulfilling the aims of the old road map and defining the objectives of the new road map, to which this debate and all the reports should have pointed, we see that the Commission needs to introduce specific measures in order to assure the strength of the existing road map, and also to learn from its weaknesses and to overcome these weaknesses."
"My main concern is the visibility, the visible influence that we can have on national and regional level instruments achieving gender equality in the field."
"Although, as Mr Romeva i Rueda said, it is still difficult to assess the financial crisis, it is absolutely clear to all of us that this period has had particularly serious consequences for women."
"It is therefore very much the case, and should be highlighted endlessly, that inadequate investment in economic and social opportunities for women completely limits economic growth and slows down the reduction of poverty and social disparities in our Europe."
"Beside this, what was missing from the old road map - actually it was talked about but not much was done - is combating multiple discrimination, since compound discrimination based on age, disability, ethnic or racial background, religion or national origin and social economic status creates multiple barriers to women's empowerment and social advancement."
"This is something we do not talk about very much."
"Just as rarely do we talk about the importance of collecting, processing and publishing disaggregated data."
"Finally, primarily tools ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Martínez Lozano, in a recent article published in Time, entitled The New Sheriffs of Wall Street, it states that in the US, women do not run Wall Street, nor are they to blame for this financial crisis, but that, in the face of the situation brought about through the lack of regulation of financial market, it is they who are now being called upon and appointed to positions of leadership in order to clean up the mess caused by their male managers."
"This is interesting."
"The men caused the crisis and the women will have to resolve it."
"Putting irony aside, the global economy is facing the worst recession since the Great Depression."
"It has had social repercussions throughout the European Union and the worst effects of it have fallen on women, as they are subject to greater job insecurity, more prone to dismissal and less likely to be covered by social security systems."
"In this context, there are well-founded fears that many Member States might reduce funding for the social sector, once again affecting predominantly women."
"It is not fair that the most vulnerable are those who have to pay for the mistakes of the speculators."
"I would like to conclude by congratulating the Spanish Presidency for giving priority to combating gender-based violence."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, first of all, on behalf of my group, I would like to thank both rapporteurs and tell them that my group will wholeheartedly endorse both reports because they deal with a very important issue, gender equality, the importance of which I think is also demonstrated by the rich choice of subjects covered by both reports."
"But, colleagues, I have to say that I am a little bit frustrated because, if we claim that we want action, that we want to achieve something in the next four years, that this is an issue of the highest priority, that half the population is being discriminated against and half the potential remains unused, then how come we are having this debate in the last evening slot?"
"Where are the group leaders?"
"Why do we accept that this is not the highest priority?"
"I suggest, colleagues, that we insist that, next time, this issue should be included in the agenda as a key debate and unless they grant us that, we could chain ourselves to the door."
"I do not think we should accept this any more."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, tonight's debate looks at ways to improve a woman's lot; sometimes by positive discrimination such as quotas, sometimes by direct legislation on gender equality."
"I support references strengthening cooperation between Member States in addressing wage discrimination for equal jobs and action protecting women and men against all forms of violence, including human trafficking and female genital mutilation, but we also need to see strong steps towards empowerment of women through increasing confidence in their abilities, through education and through moves to create an environment which encourages choice."
"Someone who once lived under the cloud of discrimination said: I have a dream."
"Well, I too have a dream."
"I look to the day that we will work, not only for greater equality in the workplace, but to empower women to make a free choice and to feel strong enough to achieve their goals."
"That would be the true road map for women."
"However, we must take small steps."
"We all agree on the principle of equality and I would say it is our basic right, but why include issues which muddy the water?"
"The dossiers are complex and the inclusion of issues which are Member State competences, such as public expenditure in the area of health, does not help matters."
"There are red lines in the road."
"I am sorry to say that, if we are to achieve equality, we must ensure the road is clear of distractions for it is only on a clear road that we can march forward united."
"Mr President, I should like to point out that a great deal of words have been heard, but that we have heard little about the 'wherefore'."
"In this sense, I consider that the two reports are, at best, wish lists, especially the report which refers to the impact of the crisis."
"I say that because, unfortunately, they do not address the problems which this unacceptable situation has caused for women."
"In my opinion, if today, in Greece, the retirement age is increased from between 5 to 17 years for women, that is due both to the capitalist system and to the 2020 strategy, which is not being contested."
"I fail to see how the Commissioner can speak of different equality measures for women when she does not contest this strategy."
"Whatever measure you take, Commissioner, you cannot overturn the 2020 strategy, because you have hardly even contested it."
"For that reason, we consider that the solution to the problem can only be found through the fight by women, through the fight by all the workers against the consequences of the crisis, through the fight to overturn capitalism."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will focus on two issues that are of great interest to me: the economic and financial crisis and the ensuing recession."
"They should not, under any circumstances, be used as arguments for dismantling the progress we have achieved so far with regard to gender equality."
"In the medium term, this might further harm economic growth."
"The pay gap between men and women remains and, I am afraid, this is still the case throughout the whole of Europe."
"Taking the European average, the income gap sets men and women 17.8% apart."
"In this regard however, there are, unfortunately, also some negative anomalies, like Austria, my home country."
"The current Report on Women by the Austrian Federal Government shows that women earn a mere 58.4% of the gross wage of men."
"Only in two countries is this income gap even wider."
"It has to be our general aim to break this glass ceiling and it should finally become a thing of the past."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe it is important and only right that we speak about the report by Mrs Figueiredo."
"It is a report that was discussed at length within the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, of which I am Vice-Chair, both when the compromise amendments were tabled and when the many suggestions were provided by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the report presents some areas of major concern, which have not been addressed and resolved in the right and proper way."
"Ethical and cultural issues that are of fundamental importance for the majority of the society that we represent are not being taken into account."
"Above all, the report still does not focus on the assessment of the results of the 2006-2010 road map, even though we are now nearing the end of the four-year plan and it is important for the European Parliament to be able to express its view on the matter."
"Therefore, I cannot hide my misgivings about this report."
"(ES) Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Romeva i Rueda and Mrs Figueiredo for the work they have done on the reports on gender aspects of the economic downturn and on the road map for equality."
"This Parliament is very clear that gender equality policies must be mainstreamed, given we are talking about an important asset that represents 52% of the European population."
"Our strategy must include aspects such as conciliation, equal representation, the elimination of stereotypes and the eradication of all forms of gender violence."
"I would like to take the opportunity in this speech to ask Commissioner Reding to deliver, by heeding the repeated demand of this House, of a large number of Member States and of the European Women's Lobby, which today launched a campaign to support the victim protection order."
"This is no time for getting caught up in procedural questions that will put this initiative on hold."
"It is a time for dialogue and understanding."
"We have over a hundred thousand reasons for acting now, without delay; all we need is the political will."
"(ET) In the last five years, we have indeed achieved the success referred to in the area of women's and men's economic independence, with the employment rate among women reaching almost 60%."
"At the same time, however, there have been no improvements with regard to closing the gap between women's and men's pay."
"According to data from 2007, women got on average 17% less pay than men."
"In my country, Estonia, this gap was over 30%."
"2007 was a year of economic growth."
"What kind of figures will we be able to see shortly, when the next analysis is due?"
"In every country, league tables of successful companies are produced; the country's richest people are made visible, and they are applauded."
"As a rule, though, 99% of them are men."
"When thinking now about the gap between women's and men's pay, it becomes clear that in these people's profits and dividends, women..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(HU) I am very pleased about today's debate on women's rights and I also welcome these excellent reports."
"However, I am not particularly thrilled about the fact that the majority of women, at least in Hungary, my home country, are not aware of their rights and cannot enforce them."
"This is the situation which calls for urgent measures."
"One of the reasons behind their inability to enforce their rights is the fact that they cannot afford a solicitor."
"What solutions do I have in mind?"
"We need specially trained solicitors, a free legal aid service and a website with answers to the everyday legal problems women encounter."
"What legal problems are these?"
"For instance, a woman who has not received child maintenance payments for months needs information on what to do, whom to contact for help."
"A woman who is physically abused by her husband, who calls the police only to be told that this is a family affair and they cannot intervene, needs to find out if the officers are right or if she can find help, and from whom."
"A woman who has three children and is rejected for the twentieth time at a job interview for made-up reasons should be able to find out if she has a chance for legal redress."
"A woman who is fired as soon as her employer discovers that she is pregnant needs to find out if she can turn to someone."
"In these and similar cases, there should..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, the Charter for Women's Rights, which is the subject of the debate, refers to the acts of the United Nations."
"The victims of this procedure are the national governments, which alone are responsible for implementing their decisions taken on the basis of national needs."
"To refer to the United Nations is an effective means of diluting the authority of the national institutions."
"We do not need a charter while existing legal instruments have not been implemented."
"However, as a result of collective ignorance, we women prefer to be presented with a new declaration than to fight to implement legally binding instruments."
"This charter is contributing to a paradoxical development in the European Union."
"We are already in the habit of regulating morality."
"Now, social engineering is generating an unusual paradox in the Union."
"We are privatising state economies on the pretext of free competition, but we are nationalising relations between men and women."
"The Union is copying the bad experiences we lived through in Central and Eastern Europe."
"It is a pity that social engineering does not take account of historical experiences in order to avoid a new defeat, the first victims of which will be women."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the report by Mr Romeva i Rueda, which highlights an aspect of the crisis which is too often forgotten, that of the repercussions on women."
"Right at the start of this crisis, we in the European Parliament were among the first to sound the alarm of the damaging consequences that the crisis might have on women unless adequate measures were taken."
"We also pointed out that this crisis represented a chance to make the European Union a society that takes greater account of equality between men and women if adequate policies and measures were adopted."
"We must believe that our advice was ignored, given that the various austerity plans do not provide a differentiated response to the crisis."
"The first to be hit by the crisis were manufacturers and the building industry, which are primarily sectors of male activity."
"Since then, most sectors have been affected and the first victims are at the bottom of the socio-economic pyramid, where women are in the majority."
"We therefore urgently need to take account of this problem and to conjugate the various austerity plans adopted by the European Union and its Member States in the feminine too."
"I do not want to see us go back thirty years."
"The very independence of women is at stake."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the last few days, the European Union, partly in a bid to combat the economic crisis, has forced my country, Italy, to comply with the obligation for women employed in the public sector to retire at the age of 65, thereby making their retirement age equal to that of men."
"I believe that we should welcome these provisions, which are all about equal responsibilities, but I also believe that women feel that they have other priorities: combating unemployment and job insecurity, and eliminating the unacceptable pay gap."
"Then there is the major problem of insufficient services."
"To take just one example, it is very difficult to talk about equality when there are so few child care facilities."
"It is even difficult to find or keep a job."
"I am sure that the European Commission will demonstrate ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(CS) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is undoubtedly a gender aspect to the economic slowdown and the financial crisis."
"There is a risk that the inequalities we are wrestling with will grow deeper."
"Pay differences, pressure on labour law, maternity-related social protection and conditions on the labour market are just a few examples."
"The crisis-related budget cuts in various States are an unavoidable reality."
"They affect mainly public services and the availability of these services."
"Cost-cutting measures do not greatly affect most of the powerful departments of state."
"Savings therefore focus on those areas where the least resistance is expected from the parties affected by the cuts, relying on the fact that people will cope, because there is simply no alternative."
"Caring for children and elderly parents remains a duty under all circumstances."
"It is overwhelmingly women who have to take on this role."
"Reductions in funding for social services, which mainly employ women, also come top of the list of cost-cutting measures."
"It is the responsibility of individual governments also to look at the matter from this perspective when planning cost-cutting budget measures and their impacts, and to select a carefully balanced approach when placing burdens on the population at large."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by saying that in our opinion, the report on the assessment of the results of the 2006-2010 Roadmap for Equality between men and women, which is aimed at influencing the strategy on this issue in future, could have been more assertive and less polemic."
"Indeed, the way in which several ethically sensitive issues were approached, particularly the issue of female sexual and reproductive health, should have been different if the goal were really to achieve the greatest possible consensus."
"That said, I would like to stress that in times of 'normal' economic growth, there is a great deal of concern over women's rights, especially over the disparity between the respective situations of men and women at work, in society and in family life, but those problems are profoundly exacerbated by an economic and social crisis like the one we are experiencing at present."
"That is why there needs to be stronger strategic commitment from the Member States at the level of local and regional authorities and Community institutions in matters regarding the protection ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(RO) The gender aspects of the economic crisis, the road map for gender equality and the Charter for Women's Rights are three topics with a common denominator: the status of women in society."
"If we really want to improve the status of women in society, we need specific policies and measures like those also presented by the Charter of Women's Rights as proposed under the S&D manifesto."
"If we really need women to be better represented in the decision-making structures in both the public and private sectors, introducing gender equality in Europe's institutions is an absolute must."
"I believe that the European Parliament and the European Commission must set an example in this respect in 2014, through making a commitment and showing strong political will."
"Mr President, I think it is disappointing that in the year 2010, we are still talking about women's rights, notwithstanding the great progress made by the European Union, especially in trying to get equal pay for equal work."
"I also want to highlight the lack of women's rights particularly in the third world."
"I worked as a volunteer in Malawi for a few months and I was appalled at the treatment of women there."
"Firstly, they did most of the hard work in the fields while the men loafed around the place, and secondly, the sexual entitlements of some of those men, especially a guy known as 'The Hyena', were absolutely abhorrent."
"I think it is time that the European Union made development aid to these countries conditional on eliminating some of these appalling practices."
"The NGOs could highlight it too a bit more than they are doing."
"I look forward to a women's rights charter here in Europe which can hopefully become a model to be implemented right throughout the world."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteurs - whom I thank - have raised a key issue, which Commissioner Reding has also addressed in part."
"We must ensure that policies for women and for equal opportunities are incorporated and integrated more effectively into general policies at European and national level alike."
"I am thinking of the crisis, poverty, development, cooperation, employment and welfare."
"I believe, however, that there are three issues that should be emphasised by the Commission, by us in our work and by the Member States."
"Firstly, I would like Commissioner Reding to emphasise the role of women in the European Union's external action."
"A new policy of which women must be made more aware is contained in Mrs Figueiredo's report."
"The second issue is that of the Commission's support for the draft directive on the European Protection Order, which is a tool of fundamental importance for guaranteeing the ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(DE) Mr President, in recent years and decades, the European Union has been at the vanguard of equal treatment of women and men."
"We need to expand Europe's vanguard role."
"In the Women's Charter presented by the Commission, I see an indispensable contribution towards equality between women and men in the European Union."
"However, the efforts made towards strengthening a woman's role in the economy, equal pay and increasing the appointment of women to decision-making posts must not just remain empty words."
"We must back them up with action."
"Above all, we need to make greater efforts to convince male decision makers of our concerns."
"Women's issues are society's issues and concern everyone."
"However, we must put a stop to the discrimination of women, both within and outside our society, and we must take decisive action on this front."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, the reason why I have asked to speak is that I expect you, Commissioner, to be able to set out for us a proper track record at the end of this parliamentary term."
"Your announcement today that you plan to introduce EU requirements for mandatory women quotas in corporate boardrooms is already quite promising."
"Your announcement makes sense, it is fair and well overdue and promises, above all, economic success."
"On this account, I sincerely hope that you will follow up your words with action."
"I personally have, time and again, tried to table amendments when it comes to financial market regulation, the issue of business ethics and employment policy guidelines."
"I am already looking ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the financial crisis, which has become an economic and, finally, a social crisis, has had disastrous consequences on the positive developments that had been made to date in the field of equality between men and women."
"Whether we are talking about unemployment rates or wage gaps, it is clear that women are suffering more from the consequences of the crisis, because they are often in a far more vulnerable position than men."
"That is why it is important for us to set clear short-, medium- and long-term objectives, for us to put specific measures in place which attack urgent problems and for us to provide real resources for our actions and ambitions."
"Certainly, the Member States have a great deal to do at their level in terms of collective awareness raising and exchanges of best practices."
"However, it is just as certain that it is our responsibility, here in the European Parliament, not to allow texts to be adopted which are totally bereft of substance and which contain no innovations whatsoever."
"On the contrary, we must ensure that they include appropriate and specific solutions."
"Simplicity, efficacy, innovation, that is ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(SK) The submitted report is highly detailed and of a very high quality, which must be applauded."
"I would like to focus on certain specific points which are typical of post-communist countries in particular, because state support was provided in these countries particularly to sectors of a masculine nature, or sectors which are male domains, especially the car industry, which is export-oriented and is mainly a male domain."
"In contrast to this, for example, sectors where most of the workers were women were not supported in that way by governments."
"It should also be emphasised that the post-communist countries are of a persistently semi-industrial nature, and it is therefore very difficult to find an opportunity to support precisely those sectors where most of the employees are women."
"We are also anticipating very heavy cuts for the social area in particular in post-communist countries, and it will be women that are most affected by this."
"It is therefore also necessary to focus on this element, and to look for a solution in this area."
"(DE) Mr President, we all see eye to eye on this issue and I believe that that is beyond doubt in every respect."
"However, I would like to make a proposal as to how we might perhaps speed things up a little and make progress."
"We should make sure that we always include and take into account the equality issue in all reports that we discuss here in Parliament."
"I am sure there are many dossiers, perhaps not all but certainly quite a few, with the scope to include equality concerns."
"This may enable us to achieve more rapid progress from the inside."
"This would also be model behaviour emanating from the European Parliament."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I could comment on many of the issues we have debated but, with regard to the crisis, I would like to say that we should focus on making sure that the burden of this crisis is not carried on the backs of women."
"When we talk about consolidation in all national parliaments, including in this House, then this consolidation should not be at the expense of the socially vulnerable, nor at the expense of women in general."
"If we now start cutting corners to the detriment of social services, education and training and, above all, child care, then that will have implications for the future and for the livelihoods of women."
"In other words, the concern I am trying to put across to you is that, in the Europe 2020 strategy, we should emphatically re-introduce the issue of gender mainstreaming and make sure that gender budgeting becomes a matter of course in the future, because only then will we be able to ensure that we can implement in Europe everything that we are wishing and calling for today, in the future as well."
"Mr President, a lot of interesting things have been said here this evening."
"I would like to congratulate you on your contributions and on these ideas, which, without a doubt, also have a lot to do with proposals to emerge from the crisis."
"Commissioner Reding said that we already have a lot of documents and that the time has now come to take action, something with which I fully agree."
"I think this is what civil society has been asking governments to do since 1995: that we begin to take action."
"Taking action means continuing to work towards real equality, and doing so, as Mr Romeva i Rueda said, with imagination and political will."
"True equality means improving the life of women, making their daily lives better, making men and women live better lives from day to day."
"Seeing the crisis as an opportunity is something that has been repeated a lot this evening."
"I agree with this statement."
"I agree that the crisis also affords us opportunities."
"For some, it is already proving to be an opportunity, but we must not overlook the fact that there are also risks and backward steps."
"As far as the equality issue is concerned, there have always been forward and backward steps, something that we women know only too well."
"There have never been forward steps that were not accompanied by backward ones."
"For that very reason, in order to prevent such backward steps, I believe that it is important that we do not abandon European consensus, that we do not lose sight of the road map that has enabled us to make so much progress together over recent years."
"Nor should we, the Member States, stray from the road map."
"As the Commissioner so rightly said, it is very important that we always remain true to the Commission's recommendations."
"I am finishing; I will not go on much longer."
"I believe that we cannot leave the marks of our identity or the coherence of our policies behind; those same policies have enabled us to show our better side to the whole world."
"I agree with Mrs Figueiredo that in the future, in order to work along this line, we have to strengthen coordination with the Council, coordination with the Commission, and coordination with the European Parliament, and, of course, we always have to keep an eye on civil society's demands."
"I would like to congratulate the House on the debate and the reports that have been presented to it this evening."
"The Spanish Presidency of the Council has 15 days left before it hands over to the Belgian Presidency."
"We have endeavoured not to let the issue of equality be overlooked at such a politically complicated and complex time as the time we are dealing with at present."
"It goes without saying that we in the Spanish Government shall continue to work on placing equality at the top of the European Union agenda."
"Mr President, you have been so kind and generous throughout the evening, allowing the members who wanted to do so to speak and I would not want you to have to demonstrate severity by cutting me off at the end of my speech."
"That is why I shall not repeat what has already been said."
"I should just like to say to all the speakers that I have taken due note of their proposals and suggestions."
"I have taken note above all of two recurring concerns: the first is the effects of the crisis on women and the second our need for concrete action."
"I shall share these concerns with the college of Commissioners and shall present you with an action programme at the end of September."
"Our strategy will be an action programme that the three institutions, together with the social partners, with the stakeholders, by which I mean women's associations and the bodies working for equal opportunities in the Member States, will put into practice during the four years of their respective mandates."
"Thank you for your collaboration, thank you to all the women for their enthusiasm, and thank you especially to the few men holding their own in the midst of all these women."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by referring to that feeling of frustration mentioned by my fellow Member Mrs in 't Veld, which is evidently felt by all of us."
"However, it is also obvious, as we have seen, that this is, at least for us, an essential, important and crucial issue."
"That is how we experience it, and will continue to pursue it until some chairs of political groups, be they male or female, understand that this must be regarded as a priority issue, and not simply an end-of-the-evening debate."
"The second question I feel it important to underline has been expressed in several different ways by fellow Members, namely that equality is not a mere whim or a superfluous expense, but rather an investment."
"In addition to being a necessary investment, it is also a right."
"This is something that we need to bear in mind when debating questions of this nature. We have to understand that, when faced with a crisis situation like the one we are currently going through, investing and devoting effort, time, political will and money to equality is something that demands not only all our ingenuity, but also, clearly, all our political will and our closest attention."
"The third question I wish to address very briefly as well is my belief that it is important to underline the fact that, in order for us to achieve the 75% employment target by 2020, not only for men, but for women as well, it is important to understand that this means adopting active measures to promote and encourage women to play a larger role in the public sphere, and also measures to encourage and oblige men to play a larger role in the private sphere."
"Achieving one without the other is impossible."
"It is important that we understand in our policies that they are two sides of the same coin."
"If not, we are clearly going to oblige women, once again, to do those two extra days' work."
"The fourth and last question I also feel to be of importance is to take care not to use the crisis to make cutbacks where it is least necessary to do so."
"We know that it is precisely in the Spanish Ministry of Equality where we currently have the lowest budgets."
"The threat of cutbacks there would imply that this is not a priority area."
"That would be a serious mistake and I believe it important that the rest of the European Union Member States not only understand the importance of such a ministry, but even copy it as a model for their own countries."
"Mr President, I would also like to stress that, although this debate is being held at night, it has seen a significant level of participation from MEPs, which is unusual for a debate at this hour."
"Such participation, in spite of the unfavourable conditions in which the debate is taking place, makes this a victory in the fight for women's rights and equality."
"Secondly, I would also like to say that the speeches that have been heard today generally point out concrete actions and ideas which we must now put into practice."
"All of those here can rise to this challenge and put them into practice."
"Lastly, I believe that this strengthening of political will to put the proposals, words and promises into practice is something that I would like to be preserved as a very positive aspect of tonight's debate."
"This increased political will, whether in all the policies of the EU and the Member States, or in specific actions to give greater visibility to women so that equality is achieved along with social progress, makes this a key contribution, and we hope that four years from now - as the Commissioner has said - we can achieve a positive balance out of the work that we have carried out, with Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"I would therefore like to conclude by saying that with this increased political will and attention to women's dreams and aspirations, we can make an important contribution to their emancipation and to making their dreams come true."
"This must take the form of personal and professional fulfilment, through consideration of each of their lives, with work, jobs with rights, participation in social life, and, where applicable, in economic and political life, and with greater fulfilment within their families."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"EU ministers for social affairs have acknowledged that 120 million European citizens live below the poverty line."
"Compared to the statistics dating from before the economic crisis was unleashed, we are facing in the EU a 50% rise in the number of poor in just two years."
"The recession has exacerbated a steady trend during the last decade: the number of women affected by poverty is much higher than that for men."
"Unemployment, working in unsafe conditions, pension levels lower than the minimum subsistence income and difficulties in accessing decent public services are some of the main causes of the state of poverty whose nature justifies us talking about the feminisation of poverty in Europe."
"Unfortunately, numerous right-wing governments have abandoned their policies combating the gender gap, under the pretext of the recession."
"The budgets for care services and leave provision have been particularly hard hit, which has serious, adverse repercussions, including on children."
"As we reach the halfway point in the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, the assessment is negative."
"In fact, the future looks gloomy when there is little time devoted, both at government level in many Member States and at European institution level, to the concern for, and the desire to improve, the lives of those hardest hit among our fellow human beings."
"Eliminating any form of discrimination in every sphere of social and economic life is a vital prerequisite for protecting human rights and the welfare of every citizen."
"The promotion of the principle of equal opportunities for men and women, along with ensuring greater involvement by women in economic and social life, as participants enjoying full rights, must be constant issues of concern."
"I believe that this approach must be reflected in the common agricultural policy in order to ensure that the sexes are represented fairly and equally."
"On the other hand, this approach may ensure the effectiveness of implementing various policies at European level."
"I believe that gender equality in the economy is extremely important for rural development and that the measures being implemented as part of Pillar 2 on this issue must also be retained in the future CAP."
"Bearing in mind that the principle of gender equality is promoted by European legislation and is a fundamental requirement of the Europe 2020 strategy, we consider it appropriate to include this issue in the future CAP, which also means through using new instruments which will promote this principle."
"The principle of gender equality is not being pursued effectively."
"According to Spanish Member Mrs Valenciano, cows are better protected in the EU than women."
"We suffer discrimination in every area of life."
"We earn 18% less than men, we are more often unemployed and we are underrepresented in politics, public life and business."
"Most lamentable of all is the fact that women cannot benefit fully even from fundamental rights."
"In relation to women, the right to life and personal integrity, as well as reproductive rights, are violated significantly more often."
"For example, in Poland, the restriction of human rights is tolerated in relation to women."
"In 1997, the President of the Constitutional Tribunal, in justifying rejection of liberalisation of the right to abortion, considered it obvious that a pregnant woman must be deprived of some of her civil rights."
"Not only did this not end his career, but it strengthened his position as a 'moral authority'."
"The gender question must find significant reflection in the Union budget."
"The economic crisis must not be the cause of restrictions on measures for equality between men and women."
"Only a consistent, long-term political strategy can bring results."
"Just promoting equal treatment of the sexes and passing anti-discrimination laws is not enough."
"Legislation does not automatically generate equality."
"What is needed is work from the bottom up, building the social awareness and solidarity of women."
"Improving the situation of women requires a fight against stereotypes and discriminatory practices and the elimination of male chauvinists from public life."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation of women in the labour market before the crisis was not satisfactory."
"However, it was improving, despite difficult and perpetually unsolved problems such as differences in pay for the same work and under representation in managerial positions in business."
"These positive trends should not be left out of the discussion."
"A report from the Commission shows that since 1995, the contribution of women to economic growth in the EU has increased by a quarter, and that the female employment rate increased by 7.1% over the last decade and reached 59.1%."
"As a result of the crisis, unemployment is rising faster among women than among men."
"Women are employed, principally, in the public sector, so they are directly at risk from redundancies made due to cost-cutting policies."
"The anti-crisis mechanisms which are being applied are aimed at a quick return to employment mainly of people who lost their jobs as a direct result of the crisis, which ignores, for the time being, people who are permanently out of work."
"Forced by personal circumstances, women currently are more often taking work in part-time jobs which offer little job security."
"Aware of all these dangers, let us try to apply horizontal solutions in order to maintain the level of employment from before the crisis and not allow a downward trend."
"Joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme (BONUS-169) (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Ek, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on the participation of the Community in a Joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme (BONUS-169) undertaken by several Member States - C7-0263/2009 -."
"Mr President, in 150 years, the Baltic Sea has gone from an untouched, clear, oligotrophic Arctic sea to one in a constant state of crisis."
"The problems of eutrophication, algal blooms, toxic waste and threatened biodiversity are growing ever greater."
"The situation in the Baltic Sea is very serious."
"Despite successful attempts in the 1990s and 2000s to reduce the input of nitrogen and phosphorus, almost the whole of the Baltic Sea is currently suffering the effects of eutrophication."
"Similarly, the levels of environmental toxins and heavy metals are high, despite success in reducing the discharge of lead, mercury and DDT, for example."
"I do not know whether any of you have seen the algal bloom in this large, previously healthy, inland sea."
"If you go out in a boat in the wonderful archipelago in summer, you are met by a decimetre-thick green, foul-smelling layer of algae."
"If dogs drink the water they die, and if children bathe in it they vomit and suffer an upset stomach."
"That is the situation in many places around the Baltic Sea today."
"In order to safeguard growth and enable our rural communities to thrive in the future too, it is vital that we increase our knowledge of the impact on the Baltic Sea."
"The ecosystem of the Baltic Sea area is complex and impossible to understand without cooperation between researchers across borders throughout the whole of the catchment area into this inland sea."
"A great deal of research along these lines is already being carried out, but often without adequate coordination."
"The proposal that we have on the table today - which is referred to as BONUS for short - aims to change this."
"This work will be a joint research programme between the states surrounding the Baltic Sea, including, in fact, researchers from Russia, in order to meet the environmental challenges in this area."
"BONUS will create a strategic plan with a common focus for more than 500 researchers from the eight Member States around the Baltic."
"The EU and the states in the Baltic Sea area will then, together, invest nearly SEK 1 billion in environmental research."
"Eighty five million people live around the Baltic Sea in countries whose economies are dependent on the sea in various ways."
"At the same time, it is our societies that are contributing to the problems as discharges and waste find their way out into the water."
"A better overall view of the research is needed if it is to be possible to save the Baltic Sea."
"Research in this area is fragmented and far too dependent on the limited research appropriations at local, regional and national level."
"BONUS builds instead on experience gained from the EU's Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development."
"As a result of BONUS, the national research programmes and activities in the participating states will, for the first time, be integrated into a joint strategic programme with a clear focus."
"I would like to thank everyone - my fellow Members, the Spanish Presidency and the Commissioner for Research, Innovation and Science - who has been involved in making this happen."
"This type of coordinated investment in environmental research is one element in the creation of a sustainable, dynamic and resource-efficient Europe."
"The Baltic Sea is very much alive in the culture of all eight of our countries surrounding this inland sea: in their literature, music and art."
"We want it to still be here for our grandchildren."
"BONUS will form part of the platform for this investment in the future."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I wish to express my gratitude to the European Parliament and particularly to the rapporteur, Ms Lena Ek, for supporting the European Commission's proposals on the joint Baltic Sea research programme, BONUS."
"I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs on the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for their constructive support and I would like to acknowledge the supportive opinion of the European Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety concerning the BONUS programme."
"Eight of the nine states bordering the Baltic Sea are members of the European Union, and we are all aware of the very complex and pressing environmental problems currently being faced in the Baltic Sea, which were outlined very eloquently by Ms Ek a few moments ago."
"These ever-increasing pressures are today threatening the capacity of the Baltic Sea region to continue to provide the diverse range of goods and services upon which we have all learned to depend."
"Science has a very important role to play in supporting public policy in the research and environmental sectors."
"However, the fragmentation of the European research system and the lack of coordination and coherence among its national components undermine its cost effectiveness and overall performance."
"This is indeed the challenge that we face in the Baltic Sea region."
"It is clear that no individual Baltic Sea state acting alone can be successful in solving the complex environmental issues in this area."
"To tackle the environmental problems in the Baltic Sea, it is now a matter of urgency to develop a strategic and integrated research strategy for the region, enable cross-border synergies, pool resources, share knowledge and enhance the cross-border mobility of researchers."
"This is how we can ensure a sustainable future for the Baltic Sea region."
"The BONUS initiative, together with the efforts made within the framework of the EU strategy for the Baltic Sea region, will provide the structure and the means to address these challenges in an effective and coordinated manner."
"I welcome the institutional agreement that was reached with regard to the implementation of the BONUS initiative on 27 April last."
"Having said this, I would also like to stress my regret at the lack of agreement among the Member States to put in place a real common-pot model, as set out in the original European Commission proposal."
"Without having a real common-pot financing facility, the selection of the best transnational research proposals based strictly on scientific excellence, the quality of the consortium and the expected impact cannot be fully guaranteed."
"It does not allow for the full realisation of the benefits, added value and efficiency gains of cross-border collaboration."
"For this reason, the European Commission would like to stress that the implications of this decision should not be taken as a precedent for future proposals."
"Member States will need to commit to a real common pot for cross-border funding and collaboration before the launch of any further initiatives based on Article 185 of the Lisbon Treaty."
"To come back to this current initiative, the European Commission has every confidence that the BONUS programme will be in a position to optimise the potential of environmental research programmes in the Baltic Sea region, enhance the scientific capacity of the area, facilitate cross-border mobility of researchers, promote synergies and avoid wasteful duplication of research efforts."
"This will secure a sustainable future for the Baltic Sea."
"Mr President, BONUS-169 is an important pilot project and it is about cooperation on environmental problems in a particular area."
"The programme is supported, in general, by all of the Baltic States."
"The programme is also intended to include non-EU countries that discharge their waste water and thereby pollute the Baltic Sea, which is considered to be one of the most polluted seas in the world."
"The BONUS programme has an enormous task to do in bringing to light the many environmental problems in the Baltic Sea."
"All the various types of pollution in the world, from paper factories and similar industries, as well as collapsing fish stocks, threaten the Baltic Sea, and undetonated mustard gas bombs and Russian gas pipelines do not help to promote the welfare of the ecosystem."
"I am therefore very much in favour of the BONUS programme."
"However, it must not stand alone, but must instead be accompanied by the environmental awareness of the individual States together with action on their part; including the provision of financial resources."
"Mr President, Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn, rapporteur Mrs Ek, the particular problems and the special situation of the Baltic Sea call for a special approach."
"Therefore, I am delighted that we can wind things up with an agreement at this time and that the work can begin."
"Nevertheless, I should like to share a few reflections."
"As the Commissioner has already said, we have gone for a real common pot in the first instance, a common fund to which criteria such as excellence and interdisciplinary approach apply."
"The consultations produced a rather pragmatic approach, which is that countries themselves may also shop around on the list of projects so as to get their own universities and institutions on board. I do not have any objection to that per se - indeed, I am in agreement - but we do have to assess it."
"This must be done efficiently and, if it is done right, and cooperation is more successful than in the past, it may well be an example of what we are looking for in the EU 2020 strategy."
"Europe pays a little extra and the Member States pay extra."
"We are talking about not only research itself but also the subsequent implementation."
"Environmental quality must also be restored effectively, so let us keep a close eye on that."
"I should like to make two more comments."
"Firstly, the approach to the Baltic Sea can also be an example for other macro-regions, for example the Danube."
"May I ask the Commissioner whether, in the light of this, thoughts towards that region ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"The regulations concerning research on the welfare of the Baltic Sea which are contained in the Commission's proposal introduce a certain important element - the strategic planning stage."
"Without this stage, we would be dealing only with extensive development of this research."
"For what we need is a broader plan of action, a better strategy which, apart from the sea itself, will include its drainage area, which currently, as we all know, is suffering severe flooding."
"Special attention should also be given to the selection of experts, for the broad range of research which has been proposed cannot be reduced to phenomena which can be reproduced in a laboratory."
"Here, research carried out in the field is closely connected with territory which falls under the jurisdiction of a particular country."
"Therefore, EU law has to be reconciled with national law."
"The Commission's selection of independent experts should take this fact into account."
"Increasing the research capability of the new Member States in the Baltic Sea region should take account of the fact that, firstly, the research potential in these countries is varied and the generally good potential of research staff is accompanied by poorer laboratory facilities."
"Therefore, I am surprised by the limit imposed of a 25% share of in-kind infrastructure contribution in the common pool."
"Secondly, for many countries, the 'common pot' is not acceptable, both for legal reasons and in view of the fact that it could adversely affect research plans which are currently being put into effect there."
"Thirdly, the strategic stage of the programme needs time."
"Better use should be made of this stage."
"Firstly therefore, it is necessary to define the research priorities for the Baltic and its drainage areas, and then the participants in the project should invest in their research facilities to make them ready to work on these priorities."
"Including Russia in this research on equal terms on the basis of an Eastern Partnership is an important matter."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Ek, for her quite excellent work."
"The BONUS research programme, which is well worth supporting and an excellent initiative, is an outcome of the EU's Baltic Sea Strategy."
"I also regard the strategy itself as a very major step forward."
"Around six years ago, enlargement meant that the Baltic Sea, to all intents and purposes, became an internal sea of the EU."
"People have become aware of this all too slowly."
"As Mrs Ek said, there has been much research undertaken with respect to the Baltic Sea, but too little coordinated research to establish a knowledge base, for example, to improve EU policies and make them more intelligent."
"I hope that coordinated research will help us at least to become aware of two issues."
"Firstly, the ecological state of the Baltic Sea is alarming."
"It is one of the world's most polluted seas."
"The world's largest area of seabed devoid of oxygen - in other words, dead - is in the Baltic Sea."
"It has been said that the largest desert in Europe lies at the bottom of the Baltic Sea."
"The other issue that research will hopefully help people to understand better is that it is we ourselves who are to blame for the state of the Baltic Sea."
"The main problem is eutrophication, the consequences of which the rapporteur also described well."
"The main source of eutrophying nutrients - nitrogen and phosphorus - is agriculture."
"It mainly relates to EU agriculture in the Baltic Sea catchment basin."
"I therefore hope that jointly-organised coordinated research will help people to become sufficiently aware of all this and that it will also help us to develop better and more intelligent methods and processes in all sectors, but in agriculture especially, because fertilisers that have entered lakes and seas are nothing more than a waste of resources as far as farmers are concerned."
"We need to remember, however, that research cannot solve everything."
"We also have to understand that saving the Baltic Sea will require genuine changes in policy too, mainly in the area of agriculture, but also in other sectors."
"I hope we will make saving the Baltic Sea, which is now one of the world's most polluted seas, a success story from which the rest of the world can learn a lesson."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, I welcome the Baltic Sea Research and Development (BONUS-169) programme which will integrate the national research activities of the Member States and the European Commission on environment and marine resources management in the Baltic Sea."
"The BONUS-169 programme is an innovative model and an example for other kinds of regional cooperation in the field of scientific research."
"Like the Baltic region, other regions such as southeast Europe would benefit from there being concerted action by the Member States and the Commission, so as to address common challenges and support sustainable development in their regions."
"I would therefore urge Parliament and the Commission to consider the possibility of creating a joint research programme for the southeast region of Europe, focused on areas of great importance, such as the sea, biodiversity and energy sources from the sea, and with a view to the sustainable development of the European Atlantic axis and its neighbouring regions."
"(RO) The EU's involvement in the Joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme is proof that Europe's institutions want to achieve better harmonisation of policies, programmes and the other activities mentioned in the research sector."
"Joint action is required at EU level in order to deal with the challenges and improve programming efficiency and effectiveness by incorporating all the research activities into a uniform, well-coordinated programme, which will promote the region's sustainable development."
"The BONUS programme is especially important to the Baltic Sea region."
"However, its role should not be restricted to just this region."
"I would like, in future, for this programme to serve as a model for other forms of regional cooperation in Europe, such as in the Danube or Mediterranean Sea regions."
"This will allow us to have a powerful, dynamic and competitive European Union."
"(LT) The implementation of the Joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme BONUS-169 has revealed the catastrophic situation of the Baltic Sea, particularly in those areas where large-scale energy infrastructure projects are planned and are being carried out not just by European Union Member States, but by other countries bordering the EU."
"In some places, genotoxicity has risen several hundred times."
"The BONUS programme has already shown its potential to contribute to monitoring the Baltic environment and therefore it is necessary to continue to actively research the condition of the Baltic Sea."
"To ensure that research is as comprehensive and objective as possible, it is very important for scientists from all the countries surrounding the Baltic Sea to be included in research on an equal footing."
"This programme is a quasi preventative measure, drawing attention to the Baltic Sea's complex ecological situation."
"Only by properly funding scientific research and observing threats in time will we stop ecological disasters and I trust that we will ensure that the Baltic Sea ..."
"(RO) Environmental problems in certain regions could be dealt with much more successfully if individual countries pooled the research activities they have carried out."
"This is why I welcome the Commission proposal and the rapporteur's proposal on supporting the BONUS programme for the Baltic Sea region."
"I think that it is a good idea to have included a recital which asks the Commission to carry out a final evaluation of the programme to see the level of quality and effectiveness in implementing programmes of this kind, especially in terms of the progress made in relation to the specified objectives."
"These results should be published on the programme's website so that citizens can find out how the programme is going and performing."
"In fact, representatives of the business sector can also draw up their business plans based on the recommendations and opportunities which emerge from the research results in this region."
"What is important is for us to see this programme's results expressed in terms of clear benefits for the environment, citizens and the development of this region, especially against the backdrop of the current economic crisis."
"(PL) Mr President, I fully support establishment of the BONUS Joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme."
"I am certain that establishing a consolidated supranational research programme based on reciprocal cross-border cooperation and exchange of experience will contribute to more effective action for the protection of the Baltic Sea and will bring about sustainable development of the region."
"The BONUS programme was initiated by eight Member States."
"The Baltic countries include one more country, Russia."
"It is, therefore, justified that Russian scientists participate in the programme."
"This research programme should supply a number of proposals for the strategy for the region being developed by the Union and for the role of macro-regions in future cohesion policy, which we debated in Parliament two months ago."
"It is a pity we were not able to discuss openly and determine the consequences and dangers for the Baltic Sea of the construction and use (...)."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(PL) Thank you very much, Mr President, for giving me the floor."
"I would like to say that today's research related to the whole Baltic Sea sector should be seen as part of the huge territorial cohesion of the whole European Union."
"Let us concentrate, today, on several important parallel strategies: the Baltic Sea Strategy, the Mediterranean Partnership and the Danube Strategy."
"We have to remember, however, that these regions must be connected with one another."
"Presently, the main trade in goods is carried on with Indochina, and that is why it is so important to concentrate on ensuring that the Baltic Sea Strategy, too, will include the possibility of connections in the 'North-South' TNT network."
"Fortunately, this strategy is available to the public, today, and I hope that the Baltic Sea region, too, will be closely connected with the south of Europe by the TNT network based on several parallel solutions."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Ms Ek, and to the 10 Members of the European Parliament who took the time to be here at a late hour this evening to discuss this issue."
"I am very satisfied that all Article 185 initiatives announced under the cooperation element of the seventh EU framework programme have now been adopted."
"This is a political achievement for all of the institutions of the European Union."
"The BONUS initiative would clearly help the countries of the Baltic Sea region to address more effectively the very complex and pressing environmental problems in this area by promoting synergies and avoiding the wasteful duplication of purely national research efforts."
"In view of the key global political problems that we are facing in policy areas such as climate change, energy, food and health, the requirement to pool resources and work together becomes necessary."
"The Article 185 initiatives are playing a key role in tackling some of these key issues."
"The experience we gain from these initiatives will allow us to find even better and more efficient ways to collaborate at a European level, making full use of both national and Community research programmes."
"As I said at my European Parliament ratification hearing last January, I am deeply committed to the complete realisation of the European research area, but we must work together in a spirit of unity and cooperation if we are going to achieve this objective."
"This is vitally important for the future economic development of the European Union and if we are to ensure that the EU becomes a global leader in the fields of research, innovation and science."
"Mr President, BONUS is, in fact, a pilot project under Article 185, and I can assure everyone who will work on the BONUS programme and everyone who will read or be affected by this that it is not easy."
"It is not easy to combine research funds from the European Union and from various Member States."
"It is a huge challenge."
"It is not easy to coordinate different academic research cultures and traditions, with 16 large research groups, 500 researchers, eight countries and the rest of the EU watching to see how this will actually go, plus everyone who is to review and check that we are doing the right things and that they are proving effective."
"This will require a lot from the researchers involved."
"It will require a lot from the Member States and their governments, and I can assure you that it will require tough political decisions and strong political leadership, but we have to do this."
"Our research programmes must be thoroughly evaluated and we need to take on this huge responsibility because we need to solve the problems together for the sake of the Baltic Sea."
"However, we also need to find a model that will enable us to make progress in other parts of Europe."
"This applies to the large rivers, to the Mediterranean Sea and to how, in general, we handle common resources provided by taxpayers in EU programmes and in national programmes."
"The Baltic Sea has been part of our common history and culture since the end of the Ice Age, past the time of the Vikings, past the trade during the Middle Ages, past the 'sea of freedom' during the Cold War, and now it is a sea that our parents and children love and that we have a responsibility to manage."
"In view of these difficulties and the huge challenges we face, I would therefore, once again, like to thank everyone involved."
"The work does not finish with the decisions we take here and the documents we sign; it is now that the work begins."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00."
"Application of the provisions of the Schengen acquis relating to the Schengen Information System in Bulgaria and Romania (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Coelho, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the draft Council decision on the application of the provisions of the Schengen acquis relating to the Schengen Information System in the Republic of Bulgaria and Romania (06714/2010 - C7-0067/2010 - 2010/0814(NLE))."
"Mr President, Commissioner Malmström, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to mention four essential points."
"Firstly, the evaluation procedure."
"Since joining the European Union in 2007, Romania and Bulgaria have begun to work towards full integration into the Schengen Area."
"If the Council is to make a decision to abolish internal frontiers, the assessment procedures need to certify that all the conditions necessary for the implementation of the relevant parts of the acquis communautaire are met; namely, data protection, the Schengen Information System, borders by air, land and sea, police cooperation and visa policy."
"The assessment procedures began with the part relating to data protection."
"This means verifying that each of these Member States is adequately prepared to implement all the provisions in terms of data protection."
"The results are therefore a prerequisite for the evaluation process for the Schengen Information System, which involves the transfer of data to these countries."
"Approval of this decision is therefore a first step towards the abolition of checks at internal borders with Bulgaria and Romania."
"Secondly, access to documents."
"The Council has submitted this draft decision to Parliament."
"However, evaluation and follow-up reports were not sent; these would enable Parliament access to all the information necessary to develop a reasoned and justified view."
"The documents were only supplied by the Council after Parliament's insistence."
"I welcome the efforts of the Ambassador of Romania, with whose help it was possible to find a solution to this situation by applying for confidential documents to be declassified and designated as 'limited'."
"This allowed the schedule to be met, but we will have the same problem when Parliament's opinion is sought on other aspects of the Schengen acquis."
"It is imperative, then, that the agreement between Parliament and the Council is concluded as quickly as possible regarding the transfer of confidential documents."
"Thirdly, the evaluation of Romania and Bulgaria."
"In the case of Bulgaria, certain failures were identified relating to the adoption, implementation and enforcement of Recommendation 85/15 by the Council of Europe, concerning the use of personal data in the police sector, and deficiencies were found in the operation of the National Commission for Data Protection."
"Bulgaria took appropriate action on these recommendations and, on 26 April, the Council concluded that the necessary conditions in terms of data recovery had been met."
"In the case of Romania, weaknesses were detected in the adoption of two laws regulating the processing of personal data, and also relating to national authority facilities and resources for data protection, as well as the introduction of periodic assessments regarding Schengen data."
"In general, Romania has taken appropriate action in the light of the recommendations and those that are still pending do not prevent this country from applying, as applicable, all the necessary requirements with regard to data protection."
"The conditions for giving the green light to Romania and Bulgaria in the field of data protection have thus been verified."
"Finally, Mr President, the review of the Schengen evaluation mechanism."
"I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate the need to establish a European evaluation mechanism as quickly as possible which is simple, effective, efficient and transparent in the field of Schengen evaluation."
"Parliament rejected the proposals that were submitted to it last October."
"I would ask the Commission to exercise its right of initiative as soon as possible."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I am quite confident that Bulgaria and Romania will do their utmost to reach the target date for lifting the internal border controls in March 2011."
"The Commission, within its competences, will fully support both countries in order for them to successfully pass the Schengen evaluation."
"It is the responsibility of the Council to carry out the Schengen evaluations and, based on these evaluations, the Council will decide on the lifting of internal border controls."
"These evaluations are ongoing, so it is too early to assess the state of play of the preparations."
"But the first steps have been successful, confirmed by the positive evaluation of data protection, which allows now Bulgaria and Romania to get access to the Schengen Information System."
"The European Parliament and Mr Coelho propose that Bulgaria and Romania should inform Council and Parliament on the follow-up recommendations."
"It is indeed the practice in the current Schengen evaluation that the Member States concerned report to the Council on the measures to comply with the recommendations, as the evaluation mechanism is now under full responsibility of the Council."
"On that basis, and under current legislation, it is up to the Council to inform Parliament accordingly."
"In this context, I would like to take up your proposal and confirm that I will soon, in the autumn, propose a new evaluation mechanism following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty for the reasons that you stated, Mr Coelho."
"I think that both Member States and Parliament should be involved in this mechanism."
"Member States, of course, shall be involved to maintain mutual trust among each other on their capacity to apply all accompanying measures allowing for the lifting of internal border control, in particular, in the field of external borders, visa and police cooperation."
"The European Parliament should indeed be fully informed of the outcome of these results of the evaluation."
"With this new mechanism, the Commission aims to remedy the current weaknesses as referred to by the rapporteur."
"There is no real follow-up at this time after evaluations are made and the recommendations are not always implemented."
"The support of Parliament in this process is indeed very much appreciated."
"I congratulate Mr Coelho and welcome the progress which this report mentions for Bulgaria and Romania."
"The positive results and conclusions from the 'Personal Data Protection' audit have made it possible to set a date for the Schengen Information System to be implemented in Bulgaria as well."
"Both Bulgaria's accession to the European Union and its accession to the Schengen area generate enthusiasm among all of Bulgaria's citizens."
"In fact, it goes beyond enthusiasm as this concerns the opportunity to lift border controls and enforce the right of free movement across the whole European Union."
"This success is down to the tremendous efforts and resolute actions of the current Bulgarian Government which has done everything possible to make up the ground for the previous years it had lagged behind to meet the conditions and make the necessary preparations to apply the Schengen acquis."
"The Schengen area is not only about the freedom of movement."
"It also means strengthened police and customs cooperation, especially in the context of combating the trafficking of persons and goods, and organised crime on a more general level."
"The accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen area is part of a journey towards realising our dream of a Europe of citizens."
"To achieve this, constant efforts are needed, along with compliance with the requirements of the Schengen acquis by the countries' governments, not to mention steadfast support from Europe's institutions."
"The European Parliament's access to the recommendations in the evaluation reports and the documents on the subsequent actions to take provide a guarantee that the constructive dialogue between us all will continue."
"This transparent dialogue also guarantees the citizens of Bulgaria and Romania that the fundamental rights enshrined in the treaties are a reality."
"Yesterday, we celebrated the 25th anniversary of when Europe's citizens enjoyed, for the first time, the freedom to travel without restrictions within the European Union."
"On the occasion of this anniversary, Commissioner Malmström stated: 'Schengen has become one of the most powerful symbols of the EU's capacity to improve the lives of its citizens'."
"As for Martin Schulz, the President of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, he said: 'Schengen is probably the most successful and tangible result achieved by the European Union in the last 30 years'."
"On this same occasion, I too just want to say: Happy anniversary to Schengen and freedom!"
"Romania and Bulgaria could be an anniversary present for the Schengen area."
"After completing its evaluations, the Council concluded that both Member States provide sufficient guarantees to take the first step towards joining the Schengen area."
"We will confirm this step by expressing our opinion in favour tomorrow."
"It will not only be the citizens of Romania and Bulgaria who stand to gain from finally being able to join, but the whole of the European Union as well."
"Increasing cooperation in the economic, social and administrative sectors will strengthen the EU."
"Governments in both Member States must fulfil the requirements of the Schengen road map as part of the accession process."
"I am pleased that the European Parliament has successfully fulfilled its role as guarantor of European democracy."
"The amendment tabled by the rapporteur only serves to initiate a transparent type of cooperation between European institutions."
"It is the only one which can yield rapid, tangible results in the process of debating and approving European legislation."
"Interinstitutional disagreements in the European Union must not delay or jeopardise the rights, freedoms and well-being of European citizens whom all of Europe's institutions exist to serve."
"Introducing a new evaluation system will, as Mr Coelho suggested, make it possible to guarantee security and strengthen the principal of mutual trust - essential to maintaining the Schengen area."
"I support Mr Coelho's proposals."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a few days ago, we celebrated the anniversary of the Schengen agreements with President Buzek and President Barroso."
"This evening, well into the night, we are laying a specific new stone in the foundations for the draft decision of the Council."
"We are passing from thought to deed and to collaboration, to the preliminary and indispensable conditions for the lifting of border checks with Bulgaria and Romania which, according to preliminary evaluations, are in the course of being satisfied."
"These two countries should, in fact, soon be in a position to guarantee the protection and processing of personal data."
"This is good news and will result in the total integration of these two countries within the Schengen framework, which will contribute towards the strengthening of security and prosperity, not just for these countries but for the continent of Europe as a whole."
"I am certain that this will allow the problems of illegal migration and immigration, international criminality and all sorts of scourges to be combated."
"This will help to reduce the risks."
"Two brief comments ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, since the SIS is an integral part of the Schengen area, the issue at stake is extremely important."
"I myself come from a new Member State. I remember how Latvia wanted to join the area."
"In this regard, I very much welcome the accession of Bulgaria and Romania."
"Nevertheless, I must point out that some shortcomings are detected."
"My group fully shares the position of the rapporteur that there should be a follow-up."
"In other words, Parliament must be informed of how problems have been solved, taking our concerns about data protection into account."
"I would also hope that the unavailability of slots will not be a barrier to joining the SISOne4ALL."
"Finally, we fully join the rapporteur in his concerns about the new Schengen evaluation mechanism."
"We believe that Parliament should be able to exercise democratic scrutiny and I wholeheartedly welcome the statement of Ms Malmström that this will be the case."
"Romania and Bulgaria adopted the Schengen acquis when joining the European Union in 2007."
"Now, however, we have the pleasure of discussing the draft Council decision on the application of the Schengen acquis in the two newest Member States of the European Union, which is one of the last steps towards lifting checks at the internal borders with Bulgaria and Romania."
"Both countries have received a favourable assessment from the committee of experts concerning their readiness for the lifting of checks at the EU internal borders, and the shortcomings which were identified should and certainly will be eliminated quickly."
"If this happens, it is to be expected that Bulgaria and Romania will be technically ready for connection to SIS II by October 2010, which is in accordance with the current road map."
"Thanks to this, it will be possible to open Schengen to the two new countries while, at the same time, maintaining the right level of care for the security of citizens and their interests."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, Schengen was a trade-off for the freedom of movement of people and goods and trusting those members involved to carry out appropriate measures to ensure safety and security on their own turf."
"Although the UK is not part of the formal Schengen acquis, we use aspects of the Schengen Information System in fighting crime."
"Yet, at the same time, the system and the Schengen acquis in general also provide the more astute criminal with a broader platform for international crime and corruption."
"After the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the SIS, the primary question must be whether these Member States are at a point where they can guarantee a level of scrutiny domestically to warrant free movement across the continent."
"There has been significant opposition to moving towards a second evolution of the Schengen Information System, in particular, the equilibrium between cost and efficiency."
"The UK operates independent stringent checks and does not participate in passport-free travel."
"Will we have to provide financial support for developing information gathering systems in those countries aspiring to Schengen, in order to mitigate the potential increase in crime related to open-border policy?"
"Schengen brought with it an increase in the possibility of trafficking in illegal goods and people across borders."
"The security of travel without border controls rests heavily upon trust in the ability of individual Member States to perform checks to appropriate standards."
"The expansion of the Schengen Information System increases the window for corruption and creates a much larger collection of information for criminals wishing to hack into the network."
"Similarly, deeper integration alongside a broadening of Member State involvement may require an expansion of measures used in the Schengen Information System, especially as we approach the advent of SIS II."
"For example, at what point will the storage of biometric data be positive?"
"Critics also worry that the system may be used to monitor citizens with particular political views, with information garnered liable to be mishandled for political ends."
"With an increasing number of states joining the acquis, the risk is heightened."
"About 500 000 computers are currently able to access the Schengen Information System."
"It cannot be known how many of these systems are free of malicious software."
"In general, one in two computers have been victims to malicious infection."
"Spyware allows a third party to access the same data as the user."
"The broader the system, the more data there is to access, and the greater the number of criminals with aspirations to abuse the system."
"Member States must demonstrate exceptionally advanced security and, even with the greatest efforts and intentions, one cannot rule out the possibility of a breach which, in turn, would compromise all involved."
"(RO) I would like to express my very warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, for the way in which he has handled this dossier and congratulate him on all the work he has done."
"I strongly support what he said earlier, not only for the current evaluation based on data protection, but also for the other reports due to be drafted in the areas which remain to be evaluated."
"The Council must be able to guarantee that it can provide MEPs with all the information required to enable Parliament to adopt a suitable, fair decision."
"I sincerely hope that we will reach a solution so that we can carry out our work in normal conditions and make enlightened decisions."
"(RO) First of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Coelho for the exceptional work he has done on this report, which is so important to Romania and Bulgaria, and also make the following clarifications."
"Romania's adoption of the law aimed at regulating the processing of personal data is an important step towards meeting all the conditions for joining the Schengen area."
"The Ministry of Administration and the Interior has made considerable progress recently so that Romania is on track to join the Schengen area by the specified deadline of March 2011."
"Romania was mentioned as an example, particularly for its sea border surveillance system SCOMAR, in a number of reports produced by European experts."
"At the same time, other measures will include setting up the border police's new territorial services, improving cooperation with Frontex and continuing investments in making the land border secure."
"I would like to end by emphasising that border security ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(RO) I, too, wish to begin by joining the list of those congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Coelho."
"He has really done an exceptional job for Romania and Bulgaria."
"First of all, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that Romania has actually been presented as an example of good practice regarding maritime transport safety."
"In addition to this, I believe that Romania, just like Bulgaria, meets the conditions for being part of the SIS system."
"This is why I think that the Commission must also get involved in supporting both countries in order to complete the other evaluations as well, so that we can successfully join what is the European Union's common area."
"We are talking here about expanding the European Union in its entirety, including its values."
"One of these values is freedom and the right to move freely."
"(PL) Mr President, Europeans are reaping the benefits of the Schengen Agreement."
"It facilitates the effective and free flow of people, the development of tourism and the growth of commercial exchange."
"This is to our credit and is a great achievement of the European Union."
"However, for this to be so, it is essential to have the right technical infrastructure which will allow these processes to be monitored."
"We know from our own experience that the role and responsibility of countries entering the Schengen Agreement is to comply with the requirements related to the Schengen Information System."
"It is for our common good, and for our common security."
"Standards in this area must be maintained."
"(PL) I would like to thank Mr Coelho, who is our parliamentary Schengen specialist, and who has, indeed, done a huge amount of work in this area."
"Firstly, I am pleased that the Schengen Evaluation Working Group within the Council has evaluated the applications of Bulgaria and Romania positively, and that these countries have eliminated all the problems which stood in the way of making this important achievement."
"I think the most important matter is, of course, the protection of internal borders, and I think we will also continue to work on SIS II and the biometric data which are used."
"That is, of course, something for the future, but let us remember that this process is before us."
"I wish our friends from Bulgaria and Romania what we experienced with the Czechs and other countries two years ago, also in my country - in Poland - where the barriers were symbolically raised and Schengen became a fact."
"It really does change the cohesion of the Union and the historical approach to uniting the old and the new Union."
"I also hope that Bulgaria and Romania will meet all the essential requirements at the next stage and I wish Mrs Malmström acceleration of this work ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, there is not much to add because there seems to be a very strong consensus here."
"I fully agree with those of you who have expressed the view that there was indeed a reason to celebrate this week."
"The Schengen area is an achievement of the European Union; we can be extremely proud of it."
"It represents the free mobility of people in a Europe without borders and I hope that the Schengen area will soon grow with two more members."
"In the meantime, access to the Schengen Information System is, of course, a very important first step."
"There is still some work that needs to be done in these countries on visas, police cooperation, judicial process, organised crime and so on, and we will, of course, closely monitor this."
"I myself envisage visiting both countries by the end of the year to show my support and to study progress on the spot."
"I really want to thank these countries for the progress that they are making at present."
"As some of you have said, trust is very important in ensuring that the other Member States see that there are concrete results, so we can have a happy ending to this story."
"In this regard, increasing the transparency of the system and increasing the involvement of the European Parliament in helping to evaluate and implement is a very important step."
"That is why I hope that we can work together on this new evaluation mechanism."
"I would like, in my turn, to thank Mr Coelho for the work he has been doing on these two countries and look forward to further cooperation with you."
"Mr President, four final points."
"Firstly, to express my thanks for the kind words of my fellow Members and the excellent cooperation on the part of my shadow rapporteurs and, secondly, to stress that there is a large consensus which says yes to these initiatives, but also to demand that Parliament be informed within six months as to the follow-up for the recommendations, which are not yet fully realised."
"Thirdly, I would like to remind you that this is only the first step."
"Other steps are still to be taken, as Commissioner Malmström has rightly reminded us."
"Fourthly and finally, I would like to congratulate Commissioner Malmström for her assurances that a legislative initiative on the evaluation system will be presented this autumn."
"These two countries are being assessed solely and exclusively by the Council."
"As Commissioner Malmström has said, we need a European system of evaluation which involves all the European institutions, the European Commission and the Council, but also Parliament."
"Above all, however, it must be a European system of evaluation which does not operate according to two standards."
"That is, we cannot subject external states that wish to enter into Schengen to more demanding evaluation criteria than those which we apply to Member States that are already in Schengen."
"All countries, whether those that wish to enter or those that are already part of Schengen, must give proof of their strict compliance with the Schengen acquis and show that their control of external borders is as good as it should be."
"This is the only way we can ensure the security of our area of free movement, thus providing our citizens with assurances that they can travel about freely."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - (HU) The further expansion of the Schengen Area is a positive development and should be supported by all means as it will make the free movement of citizens - a key item of the Union's acquis - accessible to all citizens."
"It means a tangible benefit provided by the Union to citizens in their daily lives."
"The Schengen acquis is particularly important for us, citizens of new Member States, who were barred from Europe for decades."
"It means a lot to me that another border, this time the Romanian section of Hungary's external Schengen borders, is expected to disappear in the near future."
"This will give citizens from both sides of the border, including the 1.5 million ethnic Hungarians living in Transylvania, the chance to enjoy a Europe without borders."
"According to their preparation schedule, Romania and Bulgaria will be able to join the Schengen Area in the first half of 2011, that is, during the Hungarian Presidency."
"It is important to comply with this schedule, to ensure that the interim evaluation milestones are also successful."
"According to the current (interim) evaluation, there will be no legal obstacles to Romania and Bulgaria starting technical preparations for integration in this area, as well, in the second half of the year."
"I support the rapporteur's evaluation and findings, in particular, that the European Parliament and especially the LIBE Committee members must have access to evaluation reports and relevant information before giving their informed opinion."
"The accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen Area next year could be a key success of the Hungarian EU Presidency, which will begin next January."
"The decision will increase security in the region and will grant freedom of travel in Europe without border controls to many more millions of citizens, including Hungarians."
"I welcome the positive evaluation in the last report of the Schengen Evaluation Working Group on the preparedness of the two Member States and that it was approved by the Council comprising Member States' representatives."
"As a result, Bulgaria and Romania are expected to be technically ready to join the Schengen Information System in October 2010."
"After the last evaluation scheduled for December, the two countries will most likely become full members of the Europe without borders next spring."
"The delay caused by the development of the Schengen Information System cannot have an adverse effect on the accession process of the countries awaiting integration."
"For Hungary, it is particularly important to ensure that the citizens of its neighbouring countries, including members of the Hungarian communities living outside Hungary, are able to enjoy freedom of travel without borders throughout the whole of the European Union."
"in writing. - (HU) I am glad that the European Council has come to the conclusion that Romania and Bulgaria, the two newest members of the European Union, have met the relevant criteria and that therefore, the Schengen acquis can also be applied in these countries."
"For the citizens of Europe, one of the most tangible results of European integration is the establishment of the Schengen Area, resulting in unrestricted movement across borders."
"This opportunity is much more significant for citizens of former Communist countries, since the Iron Curtain blocked their way both physically and figuratively and made it practically impossible for them to travel to Western European countries."
"Now, twenty years after the fall of Communism, it all seems like a bad dream."
"By joining the Schengen Area, Romania and Bulgaria will take another step on the road to integration with a unified Europe."
"As internal border controls disappear, the concept of a 'border' will gain a new meaning and the borders between Member States will have a new function."
"Borders will no longer be administrative boundaries; they will instead become bridges and connect the peoples and countries of Europe."
"It is a welcome development that Romania and Bulgaria will become full members of the Schengen Area, an area interwoven with so many bridges and open borders."
"Sport, specifically concerning players' agents (debate)"
"The next item is the oral question to the Commission by Doris Pack, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on sport, specifically concerning players' agents - B7-0308/2010)."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in Mr Belet's report on professional football, the European Parliament already stated that it is in favour of better regulation of the activities of sports agents, particularly players' agents, and on that occasion, we called for an appropriate directive."
"Now, we once again find ourselves facing that issue."
"The legal situation is unclear."
"Since players' agents often work across borders, national legislation, even where it exists in the first place, is not a suitable method of controlling these activities."
"In turn, sports federations have limited legal scope of action."
"As non-state actors, they are not entitled to lay down extensive regulations."
"In 2000, FIFA, for example, had to relax its licensing procedure for agents for this very reason."
"In 2009, the Commission published a study which pointed, in particular, to worrying connections between players' agents and criminal activities."
"There was talk of money laundering, bribery, betting and tax fraud, amongst others practices."
"Such connections damage the integrity of the sport and are inconsistent with its social role."
"In addition, the study published by the Commission has found that the financial flows from players' transfers usually lack transparency, which goes to explain the vulnerability of this system to the criminal machinations I have just mentioned."
"There is a particular risk, in the case of the agencying of young players, of the agent exploiting the youth and inexperience of players in, say, Africa, promising them a future in European professional football and then dropping them when no club can be found for them, leaving them stranded in Europe as illegal immigrants, without work or support."
"Against this background, we need a European legislative initiative."
"That would enable us to regulate this issue uniformly across the EU, to plug the legal loopholes and to support sports federations in their efforts towards orderly and transparent agencying of players."
"In that respect, we should make it our particular aim, as we have requested in our motion, to ban commission payments for agents transferring underage players, so that we can eliminate every financial incentive for these kinds of unfair transactions, especially those involving underage players."
"I hope that we will get the support of tomorrow's plenary for our motion today and, above all, that it will encourage the Commission to get to work on this issue."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me first of all thank Ms Pack for presenting this oral question on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education."
"I am fully aware of the political importance of this issue."
"I would recall that the Commission has now published the results of the independent study on sports agents."
"The study provides a comprehensive analysis of the issue at stake."
"We have learned, for instance, that around 6 000 agents are active across the Member States in all disciplines."
"However, 95% of them are active in only four sports: athletics, basketball, football and rugby."
"The study also tells us that only a limited number of Member States regulate agents through a specific law."
"Most countries simply rely on general provisions of either labour law or contract law."
"Some international sports federations have also adopted regulations on agents, notably in the disciplines that I just mentioned: athletics, basketball, football and rugby."
"Although the existing public and private regulations may conflict with each other and create legal uncertainty, the findings of the study show that few obstacles exist to the free provision of agents' activities across the EU."
"However, the study highlights a number of dubious practices related to agents' activities: for instance, the payment of secret commissions, the exploitation of young players, etc."
"The sports movement has been trying to tackle these problems for some time."
"This is why a number of governing bodies have adopted measures to regulate the activities of agents."
"The rules put in place by sports bodies may have an advantage: sporting sanctions are sometimes the best way to deter unscrupulous actors in the market, be they agents, clubs or players."
"But sporting authorities do not have the power to investigate and punish acts which all Member States consider to be crimes: corruption, money laundering, tax evasion and illegal immigration."
"The sports movement is looking for assistance from the European institutions to tackle the challenges posed by agents."
"The Commission has an important role to play."
"We can help to develop the common principles and standards that might serve as a minimum set of rules for countries and sports federations across Europe."
"We are now assessing which type of action at EU level would be most appropriate."
"We have several options in mind but, to finally decide what action we should take, we will certainly need further deliberations and consultations."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I should just like to start with a reference to the Football World Cup in South Africa, which is again showing every day how great sport can be, how great it is for a country, a continent, and particularly the society there."
"This makes it all the more important for us to preserve sport from the criminal excrescences to which Mrs Pack has already referred, or to make vigorous efforts to tackle these excrescences."
"To quote verbatim from the study you have just mentioned, the results of which are now known, 'Sport is increasingly affected by organised crime'."
"This is sad but true."
"We are talking about human trafficking, sometimes of young children, and also about all kinds of financial malpractice."
"It is clear that the sports federations themselves have neither the ability nor the power to tackle this malpractice efficiently."
"A European initiative is indeed required, therefore."
"We already have various legislative instruments at our disposal - in the treaty and in certain directives - to enable us to take action."
"I should like to mention a couple of proposals for action."
"Firstly, we could set to work on strict criteria applicable to all sports agents throughout the Union."
"The best way to bring about such a situation is via licensing systems for clubs and via a compulsory register for players' agents."
"The sports federations can impose this, but the European Union can certainly be a driving force in this connection."
"For example, the EU can coordinate activities among the various national supervisory authorities."
"A second measure we could take would be to introduce absolute transparency into the financial flows in circulation in the world of players' agents, as these are the root of most evil at present."
"We have no knowledge of these shady financial flows, which means that they can continue to use top-class sport for money laundering, on the one hand, and bribery on the other."
"A third proposal - which Mrs Pack has already discussed - concerns a ban on remuneration for players' agents who seek to make money from the transfer of underage players."
"We should definitely take action on this."
"We have sufficient instruments at our disposal not only to exert pressure on the professional sports federations to push this through but also to take our own initiatives."
"Back in 2007, by a very large majority, this House called on the Commission to take the initiative in the fight against the excrescences in the world of sports agents."
"This study makes a number of specific suggestions."
"Although good, they are clearly inadequate."
"We are pleased to hear you say here that you do indeed intend to move things up a gear."
"There have been calls for this even within the sector itself; from the European association of players' agents."
"We have had a great deal of contact with them, and they themselves are pushing for the European Union to swing into action to root out the rotten apples."
"I propose that we respond to their calls in the interests of sport and of its extremely important social role."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, we are indeed fortunate, I suppose, to be talking about this at the time of the World Cup because what the World Cup illustrates more than almost any other sporting event is just how important sport is to people; just how many millions and millions of people watch football and how much pleasure and passion is invested in it."
"Because of this, it is so important that we actually make sure that the game of football and other sports are regulated properly and that we do now take the action which has been discussed for so long about players' agents."
"We are, unfortunately, as has been mentioned, seeing some very serious things going on: abuse, money laundering, corruption, exploitation of underage players; things which are serious crimes against which we really must take the action which we have been planning for so long."
"What better time to be doing that than now, when the whole world it seems is consumed by football?"
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, I fully support efforts to make the activities of sports agents, mainly in football, more transparent and I believe that the EU should be supporting the various sporting governing bodies to ensure that they can do just that."
"We need to shine a light into the murky world where exploitation could be rife and matters such as dual representation, whereby the agent can be representing a player at the same club that is trying to sign the player, need to be looked at."
"However, any legislation that comes forward to regulate this sector must be from the national sporting bodies or authorities such as FIFA and UEFA."
"It is really not the place of the EU to be regulating in the sporting world, especially with the global nature of this particular problem."
"Where we can add value to sports we should, but we should only intervene upon the request of the sporting governing bodies where we can clearly deliver value or give clarity."
"Mr President, I welcome the question raised by our President in the middle of the World Cup."
"The Commission study has worrying aspects, in that it exposes the risk to the ethics and reputation of sport."
"If the sporting movement is to remain the main player in regulation, by relying on the thousands of charitable men and women who keep alive the sporting spirit as we love it, because is it a factor in individual development, the States should be at their side to punish attacks on public order and to punish excesses."
"These excesses are found in the sports business, in which players are increasingly becoming commodities and their agents simply brokers, placing them just like commodities."
"Transfers command astronomical sums and the rights of minors are increasingly trampled upon."
"These excesses are a cross-border phenomenon, it is money as king, crazy money, and has unfortunately been strengthened by the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities."
"The leading bodies of certain sports in question, especially football, are looking for aid from European bodies."
"Yes, Commissioner, we need to act and, for my part, I am sorry that France has just passed legislation to the contrary."
"(GA) Mr President, an hour and a half ago, the women were saying that it was late to be discussing women's issues."
"Now we are approaching midnight and we are discussing sporting matters."
"However, at least we have the opportunity to discuss this; before Lisbon, we did not."
"Now we have the opportunity and it is good that we are taking it, particularly when we are talking of young people and of the activities of sports agents."
"As Mrs Pack said, there are many examples of young people who are promised that they will be big stars in the future."
"But what happens?"
"They are taken from their homes, from their families, from schools, and then a year or two later, they are discarded."
"This is what happens to the majority of them."
"Now the European Union has a chance to do something about this and to lay down laws and penalties to protect young people from these agents."
"We should look at what is going on in different sports and in different countries, compile this information and do the best thing - particularly for young people and for sport as a whole."
"(NL) Mr President, the profession of sports agent is one with no safeguards and little or no supervision, let alone penalties for misconduct, for example, human trafficking."
"The EU has carried out a study and identified abuses but, as yet, has failed to do anything about the situation."
"Yet something must be done."
"I am very concerned about the vulnerability of underage players, particularly those from developing countries, who are often victims of human trafficking."
"The EU has to clamp down on this."
"The resolution presents specific proposals: putting a stop to remuneration for agents of underage players, enforcing more transparency in financial transactions during transfers, and more regulation by Member States given that the sports federations do not have the situation under control at present."
"Specific measures are required in order to tackle Wild West conditions."
"The Commission must ensure that enforcement and the penalising of malpractice - which, after all, is often cross-border in nature - are improved."
"In addition, the rights of underage players must be safeguarded effectively at all times."
"(RO) I welcome the initiative suggested by Ivo Belet of setting up a standard system for protecting the interests of sports men and women who use the services of agents, which will reduce incidences of misconduct in this area relating to the lack of transparency with transfers, money laundering and human trafficking."
"As I see it, we need to focus appropriate attention not only on football, but on all the other sports as well."
"For example, we currently have around 6 000 agents who are active in Europe, representing 30 different sports, involved in business activities with an estimated annual value of hundreds of millions of euro."
"In these circumstances, imposing a single code of rules for licensing players' agents will be far from an easy task."
"In addition, we will have to support a clearer definition of the functions of an agent, whether as a manager of players or as an intermediary in transfers."
"Looking ahead ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(PL) Mr President, there is one good thing about having this debate at this late hour - our discussion is not being held during the transmission of World Cup matches, so we have time for the debate."
"On a serious note, however, we have the Treaty of Lisbon, which obliges us to take very serious action in a situation which is wrong and which it has not been possible to solve for years."
"We have before us the European Championships organised in two years' time by Poland and Ukraine, so I am extremely pleased with the decision made by Mr Belet, Mrs Pack and Mrs Vassiliou, who has been so actively involved in this, that harmonisation of legislation is needed in this area."
"The system is, indeed, not transparent and is burdened with decades of corruption."
"The trade in young players is taking on enormous proportions, and is leading to many situations where money is being shared, even after transfers have been completed and high fees paid."
"Transfer fees are so high that they sometimes put clubs into debt."
"This is why we need a new code ...."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I believe that we all agree on the importance of sport and that it can be very enjoyable for all of us."
"I thank you all very much for your input and proposals which will be seriously taken into account."
"There is no doubt that some EU action is desirable; sports federations do not have the powers to intervene in some of the worse cases of malpractice."
"Such problems now take on a transnational dimension as sport becomes more globalised."
"The internationalisation of professional sport makes it difficult to adopt a national approach to problems of a systemic nature. The EU can play a coordinating role and help to ensure a harmonised approach to the issue of agents."
"We might, for example, use the new competence acquired by the EU for the harmonisation of criminal law."
"Many actors within the sports movement would certainly welcome our support."
"Of course, whatever action we decide to take, we will work closely with the relevant federations and I intend to publish - as you know - a communication on sport very soon and this communication will certainly look at this issue in more detail."
"It would be wrong to prejudice the discussions which we need to have with you, the Parliament, as well as the sports movement itself."
"I am looking forward to working closely with you to take this issue forward."
"I have received one motion for a resolutiontabled in accordance with Rule 115(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - In this era of commercialisation and professionalism, agents are unavoidable aspects of the sporting landscape."
"The Commission Report estimates that 6 000 agents are active in the EU, generating a turnover of over EUR 200 million for the transfer of players and athletes."
"Football is the only sport where agents are active in all EU Member States."
"Football in Europe is big business and it is essential that fair play and integrity are at the heart of the sport."
"The illicit trafficking and transfer of young players across borders is a worrying issue."
"This situation is particularly associated with football clubs and their search for talent."
"It is estimated that around 20 000 young Africans have been brought to Europe to play football but now live in the EU illegally because they did not secure a career as a football player."
"Closer cross-border regulation, monitoring and minimum harmonised standards for agents' contracts would contribute to tackling this problem and are necessary to ensure the integrity of football."
"Given the cross-border dimension of this issue, I would urge the Commission to carve out an effective and strong role for itself in order to protect minors and halt the trafficking of players."

"Future of the CAP after 2013 (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Lyon, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the future of the common agricultural policy after 2013."
"We are pleased to welcome Commissioner Cioloş."
"In Strasbourg, the Commission designates one or another Commissioner to attend sittings on an ad hoc basis, but I think it is a sign of noteworthy responsibility that the Commissioner responsible for the area being discussed is present and is participating in this debate."
"I believe this to be an extremely positive detail."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, could I begin by offering my commiserations to my German colleagues and congratulations to my Spanish colleagues after last night's excellent match."
"I would like to set out what I believe are the two fundamental questions that we need to answer in terms of CAP reform."
"What is the CAP for?"
"Why is it still relevant in the 21st century?"
"In these times of economic crisis, debt-ridden public finances and austerity budgets, it is vital that the CAP provides answers to these questions if we want taxpayers to continue providing much needed support for our farmers in the future."
"One of the fundamental challenges society faces is how to feed a growing world demand for food, estimated by the FAO to double by the year 2050."
"The big challenge of course is how to meet that doubling of food demand against a background of less land, less water and less energy due to the impact of climate change."
"How do we square that circle and avoid the perfect storm predicted by UK's Chief Scientific Advisor, Sir John Beddington, when he said in 2009 'we head into a perfect storm in 2030, because all of these things are operating on the same time frame'?"
"If we do not address this we can expect major destabilisation, an increase in rioting and potentially significant problems with international migration as people move out to avoid food and water shortages."
"That is the scale of the challenge."
"I believe that tackling climate change and making our agriculture production more sustainable are objectives which must be at the heart of the reform going forward."
"They are vital steps if we are to continue to have guaranteed food security for our European citizens and still make a contribution to meeting growing global demand for food."
"Reform should also encourage green growth through the development of small-scale renewables such as wind, biomass, biogas and second generation biofuels."
"That would help to create jobs and provide real opportunities for farmers to diversify and earn extra income."
"We also must respond to the call for greater environmental protection by ensuring farmers have an opportunity to participate in agri-environmental schemes with a goal of a majority of farmland being covered by such a scheme over the period of the next reform."
"By using the carrot, rather than the stick - that is a very important principle, the carrot encouragement rather than the big stick of rules and regulations - you will get buy-in from farmers to this agenda."
"Fairness also has to be a key driver of the reform: fair to old Member States as well as new Member States in the distribution of direct payment envelopes across the EU; a fair distribution among farmers and Member States by bringing historic payments to an end by 2020."
"It cannot be right and justified to continue making payments based on how you farmed some 10 years ago."
"We also need a fair deal for farmers in the food chain to be able to take on the power of the multiples."
"So, fairness, and the principle of fairness, must be at the heart of the reform going forward."
"We also have to address the issue of market volatility, but on this I would urge some caution."
"Yes, we still need intervention and private aids to storage."
"Yes, we need to examine other tools such as risk insurance and future markets."
"Yes, we need our special reserve budget line to fund action in terms of crisis."
"But we should reject any thought of a return to the wide-scale management of the markets we saw in the past."
"That has already been tried and it has failed."
"I would suggest that we do not wish to go down that road again."
"In conclusion, I am confident that this House will back our reforms, modernising the CAP, setting it on a new course to deliver on the new challenges of the 21st century."
"By backing this report the Parliament will shape the debate, set the agenda, and I would invite the Commissioner to use our ideas to inform his proposals on CAP reform when he publishes them in November this year."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am of course very honoured to participate in these debates, which particularly interest me since I have to make proposals on the reform of the common agricultural policy."
"As I said previously in my hearings before Parliament, I believe the relationship with the European Parliament is key to ultimately undertaking a reform of the common agricultural policy which is more in tune with the expectations of citizens and even better understood by European citizens."
"I would like to sincerely thank Mr Lyon for the report that he is putting to the vote today, as well as his whole team and, of course, all the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, who have tabled amendments that have enriched the text."
"I also welcome this report's call and the will for better communication in respect of the common agricultural policy and the future of agriculture in the European Union."
"I think that, beyond its very important technical contents, this report is already a very good instrument for communicating information about the common agricultural policy, about what it has been until now, about the need for such a policy in the future and about the need for this policy to evolve."
"I also note your call for a recast of the common agricultural policy in line not only with the Treaty of Lisbon, which sets clear objectives for the CAP, but also with the Europe 2020 strategy."
"I think that we have here the opportunity to better adapt our common agricultural policy to citizens' current expectations, beyond its traditional objectives of ensuring the security of market supply."
"You also recommend measures to help improve the functioning of the food chain and the balance between the different operators within the chain, as well as the transparency of positions and the negotiating power of agricultural producers."
"These are elements that will be reflected not only in the reform of the CAP, but also in other initiatives that the Commission will propose."
"I also read very carefully your proposals on the future of direct payments as an instrument not only to guarantee the stability of farmers' income, but also to ensure a minimum level of provision of public goods."
"Here we have, I believe, a new concept of direct payments and a new justification linked to the guarantee of a minimum basic income for farmers, but also the incentive to produce public goods."
"I also noted the suggestion that the criteria governing the distribution of these direct payments should be reviewed, starting from this new criterion but also in order to ensure a more even distribution among the various Member States, regions and categories of farmers, with account also being taken of the specific nature of farming in less-favoured and difficult areas."
"I also note, as Mr Lyon said, the need to continue to ensure that the CAP is focused on the market, and this must be achieved in a measured way so as to prevent farmers from being faced with very chaotic markets."
"From this point of view I think that the focus on the markets is fully compatible with the improvement of market management mechanisms as a means of ensuring, more specifically, that these markets can function properly without affecting, as I was saying, the achievement of objectives aimed at maintaining agriculture throughout Europe and preserving the diversity of our farming."
"I have a few comments about the amendments which have been tabled and which are going to be discussed."
"I think that food production is an important objective of the CAP."
"This production is remunerated directly from the markets, but we must also take into account public goods, which are not remunerated from the markets and which must be covered by a public financial contribution."
"In agricultural production we can take into account these two aspects: food production and the production of public goods, with aspects which are remunerated from the markets and others which are not and which must be supported from the public purse."
"As far as the structure of the common agricultural policy is concerned, I have said several times that, in my opinion, the common agricultural policy must consist of two pillars in order not only to make the achievement of the CAP's objectives clearer, but also to ensure that the instruments at our disposal are managed better."
"We have instruments that must be applied annually, and of which the results can be measured each year, but we also have some measures that have to be applied over several years, as part of programmes that take several years to produce results."
"In order to ensure better management of the resources and means at our disposal under the common agricultural policy, I think that we need these two pillars, which must, of course, be complementary and which must have more clearly defined objectives."
"Then, and most importantly, it would be a good idea to clarify how the measures that they cover should be implemented."
"As far as cross-compliance is concerned, I think that it has had a positive impact on direct payments."
"It has also clearly defined the starting point of public goods rightly remunerated from the public purse."
"Of course, we can simplify cross-compliance measures."
"We can ensure that their content is clearer for farmers, but also for the national or regional authorities which implement and monitor them."
"That said, I think that environmental cross-compliance linked to baseline direct payments is also a good starting point to later clearly define the other measures which stimulate the production of public goods."
"In terms of market measures, as I was saying, I think that a focus on the markets is necessary, but we also need to protect safety nets and study new measures which may enable us to achieve the objective of a level of stability in market prices and income."
"As far as the structures of small, medium and large farms are concerned, I agree that they must perform better - and this applies to small farms too - but we must be able to ensure that this change takes place in their specific environment, by harnessing their specific potential to a greater extent."
"We can therefore have a restructuring of these farms which is closely connected with a move towards the markets, but without a shift towards a single model of agriculture, so that we are able to maintain diversity in agriculture."
"Following these remarks I will now listen closely to your comments and observations, and I can assure you, Mr Lyon, that I will examine very carefully the contents of the report voted for by Parliament and will definitely refer to it when preparing the Commission's legislative initiatives in the months ahead."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the Lyon report has the merit of having clearly defined a set of common agricultural policy objectives that is much broader than in the past and which is in line with the EU 2020 strategy."
"As is clear from the report, this agricultural policy must remain European in scope, and so we must really put the brakes on all those who planned to renationalise it, who wanted national support for it."
"The forceful point is made that we need resources commensurate with the much broader objectives that have been set, not least to achieve public objectives and the objective of having public goods without the market."
"It is made clear, again by the report, that the resources earmarked for the new common agricultural policy must be in line with those enjoyed up to now by that policy."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - (FR) Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mr Lyon, as well as the team of shadow rapporteurs, who I feel cooperated effectively with him on this report."
"As far as our group is concerned, this report conveys an ambition for European agriculture."
"It was written following the raw material crises of 2007 and 2008 and following the farming crisis of 2009, which taught us that liberalism is not the solution for agriculture."
"Our agriculture is firstly intended to provide - to guarantee - food security for 450 million Europeans, but we must also take our place on solvent markets."
"It is clear that the conditions that have prevailed since the middle of the 20th century have evolved, that techniques have evolved and must still evolve, that they must change, and that agricultural policy instruments must also evolve."
"Agriculture must be supported in this evolution."
"While the first pillar, financed solely from the EU budget, must support the level of societal demands that we attach to agriculture, the second, cofinanced pillar must continue to support the modernisation of agriculture and agri-foods so as to take the new contexts into account."
"This policy will also have to be fairer - yes, I did say fairer - between countries and between farmers themselves."
"It is clearly our wish to give hope back to the 14 million farmers and their families, in particular to ensure the replacement of the 4.5 million farmers who, today, are over 60 and who are going to leave the profession."
"The issue of generational change will be one of our concerns."
"Mr President, the debates we have had in recent months in the European Parliament point unequivocally to the need for change in the common agricultural policy."
"None of us is in any doubt that the CAP should help ensure food security over the next few decades, providing good and healthy food while maintaining biodiversity and protecting the environment."
"In the future, the CAP should to a greater degree respond to social needs, such as job creation and the position of women and young people in agriculture."
"I would like to emphasise strongly that farmers must be assured stable and adequate incomes in return for their hard work and supplying us with high-quality goods."
"The report which we will adopt today includes proposals tabled by Members representing political groups and individual Member States."
"We have major decisions to make which will determine the choice of a particular route, so that money spent on the CAP in the future will bring benefits both to agricultural producers and to consumers."
"Finally, I would like to thank Mr Lyon very sincerely for making it possible for us to work so well together."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (SV) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Lyon has made a few, perhaps small, but nevertheless extremely important steps towards amending agricultural policy."
"We need the common European agricultural policy."
"Let us forget any thoughts of renationalisation."
"We also need to realise that we live in a new era with very difficult issues that it is our duty to resolve."
"This, of course, includes finding food for nine billion people."
"At the same time, there are also the enormous challenges we face with regard to the climate, and in respect of making the natural cycles work."
"Let us not see agriculture as an environmental villain and environmental problem."
"Agriculture and forestry hold the fundamental solutions to our huge problems."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Lyon, first of all I would like to thank you for the report."
"We have worked well together as rapporteurs and I believe that we have found an excellent compromise that we can fully support."
"It is important that Parliament should send out a strong message indicating our intention to continue pursuing a common agricultural policy."
"Of course, it is in the nature of things that we do not get everything we want in a compromise."
"However, what I believe is important for us, and what I would like to emphasise, is that we have the prospect of a greener CAP - I mean green not just in the sense of a sustainable energy policy, but also in the sense of a sustainable agricultural policy too - and that we start to view competition not just as a competitive stance in relation to the global market, but also paying more attention to the situation within European agriculture, focusing on competitive conditions within European agriculture, not only adhering to the rules of the WTO for future agricultural policy, but ultimately developing a strong common European agricultural policy of our own."
"It is important that in future we designate the direct payments from the first pillar in line with a sustainable agricultural policy and that we have a strong second pillar for the development of rural areas, with a focus on jobs."
"What we will not support - and this is something we also made clear at committee level - is an agricultural policy in relation to the global market that is based on export subsidies."
"We continue to reject this strategy and, unlike many others, we are more critical in our appraisal of the history of the current agricultural policy."
"In other words, we want an agricultural policy that moves away from industrialisation and greater concentration and from purely competition-based market policy."
"Instead we want to focus on the fact that agricultural policy is genuinely a policy for the future, which seeks to provide a policy for rural areas that promotes food safety and the safeguarding of soil, water and biodiversity."
"We also believe that we should deploy agricultural policy to combat climate change and, last but not least, as an important mechanism for securing jobs."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, this report allows Parliament to outline our views before the Commission brings forward its proposals on the future of the CAP by the end of this year."
"While I and my group will be voting in favour of this report, I wish to make it clear that there are some parts which we do not agree with."
"Certainly, maintaining the second pillar structure is crucial and will prove to be central to the long-term success of the CAP."
"However, on balance I believe it to be a good starting point for a comprehensive debate on the issue and shows that the Committee can work together."
"We have a major responsibility as a Parliament to ensure that any future reform ensures that agriculture as an industry can compete and can survive in the future."
"The CAP has seen vast changes, and we must ensure that it is fit for purpose in the 21st century."
"We must remember that the CAP is not just for farmers: it provides us with a safe and secure food supply and wide-ranging public goods and environmental benefits."
"In order to achieve these goals I feel that the budget must be at least maintained, and I want to thank the rapporteur for a very good report and his cooperation."
"Mr President, please accept my congratulations."
"Previous CAP reforms have led to the liberalisation of agricultural markets."
"They have given rise to profound injustices in the distribution of aid - between countries, products and producers."
"They have destroyed regulatory instruments for production, such as quotas and production rights, along with mechanisms for intervention and market regulation."
"They have subjected agriculture to the WTO's rules, whereby it has been used as a bargaining chip for other interests."
"The result is plain to see: the unprecedented abandonment of production by millions of small and medium-sized farming enterprises, income insecurity and increasing price volatility, and the exacerbation of food dependence in countless countries and regions."
"All this calls for a profound change in the CAP that will guarantee food security and sovereignty, giving priority to the need for countries and regions to develop production to meet their needs, while promoting environmental sustainability and rural development; promote more diversified production and prevent it from diminishing, while recognising the specific characters of the different sectors and regions; surpass, through modelling and capping aid, the current imbalances between products, producers and countries and finally foresee intervention mechanisms to ensure fair prices for production and to provide farmers with a level of income that will ensure the continuity of production and regular food supplies."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to congratulate Mr Lyon on his work, and also the Chair and the Secretariat of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"I am also grateful to Commissioner Cioloş, since he and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have certainly established a good working relationship, and that is very important."
"I hope that in the future, too, during the forthcoming stages of the legislative process, the Commission will continue to pay particular attention to producers and consumers, who have undoubtedly been heavily penalised because of the structure of the market and the recent crisis."
"My region, Veneto, has 150 000 farms, and through their efforts they not only provide quality products but also ensure protection of the rural environment, which we believe is an asset that should not only be safeguarded but also encouraged."
"However, in order to continue to be able to carry out their activities, our farmers are asking us to provide greater safeguards against price volatility and to keep allocating direct aid."
"It is also essential that we maintain the second pillar of the common agricultural policy."
"Rural development policy must be safeguarded primarily because it facilitates the development of the different types of local agriculture present in Europe, which are required to comply with ever higher quality standards."
"In a competitive market in which they are often at a disadvantage, our farmers are appealing for the bureaucratic burden imposed on them to be reduced as part of the priority actions, since it certainly plays a part in making them less competitive."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for this report."
"It was good indeed to have a listening rapporteur, and his travels within Member States reflect that and also reflect the outcomes within the report."
"The future of farming and the CAP must provide farmers with a viable secure income."
"Pillar one payments must continue giving farmers a direct payment which gives them a minimum level of income security."
"To achieve this, we will need a CAP budget which is at least maintained at the current level or, more importantly, increased to take into consideration the expansion of the Union."
"Volatility within markets has been detrimental to the industry across Europe, and we need to retain the safety nets to maintain stability and ensure profitability."
"The distribution of CAP funds must take into consideration the cost of production in Member States."
"The definition of fair must be examined in greater detail by the Commission and area-based payment which would result in farmers in Northern Ireland receiving less in their single farm payment would be detrimental to an industry where many farmers are on the verge of viability."
"Northern Ireland has many farmers who have a small area of land, but who farm intensively, and such a payment would neither reflect their work nor the financial burden they face."
"Regional variation must therefore be taken into consideration and catered for in the post-CAP 2013."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, today sees an important debate on George Lyon's report and I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Lyon sincerely for the willingness to compromise that he showed in this document."
"We have managed to reach a good compromise that can be supported by many groups and I am hopeful that this compromise will be supported by a broad majority in the vote to take place at noon today."
"The common agricultural policy in Europe was and is one of the most important pillars of the European unification process."
"In this report we describe the effects of the common agricultural policy post 2013."
"The European agricultural sector produces high-quality food, protects vital rural areas and many jobs, maintains and promotes our cultural landscape and biodiversity and can make a contribution to conserving fossil fuels through the production of renewable raw materials and energy."
"To ensure that European agriculture can continue to perform these functions into the future, we must find a concept for the period post 2013 that will enable it to fulfil these many tasks."
"I welcome the fact that Commissioner Cioloş has clearly indicated that he wishes to see a continuation of a two-pillar system."
"My group will support this."
"The first pillar acts as a balance to the constraints under which European agriculture operates in relation to other agricultural regions in the world, while the second pillar involves the creation of a catalogue of measures to enable the 27 Member States to ensure that agriculture receives additional aid to enable it to fulfil its functions."
"The vast majority of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) will vote in favour."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Socialists and Democrats are particularly pleased to see their main proposals reflected in the Lyon report: 80-90% of our amendments were considered, and we were able to endorse 49 of the 50 commitments voted on by the Committee on Agriculture."
"We particularly welcome the fact that the Lyon report includes a clear willingness to maintain the truly Community-minded character of the CAP and a desire for it to continue to receive an adequate budget."
"It incorporates the condemnation of historical criteria for allocating aid to farmers and their replacement with new criteria, essentially based around the environment, the intention to move towards fairer distribution of support among farmers and Member States, as has been reiterated by several of my colleagues, and acknowledges that market regulation and risk and crisis management must have appropriate policy instruments."
"It also includes a new system of support based on compensation for the provision of services and public goods that benefit the whole of society but receive no remuneration from the market."
"The Commission thus has many sources of inspiration for its communication, to be presented in November, and I welcome the fact that the Commissioner has already shown a willingness to accept our recommendations."
"I hope that six months from now I will be able to congratulate Commissioner Cioloş with the same satisfaction I now have in congratulating my fellow Member Mr Lyon for his excellent work, which ennobles and strengthens the role of Parliament at the very moment when, with the Treaty of Lisbon, we are taking on powers of co-decision."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank our rapporteur for his constructive cooperation and for the important aspects highlighted by his report on the future of the CAP after 2013."
"This report calls for further development of the existing common agricultural policy rather than the development of a new policy."
"This is a good thing."
"The primary function of agriculture is and remains the production of food for our citizens."
"The ever-increasing need for public goods, the growth in population numbers and the simultaneous shortage of natural resources make this more difficult to achieve."
"Farmers are required to produce more and more with less and less."
"This is impossible without increasing efficiency."
"The European Parliament, the Commission and the Council are responsible for securing the necessary framework conditions for this."
"If we in Europe want to maintain a healthy and diverse agricultural sector in the future, we will also need to take account of the needs of farmers, namely by imposing as little bureaucracy as necessary and by allowing as much entrepreneurial freedom as possible to enable them to earn a reasonable income for themselves."
"Mr President, I shall be no exception in congratulating my Scottish colleague, George Lyon, on a very solid report."
"There is much in this report to be content with and I echo the comments of a number of colleagues this morning."
"I particularly like the very clear reference in the report that food production is the primary purpose of the common agricultural policy."
"Everything else is very worthy, very desirable, but secondary."
"We must be clear in our own minds that food security is an integral part of our European national security and the primary public benefit of the CAP which is worth paying for in its own right."
"I pick up particularly on Mr La Via's comments on the budget, which have been echoed by remarkably few colleagues this morning."
"Perhaps it is a little stereotypically Scottish to focus so much on the budget, but, unless we have sufficient monetary resources allocated to this policy, it is all pointless."
"I would be grateful for a few words from our Commissioner about how he proposes to defend that budget going forward, not least because a number of Member States, including Britain, want to end direct payments to farmers."
"You can, however, rest assured of the support of this House in maintaining a workable CAP and a workable budget, and this forms a good basis for ongoing discussion."
"(PL) Mr President, I, too, would like to express my regard for Mr Lyon, who has drafted a report containing a vision of the most important challenges facing European agriculture."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have a problem concerning the elimination of disparities in subsidies paid in different Member States, and it is a very serious problem."
"When we look at current subsidies - and if we were to maintain this system - we see huge differences."
"There are countries where the subsidy is over EUR 500 per hectare post 2013, and there are countries - mainly the new Member States - where it is less than even EUR 100."
"We must face up to this problem and solve it."
"We cannot continue with such great differences in the long term."
"Solving this problem is going to be difficult."
"I would like to thank Mr Smith, who has noticed the problem with the budget."
"We will not resolve this problem without having a bigger budget, because it is difficult to take from those who have more; we should, rather, give to those who have less."
"To quote the motto of the French Revolution: 'Liberty, Equality, Fraternity' - we do not have a problem with liberty, but with equality and fraternity the need is greater, and I appeal to fellow Members from the old Member States to help solve this problem in a spirit of equality and fraternity."
"(GA) Mr President, I also welcome this important report, although I am a bit disappointed that it fails to lay out a vision for the common agricultural policy (CAP) which will stop the depopulation of the countryside and ensure that active farmers can provide the goods and services demanded by society."
"We need a CAP that will ensure high-quality food produced to high standards; care and maintenance of land, and protection of water, soil and biodiversity; a common policy to ensure jobs in rural areas and a strengthened rural economy, and one that will strengthen the fight against climate change."
"It is necessary to amend the CAP to help those who need it urgently."
"Currently the largest proportion goes to big owners and to producers."
"A proper budget for the CAP is also important, and I express my thanks to Mr Lyon."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Lyon, ladies and gentlemen, in a context such as this, farms need strong support in order to innovate and make progress."
"The role of farmers needs to undergo a radical change: by systemising agricultural production farmers become agricultural entrepreneurs, and thus promote economic development."
"I believe it is fundamentally important for the recovery of countless abandoned areas of land to be used in the creation of short, closed agricultural branches - in other words, systems that link agricultural cultivation directly to sales."
"These systems can operate and become widespread throughout the European Union."
"I believe that, under the new common agricultural policy (CAP), the Commission should support the creation of agricultural cooperatives so as to cut production costs and make farmers more competitive."
"The Commission must commit itself to defining a budget that is sufficient to achieve these objectives."
"The funding for the new CAP must be linked to results, so as to prevent waste and various kinds of speculation."
"What is more, at this time of crisis, many young people want to return to farming."
"However, they are faced with various obstacles: land is too expensive, and rural development policies are difficult to manage; the fact that there are long waiting times for land and that it is granted on the basis of earnings rather than on the basis of the ideas expressed by young entrepreneurs prevents this group from realising its potential."
"I believe that the Commission must take a supportive and flexible approach to helping young farmers."
"An information policy must also be launched, starting in schools and universities, in order to promote a ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(RO) I share the sentiments of my fellow Members who highlighted the quality of this report and the wide consensus it received in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"On the one hand, it is an ambitious report because it attempts to find solutions to the current major challenges; on the other hand, it is a balanced report which attempts to respond to the legitimate concerns of new Member States about benefiting fairly from the common agricultural policy."
"I wish to stress in particular the articles referring to the common agricultural policy's architecture."
"The CAP must continue to be based on its two pillars."
"Abolishing these would end up destroying the CAP or changing it into a policy devoid of any opportunity to help modernise agriculture and boost its competitiveness."
"Abolishing the rural development pillar would be a mistake and it would slow down the modernisation of agriculture in the whole of Europe, but in the new Member States most of all."
"Another key point is to maintain a CAP budget at least at its current level."
"European farmers are obliged to comply with the highest quality standards, which is reflected in the quality of the food which Europeans eat and in our global competitiveness."
"However, farmers need support to be able to comply with these standards."
"A well-structured, properly financed common agricultural policy means safe, good-quality food for Europeans."
"I believe that the vote on this report will enable Parliament to give the Council and Commission a clear, unambiguous signal regarding our position as representatives of Europe's citizens."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over the next few years the challenges accompanying the development of the European agricultural system will be huge: the growing demand for food will have to be met through the sustainable use of natural resources, with a parallel increase in the level of environmental performance."
"This outlook, which strengthens the relationship between the agricultural sector and the production of public goods, gives agriculture a new strategic importance: the creation of the future common agricultural policy (CAP) today represents the solution to these major challenges facing our society, and the policy will play a crucial role in responding to what is already a food crisis."
"Therefore, it is a case of producing more while polluting less: this is the difficult objective that European agriculture will have to fulfil over the next few years."
"Based on these assumptions, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which I have the honour of chairing, has produced an intense and concise piece of work - which Mr Lyon, with the involvement of all the groups, has overseen in an excellent fashion - in the shape of the report presented to Parliament today."
"It is a report that we are convinced will help lay the foundations of the future CAP and will provide the European Commission with some clear pointers so that it can prepare the year-end communication on the future of the CAP after 2013."
"Mr President, I too wish to thank my colleague George Lyon for his excellent work on this report."
"The CAP has many challenges facing it and in an enlarged Europe it is essential that the EU maintains a strong and properly resourced agricultural policy that will deliver for farmers, rural communities and society and will ensure food security."
"It is also important that there is no renationalisation of the CAP through cofinancing."
"The common agricultural policy must remain a common European policy."
"Over the past 50 years the CAP has increased productivity, contributed to a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, secured the availability of supplies and provided consumers with quality food at reasonable prices."
"European citizens benefit significantly from agriculture in the form of food security, protection of the environment, combating climate change, sustaining rural communities and supporting farming families."
"For the CAP to continue delivering for European citizens and to meet their demands, it needs to be strongly supported, and that of course means a strong budget."
"Secondly transparency and proportionality should be central to the future CAP."
"European agricultural policy should support farmers with the main aim of producing high-quality food and not hinder them or burden them with excessive administrative requirements and red tape."
"Lastly, European farmers produce food to the highest quality and standards."
"All imports to the EU must be guaranteed to be produced to the same quality and standard as EU products."
"We also need to ensure a level playing field, fair competition and the future viability of European agriculture."
"- (CS) The greatest injustice of the current common agricultural policy consists in the fact that subsidies are portioned out in an unequal and unfair way between the old and new Member States."
"This year, farmers in the new Member States, which joined in 2004, will receive only 70% of what farmers receive in the old European Union of the so-called fifteen."
"Bulgarians and Romanians will receive a mere 40%."
"At the same time, all are operating in the common market of the European Union."
"I firmly believe that this injustice must be eliminated as soon as possible."
"All farmers throughout the Union must have an equal position and the same conditions for subsidies."
"I therefore support Amendment 6, which asks for this aim to be achieved as soon as possible, and I hope that my fellow Members will support it."
"(EL) Mr President, the common agricultural policy was designed to safeguard Europe's independence in food production."
"In the 1970s, nearly 70% of the EU budget was spent on agriculture."
"However, following a serious of competitive reforms, agricultural spending in the budget fell to 35% for the financial period 2007-2013."
"Unfortunately, today the revised CAP is being designed under the same conditions of competitiveness as the previous policy."
"It is insulting that the economic crisis is being used as a pretext to cut benefits to farmers."
"Moreover, it is the latter who are to blame for today's conditions of crisis."
"The basic objective of the new CAP should be to promote a global model compatible with healthy food, environmental protection and the fight against carbon dioxide emissions."
"We must not forget that the agrochemical model of conventional agriculture bears serious responsibility for the greenhouse effect and climate change and it must change, precisely because it works against the farmers, the people and the biodiversity of the planet."
"Mr President, I declare an interest as a working farmer."
"Plans for the future of the CAP have to work at a practical level and it must be affordable."
"The military have a phrase 'no names, no pack-drill'; however, a member of the PPE Group voted against this report in committee."
"This may be because, in today's financial climate, cost is a worry and the report's enthusiasm for non-agricultural objectives under pillar two diverts funds away from farmers."
"The report's obsession with climate change could lead to accepting advice that obliges arable farmers to pump tractor exhaust under the ground, increasing fuel consumption and spoiling seabeds as a consequence."
"My own experience of witnessing contractors' attempts to inject dirty water under the ground to satisfy EU rules tells me what problems lie ahead."
"Ruminant livestock farmers may be required to reduce methane emissions by replacing hay and silage with more expensive cereal-based rations."
"If there has to be a CAP, let it assist farmers and not hinder them."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, over the next few months we will be entering into a full debate on the new common agricultural policy (CAP)."
"It is important to reach a satisfactory agreement, and so I hope that the Belgian Presidency manages to achieve what the Spanish Presidency did not."
"I hope that the Belgian Presidency can direct discussions in such a way that the Member States commit themselves to maintaining a truly strong CAP in the future, with a sufficient budget for meeting the needs of the 27 Member States, both new and old;"
"I also hope that it will not be as it was in 2005, when there was a lack of money and a modulation had to be improvised."
"In the upcoming reform of the CAP, we are gambling with the viability of a sector that not only provides intangible goods and services, such as care for the environment, but must also guarantee the supply of food to the European public."
"We have witnessed distressing shortage situations in the past, which is why the European Parliament should make security of supply based on EU production the main objective of the next reform, without leaving aside other contributions, such as the fight against climate change."
"(FR) Mr President, I understand that you had a short and happy night."
"I thank the Commissioner for listening throughout this debate and I would like to congratulate Mr Lyon on the work he has carried out in connection with the report he is presenting this morning."
"What is the aim here?"
"To make people realise that, in today's world, agriculture, food and the environment are challenges for the whole of Europe."
"That is the aim."
"What do we mean by that?"
"Rejecting the renationalisation of the CAP and increasing cofinancing, that is the first point."
"Maintaining an agricultural budget that is a match for these challenges and this major issue of food security, that is the second point."
"Ensuring that agriculture can provide the public goods demanded by society, that is the third element."
"The fourth element is regulating and preventing market volatility, which I believe is essential."
"We must return to this topic and we need to go a little further still."
"My final point concerns the first and the second pillar."
"I warn all those who defend this structure - and they are perhaps right - that, ultimately, within the framework of the budgetary discussion, there is a danger of the first pillar being reduced significantly, with everything being transferred to the second pillar, itself cofinanced, which would contradict the objective we have set of avoiding the renationalisation of the common agricultural policy."
"I am saying that this morning because this is the debate we are holding."
"Commissioner, I would like to finish with a simple idea."
"The CAP was created at the same time as the European Economic Community."
"We are now in the European Union."
"I really feel that we ought to have a major policy ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, in this changing world it is vitally important that the common agricultural policy goes on changing so that it can be relevant to the challenges of the future and not live in the past."
"The reformed common agricultural policy is going to have a vitally important role to play in confronting issues like food security, market volatility and climate change, but I want to mention three other principles which, to my mind, are no less important."
"Firstly, we must recognise that the best way of achieving the goals of the common agricultural policy is to create a viable, dynamic farming sector and I do not think we should lose sight of that aim."
"Secondly, if you are going to achieve that, the common agricultural policy needs to be simpler, fairer and more transparent at point of delivery."
"Finally, it needs to deliver value for money."
"All nations and all sectors are experiencing tough economic times at present, and I caution this committee to be utterly realistic about its expectations from the European budget."
"To my mind, that means we should ensure that funds are used effectively."
"The rapporteur has produced an excellent report."
"I congratulate him on his work and am happy to support."
"Mr President, the future of the common agricultural policy will see increased focus on connecting it with climate change policy."
"In my constituency of Wales the existing schemes and pillar two will be replaced by the Glastir scheme that focuses on climate change objectives and carbon sequestration."
"Farmers will be paid per hectare for water conservation, reforestation and so forth. While reforming the CAP post 2013 it is important not to sacrifice pillar one for the sake of promoting new pillar two objectives."
"The single farm payment is vital for many farmers reliant on subsidies that could be stripped at the drop of a hat."
"If Welsh farmers are unhappy about Glastir arrangements, will they be offered sensible alternatives, or will they be penalised in any way for not adopting the scheme?"
"Choice without an alternative is no choice at all."
"Wales has a strong history of agriculture and many communities depend heavily upon farming."
"Current reforms of agricultural policy based solely upon climate change ideology could jeopardise the Welsh farming tradition and Wales's economic future."
"(ES) Mr President, the common agricultural policy (CAP) has been making efforts to adjust for a number of years, and we are now entering a new phase in this process of permanent reform."
"Commissioner, the Lyon report recognises the role that agriculture, as a strategic sector, can play in contributing to the priorities of the new Europe 2020 strategy."
"We want a strong CAP after 2013 that maintains its common character, without detriment to the specific nature of some sectors or regions."
"Its market orientation will continue as at present."
"However, growing market volatility, combined with the requirements of the Union's international commitments, may have a negative impact on farmers' incomes."
"We need a proper safety net."
"Direct aid must be financed entirely from the Union budget, and the CAP needs to have a budgetary allocation adequate for facing the new challenges and objectives ahead of it, at a level at least equal to that for 2013, as further cuts could compromise its effectiveness."
"Commissioner, our farmers will once more have to make efforts to adapt."
"Any changes that do take place must be accompanied by realistic transition periods."
"I would like to thank Mr Lyon and all of the shadow rapporteurs for their work."
"They have produced a report that we in Parliament can endorse, and which will be a positive signal for bringing to an end uncertainty for European farmers."
"Now we have a problem: there are 23 Members who have asked to speak during the 'catch the eye' session."
"As you know, the Rules of Procedure make provision for five to speak."
"Moreover, 57 minutes were anticipated for this entire debate, and we have so far taken 59, with the Commissioner not having spoken yet, nor the rapporteur to close the debate."
"As the issue seems to me to be very important - the evidence being the exceptional number of people who have asked to speak - we are going to allow 10 to speak, double the number for which there is provision."
"(PL) Mr President, Mr Cioloş, departure from the historical method of establishing levels of support and the introduction of a new and fair distribution of resources from the common agricultural policy between farmers from the whole of the European Union, without distinguishing between 'old' and 'new' Member States, is one of the most important challenges for the post-2013 common agricultural policy."
"I support the two-pillar model of support, in which payments are made to farmers and are designated for the development and modernisation of farms, and not to owners, who take the money but do not invest it in agriculture, hindering essential change."
"In accepting new challenges, the common agricultural policy must maintain its care for environmental values and food security."
"In addition, I propose leaving tried and tested instruments for market regulation untouched."
"Milk quotas are an example."
"If they are ended, what will we replace them with?"
"Of course, there are certain ideas, but we do not have any certainty ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(RO) I wish to congratulate the rapporteur, shadow rapporteurs and all those involved in this project which is particularly important to the future of the CAP."
"In a globalised world the European Union, with its Community market, must take uniform action in order to guarantee the security of food supply and promote renewable resources."
"It must also combat climate change and step up its research efforts in order to make the best use of the opportunities that research can offer."
"The CAP must offer prospects and a stable framework, which will encourage the development of agricultural production through increasing productivity and competitiveness, as well as ensure that the market operates properly, thereby guaranteeing strategic supply independence in all the key production sectors."
"I feel that it is crucial for us to maintain the common agricultural policy's two pillars, making a clear distinction where we have Pillar I, which is strong enough to ensure a fair standard of living for farmers in all Member States..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(FR) Mr President, first of all I would obviously like to thank our rapporteur, Mr Lyon, with whom I believe we all worked on the basis of mutual agreement to try to move forward, and I would like to say briefly, in just a few words, that the evidence is there for us to see."
"The evidence is that, today, Europe is a net importer of agricultural raw materials."
"We must have an ambitious agricultural and food policy so that we can ensure that our citizens' food needs are met."
"Furthermore, today we have a CAP that must be reformed for three reasons."
"It is a CAP that is unfair, economically, socially and environmentally."
"Economically: the amount paid to producers is less than their production costs, and the CAP must allow for this problem to be resolved."
"Socially: aid is unfairly distributed between countries, regions and farmers."
"Eighty per cent of aid is allocated to 20% of farmers."
"Environmentally: we need a CAP which respects the soil, which respects ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(NL) Mr President, in a nutshell, the following holds true of the common agricultural policy: we now have more countries, more priorities and less money."
"That therefore means that the CAP requires thorough reform and such reform requires starting from scratch."
"As food is the most important collective asset of the agricultural sector, food production must be ensured, especially with a view to food security over the coming decades."
"In addition, we want good-quality food in Europe and we set great store by animal welfare and the environment."
"Yet our farmers are not always rewarded by the market for these contributions to the public good."
"Their global competitors do not have to contend with such requirements or, if they do, the requirements which they have to meet are much lower."
"We therefore need support where the market fails."
"The fact that the report calls for aid per hectare is a positive thing."
"This will counteract further intensification of agriculture and make the achievement of environmental targets a more realistic prospect."
"That is how we can reward our farmers."
"(SK) We all know that the European Union's common agricultural policy is a very complex and sensitive issue."
"The continuing application of the so-called historical principle in respect of support for agriculture - even after the expansion of the EU - has brought considerable disproportion to European economic policy."
"It is therefore necessary to introduce objectively fair criteria to the system of sharing out financial support for farmers as soon as possible, as this will create the right conditions for proper economic competition between farmers on the single European market."
"The funding must be shared out properly and in a balanced way, so that farmers in all countries of the EU have the right to equal levels of support and may compete against each other fairly."
"In my opinion, we should therefore support Amendment 6 of the submitted report, which will help to bring justice to the support mechanism for European agricultural production."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, agricultural policy needs a coherent framework."
"This must strengthen the EU as a whole, while also taking regional differences into account."
"The second factor is particularly important for my home country, Austria, when one considers specific environmental and investment programmes."
"There are some enormous challenges facing agricultural policy."
"Estimates indicate that the world's population will grow to 9 billion people, while at the same time we find ourselves confronted with the effects of climate change, such as water shortages and drought."
"In order to resolve these problems, it is essential not only that the EU should cooperate more effectively internally, but also that it should operate in a coherent manner worldwide."
"Mr President, today's discussion has been very encouraging from all sides of the House from an agricultural point of view."
"I particularly welcome the emphasis on encouraging young people into agriculture, which is absolutely vital; that there should be no renationalisation of the CAP; that the Commissioner said the two pillars should be maintained because without pillar one there will be no need for pillar two since it would be unprofitable to farm and therefore public goods would not be guaranteed; and, as Mrs Dodd said, we need to look at what we mean by 'fair', particularly taking into account varying costs and purchasing power right across the Union."
"Also, Mr Lyon alone referred to the historical basis."
"I think it is very important for farmers right now that a clear signal be sent to them as to what is likely to happen, so that they will not be left to wild speculation, not knowing whether to buy or sell stock based on the historic model."
"I would therefore welcome a clear signal on that from the Commissioner as soon as possible."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to thank and congratulate our fellow Member, Mr Lyon, for his excellent report, which represents a first positive step towards a recast of the CAP."
"The objective with the new CAP is to have a major European agricultural, food, social and environmental policy, not a Europe that is all about the unbridled free market."
"We want the CAP to be more legitimate in terms of public resources pledged and accepted by the taxpayer, fairer in the distribution of European funds among the 27 Member States and among farmers, and more effective in the proper use of public money."
"New public mechanisms for regulating agricultural production will have to be established to ensure the food security of consumers."
"We are in favour of a strong CAP that has the budget it needs to achieve its objectives."
"To this end, the Lyon report quite rightly underlines the emergence of new challenges that the CAP will face: in particular climate change, water management, renewable energies, biodiversity and soil erosion."
"This report calls for a simpler, more responsible CAP that responds more effectively to the needs of European farmers, in the interests of consistency and of preserving ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the common agricultural policy (CAP) is essential and will continue to be so for a long time yet, not least where employment is concerned."
"In Europe agricultural employment has fallen by 25% in less than 10 years, with the loss of almost 4 million jobs."
"If we want to solve the pressing unemployment issue, we cannot allow the CAP to drift and we must invest in it by guaranteeing adequate resources that lead to lasting growth."
"Therefore, the new CAP will have to guarantee at least the same level of funding as in the past."
"However, Commissioner, Parliament's request to you today is not to guarantee the same level of funding, but to increase it."
"The ultimate, non-negotiable requirement is for the funding that exists today to be matched, but the request is to increase - to increase substantially - the funding for agriculture."
"The Lyon report contains some highly positive elements, measures to curb price volatility, to support the sector, to guarantee farmers a fair income and to guarantee the current ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(PT) Mr President, we also advocate a strong common agricultural policy, aimed not only at farmers but also at the more than 500 million citizens of Europe, which is equipped with an ambitious budget capable of addressing the growing challenges that we face and, above all, which is in operation in all the European regions."
"Ensuring that this comes about is crucial to the Azores, where agriculture is an irreplaceable pillar of the sustainable development model."
"This new CAP should abandon historical criteria for allocating funds, as this has been greatly detrimental to Portugal and Portuguese farmers."
"The new CAP should take account of the specific character of agriculture, providing a set of tools for market regulation and risk management, capable of ensuring proper market functioning and stability of agricultural production."
"The CAP post-2013 should enhance the competitiveness of the European agricultural model, ensuring the proper distribution of value on the domestic market, generated by relations established along the food chain, and opening external markets ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"I have two requests to speak in relation to observance of the Rules of Procedure."
"Mrs McGuinness has the floor first."
"Mr President, just a point of order;"
"I know other colleagues will share my concern about 'catch the eye' and you are all-powerful in this regard, but Members who are on the Agricultural Committee, who have actually worked on this dossier for a long time and who were at this debate at its very inception, in my view, deserve to have their considered opinions heard, and I could not catch your eye because you would not look at me, although I caught six other eyes around you, Mr President."
"Could I ask, while I have the floor, the Commission to comment on the possibility of less-favoured areas moving to pillar one?"
"I will put in a written statement on this issue."
"I hope you support my point, colleagues."
"Mrs McGuinness, I assure you that I have been looking at you nearly the entire time, and that I have seen you asking for the floor."
"However, the problem is that this item is not structured like that: in other words, it is not structured so as to give priority to members of the corresponding committee, but is structured so as to give priority to those Members who 'catch the eye' of the President before anybody else."
"Those are the Rules of Procedure."
"Moreover, it is stipulated that five shall speak, although we have given 10 the floor."
"This is a very important issue."
"The time for the groups was shared between Members so that everyone could have a minute, but almost nobody has spoken for less than a minute and a half, and so there is no way of responding positively, as we would all like, to anyone who wishes to contribute outside the time allocated to their corresponding groups."
"Now Mr Obermayr has the floor, also in relation to observance of the Rules of Procedure."
"(DE) Mr President, I assume you were referring to me."
"I would like to pick up on what the previous speaker said."
"Of course I would like to thank you for your generosity in allowing ten speakers rather than five."
"We understand your time constraints, naturally, but I hope you will understand us too."
"This is a very important issue."
"There are parts of Europe that are operating under a considerable burden and that are under extreme threat."
"Naturally this is also true beyond the work of the committees."
"Secondly, you indicated that the problem regarding the 'catch the eye' procedure has not been resolved."
"We would ask that this issue be resolved as soon as possible, because I do not know if we should start forming a queue the day before, or make a submission three days in advance and then spend the night here so that we might finally get a chance to speak."
"It is also important, if only 10 speakers are to be heard, that we should be told who the 10 are."
"It would be helpful and fair to put the appropriate structures in place as soon as possible."
"That way, you will experience less stress and will be all the more popular if you can allow more people to speak."
"We will also be happy to have a solution that is fair to us."
"I beg your indulgence and thank you again for your understanding."
"You are absolutely right."
"This idea of 'catching the eye' of the President is clearly entirely subjective, as the President has an eye, but he does not have a wide and multi-faceted eye like a reptile's, meaning that those who catch his eye are those who catch his eye; the secretarial staff can help a great deal with this."
"Nevertheless, you are right: this is an issue that has not been handled in a reasonable manner - I understand this - by the Parliamentary Bureau."
"For example, what Mrs McGuinness says, that members of the corresponding committee should have priority, seems entirely reasonable to me, but provision has not been made for that."
"The only provision made is that it is the President who runs the debate as he sees fit, which clearly puts the President in extremely complicated positions."
"Furthermore, the Members themselves do not follow the Rules of Procedure, as the blue card is not to be used for asking to speak during 'catch the eye'."
"The blue card is to be used for interrupting the speaker who is speaking at that moment, in order to ask him or her a 30-second question."
"However, there are Members here who are constantly getting the blue card out."
"We will have to have a short course for Members to learn that the blue card has a specific use, and that in order to ask to speak during 'catch the eye', one has to raise one's hand, raise one's white card, or use some other mechanism rather than the blue card."
"However, I do not wish to prolong the debate."
"We have fallen quite far behind, and there could have been two or three contributions during the time that we have spent on this issue."
"Member of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, I am not sure if many questions have been asked."
"I certainly noticed that some principles have been affirmed, which, as we have seen, were well reflected in the report."
"In any case, the main thing I have taken from this debate is that we need a common agricultural policy, an agricultural policy that must be a Community policy, and that we also need a budget which must be commensurate with the objectives that we set for agriculture."
"I therefore feel that we need a realistic budget."
"In my opinion a realistic budget is a budget that is in keeping with the objectives set for the common agricultural policy."
"What we notice is that we are demanding more and more of our farmers."
"Of course we are also demanding that the resources provided are used more effectively and accounted for in a clearer way."
"Incidentally, I see that my colleague, Mr Lewandowski, the Commissioner for Budgets, is here; perhaps he has come specifically to confirm to us that the CAP will have a budget commensurate with the objectives that we set it."
"I have also taken away the fact that, if agriculture - the common agricultural policy - is to achieve the objectives that we set it, we must take into account all the differences between all the types of agriculture that exist in the European Union."
"We must take this diversity into account so that, in the regions where it expresses itself, these different types of agriculture can help achieve objectives not just regarding market supply, production and security of market supply, but also a move towards better recognition of the environment, the management of natural resources, and economic development capacities in rural areas."
"We must reflect on how agriculture and the agri-food sector can contribute to this."
"I also took on board the fact that all of these thoughts on the future of the common agricultural policy must also help encourage young people, must give prospects to young people who want to become established, who want to invest in agriculture, so that agricultural activity is also an activity of the future and so that we can achieve our objectives."
"I also want to send out a clear message and to answer Mr Kelly's question about direct aid."
"I do not think there is any doubt that, if we are to have fairer agriculture and a more transparent and more effective common agricultural policy, we must define clear criteria for the distribution of this direct aid in line with the objectives that we are going to set."
"Therefore, in my opinion, historic references do not constitute fair, transparent or objective criteria."
"We need to replace these historic references with much clearer objectives, which will create a certain amount of fairness and enable the agricultural diversity that exists in the European Union to be better taken into account."
"That will give the Member States and regions the means to get a better return out of the resources they have."
"To conclude, I would like to reaffirm that we need a common agricultural policy for Europe."
"We need a common agricultural policy for the entire European Union and, of course, a common agricultural policy which does not prevent the other regions of the world from developing their own agriculture."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, could I first of all just touch on some of the key themes that colleagues have raised during this debate."
"A new strategic importance for food production and the CAP: absolutely."
"Two pillars: absolutely, I agree with that."
"Food production at the heart of the CAP: yes, that is absolutely what the CAP is about."
"The rest are all add-ons to ensure that we have a profitable farming sector to be able to deliver the environmental benefits, to tackle climate change and all the other things we set out in the report."
"A strong budget: yes, absolutely; fair to old and new Member States: so many Members raised that as an issue, and it is an issue we need to address."
"It needs to be objective and transparent as to how money is allocated between Member States."
"They need to meet the challenges of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"It is absolutely essential that farming and the CAP are seen as part of the solution to meeting these objectives, and not part of the problem."
"I would like to pay tribute to Michel Dantin, Mr Häusling, Mr Olejniczak and Jim Nicholson, my shadow rapporteurs."
"We had tremendous cooperation in bringing together what I believe is a very strong report that sets out a clear vision of where this Parliament wants to see the CAP head after 2013."
"I would say that it puts this Parliament in a very powerful position when it comes to dealing and negotiating with the Commission and with the Farm Council."
"I would say to you, Commissioner, come alongside us and we can make sure that we deliver that vision together."
"(Applause)"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today, Thursday 8 July 2010, at 12.00."
"I would like to apologise once again to those Members who we have not been able to allow to speak."
"As Mrs McGuinness says, they may present their contribution in writing."
"I will be putting this issue to the Bureau, as it is one that needs clarifying."
"I will also be proposing to the Bureau - and I hope that you will all support this - that permission to speak during 'catch the eye' proceedings should not be granted to Members who are not present when the debate begins, when the rapporteur presents his or her report, or when the Commissioner takes the floor."
"We have a situation where Members have been indignant that they were not allowed to speak, but have not stayed to hear either the Commissioner or the rapporteur explain and set out the conclusions."
"An effort needs to be made towards rigour, but it needs to be made by all of us."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The common agricultural policy (CAP) is one of the European Union's most important policies, when we consider that agricultural expenditure accounts for around 43% of the EU budget."
"Under Article 33 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, the objectives of the CAP are to guarantee reasonable prices for European consumers and a fair standard of living for farmers."
"The recent economic and financial crisis resulted in an average 12.2% reduction in farmers' incomes between 2008 and 2009, stricter conditions on accessing credit and an increase in the unemployment rate in rural areas."
"The volatility of the prices of products on the agricultural markets has sharply increased and this increase is expected to continue."
"I therefore believe that provision should be made in the future CAP for a minimum safety net so that market price uncertainty can be managed and rapid, effective solutions provided for economic crises in the sector."
"The Food and Agriculture Organisation estimates that, by 2050, the world population will increase from the current 6 billion to 9 billion, and that doubling the demand for food will require an associated increase in global food production."
"Therefore, food security will be the main challenge for future agriculture, and the onus will be on the Union to continue to guarantee it for the sake of European citizens."
"Adapting the CAP to the new social and economic realities is a necessary step."
"We actually need to answer some key questions to be able to do this."
"I totally concur with the need to guarantee security of food supply."
"However, to what point do we want to be independent and how willing are we to pay more for this?"
"Until now, the CAP has kept prices high for foods which are cheaper in other countries."
"The EU cannot promote free trade while protecting its own agricultural market."
"Solutions need to be found which will allow the EU to enforce proper global quality standards so that the discrepancy between prices for agricultural products in the various countries can be narrowed."
"However, I am concerned most about the impact which the CAP reforms have had on farmers."
"Decoupling payments has only succeeded in channelling direct payments to the major land owners, who are definitely not farmers."
"Decoupling is necessary to avoid overproduction."
"However, I call on the Commission to put forward some fairer criteria so that farmers can be the real beneficiaries of the CAP."
"We need incentives for farmers, especially to encourage young people to move to rural areas."
"However, this is not going to happen while maintaining the current direct payments system, which is ridiculous."
"in writing. - The common agricultural policy (CAP) has the potential to offer solutions to many of the problems currently affecting European farms, and this is obvious in no EU Member State more than in Ireland, where there is an equal commitment to both secure a fair and full CAP agreement and to move forward by implementing the changes necessary in 21st century farming."
"However, in order to secure the trust and commitment of Europe's agricultural community, the new CAP needs to offer stability to farmers and a fair price, as is currently provided, for the goods which they produce."
"In return, European citizens will receive not just reliable, high-quality goods which are guaranteed to have been farmed to the EU's high standards of practice, but will also benefit from the societal and cultural implications of the CAP, such as those contained in Pillar II."
"Above all, the EU needs to retain the trust of European farmers."
"The agricultural community is aware that change is on the way with this new agreement, and is currently poised to embrace it."
"In order to take advantage of this positive relationship, the institutions of the EU must ensure an agreement that is modern while being full and fair for all."
"Europe will still need an effective and common agricultural policy after 2013."
"This is why the EU's agricultural budget should at least be maintained at the current level."
"Europe has a particular responsibility to guarantee food safety in the world."
"This is because it is in Europe that the safest food can be produced under the most stringent environmental protection standards."
"Therefore, the main task of the CAP is to preserve the agricultural production capacity of the European Union."
"It is therefore vital to ensure that direct payments do not decrease."
"In the case of the rural development support under the second pillar, it must be ensured that they are used primarily for agricultural purposes."
"Farmers should be protected from the extreme fluctuations in intervention prices that have been common over the past few years."
"We need market intervention tools and, in certain sectors, such as wine and milk, measures are needed to limit supply."
"These would reduce farmers' losses arising from price fluctuations."
"The European food trade is much more concentrated than the food processing industry or agricultural production."
"Very often, hundreds of farmers are competing with a large hypermarket chain, and their bargaining position is much worse."
"This is why we must help improve cooperation between farmers."
"However, this requires an exemption from the stringent EU competition rules in agriculture."
"Third country imports should be subjected to the same stringent environmental protection, food safety, animal welfare and other regulations as European farmers."
"Mr Lyon's own-initiative report involves Parliament at an early stage in the debate regarding the future of the CAP."
"I would like to thank all those involved for the work they have done."
"Forward-looking targets have been formulated for the entire Community."
"For me there are three elementary points to be considered if we are to continue to secure comprehensive and sustainable agricultural development throughout Europe."
"1. It is vital that we ensure that the CAP is adequately funded post 2013 and that we produce an appropriate budget."
"2. The tried-and-tested two-pillar structure must be retained with a strong first pillar and an equally strong second pillar."
"The only way that we can maintain the European agricultural model is to ensure the production of our food to the highest standards in the first pillar and, in the second pillar, to provide good prospects for the development of rural areas, and job creation and infrastructure for farmers and non-farmers, male and female and, in particular, for young people."
"3. The major fluctuations in the liberalised markets and the effects of climate change continue to necessitate a safety net."
"New objectives have arisen for us in terms of market orientation, product safety, animal protection and the need for environmental protection and biodiversity as a result of climate change."
"In the face of these challenges, good agricultural policy is the best policy for the future and is in the interests of all our citizens."
"in writing. - (LV) This resolution involves a transition from area as the historical basis for determining direct support payments in the next financial planning period."
"We thus provide for the possibility of a transitional period."
"Such a period is essential, but a full seven years would be an excessively long transitional period."
"Dragging our feet in implementing the new method could negatively impact the attainment of an important objective of the CAP reform - support that is targeted, fair, balanced, simple and transparent."
"One argument in favour of preserving the CAP budget at its 2013 level is the justified expectations of the new Member States that CAP support will in their case be comparable with that provided to the older Member States."
"I am convinced that the CAP can be powerful and truly common only if it is intended to secure fair competition between all European farmers."
"Undistorted competition in Europe is also a precondition for the competitiveness of European farmers in world markets."
"I should like to highlight the political will expressed in the resolution to strengthen the position of primary producers in the food supply chain, so that primary producers' organisations can become more effective and so that they can talk to large retailers and processing businesses on equal terms."
"I hope that the rural development element in the CAP will be consolidated and that the main focus of attention in rural development strategy will be on rural communities, environmental improvement, the modernisation and restructuring of agriculture, the strengthening of cohesion, an improvement in the sale of produce and competitiveness, job preservation and creation in rural areas, and on climate change, renewable energy and biodiversity."
"The future of the common agricultural policy after 2013 is extremely important for us."
"Many important things depend on the CAP - the structure of the European Union budget and the future of agriculture, farmers and rural areas."
"The entire European Parliament needs to be aware of the CAP's significance for the future of the EU."
"What is crucial is, of course, the matter of direct payments, as is the need to eliminate disparities between them in different countries."
"Today, differences between the level of payments in different Member States are too great."
"This undermines the sense of solidarity, equality and community."
"What farmers need most of all is stable incomes, both now and in the longer term."
"Without this it is very difficult to modernise farms, and it will be difficult to maintain the beneficial influence of agriculture on the natural and cultural environment."
"Therefore, let us endeavour to help ensure that future changes in the common agricultural policy lead to stable incomes for European farmers. Thank you very much."
"in writing. - I welcome this report which is the first step in examining the shape and nature of the common agricultural policy (CAP) post 2013."
"This report reaffirms that there will be a CAP post 2013, that it should remain a common policy and that its budget should be at least maintained at current levels."
"The report is firm on keeping the policy an EU one, rejecting attempts to re-nationalise it."
"Farmers should take heart that this Parliament understands their concerns."
"The CAP post 2013 should support active producers and reward them for the food they produce and the many public goods they provide to society - including high animal welfare and environmental standards."
"Market support measures will be essential in providing adequate safety nets against extreme market volatility which is likely to be a feature of the market in the future."
"Only seven per cent of the EU's farmers are under 35 years of age - this is a stark reminder that we need to ensure that the conditions exist to keep young people farming."
"It is essential that there should be a strong focus on young generations in the CAP post 2013 so to provide for the development of agriculture in an innovative and efficient way."
"To begin with I want to thank my colleague Mr Lyon for drafting a very balanced report."
"I believe that this has already allowed us to create a good basis for discussion for the near future."
"Changing agricultural policy is perhaps one of the biggest tasks of this plenary session."
"It is true that we will only begin to taste the fruit of these laws much later, perhaps ten years later."
"Although the most important task of agriculture is to provide food, the importance of agriculture to the public interest is increasingly recognised, whether this manifests itself in social policy, environment or culture."
"A relatively small part of the population actually feeds 100% of the people, uses land economically and looks after the social balance of rural areas throughout the European Union."
"The report is a good basis for further discussions. Thank you for your attention."
"in writing. - (DE) I thank the rapporteur."
"Many ideas from my group have been worked into the report before us, and now we have a very good result."
"Our primary goal must be to ensure high-quality food production in Europe."
"In the discussion on the organisation of agrarian reform, there was frequent talk of compensation of public goods."
"In my opinion, this debate goes in the right direction."
"Only if the citizens of the EU are convinced that efforts are really being made and money is not simply being paid out across the board will the common agricultural policy get the recognition that it deserves."
"The development of rural areas plays an ever greater role."
"In order to prevent the obliteration and desertification of our agriculture, we must develop further instruments that will stop the rural exodus."
"Active rural areas are an attractive living environment not just for farmers, but also for people who do not want to live in cities."
"We should approve the report as it stands with a large majority in plenary in order to send a clear outward signal."
"When the European integration process started, the common agricultural policy not only secured food supply for the population, it also laid the foundation for a modern European agriculture and other specific policies."
"However, the European Union recently gained 12 new Member States."
"This means that the EU acquired a new agricultural population of 7 million people in addition to the 6 million it had before 2004."
"In addition, following the accession of the new Member States, the EU's agricultural land of 130 million hectares increased by 40% to 185 million. At the time of accession, new Member States anticipated that, in time, their farmers would receive the same level of support from the CAP as farmers in the old Member States."
"However, this can only be achieved if the resources dedicated to agricultural policy are not reduced after 2013."
"The EU must take into consideration the different situations and needs of Member States, as European agriculture will only promote the interests of Member States, farmers and citizens alike if resources are not distributed unfairly due to differences in modernisation levels."
"The common agricultural policy requires fundamental and bold reform which takes into account the particular situation of new Member States."
"Maintaining the CAP is only reasonable in the eyes of European taxpayers and defensible at negotiations with ministries of finance if we can show that in addition to European food safety, agriculture can also provide social and environmental public goods for society."
"I believe that only a major reform can save the common agricultural policy."
"The agricultural investments of new Member States should be supported with subsidised benefits, otherwise European agriculture will operate at two, or, taking into account the situation in Romania and Bulgaria, three different rates of development."
"This will further increase the gap between the EU15 and the 12 new Member States."
"The achievement of 'green' agriculture in Europe and the production of environmental public goods require new investments, especially in the new Member States."
"Farmers should not be punished, but given financial incentives to help them purchase machines that allow environmentally and soil-friendly cultivation, gene pool replacement for cultivated species and investments to protect the environment and water purity."
"In reforming the CAP, we must not forget the principles of integration, solidarity and community."
"Direct payments significantly affect the security of food supplies."
"Not only do they help stabilise farmers' incomes, but they also compensate for the costs of having to comply with the ever greater requirements being imposed on agriculture."
"If we do not eliminate the disparities in the level of direct support, this instrument - the main financial instrument of the CAP - will continue to divide the European Union into old and new Member States."
"Departure from the historical criteria of distribution would not only be a symbolic gesture of fuller integration, but would also contribute to ensuring equal conditions of competition in a single Community market."
"Furthermore, it is essential that rural development strategy continue to be a key element of the CAP, supporting economic and social development in a broad sense."
"A fundamental role is being played, here, by continued restructuring and modernisation of farms as well as by the many innovations intended to increase efficiency and improve competitiveness in an enlarged Union."
"A strong second pillar is an opportunity to help young farmers make a start in agriculture as well as to improve quality of life, activate society and improve the situation of women in rural areas."
"Implications for EU agriculture of the reopening of negotiations with Mercosur with a view to concluding an Association Agreement - Preparations for the forthcoming EU-Brazil summit on 14 July 2010 in Brasilia (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on:"
"the oral question to the Commission on the implications for EU agriculture of the reopening of negotiations with Mercosur with a view to concluding an Association Agreement, by Mrs McGuinness, Mr Deß, Mr Papastamkos, Mrs Mathieu, Mrs Nedelcheva, Mr Dantin, Mr La Via, Mrs Jeggle, Mr Jahr, Mrs Klaß, Mrs Köstinger, Mrs De Lange, Mr Silvestris, Mrs Lulling, Mr Glattfelder, Mrs Herranz García, Mr Mato Adrover, Mr Dorfmann, Mr Kalinowski, Mr Daul, Mrs Patrão Neves, Mr Siekierski, Mr Béchu, Mr Niculescu, Mr Mayer and Mr Audy, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), Mr Nicholson and Mr Wojciechowski, on behalf of the European Conservatives and Reformists, Mr Bové, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, Mr Lyon, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, Mr Capoulas Santos and Mrs Kadenbach, on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament (O-0079/2010/rev.2 - B7-0315/2010), and"
"the oral question to the Commission on preparations for the forthcoming EU-Brazil summit on 14 July 2010 in Brasilia, by Mr Yáñez-Barnuevo García, on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament - B7-0317/2010)."
"author. - Mr President, thank you for your clarification on the one minute, but can I just take this opportunity: a point of order."
"I was one of the authors of the first oral question."
"I am not at all happy that we now have a joint debate with two questions merging."
"I have tried since May to get the Mercosur question on the agenda."
"I do not believe it should be a joint question, and I want to make my opposition to what has happened this morning absolutely fulsome."
"I do not know how this happened or why this happened."
"I am extremely unhappy about it."
"Can I come back to this in the debate?"
"I would like a clarification please, and I hope other colleagues will support me."
"Mrs McGuinness, as you know, because you are a veteran Member of this House, it is the Conference of Presidents that has decided that the debate should be organised in this way, and so this is how it is being done."
"I have, naturally, taken note of your dissatisfaction on this issue, but I would ask you to understand that we are not going to start a debate about it now, because otherwise none of the Members who are supposed to be speaking will be able to do so."
"author. - Mr President, I think we are in trouble here this morning because of a lack of consultation."
"I would have thought, as the authors of the Mercosur question, we should at least have been afforded the decency of being consulted as to why this has happened."
"I know the Conference of Presidents is the be all and the end all, but, Mr President, you are a very distinguished member of the Bureau of this Parliament and I hope you will take back to the Bureau the message that when agriculture is debated in this Parliament you have to give enough time for it."
"Clearly there was not enough time this morning."
"You saw the demand and you saw the problem."
"Can we get this Parliament to work for the Members of Parliament, not for the administration of Parliament?"
"We are the people elected here to represent our people, not the administration, which is paid big fat salaries..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr Nicholson, we have taken note of your words and will naturally pass your concerns on to the Parliamentary Bureau."
"It is not the administration that organises debates."
"The administration helps the political bodies organise debates."
"author. - Mr President, it is not because it is summertime and we are all cross."
"It is just because we make very valid points and we take our jobs seriously."
"I am going to take 30 seconds because I have two blank pages."
"I have asked five questions of the Commission."
"I do not intend to speak before I hear the answers."
"I will return at the end of the debate."
"Thank you very much, Mrs McGuinness."
"I will grant you later the time that you have not used now."
"author. - Mr President, I think many were taken by surprise at the recent decision by the Commission to reopen the negotiations with Mercosur on a free trade agreement."
"As we enter into a period where we will see reform of the CAP, and we have just been debating that, everyone knows that agriculture will be a major part of that agreement."
"While I accept that the Commission services are within their rights to reopen discussions, they would have been much better advised to inform Parliament of their intentions."
"This issue has the possibility to open Pandora's box in many sectors of Europe's agriculture industry, and I therefore seriously question the wisdom of embarking upon any future deal."
"There are serious ongoing problems in Brazil and Argentina with regard to animal traceability and other health and safety issues."
"The most recent report by the FAO mission in the state of Santa Catarina concluded that there were very few controls on cattle passing from Argentina to Brazil, or indeed between the different states in Brazil."
"By the same token, ear-tagging rules were not enforced."
"These are only some examples of the many I could list from the FAO report last October."
"I must tell the Commissioner very straightforwardly that if he persists down this route he will be opposed every step of the way."
"I can to some extent understand why this may seem like an attractive option, as WTO discussions do not progress with any speed, but I really do believe that this has the potential to destroy the WTO."
"If Mercosur succeeds in achieving a deal with the EU, why should these countries continue to participate in WTO negotiations?"
"You must understand that there will be no reduction in the level of standards of animal health welfare or traceability."
"Consumers and producers in the European Union must be protected, and I do not think that a trade deal with Mercosur will achieve this."
"Indeed, it will have entirely the opposite effect."
"Mr President, Commissioner, reopening negotiations with Mercosur when the European Union is getting ready to redefine its agricultural policy reveals a dangerous lack of consistency on the part of the Commission."
"Europe already imports 500 000 tonnes of beef."
"Opening up our market even further would be to the disadvantage of the cattle breeders of Europe's less-favoured areas, without any guarantee of respect for health and social standards."
"We cannot accept this."
"Europe buys 38 million tonnes of soya and feed for cattle."
"These imports from Brazil and Argentina monopolise more than 19 million hectares."
"They are concentrated in the hands of three enterprises: Cargill, ADM and Bunch."
"Between 2001 and 2004 soya destroyed more than 1.2 million hectares of tropical and equatorial forest."
"It is one of the principal causes of the increase in greenhouse gas emissions and the loss of biodiversity."
"The European Parliament has decided to produce a report on the recovery of autonomy in respect of vegetable proteins for livestock feed."
"This decision is motivated by the need to have environmentally friendly agriculture and to combat climate change."
"These efforts will be completely undone by this draft bilateral agreement."
"Once again the European Commission is selling short its farming and its farmers in order to obtain chance gains for service companies."
"These concessions will not serve the interests of the farming families of Mercosur, only those of agro-industrial groups."
"Convincing evidence of this can be found in the report by the Tyson group, a US corporation and heavyweight in the international meat market, which announced that it has invested in Brazil - I quote, and it is in its report - to use this country as a platform for exporting to Europe."
"Other enterprises, such as the Doux Group, had already anticipated this move by buying out the Brazilian Frangosul Group in 1998."
"Many poultry farmers, particularly in Brittany, paid the price for that deal."
"Europe seems to want to pursue its policy of relocation by intensifying its attacks against farmers."
"We must stop this insane process by offering our citizens quality, locally produced food."
"author. - Mr President, I will try and be brief."
"There are real concerns about the reopening of the negotiations with Mercosur."
"I represent Scotland, which has extensive beef production."
"This is a high-cost system, and it is vital that this production system continues if Scotland is not to see much of its land area abandoned because of cheap imports flooding into the market."
"There is real concern that we might see our Scottish beef industry sacrificed due to the need to negotiate and agree a deal with the Mercosur countries."
"I would therefore like to raise a number of questions about this, which is not just a Scottish issue, but is also an issue for the Irish or French and right across Europe."
"In particular, I would like to ask you why there seems to have been no consultation with this Parliament and with Parliament's Committee on Agriculture before the announcement was made."
"Surely, in the interests of courtesy at least, informing us ahead of the announcement would have helped try and ensure reasonable relations between Parliament and yourself on this issue."
"Secondly, what negotiating mandate will the negotiators have in terms of agricultural products?"
"Can someone please tell me what they are being allowed to negotiate on?"
"How many tonnes of beef?"
"How much access?"
"Is there no tariff, or are there minimum tariffs?"
"Can someone please tell us what the mandate is?"
"Two other points."
"When is an impact study going to be carried out to find out what the impact of any deal might be, regardless of its size?"
"At the very least, we should know what the impact is before we sign up to something, especially at a time when we are renegotiating the CAP and we are deciding how future farm support is decided."
"The two are completely linked and therefore we need to understand what the impact will be."
"Finally, what involvement does the Agriculture Commissioner have on this issue?"
"To date, we have heard very little as to what his role will be in this negotiation, and whether he is responsible for setting the mandate for your negotiators."
"Will this Parliament be consulted before any final agreement is reached?"
"I would like to hear some answers to these questions."
"I would like to call everybody's attention to the fact that the speakers who have contributed so far, including Mr Capoulas Santos, are the authors of the first question that we are debating, and that the speaker who is to follow, Mr Yáñez-Barnuevo García, is the author of the second question."
"author. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Latin America as a whole and the Mercosur countries in particular are strategic partners of the European Union."
"We share a common history and social values with them."
"Moreover, it is a geopolitical area where freedom, democracy and respect for human rights have been making remarkable progress."
"The deepening of political and cultural ties and maximising mutual benefits in economic terms therefore makes perfect sense."
"I therefore welcome the European decision to reopen negotiations on the association agreement with Mercosur, although I regret and condemn Argentina's recent protectionist actions, which are totally in contrast with the spirit of openness shown by the European side."
"However, I must alert the Commission to the potentially negative consequences for the European agricultural sector if these negotiations are not handled with care."
"We all know the extent of the imbalance in our trade with Mercosur and the respective production conditions and requirements for farmers on both sides of the Atlantic."
"For this reason, along with the questions that were formally submitted in writing, particularly the one asking how the Commission intends to address the issue of sensitive products, I would like to know how it intends to react to Argentina's understandable action."
"author. - (ES) Mr President, today is a day for congratulations: the first of these is due to the Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Moratinos, who has succeeded in bringing a number of Cuban political prisoners to Spain, or is on the point of doing so; also to Guillermo Fariñas, the political prisoner who, through his hunger strike, tenacity and sacrifice, has achieved freedom for these prisoners."
"Above all, turning now to the issue that brings us here, I would like to congratulate the Council for starting negotiations on a major trade agreement, which is also political and relates to cooperation, between the European Union and Mercosur, which was decided upon at the Madrid Summit on 18 May of this year."
"Contrary to what is being said, Parliament has expressed its support repeatedly for these negotiations, within the Delegation for Relations with Mercosur Countries, the Delegation on the Euro-Latin American Parliamentary Assembly (EuroLat) and the plenary sittings themselves of several parliamentary sessions."
"We are talking about what could and should be the most extensive trade agreement in existence in the world, which will bring development, well-being, progress and employment to 800 million people, and spectacularly increase the exchange of goods, merchandise and services between the two regions."
"Agriculture is only one part of this macro-agreement."
"Balanced agreements will need to be sought during the negotiations, but not with the mentality of protectionism, which is the enemy of development and well-being;"
"European protectionism and also protectionism by some of the Mercosur countries."
"In any case, industry and services represent 97% of European gross domestic product, and agriculture only 2.1%."
"Fears therefore need to be faced in terms of their proper proportions and justification."
"Commissioner, the next European Union-Brazil Summit, on 14 July, should serve, then, to promote and accelerate these negotiations, the completion of which has acquired even more importance during the economic crisis that we are going through; this agreement will contribute to a solution for it."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, as this is a joint debate and with the agreement of the Chair, I would like to address both the agricultural implications of an association agreement with Mercosur and the forthcoming Summit at the beginning of the session."
"I am thus happy to respond in any format decided by the Chair."
"Starting with Mercosur, the relaunching of negotiations for an association agreement with Mercosur is of utmost importance for the EU, both politically and economically."
"Politically, Mercosur is the largest regional integration project in Latin America, which makes it superfluous to insist on the geopolitical importance of strengthening our ties with the continent."
"We have agreements in place with Chile and Mexico, and recently finalised negotiations with Colombia, Peru and Central America, so it is only logical to engage with Mercosur as well."
"In economic terms, a successful agreement could bring considerable benefits to both the EU and Mercosur."
"In these difficult economic times, we cannot afford to overlook the potential of this agreement for our two regions in terms of jobs and growth."
"Mercosur is a large and dynamic economic entity with a combined GDP of EUR 1 300 billion and with GDP growth rates expected to reach around 5% in 2010 and 4% in 2011. It is an increasingly important partner for the EU."
"In terms of EU exports, it ranks on a par with India and ahead of countries such as Canada or Korea."
"Over the past four years until the crisis hit, EU exports to Mercosur increased by more than 15% annually."
"In terms of foreign direct investments, Mercosur is also a key partner."
"EU investments in Mercosur amount to more than EUR 165 billion - more than EU investments in China, India and Russia together."
"Given its size and potential, and also the fact that Mercosur is still a relatively protected market, the economic gains for EU business could be among the most important of the free trade agreements recently concluded or currently being negotiated by the EU with major trade partners such as Korea or India."
"Relaunching these negotiations is also a sign of the commitment of both regions to continuing to promote free trade and to reject protectionism."
"The Commission has taken this decision after a thorough examination and in-depth internal debate."
"In reaching this decision, the Commission positively valued the indications given by Mercosur, during the informal dialogue at technical level, on issues like trade in goods, public procurement or some services sectors."
"Let me add that immediately after the College had taken the decision I came to the INTA Committee and we discussed in depth the relaunching of the negotiations."
"I could even add that the Council is of the opinion that I treated the European Parliament much better than I treated them, so they were not pleased at all."
"We did this is on the basis of the mandate that we have, so we did not need a new mandate."
"This was a proper decision of the College, and Parliament was extensively informed immediately afterwards."
"However, it must be very clear that the forthcoming attitude of our Mercosur partners surely allows negotiations to be relaunched, but is of course no guarantee of a successful conclusion."
"That is something quite different."
"In order to conclude, we will need to negotiate an ambitious agreement, notably in sectors such as trade in goods and services, or intellectual property, including geographical indications."
"The first meeting with Mercosur took place last week in Buenos Aires."
"It was a rather technical round to touch base after more than five years of suspension, identifying where the negotiations had left off in 2004, on process issues and modalities for the negotiations going forward."
"We will of course keep the European Parliament and the Council fully informed about the evolution of the negotiations."
"As regards your specific questions, the Commission is working on the basis of the negotiating directives adopted by the Council back in 1999."
"These directives task the Commission with negotiating a balanced and comprehensive agreement with Mercosur, with the aim of liberalising substantially all trades in line with the EU's commitments at the WTO."
"This applies to all areas to be covered by the agreement, including agriculture."
"The Commission is very well aware of the sensitivity of agriculture in these negotiations and will take this element into account when negotiating with Mercosur."
"Let us also keep in mind that we have substantial offensive agriculture interests in Mercosur as well, such as wine, cheese, fruit and vegetables and geographical indications."
"In this context, we are aware that accompanying measures might become necessary for the most sensitive sectors."
"It is, however, way too early to discuss what these measures could cover."
"We are only just starting the negotiations and have not yet entered into discussions on substance."
"We have not put down agricultural offers at this moment in time and there was a question - I do not know by whom - about the position of the Agriculture Commissioner in this respect."
"It is not the Trade Commissioner who decides what agricultural offers will be put on the table."
"This has to be agreed between the Agriculture Commissioner and myself, and if we do not agree then it goes to the College of Commissioners and it is the College of Commissioners which takes the decision."
"That is the way it happens, so Mr Dacian Cioloş is fully included in these discussions."
"We also know that we will have to take into account previous agricultural offers made by the EU in the Doha Round, of which Mercosur is expected to be one of the main beneficiaries."
"In this context, let me clarify that relaunching the negotiations with Mercosur does not undermine in any way our commitment to a successful conclusion of the DDA."
"As a matter of principle, we only negotiate FTAs which are compatible with WTO rules and which, building on the WTO acquis, go much further in coverage than the Doha Round."
"I believe that if we make the right choices it is possible to successfully conclude both negotiations."
"As regards food safety, it goes without saying that imports have to fully respect EU food safety requirements."
"Let it be very clear that there is no intention to negotiate away our health and safety requirements; not with Mercosur or anyone else!"
"The EU approach in all trade negotiations is certainly not to decrease the EU level of protection."
"The WTO rules give us the right to establish our own level of protection provided that this is based on recognised scientific evidence - this is an inviolable right."
"Finally, as regards the impact of a possible agreement, a sustainable impact assessment of a trade agreement between the EU and Mercosur has already been carried out and has been publicly available since March 2009."
"In addition, the Commission will complete this impact assessment with a more focused economic study in the months to come."
"Now let me turn to the EU-Brazil Summit and start with a short overview of our relations."
"Brazil has uncontested international stature in line with the size of its territory, its population and its economic performance."
"It supports multilateralism, is a member of the G20 and is a key player in global debates on climate change, economic governance, the reform of the UN, trade issues and the eradication of poverty."
"Moreover, Brazil often acts as an informal bridge between Western and emerging and developing countries."
"Brazil is one of nine countries with which the EU has entered into a strategic partnership."
"The partnership dates back to 2007 and the joint action plan, which translates the partnership into concrete actions, to 2008."
"The multiplicity of joint initiatives, the level of mutual understanding and the deepening of the relationship, which includes 18 ongoing dialogues, bear witness to our satisfaction with the implementation of the joint action plan."
"This will be the fourth EU-Brazil Summit at which we will aim to take stock of progress in our relations and discuss the main global challenges."
"The moment for such an assessment is particularly appropriate as President Lula's term in office approaches its end."
"As regards environmental issues, at the third summit in Stockholm we planned cooperation in view of last December's Copenhagen Summit and a bioenergy initiative involving Brazil, the EU and the African Union."
"The forthcoming Cancún and Nagoya conferences on climate change and biodiversity are high on the agenda of the Summit, as enhanced coordination with Brazil is crucial to a successful outcome."
"Further to a suggestion by President Lula at the EU-Mercosur Summit in Madrid, we are looking into a common position with Brazil for Cancún."
"The African Union Commission has received our joint proposal on trilateral cooperation on bioenergy and we hope to hear from them soon."
"In terms of cooperation in multilateral fora, we are pursuing coordination ahead of the Seoul G20 Summit to gather Brazil's support to obtain adequate representation of the EU in the UN system and to purposefully engage towards a conclusion of the Doha Round."
"Brazil is seeking to reinforce its influence with the global governance system and needs our support for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council."
"As an advanced emerging economy, it takes a very different stand to the EU in relation to reform of the World Bank and the IMF."
"Overall, what is certainly clear is that we have a shared agenda as globally relevant partners and we have to find ways to sort out our differences and seek convergence."
"At the Summit we will confirm our commitment to strengthening non-proliferation and encourage closer cooperation."
"Brazil opposed the Iran sanctions adopted last June by the UN Security Council."
"However, the EU welcomed the efforts made by Brazil and Turkey that led to the Tehran Declaration, pointing out its shortcomings but also emphasising its value as a potential confidence-building instrument and inviting Iran to seize the chance to resume serious negotiations."
"Although we diverge tactically, we find common ground on the principles enshrined in the Non-Proliferation Treaty and the need for Iran to demonstrate the peaceful nature of its nuclear programme."
"I have dealt extensively with the negotiations with Mercosur in the first part of my address, but these will of course be raised in the Summit discussions."
"Unfortunately, I will not be in Brasilia, but given that we have only met recently to have the first technical talks after a long pause the Summit is unlikely to take firm decisions in relation to this negotiation."
"The Summit will also address regional issues: Cuba, Honduras, Paraguay and Venezuela."
"Brazil's role in helping to stabilise Paraguay, its refusal to recognise the new Honduran Government, its engagement with Cuba and Venezuela are all on the agenda."
"Lastly, tough work is still being finalised on some issues where we expect the Summit to deliver."
"First, the signature of a horizontal civil aviation agreement and an air safety agreement."
"Second, the announcement of a joint work programme on triangular cooperation with developing countries."
"Third, a letter of intent between the Commission and the Brazilian National Council of Justice to advance trilateral cooperation in electoral support and justice reform will be signed in Brussels on 14 July."
"Our relationship with Brazil does not end with the Summit; we have other initiatives in parallel that help to give a fuller dimension to our bilateral, regional and global engagements, but I have more than exhausted my speaking time."
"I will try to give additional examples in response to your questions."
"Mr President, as regards the Mercosur countries, I would highlight the large deficit trade balance against the European Union in the agricultural product sector."
"Yet Argentina is blocking food imports from third countries, thereby seriously damaging exports of European agro-foodstuffs, including Greek peach jam."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner if he raised this issue last week during the first round of negotiations in Buenos Aires."
"Also, does Argentina's stance raise questions of the incompatibility of its measures with the rules and obligations of the World Trade Organisation?"
"A brief digression: Commissioner, negotiations with the countries of the Andes and Central America have been completed."
"To be honest, the concessions made by Europe in the agricultural sector are causing reasonable concerns and raising specific questions: What justification is there for the quotas granted by Europe in the rice and sugar sectors, which exceed the productive capacities of these countries?"
"Do the agreements include a net exporter clause, in order to prevent the development of a trade triangle?"
"Can the Commission assure us that import prices will be maintained in the fruit and vegetable sector?"
"Commissioner, I too should like to add my voice to the voices of my fellow Members who spoke about the need for closer interinstitutional cooperation between the Commission and the European Parliament."
"The Commission needs to realise that the terms of interinstitutional cooperation changed under the Treaty of Lisbon, as did the interinstitutional culture."
"The more quickly you move in that direction, the more productive and correct cooperation will be between the two institutions."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (PT) Mr President, the first EU-Brazil Summit, which was promoted by the Portuguese Presidency in 2007, filled an inexplicable gap."
"Brazil was the only BRIC country with which Europe had no strategic partnership."
"The strengthening of dialogue between the EU and Brazil makes perfect sense as it allows us to deepen cooperation in key areas such as energy security, sustainable development, biodiversity and climate change, etc."
"The size of Brazil's population and its economic development and political stability make it a key player on the international stage."
"Now that the 4th EU-Brazil Summit is about to take place, it is important to strike a balance between celebrating the progress achieved and examining how we can develop this partnership so that we can face common challenges and harmonise positions, with a view, for example, to the UN conference on climate change that will take place at the end of this year in Mexico."
"This summit is also an opportunity to advance negotiations with Mercosur in order to reach a conclusion on an association agreement and overcome the current differences."
"Mr President, we have just had a debate in this Chamber on the common agricultural policy, where we reiterated the importance of supporting a European model, unique in the world."
"However, at the same time the Commission has decided, without any prior public debate, to reopen negotiations with Mercosur, the consequences of which risk being disastrous for our agriculture and, in particular, for our European livestock farming, which is already struggling."
"Beef imports will increase by 70%, poultry imports by 25%."
"They will flood into Europe at a lower cost because they are not produced in accordance with the same level of health, environmental and social requirements."
"Commissioner, I would therefore like to voice my concern to you."
"Our agriculture is in great difficulty."
"Destabilising it further will have serious consequences."
"We cannot develop European trade policy without taking account of and defending one of our main assets."
"The Commission must hear this message and this demand."
"Mr President, many fellow Members are concerned about the ramifications that the reopening of negotiations on an association agreement with Mercosur might have on European agriculture."
"My group and I share these concerns."
"Indeed there are fears - and, as the MEP for an outermost region, I have experience of the banana agreements - that an agreement with Mercosur may deal a severe blow to many European agricultural sectors."
"That is why an impact assessment is absolutely essential."
"There are also fears that Mercosur's agriculture will become more production-driven - a little too production-driven - by this agreement, to the detriment of the small farms in these countries."
"A balance must therefore be found so that this agreement does not transform the continents of Latin America and Europe into superpowers essentially defined by mercantile dogma."
"(DE) Mr President, China's interventions in Central and Latin America have brought a new impetus to EU negotiations."
"With more than 200 million consumers, the Mercosur countries, which, as we know, share many of our values and interests, are the most important market for our domestic products in Latin America."
"We are targeting the world's largest free trade zone with a total of 700 million inhabitants and a trade volume of EUR 100 billion."
"Naturally this is a major argument in favour of a free trade agreement, something that should be supported in principle."
"However, the question remains why we have separate agreements with Mexico, Chile, Mercosur, Peru and Columbia, rather than one common agreement."
"Also, if individual agreements are to be concluded, then the smaller states need to be included, not just through trade associations."
"Clearly there is a lack of consistency here."
"Nor must we lose sight of the misgivings of the agricultural sector in relation to cheap meat imports."
"After all, while we police our own farmers with bureaucratic rules and regulations for quality, environmental and animal protection standards, the same does not apply to the meat produced in the Mercosur countries."
"We must not further undermine the EU's self-sufficiency, which is already no longer absolute, and must avoid driving up the number of Europe's farmers leaving the land."
"(ES) Mr President, we are all pleased about the freeing of political prisoners in Cuba."
"However, on the subject of congratulations, I have not heard any offered to the Catholic Church and, in particular, to Parliament for the role it played, which has been key in the determined defence of all of those fighting for their freedom and dignity in Cuba."
"With regard to the subject of Mercosur, there are several clarifications that need to be made."
"As Commissioner De Gucht has explained, the Commission put forward some negotiation directives for the purposes of concluding an association agreement between the European Union and Mercosur, which were adopted by the Council and by Parliament."
"Negotiations have been deadlocked for six years, and it is clear that they have been reopened within the framework of the Summit of Heads of State and Government of the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean, with the support also of Parliament."
"The objective, at this point in time, is to reach a balanced agreement that shows overall consideration for the interests of all sectors within the European Union."
"I do not understand why certain sectors or interest groups should come out of this negotiation at a disadvantage."
"It has not been like this for 10 years, and there is no reason why it should be like this in the future."
"It will depend on the firmness of our negotiators."
"In any case, if this situation were to come about, it is clear that the Commission would need to come up with compensatory measures for the sectors affected."
"This is what has been done with third countries, with African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, and with the most recent agreements with the Andean Community."
"The main reason that this has been done with these countries is the need to defend European Union producers, of bananas in this case."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, during its meeting on 4 May 2010, the College of Commissioners decided to reopen negotiations on an association agreement between the European Union and the Mercosur countries."
"Everything leads us to believe that, if these negotiations result in an agreement, European agricultural producers will be faced with significant problems, in particular in the beef, poultry, cereal and fruit and vegetable sectors."
"Disastrous knock-on effects might also follow for other sectors, such as the pork sector for example."
"Here I must warn you of the unfair competition that this, the world's third integrated market, might bring."
"Indeed, while Europe wants to be seen as a pioneer in terms of health requirements, hygiene, traceability, respect for the environment and notably also social standards, by imposing a very restrictive cross-compliance system on its producers, beef production - and more specifically Brazilian beef production - still does not fully meet veterinary and health standards."
"By accepting imports from Mercosur countries which do not meet European standards, we risk having to assume a heavy burden in the defence of our consumers' interests and risk penalising European producers by applying double standards."
"Commissioner, I would ask you to be particularly vigilant in this regard."
"Mr President, increased access to the EU market for Mercosur would decimate national industries, particularly - in my case - in my major concern: the beef industry in Ireland and elsewhere."
"This is not scaremongering."
"Ireland exports around 90% of its beef production, and the beef quota sought by Mercosur will be in direct competition with the Irish beef industry."
"European farmers are operating under strict health and safety criteria."
"They adhere to all standards set for them and they guarantee high-quality, safe produce for consumers."
"In the past the Commission continually assured European consumers and Members of this House of the quality of imports into the European Union."
"However, it was the farming organisations and MEPs which proved the Commission's position wrong on the issues of equivalence of quality and standards between imports and EU products, resulting in the number of exporting units in Brazil being reduced from 3 000 to under 1 000."
"So, Commissioner, my question is: given the past experience and the current sporadic nature of FVO missions, how can the Commission guarantee consumers that all imports coming into the European Union are of equable quality and comply with European Union standards?"
"Can I just say, Commissioner, that the track record does not offer great hope or great confidence for me for the future."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, negotiations have reopened with the Mercosur countries, and, if I interpret today's criticisms correctly, the main issue is that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development was not informed."
"I agree that we must improve the coordination of all of these topics within the European Parliament."
"Naturally, the opening of Mercosur negotiations is an extremely important issue for our fellow Members in the Committee on Agriculture."
"However, just as there has been an information deficit in relation to this issue in the Committee on Agriculture, my colleagues from the Committee on International Trade were not informed of the tabling of today's oral question."
"I think that we, the Bureau and the groups in Parliament, must all take greater care to ensure that we really do pursue coherent policies and that all the relevant committees are regularly brought on board."
"I should like to emphasise one point in particular."
"I am actually grateful that the Commission has reopened negotiations."
"On 5 May of this year, this House supported the reopening of negotiations in the Salafranca report."
"In other words, the Commission is doing exactly what Parliament decided by a large majority."
"Nonetheless, I would argue that we do not want an agreement at any price."
"Naturally the interests of agriculture, industry and the service sector must be taken into account as a whole."
"The fact that we can succeed in considering the interests of the agricultural sector in free trade agreements is evidenced by the free trade agreement with South Korea, for example, where the response from the agricultural sector has been very positive and where new market opportunities are being identified."
"We have also received positive feedback in relation to the trade agreement with Central America, where new markets are also opening up, for example in the dairy sector."
"I would be grateful if the Commission would increase its efforts in the coming weeks to take all interests into consideration, that is those of industry and the service sector, as well as those of agriculture."
"(ES) Mr President, the reopening of the European Union-Mercosur negotiations comes within a positive context that will enable dialogue to be restored with regard to trade relations."
"So far it is only talks that have resumed, and it is good that today's debate has caused the Commission to take proper note of what we think."
"Although the European Union stands to gain in sectors such as wine, olive oil, speciality meats, and preserved fruit and vegetables, it is logical to assume that in no case will these compensate for the impact that may be anticipated on EU livestock and agricultural production, such as sugar or cereals."
"I would ask the Commission to work towards reaching an agreement that is balanced overall, and which takes into account the sensitivity of certain products."
"It should include the necessary mechanisms to prevent any failures, such as strict controls on the health and phytosanitary quality levels of imported products."
"Another important issue would be preventing the results from overlapping with Doha, and the European Union from duplicating its allowances in the area of agriculture."
"That said, I echo the criticisms of the restrictive measures adopted by Argentina against certain European products, and I hope that the Commission acts firmly to resolve this situation soon."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, clearly the Mercosur countries are important trading partners for us."
"However, Commissioner, this trade with the Mercosur countries should not be allowed to become a one-way street."
"The frequent claims made in public that Europe is closing itself off in the agricultural markets are quite wrong."
"We purchase over 90% of African agricultural exports and 45% of Central and South American agricultural exports."
"Europe is certainly not closed off to external trade."
"What I would criticise, Commissioner, is the information policy pursued."
"It has not been good."
"As an agricultural policymaker, I first learned that these negotiations had begun when I opened the newspapers."
"In future we should not have to rely on the press for our information."
"I urge you to inform the agricultural sector represented here in Parliament about the progress of negotiations."
"Another point I would criticise is the fact that the objective here is free trade that is not based on standards."
"How can it be that we demand high standards of consumer protection, animal protection and environmental protection in Europe, but do not require the same standards from imports?"
"Let me offer just one example in this regard."
"Last year, Parliament passed the most stringent plant protection product legislation in the world."
"Many active ingredients are prohibited in Europe."
"Commissioner, we cannot have a situation in the future where food is supplied to Europe from countries in which active ingredients are used that are prohibited in Europe for reasons of consumer protection."
"Consumer protection is inviolable and we would do well to remember this in negotiations."
"Then we have nothing to fear from our competitors, and we European farmers will stand our ground against this competition."
"(HU) Commissioner, there is a Hungarian saying that the longer the explanation, the more likely it is that the person offering it is lying."
"You are not telling the truth!"
"The European Commission has only ever had one honest Commissioner, Mr Dacian Cioloş, who said that we must choose between the WTO and Mercosur, otherwise we will ruin European agriculture."
"This is the truth, Mr De Gucht."
"As far as you are concerned, the Spanish Presidency and the Commission have violated the Treaty of Lisbon because the European Parliament has been left out."
"Mr Gaspari can say that the Committee on Foreign Affairs granted authorisation, but Parliament has not been given a mandate."
"This is the other reason for my question."
"Incidentally, I would add that the new Member States can only lose out here."
"We favour liberalisation, but if Spain and Portugal have special interests, they should leave the European Union out of it."
"They should sort it out themselves."
"There is no need to provide an EU framework for this."
"- (HU) The European Commission defined the negotiating mandates some 11 years ago."
"The world has changed over the past 11 years."
"Environmental protection and climate protection have become major issues and the European Union itself has changed as the number of its Member States increased from 15 to 27."
"The European Commission has disregarded these developments."
"It has not requested a new mandate."
"This is a serious mistake."
"Negotiations based on 11-year-old mandates cannot be continued; they must be brought to an end."
"A new mandate must be created, taking into account the interests of the 12 Member States that joined the EU in recent years, as well as the global considerations of climate protection, environmental protection and animal welfare."
"Without a proper mandate, we can only reach unacceptable agreements."
"author. - Mr President, there was wisdom in my decision to hold back my contribution until I heard what I hoped would be answers."
"I noted the time that the Commission took - longer than any of us here in this Chamber - and I regret that I did not get specific answers to five very direct questions."
"On the mandate, let me say that a mandate dating back to 1999 is way out of date and indeed most of the current Parliament would not have been around in 1999."
"Go back to the drawing board."
"The last speaker addressed some of the points that I would wish to make."
"As you did not address the impact assessment, other than telling us you have done an assessment, let me talk to you about some of the impacts on our agricultural producers."
"The Mercosur Meat Forum, which represents Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, urged the negotiators not to waste an extraordinary opportunity for them."
"Contrast that to the delight, or rather to the fear and trepidation and anger, among EU producers."
"What will happen is there will be job losses across rural Europe and a reduction in our food production capacity."
"Look at the impacts of this on the environment, where Europe regards itself as a leader in terms of climate change, land tenure problems in these countries, the chopping down of forests, the impact on indigenous populations and forced labour, and specifically on beef."
"For those of you who do not realise it, this is an attack on the high-quality end of our beef market."
"If we undermine that part of our market, we will destroy beef production and the market in the European Union."
"The US and Japan will not do a deal because they protect their producers and the high standards they value."
"This Parliament imposes high standards of food production on our producers."
"We have failed to defend them in the past."
"The Commission has been found wanting, and we cannot allow an agreement of this sort to happen to the detriment of EU production at a time when we are reforming our agricultural policy."
"There is no consistency between agriculture and trade policy."
"This Parliament has to insist that there will be."
"(FR) Mr President, I would just like to say that it may be the case that we have not organised our agenda very well today."
"If having free trade agreements means that we allow products to enter Europe that respect neither our social standards nor our environmental standards, the reform of the common agricultural policy will be pointless."
"Clearly we cannot continue to take this hypocritical approach where, on the one hand, we impose environmental restrictions relating to health and safety traceability on our farmers, on the grounds that we have to protect consumers, and, on the other hand, we allow products that fail to meet these standards to enter our continent freely."
"That is precisely the issue being discussed behind the scenes at the negotiations with Mercosur."
"Although we are being told that Parliament was very well informed and that matters have been as transparent and as clear as possible, the way in which things have been initiated does not give us a good impression of a negotiation that is being held at the same time as other negotiations are taking place at the WTO."
"For the sake of consistency, and of protecting consumers and our farmers, I feel that we cannot continue down this track."
"(EL) Mr President, although the conclusion of a trade agreement with Mercosur will be to the mutual benefit of both sides, it will have massive repercussions on the agricultural sector."
"Even the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, recognised this dimension, when he stated the Commission's intention to take specific measures to combat the negative repercussions which will impact in particular on agriculture."
"To be honest, certain agricultural sectors are already being damaged by bilateral agreements and, in addition, the higher specifications for agricultural production in the European Union do not safeguard its superior quality compared with cheaper production from third countries."
"Commissioner, how do you intend to address this issue and what sort of objective criteria does the Commission intend to apply in order to ensure that this discrimination against various agricultural sectors is not strengthened?"
"Mr President, this morning, as you are aware, we are discussing the CAP post 2013, and yet much of our discussion is being undermined by the reopening of negotiations with Mercosur."
"Where, I ask, is the consistency?"
"A few weeks ago, after it was announced that you were reopening negotiations with Mercosur, I had a short meeting with you."
"During that meeting you said that, if there was to be an ambitious deal, it was likely there would have to be concessions on agriculture."
"That is why I am extremely concerned."
"Already we are talking about possible concessions on agriculture, and I would like you to clarify this."
"In your response you spoke about forthcoming summits on climate change."
"Are you doing any assessment on issues such as carbon leakage, deforestation, loss of biodiversity in the context of further imports of agricultural products from Mercosur countries?"
"I come from Ireland, and we export 90% of our beef."
"Recent research has shown that Brazilian emissions are between three and eight times higher than the Irish equivalent."
"Will any of this be taken into consideration in your impact assessments?"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Spanish Presidency has decided to sign this agreement."
"This decision has caused some concern, as we have already heard, and in tabling this question my fellow Members are asking for clarification as regards the impact that the negotiations may have on European producers and products."
"I wished to point out that the creation of a free-trade relationship between the two parties allows for imports into Europe of animal products containing antibiotic growth activators that have not undergone sufficient testing, and of genetically modified agricultural products that could jeopardise farmers' food safety."
"I therefore call on the Commission to adopt an authoritative position so as to safeguard European quality production."
"The Commission must also undertake to ensure that Europe's high production standards are recognised at international level and that these same standards are required of all imported products."
"Lastly, I believe that the Commission should take account of the concerns expressed by the various associations in the sector, so as to ensure transparent and fair negotiations that do not harm the European economy."
"Mr President, I am extremely concerned that the Commission is adamant in continuing trade talks based on a mandate from 1999, which will undoubtedly have a negative impact on agriculture across the EU."
"Sacrificing agriculture for gains in other areas is simply unacceptable."
"The beef industry in the United Kingdom is currently experiencing a fall in farm-gate prices."
"If there is a rise in imports due to these talks, I believe we will see an exodus of farmers from the industry."
"How is Europe going to provide for these people?"
"Is it not unfair that our farmers have to compete with countries whose producers do not have to meet the same quality, safety and traceability benchmarks as farmers within the European Union?"
"A Commission that claims to act in the best interests of the citizens must do so."
"We must end these talks and look after our farmers."
"(PL) Negotiations with the Mercosur countries were suspended in 2004."
"This year, they have been reopened, and are being conducted on the basis of a mandate dating from 1999."
"Such an important decision should have been preceded by a debate on policy in the European Parliament and in the Council."
"I do understand that the stakes in these talks are extremely high, because the Mercosur countries are an enormous market, a market for EU industrial products and services."
"However, we should also be protecting the interests of our farmers and the agriculture and food sector."
"If a bilateral agreement on preferential trade were made with Mercosur countries, it might have very damaging effects, including in the poultry meat, beef and pig meat sectors, the sugar and dairy product sectors and also the ethanol sector."
"If that happened, it would be necessary to propose certain forms of compensation to farmers."
"Experts estimate that making such an agreement could result in very large losses of income among farmers. These will be even higher if the agreement is both bilateral and made at WTO level."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, as a signatory to the present question I would like to return to a specific issue, namely that of food safety."
"In your initial remarks today you told us that products imported into the EU have to meet our requirements and that the WTO gives us the right to uphold our regulations, provided that they are based on scientific evidence."
"However, when I consider our agricultural production and the products themselves, not everything can be proven scientifically."
"Also important are the general conditions under which animals are raised, for example, as well as the general conditions under which agriculture operates."
"In Europe we have some excellent legislation in relation to the future of biodiversity."
"We would like to hear some answers from you about how you intend to adhere to these principles of food safety, consumer protection, animal protection and environmental protection in this trade agreement."
"The politicians must be able to decide, even when the scientific evidence is unavailable."
"We do not want cloned meat from the Mercosur countries."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, a French socialist politician once said, 'When you are in a political minority, you are legally in the wrong.'"
"You understood that we feel that the mandate is no longer valid."
"Commissioner, we must renew this mandate, and it is regrettable that the Council, which should give the necessary instructions, is absent."
"I would also like to draw your attention to the political aspects of Mercosur."
"In trade, the key element is confidence."
"How is Mercosur qualified, politically speaking, to negotiate with the European Union?"
"We have three regions in the world: there is the European Union, which wants integrated trade, the North American Free Trade Agreement and Mercosur."
"Mercosur was almost dissolved at the 2007 Summit."
"The countries do not agree on accessions. Venezuela almost did not accede."
"How can we negotiate in such a politically unstable area?"
"First check the political stability of Mercosur and then we will conclude trade agreements."
"(DE) Mr President, I believe that we have talked a great deal about sustainability."
"We have been discussing it for two hours, but there is one thing that most certainly is not sustainable, and there is clearly exactly the same problem with every President: the fact that we do not know when to ask for the floor in order to have our request granted."
"I have now been overlooked for the second time, even though I asked for the floor in plenty of time."
"I think this is an outrage."
"Clearly, it is necessary to ask each President, including the previous President, for clear rules to be laid down and for the President to take account of when we have to ask for the floor during catch-the-eye."
"It is unacceptable for me to go immediately after a debate, after the previous agenda item, and ask very politely to be given a chance to speak, only to be ignored."
"Please tell us when you are going to ignore people."
"Please let us know if there is clearly no desire to allow someone to talk about as important a topic as sustainability."
"There is clearly no sustainability here if we have to ask every President to grant us our parliamentary right and allow us to speak."
"I would like to make an urgent request for clarification in this regard, because this is an unfair way of going about things."
"Colleagues, by way of explanation, I have about 18 people on the list."
"I understand that everybody would like to take the floor but we have five minutes for the catch-the-eye procedure - one minute each - so I can take five speakers."
"Today I took eight speakers."
"I tried to distribute it evenly according to the strength of the political groups so, if you noticed, there were three speakers from the PPE Group, two speakers from the PSE Group, one speaker from the ALDE Group, one from the EFD Group and one from the non-attached Members."
"So I think I have done the maximum I could have done."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I will try to answer some of the questions because a lot of questions have been raised, but many were also already answered in my introductory statement."
"First of all on the mandate."
"Several Members criticised the fact that we are working on the basis of a mandate going back to 1999."
"The 1999 directives task us - and I am quoting - 'with negotiating a balanced and comprehensive agreement with Mercosur with the aim of liberalising substantially all trade in line with the EU's commitment at the WTO. This applies to all areas to be covered by the agreement, including agriculture'."
"That is still true."
"That is still what we have to do, so nothing much has to be added to this mandate."
"In the mean time, we have the problem of climate change and the world has changed since then."
"Yes, we have noticed that too, and we will take this into consideration in the negotiations."
"That is not the reason to change the mandate."
"There was another Member who said that Council should be here and that Council should instruct us."
"The Council does not have to instruct us."
"We have a mandate to negotiate and, if the negotiation is over and eventually we come to a result, we initial, the Council signs and Parliament ratifies. We are not instructed by the Council."
"And happily so, because this is a Community matter and it is an exclusive competence of the European Union whereby the Commission has very clear competences."
"We will stick to that."
"I am ready to discuss at length any of the elements."
"I have done so with the INTA Committee and I am ready to go back to the INTA Committee."
"You will be kept informed of what we are negotiating, what is put on the table and so on, but everybody has his role to play and we will play the role that the Commission has to play in this respect."
"As for the problem of the protectionist measures taken recently by Argentina, these measures and practices are clearly of concern to the EU and we immediately asked Argentina for clarification."
"A letter was sent by the Director-General for Trade to his Argentinean counterpart on 12 May."
"A formal démarche was launched by the EU delegation in Buenos Aires and several meetings were held with the mission of Argentina and its Ambassador in Brussels to express our strongest concerns."
"We have also insisted that the commitment to reject protectionism in all its forms be directly included in the EU-Mercosur joint communiqué."
"Last week in Buenos Aires we raised this topic bilaterally with the relevant Argentinean authorities, in the press and in the context of the EU-Mercosur first round of negotiations."
"Our message was very strong and very clear."
"We indicated that these measures, no matter whether they are based on legal written grounds or not, go against the spirit of negotiating an FTA with the EU and risk having a clear negative impact on the negotiating process."
"We were further intending to discuss the issue with Argentina on 6 July in the joint committee, but Argentina announced its postponement last week."
"We will insist that we have this meeting as soon as possible."
"In addition, they appear at first glance to be inconsistent with Argentina's commitments in the G20 framework and possibly with its WTO commitments."
"We will continue monitoring this issue very attentively and, if these measures and practices were to be maintained, carefully analyse them before deciding on the best possible solution to address this problem."
"It remains the position of the Commission that protectionist measures should be avoided particularly in the current global economic context, and one of the elements that was mentioned, the deficit with Argentina, is certainly a very good one."
"On sugar:"
"(FR) The Commission is perfectly aware of the sensitivity of the sugar issue and that is why the offer to Colombia and Peru was limited to tariff quotas at zero duty for a modest volume and without an out-of-quota tariff reduction."
"Similar quotas are provided for within the framework of the negotiations with Central America."
"The Colombian, Peruvian and Central American aggregated quantities account for less than 2% of European consumption."
"As for plant health, environmental and other measures ..."
"I made it very clear in my statements that we are going to stick to the food safety requirements, and these are the ones that can be enforced within the WTO."
"We will do that."
"If you look at the imports of beef - and this is also partly in answer to Mr Tarabella, who has left the plenary in the mean time - he will notice that, subsequently to SPS problems with Brazilian beef, the imports decreased considerably."
"So we are imposing them: we are monitoring them and we are imposing them and will continue to do so."
"But we should realise, also in this European Parliament, that a certain number of European requirements have been decided internally that are the result of a political process in which the European Parliament was very heavily involved and that we cannot impose through the WTO."
"We have to stick to the ones that we can impose and make the WTO respect: we will certainly do so in the case of food safety."
"In the case of the others, there the European Union has to consider what they really want to do."
"They should realise that, if they impose that kind of requirement on our agriculture, this has economic and financial consequences."
"But those are not the ones that we can impose on other countries."
"I have tried to answer most of the questions that were reiterated in the questions put by the Members, but of course I am ready for further discussion."
"I presume that this is not the last time we will discuss Mercosur in this plenary."
"Commissioner, I am also sure that this will not be the last time we do so."
"The joint debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - (PT) The resumption of negotiations in September between Mercosur and the EU is a process of the utmost importance for the EU."
"On the one hand, in a multipolar world where the BRIC countries are gaining ever more influence, it is vital that the EU establishes a privileged relationship with Latin American countries, where it holds more investment than Russia, India and China put together."
"In combination with a special trade relationship, this would ensure the consolidation of an enormous economic advantage on a global scale."
"On the other hand, we have the level of openness to trade relating to agricultural goods and the definition of health and plant health rules that are needed for exchange between the blocs."
"Mercosur's competitiveness in agricultural markets has been strengthened and has increased in recent years, so there needs to be an impact study on the consequences of an agreement for European agricultural activity, which is in no condition to suffer more shocks at present."
"This means that we should not plunge into a process that will reach its conclusion too fast without taking account of potentially negative impacts on European agriculture, or excessive protectionism, which compromises the EU's important position in this area of the world."
"Reopening negotiations with the Mercosur countries without consulting the Member States was very dirty play."
"The negotiations were suspended in 2004 when it was realised that trade between the EU and members of Mercosur might have adverse effects on our agriculture."
"Most at risk of losses are the beef, pig meat and poultry meat sectors and the milk, fruit and vegetable, sugar and bioethanol sectors."
"It is estimated that signing the agreement would cause losses ranging from several billion euro to several times this amount."
"Liberalisation of trade between the Union and Mercosur must be preceded by an accurate analysis of the effect of such an agreement on the Community market and careful consultations with representatives of the parties involved."
"Opening our market to imports is not an entirely bad initiative, but only if the same standards are in force in all countries."
"Otherwise, the costs of concessions under the WTO will be borne by our farmers."
"in writing. - These Mercosour talks represent a potentially dreadful development for the future of European agriculture."
"I have to say that the Commission's attitude to the matter has been appalling."
"It would appear as if they are lining up a deal and will be using agricultural standards as a currency to buy a deal with Mercosur countries."
"This attitude, I find, is appalling."
"It seems like farmers are the first victims of trade deals but the first to be blamed when trade deals do not work."
"I would like a more consistent and caring attitude from the Commission to the future of the family farm sector."
"It is heartening to see so many agricultural MEPs here from all the groups supporting the protection of agriculture."
"Dismissing Parliament's concerns of will not work, Commissioner De Gucht, and I would urge you to consult us more if you wish to have any potential agreement signed off by Parliament."
"It seems that the Mercosur negotiations are only pursuing one goal: to hand over a defenceless European agriculture."
"I do not want to know how immeasurably high the profit for industry and the services sector will be - I want to know how high the damage for agriculture will be."
"No one can now estimate the damage that a potential agreement with the Mercosur countries could do to domestic agricultural producers."
"The sensitive agricultural sector must not be handed over in the negotiations."
"The same goes for the European consumers who find themselves confronted with food which is not manufactured under the high production standards of the EU."
"On the one hand, this is risky for the health of EU citizens, because the conditions under which imported food is produced are not clear, and on the other hand, European agriculture receives unequal treatment, because EU production and processing standards do not apply to agricultural imports from the Mercosur countries."
"If someone is prepared to give away everything for a profit or an advantage, then we have a phrase to describe them: 'They would sell their own grandmothers'."
"Feel free to sell your grandmother, Commissioner, but do not give away our European agriculture."
"The resumption of negotiations with Mercosur, decided unilaterally by the European Commission, does not bode well for European agriculture, which is experiencing an unprecedented crisis."
"Apart from the fact that there was no political debate prior to the reopening of these negotiations, this agreement clearly puts our European agricultural interests at stake."
"There can be no question of any new agricultural concessions, after the offers made in July 2008 within the framework of the Doha Round."
"Back then we had already reached a 'final limit', and so to exceed it would be to kill our agriculture."
"While that may not be the morbid intention of the Commission, I do nevertheless wonder about its ability to ensure that the EU does not pay twice."
"Certainly, when faced with any attempt at protectionism, the best response to the economic crisis is to open up to trade, but not at any price and not to the detriment of the EU."
"As a member of the Committee on International Trade who is in a position to approve or reject the EU-Mercosur FTA, I will oppose a cut-price bilateral agreement, which would sacrifice European agriculture and would provide little satisfactory progress for the rest of the European economy."
"Arrangements for importing fishery and aquaculture products into the EU with a view to the future reform of the CFP (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Alain Cadec, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on arrangements for importing fishery and aquaculture products into the EU with a view to the future reform of the CFP."
"Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, one of the strong ideas of this report is the need to establish a vital link between the common commercial policy and the common fisheries policy."
"With this in mind, we can only welcome the fact that the Commissioner for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, Mrs Damanaki, who is our regular contact, and the Commissioner for Trade, Mr De Gucht, are reunited on the Commission's bench."
"Two Commissioners for one report, what an honour!"
"I must say that this dual representation of the Commission is surprising and flattering, and moreover, rather unusual."
"Let us return to the report itself."
"Imports of fishery and aquaculture products from third countries account for more than 60% of EU consumption."
"This worrying level of EU dependence on imports is the result of a double phenomenon: firstly, there has been a decline in EU production, and, secondly, the EU market has been increasingly opened up to imports, as a result of the trade policies conducted by the Commission in the course of the last decade."
"These developments are making life difficult for EU fishermen who, paradoxically, are finding it hard to sell their catches at sufficiently lucrative prices, even though demand exceeds supply for most species."
"European fishermen accept having environmental, social and health restrictions imposed on them, but bitterly resent the fact that they are not applied in the same way to products imported in huge numbers from third countries."
"What is at stake here is quite simply the survival of an economically viable European fisheries sector, a supplier of jobs right across the industry, a provider of safe and good quality food, contributing to the preservation of the cultural identity of our coastal regions."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the survival of European fisheries is non-negotiable."
"In essence, we are demanding the following."
"Firstly, the preservation by the European Union of significant tariff protection for fishery and aquaculture products, so that the preferences granted to certain third countries, in particular developing countries, still mean something, and so that the WTO mechanisms are still effective in ensuring that our processing industry receives supplies."
"We must shield these products from the tariff minefield by using the Swiss formula and demanding that they be treated as sensitive products."
"Secondly, the trade preferences granted to certain third countries must be dependent on their complying with strict environmental, social and health standards, at the very least."
"Thirdly, we call for the responsibility for conducting trade talks on fishery and aquaculture products to be transferred from the Trade Commissioner to the Commissioner for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries."
"This will mean that better account is taken of the specific characteristics of fishery and aquaculture products."
"I think this is the perfect time to review the terms of this fundamental debate."
"Indeed, we are on the eve of an important reform of the CFP."
"Furthermore, we note that the Doha Round at the WTO has come to a standstill, giving us an opportunity to reconsider some ill-timed concessions that the Commission was preparing to make on behalf of the European Union."
"Furthermore, on the initiative of Commissioner De Gucht, who is here with us, the European Commission has just opened a public consultation period with a view to creating new guidelines for the common commercial policy, within the framework of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"The European Parliament henceforth has powers of codecision in relation to both trade policy and fisheries policy, and it fully intends to make its voice heard and to ensure that its point of view is respected in these matters."
"In my view the first demonstration of this should be the Commission and the Council genuinely taking into account the recommendations contained in this report."
"In any case, we will be extremely vigilant in the coming months, and I personally intend to keep working on these issues."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mr Cadec and the EP Committees that have sponsored this own-initiative report."
"You have regretted that the green paper on the CFP reform did not pay enough attention to the issues you raise here."
"My objective today is to reassure you that the Commission is committed to the work, taking into full account all policies that would have an impact on the CFP reform."
"As I have already stated, the purpose of the reform is to turn around the negative spiral we are in now."
"We have a fisheries sector that is neither ecologically sustainable nor economically performing well."
"We need robust fisheries that ensure sustainable exploitation of the resources while allowing our fishermen, their families and the communities involved to make a decent living from their activities."
"We need fisheries which are ready to meet the challenges of the market: both national and international, and both currently and for the future."
"I hear your concerns about unfair competition from third countries and the absence of a level playing field in terms of social conditions, environmental and sustainability requirements and health protection laws."
"Let me tell you that this same concern was voiced by all the Member States which took the floor at the last Agriculture and Fisheries Council."
"So here we need an answer."
"While we are changing the rules for European fisheries in the context of our CFP reform, one of the biggest challenges we will have will be precisely to do our best in order to secure a level playing field for all products placed on the EU market."
"In this respect, for instance, we should all work together to fully and effectively implement our legislation against illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing."
"I would also like to say that we remain committed to promoting the respect of all international principles and instruments of good maritime and fishery governance by our partners, as well as their responsible behaviour in terms of environmental protection and social conditions."
"I strongly support your call for an increased coherence of our policies."
"We need to work together with a global and integrated vision."
"Two thirds of the fish consumed in Europe, as we have already mentioned, are already imported in order to ensure a steady supply of raw material to our processing industry and fair prices to consumers."
"Yet one third of the EU market is still supplied by an EU sector that represents jobs and this part of the social fabric of many regions in Europe."
"So, while we are in the middle of a serious reform of our common fisheries policy, EU trade policy should continue to take into account the complex nature of the EU's fishing sector and its economic and social realities."
"I look forward to working closely together with my colleague Mr De Gucht in order to secure the necessary time for the adjustments that are needed, taking into account the pace of the ongoing CFP reform."
"With reference to WTO negotiations, we are paying particular attention to the ongoing discussions on subsidies."
"It is our view that we should always be able to support environmentally friendly and innovation-oriented initiatives of our Member States."
"Concerning the revision of the market policy, I agree with the draft report that the new market policy of the CFP should revisit the instruments of the current common market organisation."
"The revision should aim at strengthening producer organisations in their ability to better link the supply to demand in terms of quality and volumes. It shall also support market supply and stability and review provisions of marketing standards and information to consumers."
"This brings us to labelling."
"Consumers want to know more about the seafood they buy."
"They want to know where the fish was caught or raised; also they want to know whether the products respect the environment and whether they have been fished sustainably."
"The Commission is ready to work on legislative initiatives aiming at giving consumers the information they need."
"Finally, a word on aquaculture."
"The Commission is fully committed to achieving the objectives of the strategy for the sustainable development of aquaculture, as we have already discussed in the EP report."
"We also share the view that developing aquaculture in the EU can lead to reduced dependence on imports and better respond to constantly rising consumer demand."
"Before closing I would like to stress that today's debate will provide an important contribution to the preparation of the CFP reform, but it will also send an important political signal - a positive signal - to the men and women of the European fisheries sector, who are prepared for tougher discipline but are also expecting a message of hope for their future."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission welcomes the European Parliament's decision to prepare an own-initiative report on the import regime for fish and fishery products."
"The debate opened by the European Parliament provides a good basis to start reflecting on how to address trade negotiations in the context of a reformed common fisheries policy."
"I would like to invite the Members of the European Parliament to take into consideration the following observations on the issues raised in the draft EP report."
"The Commission is aware of the particular nature of the fisheries sector and its importance, especially for coastal communities."
"This sensitivity is taken into consideration in the implementation of the common commercial policy."
"I would like to highlight that the EU's trade policy has to reconcile the diverse interests of the various parts of the fisheries sector affected by the policy, including producers, processors and consumers."
"The Commission's goal when pursuing its trade policy for fishery and aquaculture products is to achieve a balanced result between, among other things, an adequate supply policy, the situation and interests of EU producers and the demands of consumers, while taking into account potential development policy objectives."
"We all acknowledge that the EU is strongly dependent on imported fishery and aquaculture products to satisfy its market demands, represented not only by consumers, but also by the processing industry."
"Given the existing trends and potential increase in dependence, the current reform of the common fisheries policy is a good opportunity for the EU to reinforce the economic performance of the sector and its ability to compete globally."
"We should not ignore the likelihood that broader globalisation will continue in the future given current global trends in international trade, both at multilateral and at bilateral/regional level."
"In the context of free trade arrangement negotiations, the Commission has taken, is taking, and should take into account the complex nature of the EU's fishing sector during market access negotiations and ensure there is a balance between the diverse interests affected by trade policy, as I have just mentioned."
"In the context of these global trends in international trade, the Commission will strive to secure the necessary time for the adjustments that will need to take place, taking into account the pace of the ongoing common fisheries policy reform."
"Let me briefly refer to one of the main suggestions included in the report, which is the possibility of detaching fish products from NAMA in the framework of the DDA."
"I will be very honest with you on this point."
"At this stage of the discussions, besides being very difficult to segregate fish products from NAMA, other approaches such as a specific negotiating group could result in the EU coming under enormous pressure to further liberalise its market."
"The Commission takes due note of the draft report's call for the responsibility for the negotiation of fishery and aquaculture products to be transferred from the Trade Commissioner to the Fisheries Commissioner."
"According to the principle of collegiality which governs the Commission work, all the members of the Commission are jointly responsible for decisions and actions taken."
"This also means that the Trade Commissioner and DG TRADE, who are responsible for negotiations of fishery and aquaculture products, do not act alone, but negotiate in close cooperation with the Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Commissioner and DG MARE and with their direct involvement at all stages of the negotiations."
"The Commission wants to reassure the EP that the specific needs of the fisheries sector are taken into consideration in the course of trade negotiations."
"Indeed, the Commission defends the interests of the EU sector in trade negotiations and takes into account its sensitivities as far as possible, even when faced with strong pressure from our trading partners."
"In defending the interests of the EU fisheries sector in trade negotiations, the Commission also seeks to remove any trade barrier maintained by our trade partners that might threaten the export potential of the EU industry, with the aim of ensuring a level playing field in bilateral and multilateral trade in fish products."
"Finally, the report voices concerns from stakeholders as regards ensuring a level playing field for EU products and third country imports."
"The EU is firmly committed to promoting both labour and environmental standards in the context of trade negotiations with third countries in parallel to market opening - for example, in the framework of a sustainable development chapter included in our trade agreements or in a number of international fora where these issues are addressed, such as the UN, FAO and regional fisheries management organisations, where the EU is an active participant."
"I would like to conclude by showing my willingness and availability to further discuss with the Honourable Members of the European Parliament the Commission's role in trade negotiations as far as fishery and aquaculture products are concerned."
"Mr President, Commissioners, I think we must note the convergence of this Parliament's Committee on Fisheries and its Committee on International Trade on this matter and on the proposals presented in connection with it."
"It has been said that fishing is an extremely important sector for spatial planning, employment and cultural identity in Europe."
"It is also a sector which has an extremely strong impact on fisheries resources, and today a great majority of stocks are considerably overfished."
"Too often people would have us believe that the ultimate objective of a European common fisheries policy is to adapt the fisheries sector to globalised trade in fishery products, the extremely harsh effects of which we can see today, whether it be socially, economically or, of course, environmentally."
"We therefore actively defend much stronger integration of social and environmental criteria into trade agreements regarding fishery products."
"We support the idea of withdrawing fishery products from non-agricultural market access (NAMA) rules, because a fish is not a sock or a washing machine, it is absolutely crucial to food security and biodiversity."
"However, we must be clear."
"Since we are bringing this into international negotiations, our European policy must be exemplary and we must move in the direction of having more and better paid fishermen who do not overexploit fish stocks, either in our territorial waters or in those in which we buy fishing rights."
"Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mr Cadec for the work - the excellent work - he has done on such an important issue as the arrangements for importing fishery and aquaculture products into the EU."
"I had prepared my speech on the need, for example, to focus on ensuring that imported products comply with the same health rules and the same requirements, but I see that others have spoken about this, so it would be rather pointless and a waste of time for us to go over it again."
"However, I must mention a fundamental aspect, which I seemed to perceive from Commissioner De Gucht's speech and which the Member before me spoke about, namely that there are some minor conflicts today between the powers of the two Commissioners or between the powers that the two Commissioners should have."
"All hypocrisy aside, I believe that it is important to emphasise this because, as has been said, the fisheries sector has a fundamental role to play if we want to ensure that our fishermen do not keep reducing their catch capacity because we have forced them to do so for the sake of our seas."
"If we want to ensure that people do not continue to regard our fishermen as the Cinderella figures of Europe, so to speak, then we will have to devote more attention to this matter."
"Commissioner Damanaki and Commissioner De Gucht have both expressed their intention to devote themselves fully to this entire issue, but I believe that it is important to have just one line of approach."
"I also believe that the aspect regarding the Fisheries Commissioner, with everything that that entails subsequently within Parliament, is crucial to ensuring that the problem is solved and that this report becomes an important future perspective."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, fisheries and aquaculture products make up an important part of the European diet, as we all know, and this means that we need to import more than 60% of these products to meet our needs, as Commissioner Damanaki has rightly stated."
"This simple fact amply illustrates the importance of the report by Mr Cadec, with whom, as a shadow rapporteur, I had the pleasure of working in the search for as broad a consensus as possible on protecting the sector, the jobs that it provides, and above all European consumers."
"For this reason the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament is backing the key assumptions and basic conclusions of the report, particularly with regard to the concerns and recommendations on the need to guarantee the health and safety of imported fisheries and aquaculture products, and the environmental criteria that need to be made a requirement for catching, producing and processing these very products."
"The report rightly addresses other issues that are equally deserving of support, but due to lack of time I cannot explain these here."
"For these reasons my group will obviously vote in favour of the report."
"Moreover, I would like to congratulate Mr Cadec on the excellent work that he has done."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, at the outset I want to congratulate Mr Cadec on producing this report."
"The decline in fish prices in recent years is directly and substantially caused by competition from imports of both wild and farmed fish."
"The producers of these products are not subject to the demanding regimes of EU operators in areas such as conservation and in areas such as hygiene standards."
"They enter the European market at a price that is uneconomic for European producers."
"This issue must be addressed in the context of the reform of the common fisheries policy, and I know that Commissioner Damanaki will address this."
"There is a huge reliance on imported goods, as has been pointed out by both Commissioners, but when I look at my own country importing 46 000 tonnes per annum costing EUR 181 million, there appears to be a lack of awareness among consumers of imported fish versus wild fish."
"If we are to resolve this problem, we must look at import substitution to reduce the 66% to 50% over a period of, say, 10 years, but in order to do that we must ensure that the red tape which is stifling the sector at the present time is simplified and that all DGs, and indeed all government departments and the various Member States, work in tandem in the best interests of this sector."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (SV) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome Mr Cadec's report on the importing of fish into the EU."
"Europe's own catches have diminished at an alarming rate - by 26% since 1997 alone."
"More than 60% of all fish consumed in Europe today is imported."
"This should not need to be the case."
"If we managed our own fish resources at least according to the maximum sustainable yield (MSY), European catches could increase to double what they are today, while at the same time we would have strong and viable stocks."
"With that goal in mind, we must now ensure that we do not transfer our problems of overfishing to other countries."
"The Cadec report mentions several important instruments that the EU can use."
"The first is the IUU Regulation."
"All fish that are placed on the EU market must have approved documents indicating where, when and by whom the fish were caught."
"That is a first step, but it does not go far enough."
"In large parts of the world, illegal fishing is a problem that poor countries do not have the resources to do anything about."
"In countries where corruption is rife, it is not difficult to acquire the right documents for a fish exporter."
"Therefore, the EU, as the world's largest importer of fish, must take responsibility by providing tangible and technical financial support and contribute the resources that are needed to facilitate compliance and control in developing countries."
"The second instrument is already in place in the United Nations."
"We have good international agreements, but we also need to implement them."
"During 2006, the EU pursued the question of an implementing agreement for, among other things, the FAO's Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries in the United Nations."
"We must continue to pursue this."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Cadec warmly for such a bold report, which is of extreme importance to the common fisheries policy currently being constructed."
"Even while the report was being drafted, many areas of the common fisheries policy could be observed which, in our view, differ significantly from the opinion of the Commission, and this, unfortunately, also means the final form of the report."
"In the opinion of fishermen, this crucial report should have an enormous effect on the structure of the future common fisheries policy in terms of organisation of the market."
"Mrs Damanaki, you repeated at many meetings that instead of criticising when discussing individual transferrable quotas, we should present proposals for solutions under the future policy."
"I am convinced that making use of the ideas contained in this report is an alternative to the concept being forced on us by the Commission."
"Mr President, Commissioners, first of all I want to thank the rapporteur for his report."
"On 24 July 2008, in response to the economic crisis facing Europe's fishing fleet, the EU Fisheries Council approved temporary and specific measures aimed at promoting and restructuring the fleet."
"Just as many fishermen tried to avail themselves of these measures, they were hit with the fallout from the global recession."
"The value of nethrops or langoustines sold by my fishermen in Northern Ireland to other parts of Europe plummeted."
"This at the same time as imports of shellfish and fish have become increasingly available."
"Europe needs fish."
"We need fish imports, but I would contend that these should not come at any cost."
"On the one hand, my colleagues want to stop our fishermen receiving any subsidy."
"However, the contradiction comes that, as we seek to remove these subsidies, European policy allows fish imports of unregulated fishery and aquaculture products that undermine the sustainable and economically viable fishing industry we strive for."
"Europe cannot have it both ways."
"There is a lack of consistency, and it is to reverse this that I support Mr Cadec's report."
"(ES) Mr President, this report originated as a response to the frustration and lack of defence of the EU fishing sector."
"Commissioner, this sector is not asking for protectionism, what it is asking for at this stage, given the history of disregard by those in charge of the Directorate-General for Trade, is that it is not sunk even further."
"In this regard, we particularly support the request in the report by Mr Cadec that negotiations on the fishing chapters are transferred from the remit of the Directorate-General for Trade to that of the Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, as is the case with agriculture, as we are also dealing here with products that are particularly sensitive, tuna being the classic case."
"On the subject of tuna, we have a scandalous example in the waiving of the rules of origin without the conditions being taken into account in the agreements with Papua New Guinea and Fiji, which only serves to favour our main competitors: Thailand and the Philippines."
"Commissioner, are you aware that, in addition to strangling the EU sector, thanks to your policy, Papua New Guinea is entering a phase of very low-quality job creation and zero sustainable development?"
"Are you aware of the reports by non-governmental organisations operating in the region of child labour, insanitary conditions and lack of hygiene in factories, the disastrous environmental impact on the Madang coast and illegal fishing?"
"Is it your responsibility to prevent this?"
"Mr President, the behaviour of Members of this House today is disgraceful."
"It would not happen in any other parliament in the world."
"If there is no respect for the Chair of the Committee on Fisheries and for fisheries in general, I propose that you adjourn the sitting until such time as people have respect for this House and stop having these meetings."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Gallagher, we have to carry on."
"I would like to ask all colleagues to please keep quiet so that we can work for 10 more minutes and finish this important report and important work."
"(DE) Mr President, Mrs Damanaki, European fisheries policy is facing enormous challenges."
"Our fishermen have to cope with diminishing stocks and at the same time have to deal with competition on the global market that is not always fair."
"We urgently need to introduce radical reforms in order to put an end to overfishing in European waters and to ensure the survival of European fisheries."
"I agree with Commissioner Damanaki that we should not ask too much of our fishermen by on the one hand demanding that they make radical reforms while on the other liberalising trade."
"Doing both of these things at the same time will place too high a burden on our fishermen."
"The best way to increase competitiveness is to allow fish stocks to recover."
"Another way to enable European fisheries to survive would be through better marketing."
"Under certain circumstances, European consumers are prepared to pay more for European fish if they are better informed about its origin."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioners, I would like to congratulate Mr Cadec on his successful and balanced report."
"I would also like to thank him for his excellent cooperation."
"There are major challenges involved in regulating the import of fishery and aquaculture products into the EU."
"With a volume of 12 million tonnes and a value of EUR 55 billion, the EU fisheries market is the largest in the world."
"This market is growing rapidly and is increasingly dependent on imports from third countries."
"It is therefore important for us to control the conditions under which the products from third countries are produced and imported."
"We have now submitted two amendments in plenary."
"These relate to the need for us to recognise the special economic situation in the peripheral regions of Europe."
"However, we do not hold market liberalisation alone responsible for the difficulties."
"The huge introduction of fish products onto the EU market, which has been described as unfair, also has no direct effect on..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(PL) Mr President, I do not have much time, so I would like just to underline one of the themes of Mr Cadec's report."
"Fish should not be treated in the same way as other industrial products, but should come under the WTO trade rules which apply to sensitive products."
"EU trade policy pays little attention to the specific nature of this sensitive sector and the interests of EU producers."
"Therefore, it is a good idea to evaluate the desirability of fisheries products no longer being subject to the industrial non-agricultural market access rules, in order to facilitate the alignment of trade in fisheries products with the requirements that apply to food and sensitive products."
"(FR) Mr President, I would like to congratulate our fellow Member Mr Cadec on his excellent work."
"The text put to the vote today marks a certain change in the way our institution views the concept of free trade."
"Without being protectionist, the line defended here may be described as less naïve."
"We all agree that European production is insufficient, and rather than immediately resorting to imports, we must first try to intensify our efforts to safeguard and regenerate stocks, including through the use of aquaculture, to ensure the sustainability of the sector and its jobs in the Union, as well as European fisheries that are less dependent on third countries."
"As for imports, we must guarantee that the European market in fishery and aquaculture products does not suffer unfair competition as a result of less strict health and social conditions and ludicrously low tariffs."
"That is why I favour a European label, in accordance with our standards, both environmental and social."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, Europe is currently the biggest European market for fishery and aquaculture products, importing approximately 60% of fish consumed."
"Community production of fish is not and cannot in the near future be enough to satisfy the demand for these kinds of products, and importing them has become a necessity."
"In this context, it is important to safeguard two fundamental aspects: firstly, creating the conditions necessary to ensure that EU consumers have access to good quality imported fishery and aquaculture products; and secondly, establishing a framework of fair competition, both for imported products and for those caught and produced by the fisheries and aquaculture sectors in Europe."
"It is therefore necessary for fishery and aquaculture products that are imported by the European Union to fulfil the same environmental, social, health and quality standards as those imposed on EU products."
"Reform of the common fishery and aquaculture products market is also necessary, particularly the revision of the mechanisms used to counter phenomena such as the gradual suppression of customs duties and the growing competitiveness of imports."
"This report by Parliament, which has been led admirably by Mr Cadec, is timely and considers a number of important proposals for the sustainable development of the fisheries sector and related sectors, including marketing."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner Damanaki, Commissioner De Gucht, thank you for being here at this debate on a very important report on the import arrangements."
"Fishing is an important issue, in relation to which two essential issues need to be emphasised: the fact that we are not self-sufficient, and the fact that unfair competition takes place a great deal of the time, as a result of which there is a need to secure fishing in Europe and to prevent unfair competition."
"I would like to address this to the Commissioner for Trade: you cannot continue considering fishing to be a 'non-sensitive product'; it should not continue to be governed by non-agricultural market access rules; it cannot be a product like industry; it needs to be a 'sensitive product' and it needs to be governed by the rules of the World Trade Organisation and the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations."
"We cannot therefore be sustainable, we cannot guarantee the maintenance of species and we cannot engage in true market activity if we do not consider fish to be a 'sensitive product'."
"Mr President, I rise again to suggest through you to the Conference of Presidents that someone needs to get their act together."
"We were told originally that there would be votes at 12.00."
"This has moved by five minutes every five minutes."
"People have planes to catch; it is inconvenient; it makes a mockery of Parliament."
"Someone get a grip!"
"(Applause)"
"We indicated that the votes would be postponed until 12.15 or 12.20, so please let us carry on with the answers from our Commissioners."
"I am sure that we will be able to vote at 12.20."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I cannot get a grip, but what I can do is to be very brief."
"I would like to say that we are taking care of all the concerns mentioned by the Members."
"As Mr De Gucht and I have already mentioned, we are trying to find a balance."
"We need a viable fisheries sector and we have some obligations to the WTO and other international bodies."
"I would like to reassure everybody that we are doing our best to contribute so that our CAP reform will be for the best future of our fishermen."
"Mr President, I consider the behaviour of our fellow Members completely disrespectful and unacceptable in a Parliament such as ours."
"What you are doing here is scandalous."
"You make me feel ashamed."
"All you are worried about is voting and going home."
"We are working on an important report, so at least have the decency to listen to people or leave the Chamber."
"Anyway, ladies and gentlemen, following my little outburst I have no doubt that in a few minutes you will largely vote in favour of this report, and since I have the opportunity, I must thank our colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries, in particular the Chair Mrs Fraga Estévez, who agreed to take up this matter and entrust me with this report."
"I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs Mr Capoulas Santos, Mrs Reimers, Mr Gróbarczyk and Mrs Lövin for their contributions to all the discussions and the amendments."
"I would also like to thank all those who contributed to this report and the sector representatives who enabled me to carry out my research work, in particular the officials from the Directorate-General of Trade (DG Trade) and the Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (DG Mare)."
"I am thinking of Zoltan Somoguy and Miriam Garcia Ferrer from DG Trade and Pierre Amilhat, Christian Rambeau and Juan Ranco from DG Mare, and I would like to thank you, Mrs Damanaki, for being here, and you too, Mr De Gucht, even if I am not entirely satisfied with your answers - which are not really answers since they preceded my speech."
"In any case, I would also like to thank Mauro Belardinelli from our group, Ollivier Gimenez, my assistants, Emilie Herrbach and Vincent Guerre, and to give a special mention to Philippe Musquar, who helped me greatly with this report and assisted me in its conception."
"I will finish my speech by thanking you in advance for your vote."
"By way of explanation, Mr De Gucht did not reply because of the noise in this room, so I would like to apologise to both our Commissioners for the noise."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place shortly."
"1."
"Agreement between the EU and the USA on the processing and transfer of financial messaging data from the EU to the USA for purposes of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program ("
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, my fellow Members will perhaps understand that, after the European Parliament rejected this agreement in February, it is now necessary to make it clear that in the meantime, working with the Commission, we have managed to make a noticeable improvement to the text."
"I would like to use this opportunity to thank my fellow Members from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left who have worked on this for their help in producing an agreement under difficult circumstances that protects both the right of our citizens to privacy and also their right to security."
"I would like to recall that this has been our first opportunity to breathe life into the Treaty of Lisbon rather than it merely being a lifeless text."
"- After the vote:"
"I would like to thank and congratulate Mr Alvaro, and also the previous rapporteur, Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert, and all the fellow Members who have put so much work into this agreement."
"Thank you very much."
"Mr President, I call your attention to an amendment to this report that asks for the Council and the Commission to deal with Parliament in the appointment of the EU official to be posted to Washington to control the extraction of data."
"I kindly ask that you personally get in touch with the Council and the Commission as soon as possible in order to do this with proper parliamentary oversight."
"Thank you for reminding me."
"I will get in touch with them about this."

"European External Action Service ("
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Brok, and also our negotiators: Mr Brok, Mr Verhofstadt and Mr Gualtieri."
"This was a major piece of work, and many European Parliament committees also contributed."
"We have achieved a broad consensus."
"I would like to thank everyone."
"I would also like to point out that in the near future we will have the two important reports being drafted by Mrs Gräßle and Mr Rapkay, so we have to keep working on this."

"Kosovo ("
"Mr President, on Monday morning there was an assassination attempt on our colleague Peter Miletic, a member of the Kosovo Assembly and a group leader of the Serb minority Liberal party Samostalna Liberalna Stranka."
"He was shot twice and wounded."
"He is one of us, a parliamentarian."
"An attack on an MP anywhere amounts to an attack on democracy."
"This attack was aimed at the efforts to bring lasting stability to the region of the Western Balkans."
"He is in intensive care in hospital in Mitrovica."
"Let us wish him a quick and full recovery and express to him our full political and human support."
"(Applause)"
"We all concur with what you have said."
"Before the vote on Amendment 11:"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I call for the words 'all the people' to be deleted when reference is essentially being made to the dialogue."
"Therefore, the final sentence should be: 'considers that both parties should take a pragmatic approach to the dialogue for the benefit of Kosovo and Serbia'."
"(DE) I would just like the official title of the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice to be included."
"I will read it in English."
"The official wording is 'the Accordance with International Law of the Unilateral Declaration of Independence by the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government of Kosovo'."
"Mr President, this refers to the very recent violent events in Kosovo, one of which my colleague, Mr Kacin, has already mentioned where an ethnic Serb Member of the Kosovo Parliament, Petar Miletić, was shot last Monday."
"Together with this Parliament, I wish him a very speedy recovery."
"There was another incident and it was not possible to make reference to it before the end of the amendments so I will read this oral amendment: 'Expresses its deep concern at the deadly blast that killed one person and injured 10 others that took place in Mitrovica North on 2 July during the demonstrations against the opening of the civil services centre and at the attack of 5 July on an ethnic Serb member of the Kosovo Assembly; strongly condemns all acts of violence and calls on the parties to act responsibly; urges Eulex to make every efforts to defuse tension and prevent further violence and calls on the Kosovo police, with the assistance of Eulex, to start, immediately, thorough and impartial investigations into the events in order to bring the perpetrators to justice'."

"Mr President, given the importance of this vote in advance of the Vienna Conference, I request a role-call vote on the final vote."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group opposes this."
"(The request was rejected)"
"(FR) Let us calm down!"
"As Luxembourg nationals speak and write in French and German, before the vote on this very sensitive resolution, may I draw your attention to the fact that there is an enormous difference between the French and German texts of paragraph 17."
"In the German version, it states that the Member States and the Commission are invited ..."
"(DE) to support measures in the field of safe abortions"
"(FR) ... to support measures for safe abortion."
"I have been told that this part of the sentence does not feature in either the French text or the English text."
"Mr President, if you could clarify whether it is the French text that is authentic, that would definitely help many Members to come to a decision during the vote."
"We will correct all the translations so that they are in harmony with the original texts."
"We will check this."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, given the vote that we have just taken, I wonder if the political party that objected would remove its objection and now allow us to have a roll-call vote on the final vote."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would reiterate our opposition."
"(The request was rejected)"
"- After the vote:"
"Mr President, I do not want to delay the proceedings, and I am glad to see that Mr Cashman is in such good voice."
"I think it would be a good thing if we had a free vote across this House on issues of this kind. Then they could determine the true view of Parliament."
"We have one side that whips the House and only one side that allows a free vote."
"If we really want to determine the view of Parliament on issues of this kind, there should be a free vote across the House."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, if someone is named in this House, it is their right to reply."
"I was named. I therefore want to say to Mr Mitchell and others that, whichever party decides to vote, each of us has our own free vote and the House voted democratically."

"(DE) Mr President, I have not asked for the floor to raise a point of order, but I would like to ask you, Mr President, and my fellow Members to be aware of the following: there is a problem with the translation here."
"I have tabled an amendment to the Lyon report, recital Ae: 'whereas the CAP must be geared to the maintenance and development of multifunctional, sustainable agriculture throughout Europe.'"
"Unfortunately, the word 'extensive' has been used in the translations."
"However, the word 'flächendeckend' in the German translation has a completely different meaning."
"It means 'in all of the regions of Europe'."
"There should be agriculture ('flächendeckend' agriculture) even throughout mountainous regions."
"'Extensive' means something entirely different."
"Thank you for pointing this out."
"We will correct the texts and harmonise them with the original."
"- After the vote on paragraph 44:"
"rapporteur. - Mr President, there seems to be some confusion as to what we were actually voting on there."
"The interpretation told us it was 44, and yet you are announcing that 45 has been accepted."
"There is some confusion that you need to sort out and get the votes right and call them right."
"We were voting on paragraph 44, as I told you."
"I repeat: the amendment has fallen, and paragraph 44 has been adopted."
"That is the outcome of the vote."
"(ES) Mr President, we have just voted on paragraph 44, and although my vote was in favour, I put down 'against' because there was some slight confusion: we were told that we were voting on 45, when in reality we were voting on 44."
"Ladies and gentlemen, if there are so many protests - please listen - we are voting on paragraph 44 again."
"We are voting on paragraph 44. The vote was not clear for me, either, because you did not raise your hands."
"- Before the vote on paragraph 59:"
"Mr President, we need clarification."
"I do not know whether it is you announcing it wrongly or whether it is the interpretation but, in the English, we got 52 again."
"We did not get a call on 59, so we do not know where we are."
"Now we are voting on paragraph 59."
"You have paragraph 59 on the screen at the moment."
"This is a separate vote."
"- Before the vote on recital C:"
"Mr President, can I just say that Recital AE is before C. We have not voted on AE yet."
"We have completely different information here."
"We now have to vote on recital C."
"- Before the vote on recital AE:"
"(DE) Mr President, since it was explained at the start of this vote that the German version was the original text, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) will dispense with a split vote."
"My group is able to vote in favour of recital Ae."
"Mr Deß, I will explain."
"The request was made not just by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), but also by another political group, and so we will continue as planned and take a split vote, because this has also been requested by another group."
"(DE) In that case I will ask my group to vote in favour twice."
"Since the German version is the original text, we do not need to vote against in the second vote."

"Explanations of vote"
"Oral explanations of vote"
"Mr President, I voted in favour of the agreement between the European Union and the United States to share financial data for the purposes of terrorist finance tracking."
"We are well aware of the threat terrorism poses to our own security as well as that of our partners across the Atlantic."
"I do not need to remind you of all the terrorist attacks that have taken place on European soil throughout the last decade."
"It is also obvious that our American partners represent a very important strategic ally, not only in the area of global security, but also economically and in other areas as well."
"The commitment to such a strategic partnership was clearly expressed by Vice President Joe Biden in this House just a few months ago."
"We should therefore be proud that we finally gave consent to the agreement that is so important for efforts to track terrorist activities, especially since the new agreement contains significant improvements, and clarifications made by the European Parliament have been largely taken into account."
"Mr President, there are many reasons to vote against this resolution but too many to cover in just 60 seconds."
"We must of course oppose terrorism but that must not be used as an excuse for governments to spy on their citizens."
"The confidential information concerned belongs to the citizen, not to the European Union, the Parliament or indeed the nation state."
"Any such agreement should be concluded between sovereign nation states, answerable to their own people through the democratic process."
"In any case, this is a one-sided agreement and we have no reason to believe that the United States will honour it."
"The agreement breaks UK data protection law, which bans the sharing of information without consent between overseas third parties."
"The British Government has an opt-out clause on this, and I hope they overcome their usual spinelessness and oppose and vote against it in the same way I did."
"(PL) I endorsed the Alvaro report."
"In order to be effective, we must have workable instruments for fighting terrorism."
"One very important preventative tool involves monitoring and reducing the financial resources which reach and belong to terrorists."
"Very often, in fact, money is the fuel for terrorist activities."
"If there is no money, terrorist activity is held back, and that is, of course, the aim of our efforts."
"Better monitoring of the flow of money can be a fundamental hindrance to terrorist activity and preparations for acts of terror, so I am very glad that we have managed to reach an understanding and that we have adopted both the agreement and the report."
"(FI) Mr President, I voted in favour of this report by Mr Alvaro."
"I think it is very important that we can fight terrorism together, and it is very important that nations that have the same values can work together."
"It is important to strengthen transatlantic relations between the European Union and the United States of America, and, as we know, our values are the same."
"Obviously, data protection legislation has to be respected here, but there must be a limit: we cannot hide behind data protection in cases of terrorism."
"In this respect it needs to be very clear."
"I believe and hope that in this way we can continue the fight against terrorism and thereby bring peace to this world."
"Mr President, there is always a delicate balance to be drawn between civil liberties and security."
"Several times since the twin tower attacks nine years ago I think we have got that balance wrong."
"We have got it wrong because of a false equation in politics, whereby politicians think that their action needs to be in proportion to the extent of public outrage, rather than in proportion to the need to remedy an identified problem."
"This Chamber has made that mistake, but it has not been alone."
"National parliaments have done the same thing on both sides of the Atlantic."
"On this occasion, though, I believe we have got the balance right."
"We have taken our time, we have put in sensible safeguards, and I think that we are enabling the security forces of the world to collaborate effectively in the fight against terror without an unacceptable price in terms of civic freedom."
"This is exactly the kind of thing the European Union should concentrate on: a cross-border issue which cannot be left to the Member States."
"If it did this kind of thing all the time, the rest of us would not have such a problem."
"(GA) Mr President, I voted against the report on the European External Action Service."
"The External Action Service must be placed in the context of the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the changes made to this common policy by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The Treaty of Lisbon provides more resources to strengthen the ammunition and military industry in Europe, and because of the same treaty it will be easier for the big European countries who are military powers to mount a military mission."
"There is no doubt that in future the strongest powers in the Union will be willing to engage in military campaigns outside Europe when they think that this is in their economic interests, just as the United States has done."
"The External Action Service will be an instrument for promoting the economic, political and military interests of European capitalism, and this will not contribute to global peace but quite the opposite."
"Mr President, I supported Elmar Brok's report."
"The united position of the European Parliament has taken maximum advantage of the new opportunities the Lisbon Treaty offers."
"I support especially the European Parliament's political and financial supervision of the European External Action Service."
"I am satisfied about the consent of the High Representative to create such a special human rights and democracy structure as the EEAS headquarters."
"But, most importantly, we continue to support the practical implementation of an adequate geographical balance, with an EEAS staff comprising representatives from all 27 Member States."
"This process has only begun."
"I think it is important that the 2013 review should also cover this issue of equal representation."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of this report because I am convinced that the creation of the European External Action Service (EEAS) is a fundamental step, a historic step in the development and evolution of EU foreign policy."
"I especially welcome the passage in the report which stresses the importance of ensuring greater policy coherence of the EU's external action as a whole through consultations between the EEAS and Member States' diplomatic services."
"This would avoid duplication of work while ensuring long-term consistency in the promotion of the EU's strategic interests and fundamental values abroad."
"Mr President, I voted against this report."
"While many here are no doubt ecstatic at the creation of the EEAS as another milestone on the road to Union, the UK electorate gets angrier with the erosion of national sovereignty and is perplexed at the idea that UK foreign policy should - or could - become subservient to someone who is not elected by the British people."
"Our Foreign Secretary now pledges to work closely with the High Representative because the EEAS is going to have a considerable bearing on the future success of Europe's global role."
"The irony will not be lost on UK taxpayers that the same government, asking departments to show the effects of 40% cuts in departmental spending, endorses a service estimated to cost EUR 900 million that British taxpayers neither need nor want."
"Those of us who opposed the creation of the EEAS out of principle in 2008 still oppose it."
"(FI) Mr President, in the vote on establishing the Union's External Action Service I supported the amendments that focus on the inclusion of national parliaments in the supervision of the service."
"Otherwise, I voted in line with my group's position on the matter."
"The need is obvious: it is time the EU was acknowledged more clearly not just as a global payer, but also as a global actor."
"The change is necessary, as our role as the UN's biggest provider of finance, one that has largely gone unnoticed, has shown."
"Besides, I hope that the change to this role will also be reflected in the structure of the UN Security Council."
"It is to be hoped that international organisations such as this will be able to review their concepts regarding current global structures."
"(LV) Thank you, Mr President."
"The European External Action Service offers the possibility of making European Union foreign policy more effective, more unified and strategically more coherent."
"It is high time we proved that we can work in a coordinated way and that our influence in the world has not diminished."
"The European External Action Service will represent the common position of the whole European Union."
"However, without taking into account and harmonising individual Member States' interests and delicate issues, the Service will not be able to function effectively."
"This practice must become the priority of European Union foreign policy."
"Adequate geographical representation must be an unambiguous fundamental principle in the formation of the Service."
"From the earliest days of its activity, we must ensure professional and also proportional representation of Member States' diplomatic corps in this Service."
"The compromise that has been introduced - meaningful representation - places a special responsibility on the foundation of this Service, in order that all Member States are truly properly represented in the newly established Service, and I am grateful to Mr Brok for his splendid work on this report. Thank you."
"(PL) Mr President, we have made a decision today, which will accelerate creation of the European External Action Service."
"I want to draw attention to some important problems which we should take into account."
"Firstly, foreign policy requires coordination with many other areas, and it is difficult to separate it from work in the area of, for example, development policy, trade policy, the operation of global financial institutions or economic affairs in a globalised world."
"Secondly, the EU diplomatic service should reflect the character of the Union."
"Responsibility for important regulatory, supervisory and budgetary functions rests with the European Parliament."
"Thirdly, the unclear situation concerning who has control of the EEAS is causing great concern."
"This may lead to the establishment of another Union institution."
"Fourthly, there is a lack of clearly defined competences in the area of forms of cooperation with the diplomatic services of Member States."
"Fifthly and finally, let us remember that good diplomacy is built up over many years."
"The EEAS should build on the values and identity of the European Union."
"Lastly, I would like to say that at world level the Union should be better prepared for crisis management and civilian and military capabilities in the area..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(FI) Mr President, I voted in favour of the report on the European External Action Service because I know that this is the result of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Reform Treaty."
"Despite that, I do have a few questions and concerns regarding this new service."
"Right back in the early days, when it started to be put together, they said that it would be costneutral."
"Now, however, we all know that it will cost European taxpayers a great deal."
"Obviously, the High Representative needs resources."
"Nevertheless, when we are establishing new institutions, new systems, it is always worth stating at the outset what they are all about, to avoid the impression that we are moving forward on the basis of what might be seen as white lies."
"What worries me about this is that the large Member States will have an even greater say in affairs as a result of this service."
"That is why I hope that when people are chosen for various positions in the service, the whole of Europe might be fairly represented and that the European national parliaments can also have a role to play in it."
"In this way we could ensure that the service operated in a more equitable fashion."
"Mr President, I welcome the vote on the External Action Service but, now we have taken this vote, I think it is important that we move away from procedure and structures to actually getting on with the work of the Service."
"It is important that Catherine Ashton, now that she has a team, puts the core European values into action."
"Human rights have to be her top concern."
"In particular, she has promised that there is going to be a human rights desk officer in every external office."
"She needs to deliver on that, but there also has to be a structure for that desk officer to report back to the centre, to make sure we get some joined-up government in terms of the way the European Union deals with human rights."
"At the moment, with many countries, not least China, we have a human rights dialogue that is totally meaningless."
"The External Action Service, if it is to be worth the money and effort we are putting into it, has to start delivering on European values and human rights in particular."
"Mr President, there is something quaint, almost touching, about these debates about creating a European External Action Service, as though the European Union did not already have the full apparatus of a diplomatic service."
"Go to any third country and you will find an EU embassy that towers over any of the Member State legations."
"The European Union's diplomatic corps has already squeezed out the national services."
"Baroness Ashton has about twice the salary of William Hague, the British Foreign Secretary, and she controls a budget about 20 times as large as that of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office."
"In a way, this would not be quite so bad if the common foreign policy of the European Union were demonstrably superior to that which is being pursued by the Member States, but it is not."
"What is it doing?"
"It is isolating Taiwan and cosying up to the tyrants in Beijing, it is refusing to deal with the anti-Castro dissidents in Cuba, it is cosying up to the Ayatollahs in Tehran, and it is funnelling money to Hamas."
"I think we could just about manage to do better."
"We are the fourth-largest military power on the planet and the fifth-largest economy."
"I think we can run our own foreign policy to suit our own interests!"
"(DE) Mr President, I voted against the Brok report for four reasons."
"The architecture of the service has numerous weaknesses, the details of which still cause us great concern."
"The second point is that the European Union ambassador will manage Commission funds in future."
"That exposes these funds to numerous risks, and the safeguards against these risks are still extremely unclear."
"The third point is the relinquishment of the rights of this Parliament in a Council regulation."
"We are de facto codecision-makers in this procedure and yet we have allowed the Council regulation to anticipate our parliamentary rights."
"Therefore, as regards my dossier - the Financial Regulation - I would like to say that I do not consider myself bound by today's decisions."
"The fourth point is the question of how we actually treat each other in Parliament."
"We adopted a parliamentary reform during the last parliamentary term as well as procedures that we have now all trampled underfoot, including with the approval of the Bureau and that of the President."
"Why carry out a parliamentary reform that stipulates procedures if, when it matters, we violate these procedures and do not follow them?"
"For these reasons, I cannot vote in favour of this report."
"(RO) I voted differently to the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) on the Kosovo resolution."
"Unfortunately, I did not have any option other than to vote against this text."
"There are a number of basic issues in this resolution which I agree with and I think that we can all support."
"Kosovo's inhabitants must enjoy a viable democracy, with a fair, impartial judicial system, and a society free of corruption where human rights and the rights of minorities in particular are respected."
"In a nutshell, I would like to see lasting stability and economic development for the province of Kosovo as part of the Western Balkans' European prospects."
"However, I am from a country which has not recognised Kosovo's independence."
"From this perspective, I find the numerous references in this text to the features of a state, such as country, government, citizens, borders and so on, unacceptable."
"I regret that the position of states which do not recognise Kosovo's independence was not given greater consideration."
"(ES) Mr President, as we have indicated on other occasions, no vote by the Spanish Socialist delegation may be interpreted as acceptance of the international recognition, implicit or explicit, of Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence."
"Likewise, with our vote against we would like to express our opposition to Parliament requesting that Member States of the European Union give international recognition to a territory whose secession is not supported by either a United Nations Security Council resolution or an agreement between the parties."
"We affirm that the international law that applies is determined by what is laid down within Resolution 1244/99 of the United Nations Security Council."
"However, we are not questioning a European outlook for the Balkans and its inhabitants, and we believe that inter-regional dialogue, as was promoted by the Spanish Presidency of the Council at the High Level Conference that took place in Sarajevo on 2 June, may be an effective route towards this."
"Mr President, I voted in favour of the resolution."
"I would like to commend the fact that the European Parliament engages in discussion with the Commission and the Council on the very important issue of Kosovo's future."
"Kosovo can be considered the last piece in the complex Balkan political puzzle."
"It is therefore vital that we put the piece in the right place and manage the process in a harmonious and peaceful way."
"The independence of Kosovo has already been recognised by 69 countries, including 22 EU Member States."
"It is important to note that EU integration prospects serve as the strongest incentive for the Balkan countries to undertake necessary reforms and also as a factor for regional stability."
"Kosovo is not an exception."
"Therefore, if we want to anchor Kosovo in Europe and ensure regional stability in the Balkans, it is vital that we come up with a common approach towards the whole region and Kosovo in particular."
"(DE) Mr President, as rapporteur for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) I would like to thank Mrs Lunacek for her excellent cooperation."
"The text that we have adopted today is much better than the one that came from the committee, because we have made it clear in the text that the division of Kosovo is not an option."
"That is a crucial point."
"We have demanded - as was already the case in the draft produced by the committee - that the remaining five Member States recognise Kosovo."
"That is the logical thing to do, because as long ago as 2005 and 2007, the European Parliament called for Kosovo to be recognised with a three-quarters majority."
"Most Member States have now done this."
"We therefore need to bring clarity to the situation, because we need to make it clear that there will be no new negotiations on the status of Kosovo."
"Mr Panzeri, for whom I have high regard, was quoted in the media today as saying that he is in favour of renewed status negotiations."
"That would be highly dangerous, and it is therefore essential that clarity is established here and that this report reinforces the indivisibility and recognition of Kosovo as well as the involvement of Kosovo in the screening process, in other words in the pre-accession strategy."
"Mr President, from the earliest days of the Treaties of Paris and Rome, the European project has elevated the goal of supranationalism over that of freedom or democracy and, in fairness, it is exporting its ideology."
"We are effectively maintaining a protectorate in Kosovo, as we do in Bosnia, for the sole purpose of artificially holding together a multi-ethnic state."
"I was an early supporter of Kosovan independence."
"It seemed to me a very clear case, where more than 90%of people had voted in a referendum for self-government, that they should be granted it."
"But we surely ought to extend that principle to national minorities within that territory and to aim at ethnographic frontiers - in other words to allow the Serbian population, conveniently clustered close to Serbia proper, to do de jure what they are doing de facto and have government from the hands of their own countrymen."
"There is a conflict between supranationalism and democracy."
"You can hold a multi-ethnic state together - as the Yugoslav Federation was and also the Ottoman Empire, the Habsburg Empire and the Soviet Union - but as soon as you give people the vote, they opt for democratic self-determination."
"We should recognise it."
"Mr President, I also voted in favour of this resolution because I think we should once again reiterate our support for the European integration aspirations of the countries in the Balkan region within the stabilisation and association process."
"Albania is certainly a country which has made tangible progress in the context of the reform process."
"However, it is also a country which needs to do more to get closer to EU norms and accession criteria."
"More substantial efforts are needed to consolidate democracy and the rule of law and to ensure the country's sustainable development."
"The political crisis following the June 2009 parliamentary elections is deplorable."
"We must make clear to our Albanian partners that fully functioning representative institutions - parliament being the most important one - are the backbone of a consolidated democratic system and perhaps the most important political criterion for EU integration."
"(DE) Mr President, the ex-Communist Socialists in Albania are trying to destabilise the successful government there."
"This is something we reject, but, unfortunately, exactly the same thing is being attempted right now in Macedonia."
"Two days ago, the Socialist opposition leader of the country, Mr Crvenkovski, was here in this House."
"He held confidential talks with Commissioner Füle, and afterwards - which is against all of the EU rules - a press release was issued from these internal talks, claiming that the Commissioner had agreed that he was right to pursue his internal political polemics."
"This was not the case, and I also said this to Mr Füle yesterday."
"An EU Commissioner must not be abused for the purpose of socialist propaganda and for internal political ends."
"The Macedonian Government has democratic legitimacy."
"It does first-class work and it is putting the country on the path towards European Union membership."
"The opposition has the right to oppose, but it does not have the right to abuse the European Union for that purpose."
"Mr President, I voted in favour of the resolution because I would like to join my colleagues in condemning the violence that erupted in Kyrgyzstan last month."
"It is deplorable that hundreds of armed Kyrgyz men stormed the city streets, shooting civilians and setting fire to shops, choosing their targets purely on the basis of ethnicity."
"I would like to extend my condolences to the families of the approximately 300 dead and the 2 000 who were injured or hospitalised."
"It is important that the EU keeps pressure on the Kyrgyz authorities to conduct a credible, impartial and independent investigation into the violence."
"(LV) As a result of the ethnic aggression in southern Kyrgyzstan in June, hundreds of people have lost their lives, thousands have been injured, and tens of thousands have been forced to flee their homes."
"This testifies to the need for the European Union to become more actively involved in the resolution of these processes in Central Asia."
"Aid to Kyrgyzstan should be targeted at people and not at a specific government."
"As late as the Central Asian delegation meeting on 22 June, the ambassador of Kyrgyzstan, Mr Azilov, insisted that the violence was not an act of ethnic cleansing, and that foreign media were not presenting an objective assessment of the situation."
"Uzbekistan has a different opinion in this question."
"As the report indicates, several human rights activists have been arrested without due cause in Kyrgyzstan."
"These facts must be borne in mind when evaluating European Union strategy towards the existing political power in Kyrgyzstan."
"Talks must be held in parallel also with other states in the region, especially with Kyrgyzstan's neighbours Russia and China."
"Those countries also have significant influence in this region."
"The report calls on the government of Kyrgyzstan to carry out a credible and responsible investigation into the conflict, possibly in the presence of foreign observers."
"That is why I support this report, since this investigation is desperately necessary. Thank you."
"(RO) I preferred to abstain on this resolution as the deadline specified in Article 2 of the text, which also refers to Romania, may be too restrictive in the context of the negotiations in Geneva on the convention for banning certain types of conventional weapons."
"I think that the UN mechanism provides an adequate multilateral framework for examining and negotiating an international legal instrument which will regulate the cluster munitions regime, at a time when 110 states are involved in negotiations."
"(DE) Mr President, the common agricultural policy is a success story."
"I was therefore pleased to see the broad support in Parliament, as we have already achieved a great deal: firstly, a stable food supply for the population, secondly, maintenance and preservation of the cultural landscape and, thirdly, the renewal of important resources and protection of the environment and of the flora and fauna."
"Of course, there are new and future tasks."
"These include green growth, renewable energies and combating world hunger."
"With the common agricultural policy, we are to a certain degree creating a source of jobs throughout the EU that is independent of the size or the form of the undertaking."
"The Lyon report defines these tasks of the common European agricultural policy extremely well, and it explicitly acknowledges the two-pillar structure of the common agricultural policy."
"We must now work together to provide suitable financial resources for these political tasks."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the Lyon report because I agree with the rapporteur on the need to draw up a common agricultural policy that, firstly, continues the broad reform process that has taken place in recent years and, secondly, can provide concrete and innovative solutions to the numerous challenges to be faced in the coming years."
"I believe, in fact, that the five fundamental elements described in the report - namely, food security, sustainability, agriculture across Europe, biodiversity and environmental protection, and, lastly, green growth - are an excellent starting point for guaranteeing a future common agricultural policy that takes account of ongoing, rapid development not just in Europe but also, and more specifically, worldwide."
"(DE) Mr President, with the Lyon report on the future of the European agricultural policy we have enabled a clear opinion to be formed and given the Commission clear and implementable standards."
"I voted in favour of the report and I am pleased that it has broad support here in this House."
"With growing demands for a healthy environment, healthy food and foresight and sustainability in agricultural production, the European Union must also be prepared to subsidise and support these essential areas."
"Europe has a duty to guarantee food security for its citizens."
"As an area with a naturally favourable climate, Europe also has a responsibility to ensure that people world-wide are supplied with food."
"However, in so doing the European Union needs to work better and in a more coherent way with the rest of the world."
"Europe must guarantee a suitable livelihood for rural communities."
"There is one thing we need to bear in mind: if necessary, we could also import food, but not in a way that meets our conditions."
"We must produce and maintain a healthy environment here."
"Our farmers need a fair wage."
"(PL) I endorsed this report."
"However, I would like to say I am in favour of retaining partial intervention in agricultural markets in difficult situations."
"This is not inconsistent with free market principles."
"We must give more attention to the development of rural areas, expansion of infrastructure, educational affairs and the demographic situation."
"The number of young farmers continues to fall, while we have increasing numbers of older farmers."
"The conditions and standard of living on farms and in rural areas are significantly lower - much lower and much worse - than in urban areas."
"Furthermore, the incomes of farming families amount to around 60% of those of families who support themselves by other means."
"Farmers have held protests about this."
"In summary, we should aim for the sustainable development of agriculture and rural areas."
"(LV) Thank you, Mr President."
"I support this resolution because it emphasises several preconditions for the future of the common agricultural policy which deserve support."
"It stresses that financing for the policy must be preserved for at least the next long-term financial period."
"Secondly, it requires that direct payments to farmers be fully financed from the European Union budget."
"Thirdly, it refers to securing fair competition, which is currently the most significant thing that is lacking from the provisional common agricultural policy."
"Although my country, Latvia, has now been a Member State of the European Union for a considerable time, our farmers receive approximately EUR 90 per hectare in subsidies, whereas Greek farmers are paid approximately EUR 550, and German and French farmers above EUR 300 per hectare."
"These destructive discrepancies distort competition and the whole European Union market. What is more, they widen the gap between new and old Member States, ignore the principles of cohesion, delay their implementation and hamper countries' economic development."
"The new policy must be framed fairly, with support of equal value, so as to eliminate destructive discrepancies and ensure fair competition throughout the European Union."
"(FI) Mr President, I have to say that I voted in favour of the Lyon report."
"On a few points I had what I might call national reservations, or I voted a bit differently."
"We have to realise that, although this proposal of Mr Lyon's is an excellent and comprehensive one for agriculture and its reform in the European Union, the common agricultural policy is not in every respect directly suited to every situation - I speak as someone from a small nation, Finland, where the conditions for engaging in agriculture are very different from those the large Member States, such as France and Germany."
"That is why I introduced a few derogations when I voted."
"I hope that in future the European Parliament and the Union can pay greater attention too to the small-scale agriculture, the small countries and the agriculture practised there, because agriculture, in a way, is a national life assurance policy."
"Every Member State needs its own agriculture and has to ensure that it is preserved."
"Mr President, I voted against the Lyon report because all over Europe governments are cutting their budgets."
"In the United Kingdom nurses and teachers face cuts in their pay and pensions."
"Police numbers are being cut and prisoners are being released because we cannot afford to keep them in prison."
"Yet here in the European Parliament representatives of the Conservative and Liberal parties that make up the UK Government somehow find it within themselves to vote to retain farming expenditure up to 2013 and beyond 2013 at 2013 levels."
"I find that entirely unacceptable."
"I find it wrong that the agricultural community should be ring-fenced in a way that no other section of society is."
"If it is right for public servants to face reductions in their income, then it is right for others in our society to face the same reductions."
"The Government in the UK and governments across Europe are saying we are all in this together."
"If we are in it together, we all have to feel the pain together."
"Mr President, I think one can understand why, when the political leaders of Europe saw their war-ravaged countries at the end of the Second World War, they wanted to promote the idea of food security and the common agricultural policy."
"However, if you look at the policy 60 years later, let us look at the cost to the EU citizens."
"Let us look at the fact that citizens pay three times: once in tax to pay for the bureaucracy, once in tax to pay for subsidies, and then the higher prices that they have to pay in their shops."
"Surely, rather than talking about the reform of the common agricultural policy, we should be looking to abolish it."
"Scrapping the CAP would allow efficient farmers to thrive."
"It would allow taxpayers to keep more of their own money and deploy that money more usefully, and it would allow consumers lower prices."
"Reform is not enough - it is time to scrap the CAP."
"(FI) Mr President, I voted in favour of the Lyon report."
"It is balanced, and it guarantees and ensures that all over Europe people can engage in agriculture and produce food, thereby assuring a food supply for its citizens."
"There were a few points on which I voted differently from my group, because I believe that in certain situations we need market regulation and intervention."
"They are needed to guarantee the food supply as well as sustainable development."
"(DE) Mr President, I voted in favour of the report, and there were two things about it that were particularly important to me."
"The first one is of an environmental, social and qualitative nature. In this regard, it is important for imported products to satisfy the same requirements as products produced within the European Union, because what is the use in us managing our fish stocks in a sustainable way if other trading partners then almost eradicate the stocks in the world's oceans?"
"The second aspect is an economic one."
"If self-sufficiency within the EU is only 40% and the fish stocks on the global markets are at risk, then it is clear that here, too, there is a particularly good opportunity for aquaculture."
"We ought to develop this economic sector, provide it with scientific support and, above all, structure it in a sustainable way, because there are jobs in aquaculture, too, as well as, ultimately, added value for our European Union."
"(LV) Thank you."
"This report emphasises that the ecological and economic viability of European Union fisheries must be conserved, including non-industrial fishing of a constant volume in coastal waters, and of a type that would help to preserve the cultural identity of the relevant region, secure jobs in all stages of production and the supply of safe and high-quality produce."
"Unfortunately, the reality is that Latvian fishermen receive such meagre quotas and such meagre European Union support that it is more economical for us to scrap boats and stop fishing."
"This is a truly tragic situation, in which a traditional sector of the economy is being destroyed in a country with a 550 km coastline."
"Damage is being done to small-scale fishing as a whole, with a European Union policy that supports industrial producers with fishing practices that are often harmful to the environment."
"For this reason, I supported this report, which calls for the current situation to be changed."
"(GA) Mr President, I voted in favour of this fine report from Alain Cadec and I attended the debate in Parliament earlier but there was no time for the 'catch the eye', so I am taking this opportunity to say a few words."
"Firstly, the primary obligation of the European Union is to take care of our own citizens, especially when it relates to the fishing industry, because they have been involved in it for years, and their ancestors for hundreds and thousands of years, and they must be protected."
"Secondly, products coming into the European Union should be to the same standard - or maybe a higher one - as products originating from inside the European Union."
"And finally, we must do much more to promote aquaculture."
"That would greatly help to solve this problem."
"Mr President, I would like to thank you and all your staff for all your patience."
"I must say when I first came across the idea of the CFP, I thought the C in the CFP stood for communist, rather than common, fisheries policy."
"Here we actually see the idea of central planning, where central planners decide how much fishermen in each nation can catch and, like communism, it has been a disaster."
"It has led to a depletion of fishing stocks and ever more fishermen are complaining about the lack of quota they have been given."
"Surely it is time to learn from the lessons of successful fish preservation and conservation."
"Let us look at the property rights-based systems in Iceland and in New Zealand where, as the previous speaker has said, the coastal communities are looked after because they are given their rights in perpetuity which they can sell on, they can trade, or they can leave to future generations."
"Surely, that is the best answer because it has been a success and has conserved fish, rather than the CFP system which has been a dramatic failure in Europe."
"Written explanations of vote"
"We voted against this disgraceful terror agreement, which provides personal data on every inhabitant of the EU to the US secret services within the framework of 'anti-terrorism collaboration'."
"The representatives of capital in the European Parliament who voted for the 'SWIFT agreement' are unaware of its content, given that only 'trusted' MEPs were allowed to read the 'confidential' text, while the European Parliament has rejected it twice in the last six months."
"They were persuaded that the USA had guaranteed that 'the secret services would ensure that personal data are protected'."
"Approval of the 'terror agreement' confirms that the European Parliament supposedly democratically legitimises these deeply reactionary, anti-grassroots, euro-unifying policies."
"Moreover, it plays a leading part in the institutionalisation of a legislative framework of state terrorism and repression which puts a stranglehold on democratic rights and grassroots freedoms."
"No 'terror agreement' respects grassroots freedoms."
"These measures target the fight and resistance of the peoples, their vanguard, the communist movement, and the radical powers which refuse to bow down to the barbarism of the exploitative capital system."
"As long as capital and its political face step up measures to repress and put a stranglehold on the rights of workers and consolidate and safeguard its sovereignty, the greater the resistance, disobedience and inevitable fight to overturn the power of the monopolies and their reactionary unions will be."
"In February 2010, the European Parliament refused to sign an EU/United States of America agreement on the transfer of financial data and requested the resumption of negotiations."
"Today, the terms of this agreement have been considerably improved, in the interest of European citizens."
"This time therefore I voted in favour of the agreement, particularly as it provides in the long term for the establishment of an entirely European data extraction system."
"This agreement is therefore a temporary solution, enabling the European Union and the United States to combat terrorism, but cannot be considered definitive."
"I decided to abstain on the Agreement between the European Union and the United States of America on the transfer of bank data by SWIFT for the purposes of combating terrorism."
"The agreement is a significant step forward compared to the previous version."
"After raising its voice, the European Parliament was able to obtain a number of guarantees which strengthen data protection and the rights of the people concerned."
"Nonetheless, in my opinion the choice of Europol as the authority responsible for the transmission of data is unsuitable."
"Europol is not an independent authority, but a police agency which I doubt is in a position to monitor impartially the compliance of transfer applications by the US authorities."
"Given the highly sensitive nature of the personal data transferred, I could not vote for this agreement."
"It is a fact that, in the wake of 11 September 2001, no human being takes his or her security and physical safety for granted."
"The crux of any measure designed to restore faith among Europeans is therefore the protection of personal information: it is crucial to ensure that such information remains private, but processing it - especially if it is financial information - is a significant means of combating international terrorism."
"I therefore voted in favour of Mr Alvaro's report on the agreement that defines the conditions under which the US Treasury will be able, from 1 August, to access the financial data of around 8 000 institutions and banks in 200 countries, managed by the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT)."
"In view of the necessary safeguards such as the possibility for European citizens to lodge an administrative appeal and receive the same treatment as US citizens, and the crackdown on the length of time in which information is stored, cooperation between Europe and the United States is, in this case, a proper tribute to the negative effects of globalisation."
"in writing. - (NL) The delegation of the PvdA (Dutch Labour Party) to the European Parliament endorses this agreement, in the hope that in the foreseeable future we will be able to see an end to the mass transfer of data relating to European citizens."
"The agreement states that Europe will develop its own system for the collection and sorting of bank details."
"That will offer the opportunity to individualise transfers."
"By keeping the data under our own supervision, we will be better placed to protect the rights of our citizens."
"The European Commission will submit a proposal to this effect within a year and we should be able to implement such a system of our own within three years."
"From that moment on, the issue of reciprocity will become relevant."
"Our European supervisors in the US will be able to verify what happens to any European bank details on a daily basis."
"Europol will be charged with the task of verifying and approving US requests."
"Under pressure from the European Parliament, the agreement which we have already concluded is coming up for review."
"We have not had all our wishes granted, but what we have achieved is a guarantee that the US will not be able to nose into our data just like that."
"The new agreement strikes a balance between protecting privacy and guaranteeing security."
"In the meantime, the fight against terrorism will remain our overriding concern."
"I voted for the Alvaro report concerning the new SWIFT agreement, which outlines conditions for the transfer of certain banking data stored by SWIFT at the US Treasury Department as part of the fight against terrorism."
"Using the new powers conferred upon it since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, we have forced the Commission to renegotiate a more balanced agreement with the United States."
"While this agreement is satisfactory, certain points could still have been improved."
"Today's positive vote is not a blank cheque to the Americans: Parliament will remain extremely vigilant in the months ahead, particularly with regard to the procedure modifying Europol's powers, designation of the independent authority present in Washington and the establishment of a European TFTP."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the new SWIFT report, as safeguards have been negotiated with the European Council and with the United States which were not in the agreement presented to the European Parliament four months ago."
"This agreement over the transfer of banking data to the United States stipulates that the EU must develop a system to avoid any bulk transfer of data, which was not stipulated in the previous agreement."
"I voted against the report on the transfer of bank details by the European Union to America, for the same reasons that I and my group opposed the previous attempt to impose this agreement, despite any 'technical' improvements made by the report."
"The European Parliament should not approve the European Commission's agreement to hand over personal data to the US government and secret services on the pretext of the 'fight against terrorism'."
"I oppose the Commission's insistence on transmitting information in general on financial transactions to the USA, because this infringes respect for personal data and this is information and material that will be used, without any fundamental control, by the US secret services for their own purposes."
"in writing. - UKIP voted against the Alvaro report today because we do not want to give the EU greater power over personal data."
"This measure will lead to a gross violation of personal privacy."
"Confidential and private financial data belongs to the individual and not to the EU or the European Parliament."
"We are resolutely opposed to the spread of terrorism, but personal confidentiality must be protected where there is no prior suggestion of wrong-doing."
"If the UK is to enter into an agreement with the US it must be a fully reciprocal arrangement and not the almost one-way-traffic one that the EU has signed up to here."
"This is a matter for national governments to decide, and not for the European Parliament."
"in writing. - (PT) In February I voted against the agreement because it violated the principles of necessity and proportionality, as well as the integrity and security of European financial data."
"This new agreement is better than the previous one."
"There have been improvements, such as a narrower definition of terrorism, the exclusion of Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) data, the monitoring mechanism and recognition of the rights of the European public."
"This agreement, however, continues to allow the mass transfer of data (bulk data)."
"The choice of Europol is wrong."
"Europol is neither a judicial authority nor a data protection authority."
"Giving Europol new functions would only be possible by changing the legal basis, with input from the European Parliament."
"The wording of Article 20 in the agreement diminishes the effectiveness of the recognition of various rights which have just been considered at the request of Parliament."
"I look forward to the Commission submitting an initiative to create a European Terrorist Finance Tracking Program (TFTP), and expect that this will provide a more solid solution, allowing data mining only to take place within the EU."
"For all these reasons I decided to abstain from voting, as I still cannot conscientiously accept that this agreement has reached an acceptable level."
"in writing. - (PT) The fight against terrorism must be a priority for the European Union."
"Pro-active cooperation with the United States in this context, namely in terms of information and data sharing, is central to increasing efficiency in the fight against terrorism, to prevent future attacks and ensure the security of the European public."
"I am therefore voting in favour of the measures proposed in this report."
"The amendments made to this agreement not only reflect the majority of concerns expressed by the European Parliament at the time of its rejection on 11 February, but also express the need for proportionality in the treatment of this data, namely as regards their processing, storage and subsequent deletion."
"I also emphasise the strengthened guarantees the new agreement gives to European citizens in terms of data protection, namely the right to appeal against judicial and administrative decisions, the right to transparency and communication of information to the citizens in question and the definition of the sphere of the data's application, restricted to activity directly related to terrorism or its financing."
"Six months ago, the European Parliament acted as a defender of fundamental rights by rejecting the agreement between the EU and the US concerning the transfer and processing of banking data - the so-called 'SWIFT' agreement."
"Thanks to the action of MPs and of our group in particular, a new version was drawn up."
"It contains significant underlying improvements, such as the elimination of 'bulk' data transfers."
"More protection will therefore be afforded to the rights of individuals, whilst acknowledging the importance of tracking financial data in the fight against terrorism."
"That is why I chose to vote in favour of the new agreement."
"However I will continue to be particularly attentive to the following points: the prerogatives of European data protection authorities and the choice of Europol as screening authority; the effectiveness of the 'right of redress' of people whose privacy rights have been flouted; and the monitoring and evaluation of the relevancy of data transmitted to the American authorities."
"I voted in favour of the conclusion of the new Agreement between the European Union and the United States of America on the processing and transfer of Financial Messaging Data for the purposes of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program, because I felt that the new proposal tabled by the Commission offered EU citizens increased assurances, in particular as regards data protection."
"In fact I believe that any transfer of European personal data to a third country for security purposes must respect procedural safeguards and rights of defence as well as comply with applicable national and European data protection legislation."
"A few months ago the first version of the agreement was too vague and did not offer similar guarantees."
"That is why we said 'No'."
"Today I am delighted that our proposals for improvement have been taken into account, including the introduction of a similar exchange system at European level and the guarantee that follow-up monitoring will be entrusted to European officials who must be able to oppose data extraction on US soil."
"in writing. - I supported the Agreement between the EU and the USA on the processing and transfer of financial messaging data from the EU to the USA for purposes of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program."
"Thanks to the considerable efforts of the rapporteur and the members of the LIBE Committee, the current text of the agreement contains considerable improvements on the previous version of the agreement."
"Of particular importance for the future of combating terrorism whilst protecting the fundamental rights of citizens to protection of their personal data is Article 2 pertaining to the drafting of a legal and technical framework for an EU data extraction capability."
"The Commission should carry out this task in an assiduous and timely fashion."
"The addition to the agreement of Article 2 has the potential to greatly reduce the quantity of bulk data sent for analysis beyond the EU's borders."
"Articles 15 and 16 ensure that citizens have strengthened access to redress and increased transparency."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the report on the SWIFT agreement on the transfer of bank data to the US, as I believe that the agreement negotiated with the Council and the US now includes safeguards relating to the protection of citizens' data, eliminating the possibility of transferring raw data to third countries."
"This is an important agreement in the fight against terrorism, and it will ensure that the fundamental liberties of European citizens are protected."
"in writing. - (PT) The phenomenon of terrorism and the growing impact that it has come to have on European society places essential values such as respect for individual privacy and the need to safeguard collective security under strain."
"In this context, the agreement between the European Union and the United States of America on the handling of data was previously condemned by this House, which did not consider it sufficient."
"The new version is an improvement on the last one."
"I hope that this agreement justifies the reasons for its conclusion and that the parties know how to properly interpret its provisions, so as to hinder and combat the financial activities of terrorists."
"in writing. - (PT) The progress in this process is a positive demonstration of the benefits and advantages of institutional cooperation in successfully consolidating European integration."
"After the concerns and recommendations expressed by the European Parliament, a balanced agreement was reached with the United States for the transfer and treatment of financial payment data messages, above all bearing in mind that this is a process in the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program."
"I would emphasise that safeguards have been added to protect citizens' rights, the conditions of any subsequent transfer to third-party countries and the risks of undue use of information and economic espionage."
"The possibility of correcting situations of data transmission that may subsequently be judged to have been undue has also been guaranteed."
"This agreement ensures better regulation of procedures and cooperation that is useful and healthy for institutional relations with the US."
"in writing. - (PT) It is unacceptable that four months after Parliament rejected the SWIFT agreement, Parliament and the Council have reached an agreement with the US authorities to conclude an agreement which does not guarantee security or privacy, on the pretext of combating terrorism."
"It is unfortunate that the majority in Parliament have now voted in favour of this agreement."
"There is great uncertainty surrounding exchange and access to databases, whether by the US authorities or EU agencies, which could lead to uncontrollable dangers."
"Criminals and the innocent, suspects and non-suspects alike will all be caught up in a process that does not provide any assurances, as is being shown, of its effectiveness."
"The implementation of this agreement, as we said previously, means maintaining flawed measures that are being taken as part of the so-called fight against terrorism with a view to the suppression of rights."
"We support the need to fight all forms of criminality, but this must be done above all by focusing on the origin and prevention of these phenomena and not by placing the emphasis on vague security measures that infringe civil liberties and the fundamental rights and guarantees of citizens, further weakening the democracy in which we live."
"We do not accept an exchange of liberty for more security because, in the end, we will lose both."
"We rather support a more secure society with broad democratic rights and freedoms."
"in writing. - (DE) The fight against terrorism requires international cooperation governed by agreements."
"However, these must not erode the fundamental rights of citizens laid down in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"In modern times in particular, these rights also include the protection of data, which is not adequately guaranteed by the SWIFT agreement negotiated with the United States."
"Combating terrorism must not become an excuse for inadequate data protection."
"Other serious shortcomings in this agreement include, for example, the inspection of bank data without judicial approval, the long retention period for data, something that is impermissible under German constitutional law, as well as an inadequate opportunity for people to defend themselves in court against the unfair use of data."
"These are serious infringements of fundamental rights."
"However, the European Union is not permitted to unduly curtail existing fundamental rights."
"I therefore still reject this SWIFT agreement."
"Today, after careful consideration, I voted in favour of the revised SWIFT agreement."
"The compromise is certainly not perfect, but we must combine the demands of the fight against terrorism with respect for civil liberties."
"This new version also brings improvements, in particular as regards the purpose of data transfer."
"When it comes to an issue as sensitive as the protection of personal data, I would have liked even greater rigour, particularly on the following points: granting an independent authority - not Europol - responsibility for checking the compliance of applications or the effectiveness of the right to compensation for people whose rights have been violated."
"Out of solidarity with my political group, to which we owe last February's battle, and therefore much of the progress made, I have decided to support this agreement."
"Alongside my colleagues I will be very attentive to the implementation of the conditions of this agreement by the US, but also very vigilant as regards the commitments of the Council and the Commission."
"If promises are broken, I will advocate the termination of the agreement, once it is up for review."
"It is with special attention that I have been following the negotiations between the EU and the US on the SWIFT agreement since its last rejection, thanks to the action led by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe."
"Since February, the European Parliament, firmly applying its new powers, has been able to make significant progress and obtain additional guarantees: the 'twin track' approach backed by our group, regular reviews of the agreement, an initial evaluation in six months, a progress report after three years, rights to access and to make rectifications, the possibility to block the transfer of certain data, oversight of data extraction by a European authority in the US and so on."
"It is after extensive reflection that I have decided to vote in favour of this new agreement, because a legal framework for the fight against terrorism is necessary and because we are eventually heading towards a future European system for data transfer control allowing data extraction on European soil."
"From now on, it is up to European institutions to exercise strict and vigilant control of the implementation of the conditions of the agreement."
"in writing. - (DE) The German Social Democratic (SPD) delegation in the European Parliament is in favour of combating international terrorism and providing permanent protection for personal data with the highest possible degree of determination and effectiveness."
"In view of the importance of data protection, the SPD delegation did not make its decision lightly."
"After long and careful consideration, however, we are now able to vote in favour of the agreement: the Social Democrats have succeeded in providing for the establishment of permanent European monitoring in connection with the extraction of the data directly on the ground in the US Treasury Department - including the facility to stop the extraction of data."
"For us, the top priority was limiting the transfer of bulk data."
"SEPA data are not covered by the agreement; most transfers are not affected at all."
"The five-year data retention period is intended to be reviewed annually, whereby any data that is not needed is to be deleted sooner than this."
"In addition, an annual review of compliance with all data protection standards, with the involvement of data protection supervisors, is provided for."
"Even though we would have preferred the monitoring role and the transfer of data to be given to a judicial authority, Europol must carry out its mandate for approving the data transfer, provided for in the agreement, under the strict scrutiny of the EU."
"Although Europol has a reliable data protection system, it needs to be brought into line with the Treaty of Lisbon so that it can perform its duties under full democratic scrutiny."
"I voted in favour of the Alvaro report on the Agreement between the EU and the USA on the processing and transfer of financial messaging data for the purposes of combating terrorism, because I feel that this agreement now strikes a balance between the objectives of security in the fight against terrorism and the objectives of freedom in the protection of citizens' privacy."
"Unlike the SWIFT agreement which was presented in February and which I voted against, this agreement is more protective of personal data: citizens will have the right to access and rectify data concerning them, their right to administrative and judicial appeals is guaranteed, and several limitations and restrictions have been introduced in relation to the transfer of data."
"Nevertheless, Parliament will have to remain vigilant concerning the modification of the powers of Europol, which is responsible for the control of transfers, as well as the future introduction of a European Terrorist Finance Tracking Program."
"in writing. - (SV) The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has succeeded, together with the Spanish Presidency, in negotiating improvements to the agreement on the exchange of bank data with the United States."
"The quantity of bank data that is transferred has been limited (there is to be no transfer of data for transactions within the EU) and personnel appointed by the EU shall examine and approve the transfers in real time."
"Even though a certain amount of progress has been made in the negotiations, the fundamental problem of the bulk transfer of bank data still remains."
"This means that innocent citizens' data will continue to be transferred to US authorities, which we Swedish Social Democrats find unacceptable."
"Furthermore, we see serious shortcomings, from both a legal and a practical point of view, in allowing Europol to be the authority that is to monitor the transfers."
"For these reasons, we have chosen not to vote for the agreement with the US on the transfer of bank data."
"in writing. - Given the concessions and provisions which the EU has secured regarding the SWIFT agreement on financial data sharing, I am now happy to support this agreement."
"In particular I am pleased that our Group has helped to secure guarantees on the prohibition of random searches, the direct oversight of the programme by an EU official and annual assessments of data retention periods."
"The continued monitoring of this agreement will be crucial, however, to ensure the terms remain acceptable to this Parliament and European citizens."
"I voted in favour because I think that supporting the agreement negotiated between the European Commission and the United States is the right action to take and the sign of a great sense of responsibility."
"The transfer of personal data is an extremely sensitive issue in Europe, with its painful experiences of totalitarian regimes that would churn out and distort such data."
"Under the new agreement it will be possible to transfer a certain amount of bank data to the US authorities, provided that the transfer complies with the strict rules on personal data protection, which we MEPs are committed to monitoring."
"Such information may be consulted only if it is deemed important for the purposes of conducting counterterrorism investigations: access to it is conditional upon the presentation of satisfactory evidence by the US authorities."
"The new agreement is a victory for all the European institutions, and for our European Parliament in particular."
"Indeed, our requests for increased protection of European citizens' privacy have been granted, with Europeans being offered a dual guarantee: firstly, complete transparency as regards the way in which their data are accessed and used, and, secondly, proper appeal procedures to ensure that their privacy is protected."
"These are satisfactory guarantees that will ensure that these two requirements - safety and protection of privacy - can both be satisfied and safeguarded."
"I voted against this report."
"It is tantamount to approval of United States interference in Europe with the complicity of bodies such as SWIFT."
"It supports the possibility of transferring to the United States the personal data of each and every citizen, so vast is the scope stipulated in the agreement between the Council and the United States."
"It does not call for any genuine guarantee of the protection of these data or opportunities for redress."
"This report and the agreement that it ratifies are a symbol of this Europe's enslavement by American imperialism."
"in writing. - (PT) The fight against terrorism is of concern to the EU, as it is to the entire democratic world."
"All mechanisms that help to discover possible attacks are fundamental to this fight's success."
"The SWIFT agreement is a very powerful weapon in the fight against terrorism, as it gives access to privileged financial information regarding financial transfers between countries."
"The renegotiation of this agreement with the US is an opportunity for the EU to contribute effectively to the uncovering of new terrorists and potential attacks."
"There is currently a great desire for cooperation on the part of the US, facilitating an agreement that efficiently protects transmitted data and where there is maximum possible reciprocity."
"The project for solution approved today is a good starting point for the difficult negotiations ahead with the US."
"I voted once more against the SWIFT agreement on the processing of European banking data and its transfer to the United States under the pretext of the fight against terrorism, as I believe the United States' claim to be unacceptable and to be a threat to the freedoms and rights of European citizens."
"Through this proposal, the most conservative forces have tried to hand us over bound hand and foot to US interests without giving a thought to the security or privacy of citizens."
"The European Parliament cannot allow the civil rights and freedoms of Europeans to be adversely affected under the pretext of the fight against terrorism."
"in writing. - (DE) Data protection with the SWIFT agreement is simply a sham."
"Storing up limitless data packets over so long a period of time in the absence of any judicial intervention runs counter to our understanding of a modern state founded on the rule of law."
"That it should be the European police authority Europol - which has its own interest in data for combating terror - that will monitor compliance with data protection rules and the actual existence of suspicion of terror, is putting the fox in charge of the henhouse."
"Furthermore, the idea that the Data Protection Commissioners, which have often shown themselves to be toothless, can obtain a block or a deletion in the USA is downright laughable."
"An increase in data protection is thus nowhere near being in prospect, and as a result the SWIFT agreement received a clear 'No' from me."
"I voted in favour of the Alvaro report because I consider it important to combat terrorism."
"Terrorism is a threat and as such must be combated."
"The United States is a key partner in the fight against terrorism; we need to cooperate with it in order to identify and stop any possible financing, which is what really sustains terrorists."
"in writing. - (DE) Under the guise of combating terrorism, the account data of honest European citizens are being transferred in bulk to the United States."
"The re-hashed SWIFT agreement does very little to change this situation."
"We cannot promise our citizens adequate data protection, because: - Sensitive data is stored wholesale, instead of only in individual cases where there are grounds for suspicion. - The data will be arbitrarily stored for a whole five years. - Compliance with data protection is intended to be guaranteed by Europol, even though this agency has an interest in the data itself."
"The executive is therefore monitoring itself - is this seriously supposed to be an independent control body? - EU citizens whose rights have been violated have de facto no chance of taking successful legal action."
"Citizens would first have to cope with the cost of instituting legal proceedings in the United States!"
"What was first celebrated as a success for the European Parliament in February has now become a washout."
"Even the rapporteur admits that he is not totally satisfied."
"It does not provide any real, effective data protection and should therefore be rejected."
"The final agreement satisfies the majority of Parliament's requests, protecting both the security and the private lives of EU citizens and guaranteeing legally binding solutions to the problems under examination."
"The agreement also marks a new phase in Parliament's powers, ensuring European democratic oversight of international agreements."
"In addition to the improvements within the agreement, the Council and the Commission have made a legally binding commitment to set up the legal and technical framework allowing for the extraction of data on EU soil."
"This commitment will in the mid-term ensure the termination of bulk data transfers to the US authorities."
"The establishment of a European extraction system represents a very important improvement, as the continued transfer of data in bulk is a departure from the principles underpinning EU legislation and practice."
"I voted in favour of the new SWIFT agreement at today's plenary of the European Parliament."
"This is a very important agreement which aims to stamp out terrorism and organised crime by combating illegal financing."
"It is important that this new agreement also safeguards respect for the personal data of European citizens."
"The new agreement refers to the need to create a European TFTP (Terrorist Finance Tracking Program)."
"This is a commitment which needs to be implemented within five years."
"The European Parliament, Commission and Council therefore have a duty to proceed immediately with the implementation of this commitment, so that Europe has even better tools to protect the security of its citizens in the immediate future."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour because I agree with the agreement reached and in order to fulfil my duty and responsibility of supporting the agreement negotiated between the EU and the US."
"We are aware of the need for a balance between respect for individual privacy and the need to safeguard collective security, but the phenomenon of terrorism, with which many Europeans live every day, necessitates extraordinary measures."
"I feel I should mention that, due to being involved in the internal electoral process of my national party, the Partido Social Democrata, I was unable to vote in favour of the previous agreement, as I had intended."
"I am aware of the sensitive nature of this question in Europe, the result of experiences that have left their mark on people while under totalitarian regimes which, without any legitimacy, invaded their citizens' privacy."
"This is not the case here."
"We are legitimately fighting terrorism in new, ever more innovative ways, as the only way of ensuring the protection of European citizens' fundamental freedoms."
"The present agreement enables the transfer of banking data, but introduces proper security and privacy safeguards."
"Strict rules are stipulated for personal data protection, making access to them conditional on presentation of proof that the competent authorities are carrying out an anti-terrorism investigation."
"in writing. - The adoption of the new SWIFT Agreement by a majority in Parliament is a blow for the negotiations on a binding protection of fundamental rights in international security cooperation."
"There were some improvements to the first draft, but there is still fundamental criticism of the massive data transfers without initial suspicion and the over-long data retention periods."
"The grand coalition of conservatives, social democrats and liberals has therefore accepted lower standards than the existing principles of the rule of law and is risking a regulation that is in breach of EU law."
"We Greens have therefore opposed the new agreement and, as a progressive force, aim for stronger privacy protection and the principle of the rule of law in transatlantic cooperation."
"As Parliament's rapporteur for the comprehensive data protection agreement planned by Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding, I will personally work with the US administration and the US Congress on binding rules in this field."
"It is therefore really sad to see that the European Parliament has weakened its influence on the United States by accepting the SWIFT agreement today."
"A real change towards binding fundamental rights protection in the fight against terrorism requires greater courage and effort."
"in writing. - (DE) I do not want my vote against the new agreement to be seen in any way as a 'No' to the fight against terrorism."
"Terrorist acts must be prevented and every terrorist act must be condemned in the strongest possible terms."
"On the other hand, there is the protection of citizens' rights."
"Citizens' rights are not a foregone conclusion - we have fought for them."
"I am convinced that if there had been a longer discussion phase for this agreement it would have resulted in both sides - the US and Europe - being able to achieve a fully satisfactory outcome."
"The Greek Communist Party MEPs voted against the joint motion for a resolution by the conservatives, liberals and social democrats to establish a European External Action Service, because it is based on the reactionary 'Treaty of Lisbon'."
"It implements the provisions for the militarisation of the EU (civil-military committee, crisis management centre, satellite centre, military committee, Euro-army, EULEX and so forth), in order to apply the US preventive war doctrine."
"It is a tool of the NATO strategy and wars."
"It gives the EU the right to engage in military and civil intervention on the pretext of fighting terrorism, even inside the Member States."
"The EEAS restricts the ethnocratic sovereign rights of the Member States even further, by allocating responsibilities to the EU in almost all the policy sectors of a state."
"It will be a tool for applying the precedence of Community law over the national laws of the states."
"It strengthens the imperialist intervention mechanisms and repressive mechanisms of the EU (Frontex and so on) and creates new ones (such as a European prosecution service)."
"We condemn the unacceptable, furtive procedure followed by the representatives of the European Parliament, the Commission, the Presidency and the High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission to conceal the worsening antagonism and opposition between the major imperialist powers."
"I supported the compromise negotiated by my colleagues Elmar Brok and Guy Verhofstadt with the High Representative, the Council and the European Commission, and thus the establishment of the European External Action Service."
"This compromise was the subject of extensive negotiations and it currently seems satisfactory and balanced to me."
"It allows the European Parliament to reinforce its prerogatives and preserve the Community method."
"More than anything, it was today necessary to guarantee the rapid implementation of this EEAS in order to leave room for nominations and to emerge from the unsatisfactory system that has been in place over the last months."
"in writing. - (LT) Negotiations on the establishment of a single independent EU body, as laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon, are coming to a close."
"I hope that the Council will also keep to the agreement and the decision on the European External Action Service will be adopted at the end of July."
"We must ensure that the EEAS begins its work as soon as possible and that its operation contributes to the forming of a high level European foreign and security policy, ensuring the consistency of the EU's external actions and strengthening the role of the European Union on the world stage."
"The European Parliament must strive to strengthen parliamentary scrutiny, by implementing a common foreign and security policy and actively exercising legislative, budget formation and discharge functions."
"We must ensure that the work of the EEAS is based on the principle of budget neutrality and that we avoid the duplication of the tasks, functions and resources of the EEAS with other institutions."
"Furthermore, we must resolve the issue of responsibility and accountability both for matters concerning the use of EU budget money and for the allocation of powers."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted in favour of adopting the report drafted by Mr Brok because it marks an important step towards the European External Action Service coming into operation."
"The European Parliament will play an important role in the operation of the European External Action Service as it will be consulted prior to any EU mission being launched in third countries."
"In addition, the latter's budget will be subject to political control from Parliament."
"Romania is ready to offer the services of staff with the necessary expertise to work in the European External Action Service, right from the moment when it is set up."
"My country has shown its commitment to European crisis management missions."
"We have contributed more than 200 experts, police officers, military police officers, diplomats, magistrates and soldiers to most of the European Union's civilian and military missions."
"I would like to end by emphasising that the principles of competence and geographical balance must be respected as part of the staff recruitment policy."
"With the new competences that it has acquired since the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Union needs to rely on strong diplomacy."
"The European External Action Service (EEAS) represents considerable progress in this respect."
"I voted in favour of the European Parliament's resolution on the EEAS because, in order to succeed in her mission, the High Representative urgently needs to acquire a competent diplomatic arm."
"My decision is based on the conclusions of the Madrid Conference of 21 June, where an institutional balance was found."
"The European interest of the initial draft has been retained."
"The Commission, the Council and Parliament will now be able to work together to establish an effective and operational European diplomatic service."
"I am confident that subsequent negotiations on the establishment of the EEAS will respect this balance."
"From the outset, some aspects of the creation of the European External Action Service have been unclear and controversial."
"We should examine with some concern the possible contradictions that may emerge between the activity of the future EU diplomatic service and that traditionally carried out by the Member States."
"Will the Member States no longer be free to define their own foreign policy?"
"It may not be an imminent situation that I am expressing concern about, but it is still worth asking ourselves what impact the creation of a European service such as this will have in the medium to long term."
"To put it clearly: if the idea is basically to emulate the US model, whereby foreign policy is managed directly and exclusively by the federal government over the heads of the 50 states, then it ought to be remembered that the US Government is elected by the people, and every four years its foreign policy is granted democratic legitimacy, which the European Commission, the European Council - and even the future European External Action Service - do not have."
"Therefore, by voting against the Brok report I am expressing my preference for an intergovernmental European foreign policy, since relying on the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) at European level would not guarantee the supranationality of the decisions taken in such a sensitive area."
"European taxpayers are going to have greater control over the way in which the EU's financial resources are spent by the European External Action Service."
"It is commendable that the European Parliament has received increased budgetary powers in this area at a time when the Service's budget will be subject to scrutiny by the legislature."
"The European Union currently employs approximately 7 000 diplomats and civil servants who will ensure that the EU's objectives will take precedence over national and even intergovernmental objectives."
"All employees of the European External Action Service will be politically accountable to the European Parliament, with its extended powers following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Parliament has scored a victory in that it has successfully imposed the notion that a large part of the European External Action Service's work should involve promoting human rights and safeguarding peace in the world."
"This demonstrates that the European Union is consciously assuming its extremely important role as an exporter of basic human rights which, unfortunately, have been deliberately violated at the moment in many countries in the world."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the report on the organisation and functioning of the European External Action Service."
"This is a very important step in strengthening Europe's role in the world and for coordinating the foreign relations policies of the 27 Member States."
"In negotiations with the Council and the Commission, the European Parliament saw the Union dimension of the European External Action Service strengthened, thereby leading to an increased role for Parliament itself in the political and budgetary areas of this new entity."
"I voted against the report on the European External Action Service, because it is being established using obscure procedures, with confused competences and a very clearly restricted role for the European Parliament, the only elected institution of the EU, which is limited solely to budgetary aspects."
"Furthermore, I voted against the EEAS, because it is designed to be a tool for the further militarisation of the European Union, as it also includes military action, even in cases of humanitarian assistance and intervention."
"The European Union should not link its foreign policy or policy of solidarity in the event of crisis to military action and militarised structures and mechanisms."
"It should design policies and bodies which will safeguard an autonomous and peaceful role in international relations, far removed from US military opportunism and intervention."
"It should act with respect for international law and the UN Founding Charter for a world of peace and solidarity."
"in writing. - I abstained on the vote on Amendment 80 because, while the case for national governments to scrutinise the control of EEAS must be guaranteed, this amendment also guaranteed the right of the European Parliament to do the same."
"It is not acceptable to a sovereign nation for a European organisation to scrutinise its foreign service."
"It is not the business of the EP to do so."
"in writing. - (PT) It was with enormous satisfaction that I voted in favour of the Brok report."
"Following several months of debate in Parliament, with the Council and with the Commission, white smoke has finally risen from the negotiations."
"I hope that now the European External Action Service will apply the Charter of Fundamental Rights, in compliance with the spirit and purpose of the Treaty of Lisbon, so that the Community method will be given priority in development policy and in how the EU's foreign aid is apportioned, and that the Member States, (and more precisely, certain foreign ministries of certain Member-States) take to heart the creation of this new entity, as well as the new competencies and attributes that have been given to its High Representative, as a result of the entry into effect of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I also hope that what certain Member States or those responsible in the governments of these countries see as interference in their sphere of competencies, as a nation or government, does not persist, and that the Portuguese Government fights for representation that will bestow prestige upon us for the quality, competencies, attributes and the proportional number of the national agents involved."
"As Members of this House, we do not want a service that is the result of intergovernmental checks and balances, but a service that belongs to the Union."
"A common foreign policy and a common economic policy are the necessary objectives of the European integration process."
"It should be remembered that the single currency was also chosen to speed up the integration process, which had come to a standstill in Nice."
"Given the way in which it is being organised, the European External Action Service is in danger of adopting a paralysing 'do nothing' approach, rather than being the start of a virtuous unifying process."
"in writing. - I welcome the Brok report as amended."
"It was essential to resist the proposal to subsume development policy as part of our foreign policy."
"We need an autonomous development service answerable to an autonomous Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid."
"Now, arising from this report, the Commissioner for Development is responsible for the whole cycle of programming, planning and implementation of the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) and the European Development Fund (EDF)."
"We need ensure the implementation is pursued in accordance with the spirit and letter of the agreement."
"There remain elements of the proposal that could give rise to different interpretations."
"However, the amendments introduced by the European Parliament reinforce the Commission's authority over the operational budget and, therefore, guarantee parliamentary oversight and a clear line of democratic accountability."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the report on the organisation and functioning of the European External Action Service (EEAS), as the agreement that has been reached reinforces the Community identity of the EEAS and its political and budgetary responsibility before Parliament."
"in writing. - (PT) In November 2006, Parliament adopted a resolution which recognised the strategic importance of the European languages of universal communication - English, Spanish, Portuguese and French, in order of number of speakers - as a vehicle for communication and a means to solidarity, cooperation and economic investment."
"In 2008, the European Commission acknowledged that these languages form an important bridge between people and countries in different regions of the world."
"At a time when the organisation and functioning of the EEAS is being set out, I believe that it is crucial for it to take full advantage of the communication capacity of the global European languages that I mentioned, and to adopt them as working languages."
"The rules and practice governing languages in this service will reveal the extent of its commitment to external communication."
"Having said this, I cannot but rejoice at the creation of the EEAS, and I hope that it will produce results to live up to what is hoped of it."
"The European Union has much to gain from a competent and efficient EEAS, which is capable of being the EU's voice on the world stage and actively cooperating with the diplomatic services of Member States."
"in writing. - (PT) The goal of the present decision is to establish the organisation and functioning of the European External Action Service (EEAS), a body functionally independent of the Union under the authority of the High Representative, created by Article 27(3) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), as amended by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The European Parliament also has a role to play in the Union's foreign policy, namely in terms of its political control functions (set out in Article 14(1) of the TEU), as well as its legislative and budgetary functions assigned in the Treaties."
"The High Representative must also regularly consult the European Parliament on the main aspects and fundamental decisions of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and should ensure that Parliament's positions are duly taken into account; the EEAS assists the High Representative in this task."
"They should make specific provisions in terms of the access of Members of the European Parliament to confidential information in the sphere of the CFSP."
"Having no objections to present, I voted in favour of the approval of this decision."
"We voted against this report, which is the result of negotiations between the Council and the majority in Parliament on one of the crucial points in the Treaty of Lisbon and a keystone of federalism in the European Union, which now has a legal character, as advocated in the European Constitution."
"It is noted that this service will involve more than 5 000 people in the EU embassies in various countries around the world."
"To exacerbate the situation, we notice that proposals made by our group have not been adopted, in particular those which argue that the EU's military structures should not be part of the European External Action Service, and that there should not even be any institutional link between them."
"The same thing has happened with regard to the EU intelligence structures."
"The rejection of the proposal that we presented for the Council to cease development and abolish the military and civil-military structures under its jurisdiction, as well as cease funding for military and civil-military activity, is particularly worrying."
"There is therefore much cause for concern over the future of the European Union and the route it is pursuing."
"In Laeken nine years ago, during the previous Belgian Presidency, work began on the Constitutional Treaty, which was intended to strengthen European Union foreign policy, making it cohesive and visible in the international arena."
"In spite of many complications related to reform of the EU treaties, today the Belgians have the opportunity of finalising their efforts and launching the European External Action Service - on the first anniversary of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon on 1 December 2009."
"We, as Members of a European Parliament strengthened by the Treaty, can help with this."
"After many months of negotiations of the European Parliament delegation with Mrs Ashton, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the EEAS is developing in the way advocated by Parliament."
"The report by Mr Brok and Mr Verhofstadt is an important document which summarises all this work and is worthy of support."
"What has Parliament managed to win in the negotiations with the High Representative?"
"Firstly, a European Union diplomatic service, not an inter-governmental service, and this means an assurance that 60% of posts will be appointed by the European Union."
"Secondly, political and budgetary supervision of the EEAS by Parliament, which means the ability to interview candidates for the posts of heads of delegation and to inspect the finances of the institution, as we do for the Commission and the Council."
"Thirdly, an equal distribution of posts in terms of nationality and gender, and also a review of the composition of the service in 2013 in order to correct any imbalances."
"I am pleased with the agreement reached between the three European institutions and Baroness Ashton on the establishment of the European External Action Service."
"It is a balanced service in terms of its organisation and composition, and will be created to assist Baroness Ashton in her work as High Representative of the European Union."
"Furthermore, it will have the effect of strengthening the European Parliament's political and budgetary control powers."
"I sincerely hope that best use will be made of this service in the interests of the European Union."
"The latter will thus demonstrate genuine political coherence and will speak with one voice on the international stage."
"It can only emerge greater from this, and its actions will be more legitimate and effective."
"The proposal made by Baroness Ashton is unacceptable."
"It implies the standardisation of European diplomacy under the aegis of herself and the Commission, and the negation of Member States' powers in the matter."
"This report has the slight merit of calling for all Member States to be represented among the European diplomatic staff at the beck and call of Baroness Ashton and the Commission."
"That is what we have been reduced to in this Europe - to begging for the right to remain silent, but fairly!"
"I shall vote against this text."
"in writing. - (PT) The adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon brought with it the creation of the European External Action Service (EEAS), thereby laying the foundations for a strong European diplomatic service."
"The creation of the EEAS is intended to ensure coherence in European external action and the conducting of a Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"I voted against the report on the European External Action Service (EEAS) because I believe that this body will institutionalise the militarisation of the European Union."
"I wanted to express, through my vote, my total rejection of the negotiation process relating to the creation of the EEAS, as the rapporteurs and Baroness Ashton have yielded to pressure from some Member States and have totally forgotten the democratic rules."
"The EEAS will turn into a sui generis institution operating outside the basic mechanisms of control of any democratic system."
"I believe that there is a need to ensure that the European Parliament, the only EU institution to be democratically elected, and national parliaments have not only budgetary control, but also political control over the EEAS."
"Of particular concern to my group is the substantial military orientation of the EEAS and the fact that the greater part of the civilian component of European foreign policy would come under the umbrella of European Security and Defence Policy - more specifically, everything relating to development cooperation and conflict resolution."
"It is for these reasons that the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, which is committed to the values of peace and the demilitarisation of the EU, does not support the creation of the EEAS."
"Following the difficult debates on the European External Action Service held in recent weeks within the competent parliamentary committees and the various political groups, I would like to thank our colleague Mr Brok for his strong involvement in this matter."
"Today's vote lays the foundations for a strong diplomatic service at European Union level."
"Thus the Community identity of the service will be reinforced and its political and budgetary accountability to the European Parliament will be guaranteed."
"Moreover, at least 60% of the staff of this new service will be EU officials."
"It is nevertheless regrettable that the hearings, at the European Parliament, of the special representatives for foreign affairs remain 'informal';"
"I hope that this issue will be resolved within a few years."
"In spite of everything, the European Parliament's power of review is strengthened, in particular regarding Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) missions financed from the EU budget."
"in writing. - I decided to vote in favour of the report on the European External Action Service (EEAS) and fully support the setting-up of what is a key innovation of the Lisbon Treaty and a historic decision for the future of Europe."
"Only seven months after the entry into force of the new treaty, together we managed to reach a consensus, securing the political and budgetary accountability of the new service to the European Parliament."
"This supervisory role will guarantee a truly democratic control of the service, which is of paramount importance to me."
"This report will ensure geographical balance as well as better coherence between the different aspects of the EEAS."
"It is not about duplicating diplomatic services within the EU, but about strengthening the EU's diplomatic services."
"Such an agreement is clear evidence of the European Union's commitment to gathering its force and promoting its values in a more effective way."
"It will allow the EU to exert a real influence in the international arena."
"This is a chance for the European Union but also for its Member States."
"Timely coordination of the different areas of EU external policy by the Commission is clearly important."
"The establishment of the European External Action Service under the authority of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the Commission has the potential to make the EU's external action more effective on the world stage, above all so as to avoid inconsistencies and duplication of work, and to ensure long-term consistency in the promotion of the EU's strategic interests and fundamental values abroad."
"in writing. - (PT) As a member of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, in which the European External Action Service (EEAS) was widely discussed and where I was able to express my opinions, and as a member of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), I give my support and vote in favour of the present report."
"The European Parliament presented a united position among political groups, who had as their common interest to make maximum use of the new competencies conferred by the Treaty of Lisbon, especially to this House, both in terms of political control and financial control of the EEAS."
"I am reiterating my initial and constantly repeated concern, including by means of proposals to alter the report's projects, which can be summarised as the need to ensure the geopolitical balance of the EEAS about to be inaugurated."
"I would stress the High Representative's commitment to create a team based on geographical balance, with representatives from all 27 Member States, banishing any kind of discrimination and equally promoting equality."
"in writing. - (DE) As the Committee on Legal Affairs' rapporteur for the European External Action Service, I would like to point out that, including as a result of its amendments to Article 6 of the High Representative's proposal, the report that has been agreed on today has absolutely no binding effect for me as rapporteur or for the European Parliament as a whole in the discussions on the adaptation of the Staff Regulations."
"This includes, in particular, the footnotes that were adopted in the text today."
"A report on a legislative proposal on which the European Parliament was only consulted cannot have any binding effect for the areas in which the European Parliament, by virtue of a different legal basis, has the power of codecision."
"in writing. - Parliament's approval paves the way for a more coherent and effective European foreign policy that better meets citizens' expectations."
"A better service could have been possible, though."
"We regret that Ms Ashton, the Commission and a number of national governments did not have the guts to embrace a more ambitious solution."
"We support the compromise because Parliament managed to improve Ms Ashton's original proposal considerably."
"A strong human rights structure, safeguards for development policy and against renationalisation of Community policies, strengthened democratic scrutiny, a more transparent foreign affairs budget and gender balance in recruitment are cases in point."
"The deal is not flawless, however."
"Its weak points include the unclearly defined crisis management structures, the lack of permanent deputies for Ms Ashton and the limited scope of the EEAS's consular services to citizens."
"Much will now depend on how the compromise is implemented - the ball is therefore back in the court of Ms Ashton, the Member States and the Commission."
"They must work together, create a common esprit de corps and overcome divisive competition."
"in writing. - (DE) As always, it is difficult to accommodate and balance the various different interests and positions."
"However, in the current tug-of-war, we should not and must not lose sight of the overarching goal of achieving an efficient and coherent EU external policy."
"The following factors have yet to be clarified: • Staff - who and how many? • Equality - the staff should be selected on the basis of gender equality principles. • What powers will the EEAS have? • Budgetary supervision should lie with the European Parliament. • Something that is very important for taxpayers: how high are the costs?"
"In any case, these costs should be within sensible and comprehensible limits."
"In this regard, we must utilise synergies in order to achieve maximum quality and cost savings."
"The parliamentary group of the Greek Communist Party voted against the motion for a resolution, because it seeks to consolidate the illegal secession of Kosovo imposed by the force and weapons of NATO and the coercion of the EU and other imperialist forces."
"The resolution acquits NATO of the war and the dismemberment of Serbia and supports the long-term presence of NATO troops and bases in Kosovo and the area as a whole and Euro-unifying interventions through the installation of their forces via EULEX."
"This resolution attempts to prejudice the ruling by the International Court in The Hague on the legality of the secession of Kosovo."
"The EU imperialist policy, which supports the resolution, exacerbates the problems of workers in Kosovo, exploitation, corruption, crime and the rate of capitalist restructurings, offering them immigration as the only way out."
"It exacerbates instability in the area, the oppression of the Serbs and the inhabitants of Kosovo as a whole and the problems caused by the presence of EULEX and NATO."
"Kosovo is part of a very sensitive geographical zone, on which the EU should maintain constant focus."
"I would like first of all to emphasise the deplorable lack of cohesion within the EU as to what political line to adopt with respect to this country, denounced by this resolution."
"In effect, five Member States of the European Union have yet to recognise Kosovo's independence, which was nonetheless requested in 2008."
"We therefore need, not only for the internal cohesion of the European Union, but also for its credibility in the eyes of the rest of the world, a common political stance, notably on points as basic as the issuing of visas."
"It also seems to me that the European integration process for all the countries of this region is an important element in the region's stabilisation, a stabilisation that is in the interest of our community as a whole."
"Where Kosovo is concerned, the prospect of joining the European Union is a powerful catalyst for the implementation of necessary reforms, notably the reforms pertaining to human rights, which have already been brought up and which we need to encourage."
"It is without hesitation that I support this resolution, which addresses these important issues."
"I voted against the motion for a resolution on the European prospects of Kosovo, because it considers and treats it as an independent state."
"The resolution does not respect UN Security Council Resolution 1244/99 and even calls on the five Member States of the EU, including Greece, which have not recognised the unilateral independence of Kosovo to do so; in other words, to violate the UN resolution."
"Consequently, the resolution does not help to address the problem and does not help to consolidate stability and peace in the area."
"The resolution also calls for an even stronger presence of EULEX in Kosovo."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted against this resolution."
"This resolution, the analysis of the situation and the suggested direction attest to how right anyone who opposed Kosovo's secession was."
"in writing. - (PT) Kosovo has still not received unanimous recognition by the Member States."
"The cautiousness with which some regard this new country will certainly be based on political and strategic motives, but also on reasons of a more practical nature, resulting above all from the worrying way in which corruption and organised crime are rife in that territory, preventing Kosovo from truthfully claiming that it has rule of law."
"Like other states in the Balkan region, it would be good if Kosovo presented evidence that it has embarked upon the path of no return regarding the adoption of policies and reforms which, on the one hand, back up its European choice and, on the other hand, strengthen its own political body, laying down roots for its citizens to take up democracy and reject violence, particularly ethnic violence, as a way of resolving conflicts."
"Kosovo still has a long way to go."
"in writing. - (PT) The present resolution records Kosovo's declaration of independence on 17 February 2008, which was recognised by 69 countries, and encourages Member States to work together in their joint approach to Kosovo, bearing in mind Kosovo's planned accession to the EU."
"My opinion is that, despite the very difficult legacy of the armed conflict, the prospect of joining the EU constitutes a powerful incentive for the necessary reforms in Kosovo, and I appeal for practical measures to be taken to make this prospect more tangible to its citizens, through the application of human rights and the strengthening of the rule of law."
"in writing. - (PT) The simple fact that various EU Member States have still not recognised Kosovo's independence is enough to tell us that the content of this resolution is unacceptable."
"Unfortunately, once again the majority in this Parliament is giving cover to an act that is illegal under international law."
"As considered in the amendment tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left and rejected by the majority, the resumption of dialogue and negotiations in accordance with international law is the only path likely to lead to stability and lasting peace in the region."
"Mrs Lunacek's motion for a resolution clearly shows the limited progress made by the country and I believe that the problems highlighted make its joining the EU even less plausible, as this would accentuate the heterogeneous character of the Union, to which the latest accessions are contributing."
"In a similar vein to what I have said about the integration of Albania into the EU, I believe that we find ourselves at a crossroads: Europe must choose whether to limit itself to being a body based merely on geographical criteria or if it wants to become more organic, coherent and composed of states which, in their diversity, in any case demonstrate shared characteristics which are coherent with the European ideal."
"The central fact that five Member States do not recognise the sovereignty of the country remains an obstacle which, at the moment, renders Kosovo's accession to Europe paradoxical."
"For these reasons, I cannot support Mrs Lunacek's motion for a resolution."
"in writing. - (CS) The draft resolution on the European integration process in the case of Kosovo is a document whose author clearly does not live in the real world and does not realise that Kosovo is not recognised as a member of the international community."
"The effort to replace pressure with an improvement in the internal economic situation, to enable the coexistence of the original inhabitants, in other words Serbs, Gorani, Roma and other current ethnic groups with the majority Albanians, to prevent the bullying of minority inhabitants and to take a firm approach to the clans distributing drugs throughout Europe - these are the key issues which can contribute towards improving the situation in the area and strengthening cross-border cooperation."
"It is still not possible to resume the registration of citizens, and the country is still completely dependent on foreign economic aid."
"There is a lack of political will to ensure at least fair local elections and conditions for the functioning of local authorities."
"The fight against corruption and organised crime remains a purely formal matter in this territory, and the same applies to decentralisation and civil service reform."
"It has therefore had no real impact on the situation in the country so far."
"The rampant, widespread corruption and the smuggling of weapons and drugs sow unrest in the region."
"It is strange that the currency in this territory is the euro."
"Particularly as the basic preconditions for using the common European currency have not even superficially been met."
"It is clear that the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left cannot agree to such a draft."
"I was very unpleasantly surprised to read in newspapers early on this week that an armed man fired four bullets at a Serb MP in the Kosovo Parliament."
"This attack took place four days after the explosion in Mitrovica during a Serb demonstration."
"The EU basically needs to deal with the process of establishing democracy and reinforcing stability in Kosovo."
"For this reason, the draft motion ought primarily to have reflected the realities in the province, such as the long-winded reform of the justice system and the difficulties encountered by European missions in communicating with the local authorities in Pristina."
"Regional cooperation among the Western Balkan countries is key to their economic development, but in particular to establishing mutual respect and respect for the rule of law."
"In particular, cooperation between Belgrade and Pristina, especially at a local level, is fundamentally important to citizens, above all in the worst-affected sectors such as the environment, infrastructure and trade."
"Last but not least, as regards the recognition of Kosovo's status, the message in the resolution we are debating ought to have made it clear that it does not reflect the position of all EU Member States."
"Five EU Member States, including France, have not recognised Kosovo's independence."
"Consequently, it is unacceptable to present a report today that advocates the integration of Kosovo into the EU."
"Moreover, I have too much respect for the inhabitants of that province to want them to have to apply the Copenhagen criteria in addition to suffering the consequences of the recent conflicts."
"I shall vote against this unacceptable and provocative text."
"in writing. - (PT) The regional stability and the integration into the EU of countries of the western Balkans region has always been one of the EU's priorities."
"In this difficult process there are countries in the region that have become close to the EU quicker than others, such as Serbia, the former-Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Montenegro."
"For various reasons, this process has been slower for Kosovo, and its citizens are still unable to travel to EU countries without a visa."
"We urgently need to move beyond this situation, and this effort depends entirely and exclusively on Kosovo, which will have to implement the necessary reforms for this purpose."
"I voted against this resolution on Kosovo because it encourages the five Member States that have not recognised the unilateral independence of Kosovo to do so."
"The Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left has always been against the unilateral declaration of independence by Kosovo because it represents an act that is against international law."
"By contrast, we remain committed to dialogue being resumed in a manner that is satisfactory to both parties, on the basis of United Nations Security Council resolution 1244/99, in accordance with international law, as the only possible way of achieving peace and stability in the region."
"in writing. - (ES) On behalf of the Spanish delegation within the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), we would like to state that the reasoning behind our vote on the resolution on the process relating to the European integration of Kosovo is that this resolution treats Kosovo as if it were an independent state in an entirely normal situation, without taking into account the fact that the status of this territory continues to be very controversial within the international community - an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice is also pending - and Kosovo has not been recognised by five Member States of the European Union, including Spain."
"in writing. - The European Parliament today sent a clear signal that the future of independent Kosovo lies in EU integration."
"This is a signal of encouragement for the government as well as the citizens of Kosovo."
"In addition, it is a clear request to the five EU Member States which have not yet recognised Kosovo as a state to promptly do so in order to raise the effectiveness of our support."
"A clear majority of MEPs rejected a further discussion on the question of Kosovo's status, bearing in mind that a statement from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) is due in July."
"With this resolution, Parliament is in favour of starting talks on visa liberalisation as soon as possible."
"The people of Kosovo should no longer be refused the freedom of travel which the EU will have probably granted to the other states in the region by the end of the year."
"My resolution calls for this necessary step to urgently be implemented to free the Kosovars from their regional as well as international isolation."
"The Communist Party of Greece voted against the motion for a resolution, because it is against the accession of Albania to the EU, for the reasons for which it is against the accession and continuing membership of Greece in this imperialist international union."
"Accession will be to the benefit of euro-unifying and Albanian capital, especially in energy, mining and transport, and of aggressive imperialist EU and NATO plans and to the detriment of the workers, poor farmers and small and medium-sized businesses."
"The motion for a resolution calls for the package of capitalist restructurings being imposed by the disreputable, anti-grassroots political system of the bourgeois parties in the country, in cooperation with the EU, to be stepped up and promoted."
"This anti-grassroots attack, which caused popular uprisings in the 1990s, is resulting in privatisations, massive unemployment, migration, abandonment of the countryside, increased exploitation, crime and corruption."
"It attempts an unprecedented open intervention in the internal affairs of the country and in the system of political opposition and calls for anti-democratic regulations in the operation of political parties and parliament."
"The policy of the EU and of the bourgeois powers in Albania in terms of progress towards accession is exacerbating the development problems of the country, the position of the workers, the drain of capital and migratory flows and carries huge risks in terms of security in the area."
"In voting for this draft resolution on the process of including Albania in the EU, I have chosen to back its two principle ideas."
"On one hand, I lend my support to the idea of the long-term inclusion of this country, which is justified in particular by the great effort and progress already made."
"In effect, positive steps have been taken to fight against corruption as well as to reinforce Albania's democratic framework."
"On the other hand, there is significant progress still to be made in terms of consolidating democracy or even with regard to the sustainable development of the country."
"The political crisis that followed the legislative elections of June 2009 in Albania showed all of us that this country can still fall prey to serious difficulties."
"That is why it will need all our support."
"This report demonstrates what European propaganda can produce when it wants to overlook the mistakes of the past; it is true that Mr Chountis's report highlights the problems within Albania, but at the same time it almost seems to be saying that we are obliged to accommodate the Balkan countries in the Union, as if it were written in the stars and no one could oppose it."
"I completely disagree: Albania has glaringly obvious problems today with regard to its internal political stability, and a very high level of corruption."
"Its accession would cause further problems, in addition to the ones that the Union has already had to face and must continue to face today following a major enlargement that practically doubled the number of Member States."
"There is no reason, except for the hunger for power and centralism of EU bureaucrats, to persist with Albania's accession to the EU; in view of the current situation within the Balkan republic, I cannot see what possible contribution its accession could make to the cause of European integration."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of this resolution, as it is my understanding that Albania should proceed along its path towards possible entry into the EU."
"The Union should continue its strategy of expansion in a gradual and strict manner."
"It should also function as a driving force for the implementation of important reforms in countries that are candidates or potential candidates for Union membership."
"Nevertheless, everyone knows that the road to joining the Union is a demanding one."
"The conditions governing entry to the EU are clear and well known, and not always easy to fulfil."
"In the case of Albania, there is still a long way to go, as this report makes clear."
"To begin with, it needs to comply with the Copenhagen criteria, including the process of stabilising democratic institutions."
"In this sense, I would like to underline and support the efforts of Prime Minister Sali Berisha to find an effective solution to the current political crisis and, at the same time, criticise the ignoble behaviour of the socialist opposition."
"The pace at which each country progresses along its path to entry into the European Union is, therefore, determined by the candidate, or potential candidate country."
"I hope that Albania proceeds along its way towards the Union in a determined and unhesitating manner."
"in writing. - (GA) Although I voted for this report, in my opinion the people of Albania should decide whether they wish to be part of the EU."
"in writing. - (PT) Albania is no exception to the instability in the Western Balkan region, and knows that this crisis threatens to jeopardise the reforms which have been undertaken and which were largely aimed at a growing rapprochement with the European Union."
"If you recall the days of Enver Hoxha's dictatorship, it is clear that Albania offers few guarantees that it can persevere on the path it has taken and raise its level of development and respect for the rule of law and individual freedom to acceptable levels in the light of European standards."
"An important step may have been made with the country's accession to NATO, but this is still not enough for the EU to consider Albania a strong candidate for accession."
"in writing. - (PT) Despite the resolution recognising the progress made by Albania in the reform process, it emphasises that significant additional efforts are needed to consolidate democracy and the rule of law and to ensure the country's sustainable economic development."
"I believe that the prospect of entry into the European Union will give impetus to several reforms in the Western Balkans and play a constructive role in enhancing the region's capacity for peace, stability and conflict prevention, improving good neighbourly relations and addressing economic and social needs through sustainable development."
"Each country's progress towards EU membership depends, however, on its efforts to meet the Copenhagen criteria and comply with the conditions attached to the stabilisation and association process, which I hope are successfully achieved by the country."
"It is out of friendship for the Albanians that I voted against this text."
"How can we want them to enter a European Union which pursues the interests of its financial elites to the exclusion of all else?"
"No enlargement is conceivable as long as the EU advocates competition between peoples and the defence of the interests of the privileged."
"Furthermore, post-Communist Albania has demonstrated only a limited ability to combat organised crime, which is rife in that country."
"I voted against this text."
"in writing. - (PT) Regional stability and the integration of countries in the Western Balkan region into the EU has always been a priority for the Union."
"The prospect of integration with the EU therefore leads the countries of this region to make additional efforts in implementing the reforms needed to reach the targets required for these countries to become full members of the EU."
"The efforts of these countries to enhance peace, stability and conflict prevention in the region should be emphasised, along with the strengthening of good neighbourly relations."
"Albania is at an advanced stage in the integration process, and has already responded to the Commission's questionnaire for the preparation of an opinion regarding its request to join the European Union."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this resolution on Albania because it confirms Parliament's support for Albania's European prospects, once the country has reached a level of political stability and reliability and the Copenhagen criteria are fully met."
"It notes the progress made in the reform process, stressing that further substantial efforts are needed in terms of the consolidation of democracy and the rule of law and of the sustainable development of the country."
"The resolution welcomes the adoption of the proposal on visa liberalisation and calls for the introduction of a visa waiver for Albanian citizens by the end of 2010."
"It stresses the importance of the separation of powers and the respect for an independent judiciary, calling for particular progress to be made on the issue."
"The issues of corruption and organised crime, and trafficking in human beings are among the most worrying situations in the country on which the resolution takes a stand."
"The report also deals with minority rights, the Roma, trade union rights and the social situation, women's rights and consultation of the government with civil society on the draft laws and reforms undertaken."
"It encourages the development and use of renewable energy, public transport and environmental legislation."
"in writing. - I welcome the adoption of this resolution, especially because it welcomes the progress made in respect of the judicial system, but underlines that implementation of the reforms is still at an early stage; takes the view that judicial reform, including the enforcement of court decisions, is a key prerequisite for Albania's EU membership application process, and underlines the importance of the separation of powers in a democratic society; stresses that a transparent, impartial and efficient judiciary, independent of all political or other pressure or control, is fundamental to the rule of law, and calls for the urgent adoption of a comprehensive long-term strategy in this field, including a roadmap for adopting the necessary legislation and implementing measures; calls on the opposition to be involved in the drafting process and to give full support to the reform of the judiciary; stresses, moreover, that the judiciary needs to be provided with sufficient funding to enable it to operate effectively throughout the country; looks forward, therefore, to new assistance initiatives from the Commission and welcomes, in this regard, the recent inauguration of a Serious Crimes Court in Tirana."
"in writing. - (DA) I voted in favour of the resolution, because it contains a number of correct calls for improvements in Albania."
"However, my 'yes' should under no circumstances be construed as a direct or indirect call on the Albanian people to join the EU."
"This matter is entirely up to the Albanian people themselves."
"in writing. - While I have voted in favour of this report, it is my firm view that the people of Albania should decide whether or not they wish to join the EU."
"in writing. - (LT) Both Albania and Kosovo have made progress implementing democratic reforms to strengthen the rule of law and to ensure sustainable development for the country."
"However, we must continue to strive for the objectives, particularly in the fight against corruption and organised crime, strengthening the administrative capacity of state institutions and ensuring the primacy of law."
"In Albania the political tension over the parliamentary election results that has already gone on for a year is harming the country's efforts to become an EU Member State."
"Albania's political forces must begin a constructive dialogue to reach an agreement on the results and an election law ensuring a new fully transparent election process."
"I voted for the resolutions, because they also call on EU Member States to seek new means of interacting with these Balkan countries."
"One of these measures is to promote people-to-people contacts through academic exchanges between pupils, students and scientists."
"in writing. - (DE) We would like make the following comments about the subject of visa liberalisation in this resolution."
"We should, in principle, support visa exemption for the countries of the Western Balkans."
"However, the prerequisite for this is that all the conditions laid down are fully met."
"I voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution drafted by various political groups."
"This resolution confirms the necessity of unblocking a sum greater than that already paid out to Kyrgyzstan specifically for the purpose of responding to the flash appeal launched by the United Nations, which aims to collect the USD 71 million required for emergency aid."
"In addition, I think it is necessary to provide this country not only with emergency aid, but also with the tools required to stabilise its situation and ensure there is no repetition of this type of event."
"Instruments should therefore be introduced to help re-establish security in Kyrgyzstan."
"in writing. - (PT) Despite successes at an official political level, Kyrgyzstan remains steeped in instability and conflict, and there is no sign that the situation will soon become stable."
"This country, which gained independence after the breakup of the Soviet Union, has shown that it is incapable of adopting better standards with regard to human rights and respect for individual freedom."
"I believe that the European Union can adopt a stabilising role as a mediator and, in what is effectively a post-conflict situation, it should actively contribute to the difficult task of effective peacemaking and democratisation in a country that has Russia and China for neighbours."
"This resolution expresses grave concern at the tragic, violent clashes which broke out in southern Kyrgyzstan recently and extends its condolences to the families of all the victims."
"I would stress this resolution's call for every effort to be made to secure a return to normality and to put in place all the necessary conditions so that refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) can voluntarily return to their homes in safety and dignity."
"It also calls on the Commission to step up humanitarian assistance, in cooperation with international organisations, and to start short- and medium-term reconstruction programmes to rebuild destroyed homes and replace lost assets and to carry out rehabilitation projects in conjunction with the Kyrgyz authorities and other donors in order to create conditions conducive to the return of refugees and IDPs."
"In relation to the disturbances and the clashes which took place on 11 June in southern Kyrgyzstan, and in particular in the cities of Osh and Jalal-Abad, during which around 300 people lost their lives and over 2 000 were wounded, I think the European Parliament, as a guardian of democracy, law and order and respect for human rights should react decisively to every such event, trying to prevent the processes of destabilisation such as currently are being seen in Kyrgyzstan."
"Therefore, I would like to express my solidarity and support for the nation of Kyrgyzstan by supporting this resolution and voting for its adoption."
"It is with great concern that I view the violent clashes that took place recently in the southern Kyrgyzstan cities of Osh and Jalal-Abad."
"Therefore, and given the EU's commitments to the region, in particular through its Central Asia Strategy, we must make a strong aid commitment to Kyrgyzstan."
"The gravity of the situation means that a substantial increase in the humanitarian aid provided by the EU is needed, to be allocated to all those who have been affected by these serious conflicts."
"in writing. - I welcome the adoption of this resolution mainly because it calls for a substantial increase in EU humanitarian aid to the people affected by the recent violence in southern Kyrgyzstan, as well as for comprehensive use of the Instrument for Stability, and because it stresses our belief that a new level of EU engagement in southern Kyrgyzstan will be necessary in the longer term as well; reiterates Parliament's call to the Commission to prepare proposals for a reallocation of funds under the Development Cooperation Instrument designed to put the EU in a better position to give a sustained response to the new situation in Kyrgyzstan; and maintains that a focus on human security is essential in the EU's Central Asia policy."
"in writing. - The Maltese labour delegation voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution on the EU response to HIV/AIDS, especially since it addresses fundamental issues and priorities relating to a global and tragic problem affecting - to a very large extent - the lives of many people, especially women and children in poverty-stricken regions like sub-Saharan Africa, which has 22.4 million people living with HIV/AIDS."
"Although - prima facie - it seems that there is no direct reference to the promotion of abortion in the resolution, my delegation does not support clauses which might condone abortion."
"Once again we have the regrettable situation in which arguments proposing unjust solutions to the issue of the right to life are being applied to the discussion of a real and serious problem (in this case the fight against HIV), thus making it impossible to vote in favour."
"The use of the words 'sexual and reproductive health' has now become the means by which to convince parliaments to promote abortion."
"We must not let ourselves be deceived."
"Everyone, including myself, for a start, must promote sexual and reproductive health, but when the words indicate a different and, in fact, opposite state of affairs (whereby killing a human being is understood as a woman's right to freedom), it then becomes necessary to expose the deceit."
"Abortion in the world is a real tragedy, but it is a real tragedy in our Europe too!"
"My intention in voting against the resolution is not to hinder the wide-ranging efforts to combat AIDS, but to oppose the method and the content that I mentioned."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the resolution on AIDS/HIV in view of the XVIII International Aids Conference, because efforts need to be intensified to establish a priority approach to HIV/AIDS for global public health, and to facilitate universal access to health care, education and employment for the people affected by this virus."
"It is vital to combat stigmatisation and discrimination against carriers of HIV/AIDS and to ensure that their rights are protected."
"in writing. - (PT) Political groups should reach a broad consensus on a subject like this, and they should have refrained from seeking to use it in favour of this or that agenda."
"Given the existence of a joint motion for a resolution signed only by the left-wing and the extreme left-wing parties in Parliament, it is easy to see that this objective has been sadly undermined."
"We should be concerned with the people, their illness and the suffering it causes them, and the impact of this on society, particularly in the least developed countries."
"We must work to find better solutions to combat this scourge and mitigate its effects, for the sake of these people."
"The scourge of AIDS remains a serious humanitarian problem worldwide, and it therefore requires an integrated response at global level that mobilises the states, institutions, and societies of the various regions and continents."
"The social stigmatisation that continues to prevail on this issue and the continued spread of the disease, with a high mortality rate and particularly devastating effects on the least developed countries and those with the worst humanitarian situations, must mobilise the concern and commitment of the institutions of the EU and the Member States towards making actual resources available for a comprehensive and effective response, capable of ensuring the necessary harmonisation of policies for prevention and for the adequate treatment of the disease."
"Nevertheless, I do not agree with associating the fight against HIV with a sensitive issue like abortion."
"in writing. - (PT) The resolution takes a wide-ranging approach to the problem of AIDS/HIV, supported by current data."
"It emphasises the key issues, which of course we support, including, among others, advocating universal access to health care and the need for governments to comply with this, and making a public health service available for all; the need to promote, protect and respect human rights, especially rights to sexual and reproductive health, for carriers of HIV/AIDS; drawing attention to economic, judicial, social and technical obstacles, along with punitive legislation and measures that impede an effective response to HIV; the need for fair and flexible funding for research into new preventative technologies, including vaccines and microbicides; calling for the Member States and the Commission to reverse the worrying decline in funding aimed at promoting sexual and reproductive health and related rights in developing countries."
"It is with force and conviction that I voted in favour of this resolution which requires the Member States of the European Union, on the eve of the next international AIDS conference in Vienna, to produce new laws to provide accessible and effective anti-HIV medicines, to encourage more awareness campaigns in developing countries, to increase financing for the research of new vaccines and microbicides and to fight against patient discrimination."
"More than 33 million people are living with AIDS worldwide, with very limited access to antiretroviral drugs, and I hope that these few recommendations will be followed at next week's international conference."
"Ahead of the next International AIDS Conference in Vienna in July, it seemed essential for us MEPs to send out a strong message to governments."
"Consequently, I voted for this resolution, which calls on the Commission and the Council to step up their efforts to address HIV/AIDS as a global public health priority by putting human rights at the heart of prevention, treatment and support."
"The proportion of sufferers who receive treatment is still too small today, and laws are needed to provide affordable and effective anti-HIV drugs."
"I strongly condemn the bilateral trade agreements which continue to put trade interests before health, in defiance of an agreement signed with the World Trade Organisation."
"Also, as the resolution underlines, we must combat all legislation that criminalises HIV transmission and encourages the stigmatisation of, and discrimination against, sufferers."
"Finally, the statistics on the proportion of women and young girls affected have demonstrated the failure of the current prevention policies, and in my opinion that is why it is essential to adopt an ultimately realistic approach, by increasing the funding of research into new vaccines and microbicides."
"HIV/AIDS is still one of the leading causes of death globally, accounting for 2 million deaths in 2008, and is projected to remain a significant global cause of premature mortality in the coming decades."
"The number of new infections continues to outstrip the expansion of treatment, and two thirds of the people in need of treatment in 2009 were still not receiving it, which means that 10 million people in need did not have access to the necessary effective treatment."
"I therefore argue that the EU must make every effort towards greater investment in the areas of research, treatment and education, so as to improve this situation."
"An end to the stigmatisation of, and discrimination against, carriers of HIV/AIDS must also be promoted."
"I would also argue that the EU must be especially sensitive to the problem in sub-Saharan Africa, which, with 22.4 million people living with HIV/AIDS, remains the most heavily affected region."
"I voted in favour of the joint resolution by all groups in Parliament on HIV/AIDS, as it deals with important elements of this problem, such as, for example, defending the universality of access to public health services for all citizens."
"The resolution also requires governments to fulfil their obligation to make a public health service available to all citizens."
"The resolution also protects the sexual health and reproductive rights of those who are HIV positive."
"It also highlights the need for financing that is in line with the requirements of research into new preventive measures, including vaccines."
"in writing. - (DE) Up to the present day, HIV/AIDS continues to be a worldwide plague which it has barely been possible to deal with."
"Developing countries in particular continue to have a high rate of new infections, and, as a result, a high death rate."
"However, within the European Union too, more and more newly-infected people are being registered, and the number of unreported cases might be much higher."
"The fear of knowing one has the disease and of having to live with a stigma is still very prevalent."
"In order to stop the disease, much research is being carried out, also within the EU."
"Since research in the area of HIV/Aids is essential, I voted for the resolution."
"On the eve of the next international AIDS conference, which will take place in Vienna from 18-23 July 2010, I must give my support to the resolution adopted today by sending out a strong message to national governments."
"In fact it is essential to establish new legislation to provide affordable and effective anti-HIV drugs, including antiretrovirals and other safe and effective drugs."
"I must point out that only 23% of patients affected by HIV are aware of antiretroviral treatments in Europe and Central Asia."
"For example, the Baltic States are the countries of the European Union that need to implement AIDS prevention policies most."
"Thus I appeal to the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights to gather more information on the situation of people with HIV/AIDS and to ensure that these sufferers still have the right to a full social, sexual and reproductive life."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am submitting this explanation of vote because, although I voted in favour of most of the paragraphs, I would stress that I abstained on paragraph 17."
"I only abstained because the French version - unlike the Portuguese version - indicated the possibility that sexual and reproductive health could include acceptance of abortion as a means of promoting them."
"As an advocate of the right to life, I could not in good conscience vote in favour."
"I would stress that the use of the phrase 'sexual and reproductive health' cannot be turned into a way of persuading parliaments to promote abortion."
"Nevertheless, I would reiterate my total commitment to the fight against HIV/AIDS."
"in writing. - The joint resolution was adopted as negotiated with 400 votes in favour and 166 against, despite the PPE Group requesting split votes on sexual and reproductive rights, which it does every time."
"It also shows that the PPE Group is divided on the issue."
"I am happy with the result, especially because all our considerations related to sexual and reproductive rights are in."
"HIV/AIDS infections are a global phenomenon and are nothing to do with either so-called risk groups or specific regions."
"It is not a problem, today, of drug addicts or homosexuals, but of everyone."
"At greatest risk are young people, educated people, white people and people working for large corporations."
"Almost half of those living with HIV are women."
"They are more susceptible to infection, because the virus passes much more easily from men to women than vice versa."
"The XVIII International AIDS Conference in Vienna on 18-23 July this year will stress the necessity of intensifying the information campaign addressed to women and young people."
"Women must have universal and easy access to information on health aspects of sex, reproduction and medical services."
"Also essential is the free distribution of anti-HIV drugs to women in pregnancy, to prevent transmission of the disease from mother to child."
"School education programmes on sexual and reproductive rights are crucial for HIV/AIDS prevention."
"The most visible effects of the lack of sex education in schools are the cases of HIV infection and other sexually-transmitted diseases among young people, and early, unplanned pregnancies in young women."
"The HIV/AIDS epidemic, because of its extent and lethal danger and the large percentage of cases among young people, should be sufficient reason to introduce proper sex education to schools."
"This is why I voted for adoption of the resolution on HIV/AIDS in the context of the XVIII International AIDS Conference."
"in writing. - The ECR Group is wholeheartedly in favour of human rights for all, regardless of race, gender, and sexual orientation."
"We strongly support advancing treatment, prevention, and access to healthcare for all, and promoting awareness and education in the fight against HIV and AIDS."
"However, we believe that reproductive rights, which include abortion, is a conscience issue for the individual, and that the proposals within this resolution encroach too far upon the sovereign state's right to set the agenda for its own healthcare and abortion policy."
"For these reasons the ECR Group has decided to abstain on this resolution."
"The Convention on Cluster Munitions aims to prohibit the use, production, stockpiling and transfer of this category of weapons and provides for their removal and destruction."
"I supported the joint motion for a resolution, which invites all Member States to ratify this Convention to thereby allow the Union's adherence to it."
"It is therefore essential to take the necessary measures so that the countries that have not yet ratified the Convention do so."
"Where the Member States having already signed are concerned, the entry into force is an opportunity to take the necessary measures to implement the Convention, by destroying stockpiles, eliminating remainders of weapons, providing aid to victims and so on."
"I signed and voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the entry into force of the Convention on Cluster Munitions and the role of the EU, not only because this is an issue of the highest importance, but also because Greece is, unfortunately, one of the countries which has not even signed this Convention."
"This Convention needs to be applied immediately by all states."
"Cluster munitions tend to have a high death rate and pose a serious risk to citizens, especially when used close to residential areas."
"They continue to have tragic consequences even once the conflict has ended, because use of these munitions causes multiple civilian injuries and deaths, as unexploded shells which remain in the ground are often discovered by children and other unsuspecting innocent victims."
"in writing. - (PT) All countries that still remember participating in wars know the devastating consequences of cluster munitions."
"Parliament's support for their prohibition and eradication is fully justified."
"I fear, however, that the willingness of politicians and the ratification of the Convention by several States might not be enough to readily achieve the desired results."
"Having said that, this is indisputably an important step in the right direction, and the European Union and its Member States have a duty to support it."
"Given the European Union's inalienable role in the defence of peace, security, and respect for liberty, for life and for the human rights and quality of life of peoples, I support this resolution and stress the need for a positive and rapid response to the call for all the Member States to sign and ratify the Convention on Cluster Munitions 'without delay'."
"I would highlight the fact that cluster munitions are extremely deadly and constitute a serious risk to the civilian population, including in post-conflict periods."
"Regrettably, children are the main victims of this type of explosive material."
"I advocate Europe's commitment to the fight against the proliferation of weapons that kill indiscriminately, and I hope that the Member States and institutions of the EU will take coherent and determined action in this respect toward third countries."
"Our motion for a resolution is balanced."
"It welcomes the actions of Member States which have signed and ratified the Convention on Cluster Munitions, but also recognises that some Member States, in view of their situation, will not be able to sign the Convention at this time."
"Our text calls on those countries (including, for example, Poland) to take action to comply with requirements (such as a significant reduction in the number of unexploded munitions and a smaller scatter range) which, as a result, reduce potential losses amongst civilian populations - as part of an additional protocol to the Geneva Convention on Conventional Weapons."
"This route has been chosen by Poland and other EU Member States, such as Finland, Latvia, Estonia, Romania and Slovakia, and also by the US."
"in writing. - Unfortunately, the joint resolution's recitals contain a positive reference to the European Security Strategy (ESS) and the Common Security and Defence Policy, which I and my group reject."
"But due to the very high importance of the Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM) adopted by 107 countries I and the GUE/NGL group signed the joint resolution on the entry into force of the CCM and the role of the EU, as this joint resolution must be seen as a great success in order to ban cluster munitions."
"The signing of the Convention on Cluster Munitions by 20 Member States is a good demonstration of the EU's commitment to the fight against the proliferation of weapons that kill indiscriminately."
"We cannot forget that this type of weapon is the main cause of the deaths of thousands of civilians, killing indiscriminately, particularly children and other people who are innocent and unaware of the danger."
"Unfortunately, the joint resolution contains positive references to the European Security Strategy and the Common Security and Defence Policy, which both my group and I reject."
"However, due to the great importance of the Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM) approved by 107 countries, both I and my group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, also endorse the joint resolution on the entry into force of this Convention and the role played by the European Union."
"I believe that the joint resolution may be considered an advance towards the banning of cluster bombs, and so I voted in favour."
"in writing. - (DE) Cluster munitions are one of the most insidious weapons, since they mainly kill innocent people when they are used."
"Above all, children are in danger of setting off unexploded devices by accident, and they can receive serious injuries from doing so."
"The CCM (Convention on Cluster Munitions), which has been signed by 20 Member States, prohibits the use of these weapons and requires countries which have them in their arsenal to destroy them."
"I agreed with the resolution, because the CCM is the first step in the right direction of prohibiting these deadly weapons for good."
"I voted against the resolution because I do not believe that the agreement can force countries to prohibit cluster munitions."
"in writing. - With an overwhelming majority, the European Parliament has sent a strong signal against this perfidious threat to humans in war and crisis areas."
"Thousands of people continue to be affected by cluster munitions to this day: almost exclusively civilians, and in particular many children who frequently confuse the bomblets with balls and toys."
"Thus, the European Parliament took the only possible position on this indiscriminate and inhumane weapon: a united 'no' to cluster munitions in Europe and throughout the world."
"The European Parliament demands that all Member States and candidate countries which have not yet signed or ratified the international treaty to ban cluster munitions should do so as soon as possible, preferably by the end of the year."
"We Greens were successful in our demand that the countries which have not yet been named, should be named - allowing civil society to apply pressure where it is needed most."
"Estonia, Finland, Greece, Latvia, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Turkey have yet to sign and ratify this treaty."
"Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Portugal and Sweden have signed but still have to ratify the treaty in their national parliaments."
"in writing. - The ECR Group is very much in favour of all efforts to minimise the suffering of combatants and civilians and thereby voted in favour of this resolution."
"However, we take the view that nothing must be done to impair the operational effectiveness and security of our armed forces."
"We should therefore be clear that 'cluster munitions' as defined by the Convention on Cluster Munitions do not include munitions which self destruct or self deactivate: in other words, those that will be used by the responsible armed forces of our nations."
"I personally disapprove of the language in paragraph 10 which calls on the High Representative to make every effort to 'realize the accession of the Union to the CCM'."
"One of the many unfortunate consequences of the Treaty of Lisbon is that the EU itself is now able to accede to international conventions."
"This should be the prerogative of sovereign nations, not an organisation such as the EU, although it is clear that there are those that seek, most regrettably, to turn the EU into a sovereign state."
"The common agricultural policy (CAP) is one of the European Union's most important policies, and following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the reform of the CAP, like any new legislation on agriculture, cannot be approved without Parliament's consent."
"Farmers produce goods for use by society as a whole, but they are not the only ones affected by the CAP, because there is a relationship between agriculture, the environment, biodiversity, climate change and the sustainable management of natural resources such as water and land; there is also a clear link between agriculture and the proper economic and social development of the EU's vast rural areas."
"Farmers also provide food, which we need in order to live."
"This initial resolution on the future of the CAP represents the contribution made by us MEPs to the debate on how to reform the CAP in conjunction with the introduction, in 2013, of the new multiannual budget, and on how to define the basic principles that should govern the process of creating a new common agricultural policy."
"With this vote Parliament has focused on how to address the new challenges, such as the fight against climate change, food security, food quality, the competitiveness of businesses and farmers' incomes."
"The report on the future of the CAP after 2013 promotes the euro-unifying policy to uproot poor farmers from medium-sized farms and strengthens large capitalist agricultural production."
"The CAP, 'health check' reforms and WTO decisions have had a dramatic impact on poor medium-sized farms."
"Before Greece joined the EEC/EU, it exported agricultural produce; today it spends EUR 2.5 billion importing products which it can produce."
"Twenty thousand jobs a year are lost in the agricultural sector, production is falling, agricultural income fell by 20% between 2000 and 2008 and 75% of farms have annual gross profits of between EUR 1 200 and EUR 9 600."
"The report considers the painful consequences for small and medium-sized farms to be a success."
"The aim of the report is to adapt the CAP to the strategy of monopoly capital for the agricultural economy, as expressed in the EU 2020 strategy: 'competitive farming', large corporate properties in the agricultural economy which will concentrate the land and Community subsidies at the expense of poor, medium-sized farming and rabid competition for a share of the euro-unifying and global markets."
"The Commission decision to suspend or abolish Community subsidies/aid for farming to all Member States which do not satisfy the financial discipline requirements of the Stability Pact moves in a similar direction."
"There are currently 13.6 million citizens in EU Member States employed directly in the agricultural, forestry and fisheries sectors, with an additional 5 million people working in the agri-food industry."
"They generate more than EUR 337 billion in production annually at EU level."
"Given that the EU must ensure food security for its citizens and the long-term development of the agricultural sectors, agriculture must undergo major changes to maintain productivity, at a time when it needs to adapt to more stringent environmental restrictions than are currently in place."
"The policies on reducing the farming of land in order to combat climate change will restrict the size of the areas farmed and impose additional conditions on agricultural production aimed at reducing the impact on the environment and climate."
"Furthermore, the EU's common agricultural policy will have to be adapted to a new economic and social climate at local and regional level, which will take into account the increase in energy costs."
"This report has correctly identified the key problems which the common agricultural policy will have to tackle from 2013 on, which is why I voted in favour of it."
"The Lyon report aims to ensure and improve the future of the common agricultural policy (CAP) after 2013, in keeping with the context of the economic crisis and the severe financial difficulties being faced by Member States, taxpayers, farmers and consumers."
"Therefore, the European Union will have to respond to increased demographic pressure as well as growth in demand from the internal market."
"However, as specified in this report, for which I have voted, it is not merely a matter of intensifying production."
"The challenges faced by the CAP and our farmers will essentially be to produce more foodstuffs with less land, less water and less energy."
"Several amendments have been tabled in the plenary part-session."
"I voted in particular in favour of Amendment 1, which insists on the high nutritional value of agricultural products."
"However, I voted against Amendment 2, which called for the elimination of the two-pillar structure of the CAP."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted for this report."
"The background to the reform of the common agricultural policy is one of economic crisis and serious financial difficulties facing Member States, taxpayers, farmers and consumers."
"The new CAP will have to adapt to a changing European and global context and withstand many challenges."
"European agriculture must ensure food security to its own consumers and contribute to feeding a steadily growing world population."
"This will be very complicated because the energy crisis, the rising cost of energy and the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will act as constraints to increased production."
"Moreover, the impact of climate change will close off the option of bringing large tracts of extra land into production and as a result, EU and global agriculture will have to produce more food with less land, less water and less energy."
"I feel that the foundation stone of the CAP should still be to ensure that European agriculture is competitive against well-subsidised trading partners such as the US, Japan, Switzerland or Norway, providing EU farmers with fair trade conditions."
"It must also continue to support agricultural activity across Europe, with a view to ensuring local food production and a balanced territorial development."
"in writing. - (NL) The own-initiative report by my fellow Member Mr Lyon is an important one."
"The European Commission now knows the European Parliament's position as regards this dossier and will have to take it into due account when tabling new proposals."
"As far as my party is concerned, the common agricultural policy (CAP) will continue to exist after 2013."
"Agriculture is important to our citizens."
"Food security, landscape, the environment, animal welfare, climate etc. are causes to which agriculture can contribute a great deal."
"However, a firm policy will need to be backed up by sufficient financial means."
"There are challenges that we have already mentioned and there will be new ones to contend with."
"The Union now consists of a great number of Member States."
"I endorse this report because it calls for comparable funds to be appropriated for agriculture in the post-2013 budget."
"That said, some reformulation will be necessary."
"First of all, we need simplified arrangements and less red tape."
"In addition, we will have to progress from a model where not all farmers receive aid to one where aid is based on acreage."
"A transition period where we proceed with caution will be of major importance in this respect."
"With the 2007-2013 programming period now over, the new common agricultural policy will have to rise to a very important challenge on behalf of our farmers: that of guaranteeing at least the same level of financial resources as in the past and distributing them equally between old and new Member States on the basis not only of the number of hectares, but also of other objective assessment criteria."
"I voted in favour of the Lyon report because I fully support its aim of regionalising and maintaining aid in the form of coupled payments for vulnerable agriculture territories and sectors."
"I also believe in the importance of the policy of promoting geographical indications, and in simplification, in compliance with EU standards on the part of third-country imports, and in the strengthening of the position of the various parties in the food chain."
"This report gives agricultural policy a strategic role in terms of food security and sustainable development."
"The development of green technologies in the field of agriculture has great potential for job creation and these technologies will make a decisive contribution to the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"In this report the European Parliament has set out its position on reforming and financing the common agricultural policy after 2013."
"The report also deals with the links between agricultural policy and fighting climate change."
"The report as a whole: 'We Danish Social Democrats have chosen to vote against the report on the EU's agricultural policy after 2013, as we do not believe that it properly expresses the desire for an otherwise much needed reform."
"We would have liked to have seen the EU leading the way and stopping all payments of export subsidies by 2013 at the latest - irrespective of the actions of the other WTO trade partners."
"This was not included in the report."
"In connection with the payment of subsidies, we would have liked higher requirements to be set for the environment, climate and sustainability than the unambitious requirements that are in place today."
"This was not included in the report."
"We would also have liked to have seen a significant reduction in the proportion of the EU budget being allocated to agricultural aid."
"This was not included in the report either."
"In light of this, we Danish Social Democrats are unable to support the final report on the EU's agricultural aid after 2013.'"
"Amendment 3: 'We Danish Social Democrats believe that EU subsidies should be removed from European agricultural policy."
"Free and fair trade should be the guiding principle for an agricultural area based on sustainability."
"We voted against this amendment, as we believe that the amendment itself is contradictory, as it calls for EU aid to be provided without distorting free and fair trade."
"However, the distortion of free and fair trade is precisely what the EU's subsidy schemes are doing today.'"
"in writing. - (RO) I gave a decisive 'yes' to maintaining an equal distribution of payments within the common agricultural policy from 2013 onwards for farmers from both new and old Member States, which would help eliminate an injustice for Member States which have recently joined, including Romania."
"We are at a crossroads in the definition of what the future reform of the common agricultural policy must be."
"This is an issue that concerns Europeans, naturally, but also the citizens of the world."
"That is why this reform should not be the business of experts, but rather of farmers and consumers."
"We have to rethink the general objectives of a new common agricultural policy."
"Europeans have new expectations in terms of food production and supply."
"They want an agriculture that respects the environment, that meets high standards with regard to quality, traceability, food product safety and carbon footprint."
"This new policy should also be part of a global vision, with one major challenge: to be able to respond to the doubling of demand for food production and supply that will take place between now and 2050, in a context characterised by water scarcity, reduction of arable land and by a new energy agreement dictated by the fight against climate change."
"The global organisation of agricultural markets needs to be rethought, taking into account the two main inspirations of a common agricultural policy: guaranteeing food safety and saving the lifeblood of small farmers and their families, both at home and in the world's poorest countries."
"in writing. - I voted for this report but must stress my continued support depends on the Commission now taking account and securing a number of objectives:"
"1."
"We must have a CAP budget which is capable of providing our farmers with a viable and secure income, and consumers with food security."
"2."
"We must maintain Pillar 1 payments, rewarding farmers for work, securing the industry with direct payments."
"3."
"We must define what we mean by a fair distribution of CAP and look at production costs."
"An area based payment which rewards Northern Ireland less than current levels will destroy an industry already on the edge of viability."
"Regional variation is vital."
"4."
"We must maintain market control measures which control price volatility and ensure profitability."
"in writing. - (LT) The European Parliament resolution on the common agricultural policy is an ambitious and targeted reform."
"It has my vote and that of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe."
"The most important thing is that it acknowledges the injustice done to farmers of the new Member States."
"This resolution calls for us to meet the expectations of the 12 new EU Member States that joined after 2004 and to treat them fairly when distributing European Union money."
"As the European Parliament's powers in this matter have increased since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, I hope that the Council does not revert to unequal direct payments for farmers of the old and new Member States and will not approve any additional general funding, which might damage fair competition in the single EU market."
"The new CAP should ensure that farmers are provided with efficient and targeted support, which should benefit the wider society, especially consumers."
"It draws attention to food security and the supply of high quality products at a reasonable price."
"As a liberal I can only justify the current CAP budget if the new common agricultural policy is one creating added value instead of distorting the market, if it makes the EU more competitive in respect of its trade partners, creates jobs and fosters balanced development of agriculture and the countryside, conserving the environment and landscape."
"The reforms proposed by the European Parliament are a positive step which I and the family of European liberals welcome and look forward to seeing."
"I voted in favour of the report on the future of the CAP post-2013 because it is necessary to strengthen CAP policies and ensure an adequate budget in order to respond to the challenges that European agriculture is facing, such as climate change, food security and quality and the competitiveness of the sector."
"I voted against Amendment 69 of this proposal because it brings the global construction of the common agricultural policy (CAP) under threat and endangers the interests of Portuguese agriculture, as it proposes cancelling funding for structural measures without guaranteeing that these will be replaced using the changes to the first pillar."
"Furthermore, such a proposal involves procedural difficulties in the future distribution of Union funds to farmers, while the current system, as it is, needs to be simplified, not made more complicated."
"I would also stress the fact that the Portuguese state has been wasting hundreds of millions of euros in first pillar funds."
"With the abolition of the second pillar and the transfer of some of the measures of the second to the first, many measures that are currently supported will cease to be so, particularly because of the obvious budgetary impossibility, and the result will be a weakening of the CAP."
"In truth, we cannot understand what benefit the possible transfer of CAP funds to other policies could bring."
"Instead, we are advocating measures to secure the only truly common policy that exists in the EU."
"in writing. - (PT) The CAP has increased productivity, ensured security of supply and provided consumers with quality food at reasonable prices."
"The new CAP will have to face new and urgent challenges, and should provide a framework for the future based on stability, predictability and flexibility in a time of crisis."
"CAP reform should be reviewed in the context of the economic crisis and combating climate change, and maintaining its competitiveness in a global context."
"It is expected that the agricultural sector will be able to make an important contribution to achieving the priorities of the new Europe 2020 strategy in terms of combating climate change, innovation and creation of new jobs through green growth, and continuing to ensure security of food supplies for European consumers by producing safe and high quality food."
"However, I believe that the CAP should make its priority the production of the so-called first generation of public goods, and its guiding principle food sovereignty, so that Member States can be self-sufficient."
"I would also advocate market regulation in the dairy sector, from production to marketing."
"In this context, I believe that maintaining milk quotas is vital."
"in writing. - (PT) Among other aspects, the profound changes which need to be made to the common agricultural policy (CAP) should include establishing the principle of the right to food and food sovereignty; prioritising food self-sufficiency and the ability of countries and regions to develop production to meet their national or regional food needs; and supporting activities which promote local production and respect the local environment, protect water and soil, increase the production of GMO-free food and promote the biodiversity of seeds for farmers and the diversity of species for domestic cattle."
"This was the thrust of one of the various amendments that we have tabled to the report under discussion."
"The rejection of this amendment and the principles that it contains by the main political groups in Parliament merely highlights the route that they intend to follow."
"This route is also noted in the report."
"Despite advocating some important aspects, such as the rejection of renationalisation of the CAP, the rejection of a reduction in the overall budget and arguing for fairer redistribution of aid between countries and producers, the report maintains the view that was predominant in earlier reforms of the CAP - the total liberalisation of agricultural markets and the subjection of the CAP to the interests of EU negotiations in the WTO."
"We consider such a view unacceptable."
"in writing. - (DA) The three members of the Danish Liberal Party today voted in favour of the report on the EU's agricultural policy after 2013."
"The report focuses on modernising agriculture and making it more efficient, ensuring that improvements are made in relation to the environment and animal welfare, the contribution of agriculture to energy and climate policy as well as simpler rules for the agricultural sector."
"There are a few statements regarding the EU's agricultural budget that we do not agree with, and the Danish Liberal Party will continue to work to bring about a gradual phasing out of the EU's agricultural aid."
"In general, however, the report represents the consolidation and further development of the reforms of the EU's agricultural policy that have been carried out over the last few years."
"in writing. - (DE) The new common agricultural policy (CAP) is intended to enter into force for European agriculture from 2014."
"The Lyon report represents the prelude to the intensive negotiations over the next three years on the CAP after 2013."
"For the first time in the EU agricultural reform, the European Parliament has full power of codecision and will act as an important negotiator among the Member States, the Council and the European Commission."
"With the first proposals in the Lyon report, the European Parliament sets a very clear direction: a clear commitment to the common agricultural policy with its two pillars, the direct payments and rural development, which also deserve to be safeguarded in the agricultural model after 2013."
"Only the CAP, the funding for which in the next financial planning period will be maintained at at least the level of the 2013 budget, can guarantee a multifunctional agriculture throughout Europe and, with it, the supply of good quality food."
"An appropriate model needs to be found for my country, Austria, in particular - one that safeguards the small structures and provides a viable balance for mountainous areas."
"In addition to food production, agriculture also makes a significant contribution to preserving the cultural landscape."
"I support the Lyon report, as my amendment for safeguarding agriculture throughout the EU and the mountainous areas has been incorporated and will provide a stable perspective for the future for young farmers."
"I believe that European agriculture needs a common policy that will remain as such to prevent inevitable disparities between Member States and to guarantee that the common agricultural policy (CAP) is financed entirely, and fairly, by the European budget."
"I therefore voted against the renationalisation of the CAP, since the new policy will require sufficient funding if it is to be supported better in the light of the major challenges that this sector, which is crucial to the EU's food security, will have to face in the coming years."
"Indeed, food security is a consumer right that must be safeguarded in the same way as the guarantee of 'second-generation' public goods such as the environment, regional development and animal welfare."
"While I welcome this report, which is concerned about the future of farming, I do not share the view that the common agricultural policy has succeeded in achieving the objectives of ensuring a fair standard of living, stabilising markets, producing high-quality food at reasonable prices, developing economic activity in rural areas and guaranteeing our food security and food sovereignty."
"The reality is quite different."
"One need only look at the state of a great farming nation like France, which has recorded a 34% income reduction in its accounts."
"As in the past, the CAP after 2013 will be unable to protect our farmers from speculators and savage global competition, or to compensate for the excesses of the multinationals of the food processing industry and large-scale distributors."
"The CAP after 2013 will remain wedged between the ultraliberal and internationalist market logic of the European Commission and a future 'green' CAP, in reality serving the neo-capitalists of ecological business."
"This is a logic that sacrifices our rurality, but not for the good of poor countries or less-favoured or desertified areas in Europe, and which justifies renationalising the CAP as soon as possible."
"in writing. - (RO) Agriculture is and will remain a strategic sector for the European Union economy, which will need to face up to the future challenges and guarantee independence and food security for Europeans through its common policy."
"I voted in favour of this particularly important report because I believe that in the forthcoming programming period the common agricultural policy will require support from a consolidated, well-structured budget, commensurate with the challenges which lie ahead of us."
"I think that we must establish close links between rural development policy and regional policy in order to ensure a degree of consistency with interventions of the same kind carried out in a particular region, thereby fostering territorial cohesion within the European Union as well."
"I also believe that it is essential to consider regions' territorial features and priorities."
"We must promote common norms and objectives, taking into account the specific nature of each region."
"This will enable us to achieve dynamic, multifunctional and sustainable agriculture in Europe."
"I voted for the report on the common agricultural policy after 2013 because I feel that the European Parliament, endowed with new powers since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, is clearly demonstrating through this excellent report that it is assuming its new responsibilities."
"Parliament is in favour of maintaining a common agricultural policy worthy of the name, including after 2013, with a budget that is at least equal to the current budget, in order to ensure high-quality production and security of supply in the 27 Member States."
"I am delighted that my amendments along these lines have found their place in this text."
"My call for us to maintain certain market measures acting as a safety net for farmers and the prices of their products has also largely been supported."
"We must be able to prevent overproduction crises, among others, in order to safeguard farming activity in all European regions."
"It is also advisable to retain specific tools to manage the production potential that some sectors have."
"I voted in favour of the Lyon report on the future of the CAP, and in particular for retaining the two pillars."
"Today's vote in plenary on the Lyon report is very important and symbolic, since the MEPs are the first to take up a position and present their proposal for the CAP after 2013."
"I have every confidence in Commissioner Cioloş to take account of the results of this vote in the proposals that will be presented by the European Commission in November."
"The main priorities of European agriculture, such as food security, market regulation and spatial planning, are clearly reaffirmed, as are the consequences in budgetary terms, which must be in line with the ambitions of the CAP."
"The biodiversity support measures must not be forgotten."
"Biodiversity must be at the heart of the CAP provisions, since its protection is no longer a luxury where the conservation of species and habitats is concerned."
"The 2009 crisis showed the weaknesses of the system of measures to support agriculture."
"Its effects were felt in farmers' income, which suffered a 12% reduction on an income which is already around 50% lower than the European Union average."
"The strategic plan for the post-2013 period must be proportionate to the importance of the sector, which employs around 30 million workers."
"It must include the strengthening of the common agricultural policy, an appropriate fiscal policy and maintenance of its budget, in consideration of the many beneficial effects of agriculture on the environment, health and climate change."
"It is important to guarantee reasonable consumer prices and a fair income for farmers by using targeted aid."
"Agriculture must have a greater role in the EU 2020 strategy, and plans must be set out for intelligent, sustainable and inclusive growth."
"Market instability grows with increasing measures to guarantee the safety and sustainability of products because this situation places European producers at a competitive disadvantage in relation to imports."
"It will be difficult to ensure reasonable consumer prices and fair remuneration unless stricter rules to guarantee respect for the principle of European preference are introduced."
"in writing. - The European Parliament has increased powers under the Lisbon Treaty, specifically in the area of agriculture policy."
"With extra powers come responsibility, and the endorsement of the Lyon report on the future of the common agricultural policy (CAP) post 2013 shows the Parliament taking its responsibility seriously."
"We recognise that the CAP must be maintained, that there must be an adequate budget and that food production is part of the bundle of 'public goods' which farmers provide and must be rewarded for."
"We voted to hold on to the two-pillar structure."
"Market support measures are recognised as being an important part of the CAP."
"We have rejected any attempts to renationalise the policy."
"The report calls for a move away from the historical payment system by 2020, calling for an area basis plus objective criteria to replace the current regime."
"The Commission must come forward with ideas in this regard - but caution is required."
"The Lyon report allows for national flexibility in aligning the CAP to meet local, regional and national needs, including the need for the option to re-couple for specific reasons."
"Our first priority is to safeguard the budget - when this is achieved we can begin to really debate the detail."
"This text has the merit of recognising market failures and advocating the fight against climate change."
"There its merit ends."
"Despite the failures recognised, the text promotes the liberalisation of the markets, farmers' responsiveness to market signals, the competitiveness of European agriculture on global and regional markets, and green capitalism."
"This framework is of no more help in combating climate change than the carbon market, biofuels and GMOs on which this text prides itself."
"On the contrary it supports productivism and the devastation of local crop farming here and throughout the world."
"I voted against Amendment 69 of this proposal because it brings the global construction of the common agricultural policy (CAP) under threat and endangers the interests of Portuguese agriculture, as it proposes cancelling funding for structural measures without guaranteeing that these will be replaced using the changes to the first pillar."
"Furthermore, such a proposal involves procedural difficulties in the future distribution of Union funds to farmers, while the current system, as it is, needs to be simplified, not made more complicated."
"I would also stress the fact that the Portuguese State has been wasting hundreds of millions of euros in first pillar funds."
"With the abolition of the second pillar and the transfer of some of the measures of the second to the first, many measures that are currently supported will cease to be so, particularly because of the obvious budgetary impossibility, and the result will be a weakening of the CAP."
"In truth, we cannot understand what benefit the possible transfer of CAP funds to other policies could bring."
"Instead, we are advocating measures to secure the only truly common policy that exists in the EU."
"The current common agricultural policy (CAP) provides assistance to a delocalised and speculative industrial system of production, which benefits large agricultural operations and not small producers."
"The decoupling of assistance favours large landowners, and threatens small operations and family-run farms."
"Despite the failure of the Lisbon Strategy, the EU has not changed its economic policy."
"It is not committed to food security, but to competitiveness, which only favours large multinationals."
"I believe that the agricultural sector needs to be considered as strategic within the European Union."
"I therefore believe that fundamental reform of the CAP is needed, in order to guarantee access for small producers to assistance, land, seeds and water, and thus to support a social, productive and sustainable agricultural model."
"in writing. - (DE) The last few decades have been marked by a massive decline in farming throughout the EU."
"The common agricultural policy has been reformed innumerable times, and each time the agricultural assistance rules have become more complicated and the bureaucratic expenditure higher."
"It is also problematic, in connection with this, that the EU prescribes high standards in quality and in animal and environmental protection, but then allows imports from countries in which these rules do not apply and in which production is naturally considerably cheaper."
"In order to sustain food security and self-sufficiency within the EU, at least in part, it is essential that small farming structures and farming in remote regions can be sustained."
"A simplification of the CAP only makes sense if it is not accompanied by a restructuring which forces yet more farmers into sideline farming, or even closure of the farm, and hastens the death of farming."
"The simplifications provided for in the report will certainly make farmers' lives easier, and I therefore endorsed it."
"I support the structure and approach of the Lyon report."
"This own-initiative report represents an important foundation for the definition of the guidelines that the European Parliament intends to follow in respect of future agricultural policy, pending the publication of the Commission communication at the end of the year."
"For the first time, then, Parliament is indicating, with one voice, the means by which to launch a constructive dialogue on the content and priorities to be assigned to ensure competitive agri-food production and the sustainable development of rural areas."
"There are many challenges facing European agriculture and they have a significant impact on the economies of many Member States."
"However, they are also the subject of debate with regard to the budget to be allocated to the European Union, since the aim is to turn these very challenges into an opportunity for the agricultural sector to grow and for many European farmers to develop."
"I welcome the adoption of the Lyon report by the European Parliament, which is a result of the excellent work of its rapporteur, aided by the shadow rapporteurs and the contributions of all the Members who submitted amendments, took part in the debate and committed to consensus building."
"This report is a true reflection of the consensus possible between Members from all 27 Member States and various political families, which is particularly significant in itself, and even more so in the context of Parliament's new co-decision powers."
"The report, which is the final result of several rounds of negotiations, adopts positions that will structure the future common agricultural policy (CAP) and that we consider fundamental: not reducing the budget, not renationalising the CAP, keeping the two pillars of the CAP, implementing a new system for apportioning grants, distinguishing between first- and second-generation public goods, not making it impossible for the Council to revoke the decision to abolish the milk quotas, the need for a safety net, increasing the transparency of the food chain, and the need to simplify the CAP."
"It is now important to monitor the internal work of the European Commission until the final communication is published in November."
"I voted for this report, but I am giving this explanation of vote to stress that, in paragraph 44 on the management of the market, I voted against the first part of the paragraph proposed by the rapporteur and for the second part of it, which finally sets Parliament's decision out as favourable to Portugal's strategic interests."
"In fact, the version proposed by the rapporteur created the possibility of abolishing the milk quotas, albeit if its interpretation is stretched."
"I am aware of and support the position of the Portuguese agricultural sector, which has been reiterating its conviction that ending the system of milk quotas could be severely detrimental to Portuguese producers."
"In fact, 93% of the milk produced in the EU is sold on the European market and it represents a significant proportion of the income of EU dairy companies."
"The milk quotas will allow the maintenance and sustained growth of milk production in the 27 Member States; this will contribute to adapting supply to demand (European and international) in the dairy sector and allow prices to stabilise, making sustainable incomes possible."
"Abolishing this system without an alternative proposal will lead to production being abandoned in countries where it is less competitive; Portugal falls into this category."
"in writing. - The Greens/EFA have been able to include an important number of amendments which focused on environmental and social conditioning of direct payments, measures against climate change, a broader and more inclusive approach to rural territorial development and fair income for farmers."
"We also have been able to introduce a clear distinction between different levels of competition in farming and marketing of food products and supported a clear statement to replace the current basis of historical yields and income by payments to farmers by an inclusion of the principle of 'public goods' in direct payment calculations."
"Thus, the adoption of this report is highly satisfactory."
"in writing. - (CS) I have supported this report because I believe that the European Union's common agricultural policy must remain a common agricultural policy and that there should be no future renationalisation in this area."
"It must be an important objective of the common agricultural policy to have equal conditions for farmers in the European Union, especially as far as direct payments are concerned."
"in writing. - Yet again the European Parliament has abdicated its responsibilities by failing to reform the CAP."
"I believe this report should be renamed the 'increase in subsidies to inefficient farmers' report."
"Why should taxpayers' money be used to stabilise markets, to keep prices artificially high and to prop up agriculture at difficult economic times when farmers already receive other subsidies from the taxpayer?"
"I, on behalf of the EPLP, do not believe that this report goes anywhere near far enough in pushing for ambitious change."
"It penalises the efficient farmer and props up the inefficient one."
"It penalises developing countries by calling for a delay in phasing out export refunds in the worst kind of blatant protectionism."
"It fails to address the major problem of rural sustainability by sticking rigidly to a direct payment system which acts like a brake on the promotion of diversity and the protection of the countryside."
"We will be voting against this cop-out of a report in the hope that one day efficient farming will be rewarded, countryside stewardship will be recognised as important, consumers will not be ripped off by artificially high prices and the developing world will get a fair deal."
"That is what CAP reform should be about."
"in writing. - (PT) I supported this report as it has strategic relevance for countries like Portugal and the outermost European regions, and Parliament has made a massive effort to vote for it in this first year of its term."
"The common agricultural policy is a key part of the EU's financial and budgetary framework for the post-2013 period, and it deserves detailed analysis."
"Domestic agricultural production, which can greatly contribute to food security and trade with third countries, and reducing the trade deficits of Member States, is a key aspect of this policy."
"European farmers ensure high levels of safety and quality in food production, respecting stringent clauses regarding environmental and animal protection, and they should be rewarded, not undermined, for doing this."
"In order for this to happen, conditions must be imposed on third countries with which the European Union has trade agreements, and these must be similar to the standards imposed on producers in the European internal market."
"It seems to me that there is still a need for an agricultural budget that allocates its funds fairly and gives especial attention to regions like Madeira and the Azores, which face permanent constraints due to their remoteness and insularity, small area, adverse climate and geographical situation, and they should receive permanent support for this reason."
"A good agricultural policy is one which is based on what the consumer needs, and not on what the producer wants."
"Only 5% of EU inhabitants, including in Slovakia, are employed in agriculture, but we are all - 100% of us - consumers of agricultural products."
"What the consumer cares about is quality and price."
"This applies not only to cars and televisions, but also to bread, vegetables, meat and milk."
"However, the common agricultural policy turns the whole issue completely on its head, because it is based on what farmers need."
"The submitted report, in the spirit of the former approach of the EU, pays too much attention to effects and ignores causes."
"One example will suffice: the report wants, through incentives and subsidies, to boost the low level of interest shown by young people in agricultural work and country life."
"However, a functioning market and a competitive environment would solve this problem in a natural way."
"Perhaps the only at least partially positive aspect of the report is the demand for fairness, which is particularly important for Slovakia and the new Member States."
"If the EU decides to continue even after 2013 with the former costly and ineffective policy of support for farmers, it should apply equal rules for everyone."
"The fisheries sector represents a strategic resource within the EU where supplying the population is concerned, and it makes a significant contribution to local development, employment and the preservation of the cultural traditions of coastal communities."
"Unfortunately in recent years we have seen production gradually scaled down, not least because of certain EU provisions to safeguard the marine ecosystem, such as the Mediterranean regulation, which is intended to promote more sustainable fishing, but which has actually brought an entire sector to its knees."
"Our fishermen are being forced to fish less, but demand is increasing and therefore so too are third-country imports."
"If unfair competition is to be prevented and consumers safeguarded, imported products must comply with the same rules as EU products."
"In fact, imported products are often cheaper, but they are also of inferior quality and their safety cannot be guaranteed."
"Therefore it is important to strengthen fair, transparent and sustainable trade in the sector, including as regards the need to introduce stringent certification and labelling criteria in relation to the quality and traceability of fishery and aquaculture products."
"This own-initiative report, which focuses on the arrangements for importing fishery and aquaculture products into the EU, aims to protect the retention within the European Union of fishing and aquaculture sectors that are environmentally responsible over the long term and economically viable."
"In essence, we are witnessing an increase in the importation of products originating from fishing and aquaculture at the expense of our community production."
"Now, like the rapporteur, it seems critical to me to restore our communal production."
"Nonetheless, we realise, with our rapporteur in mind, that this must be carried out in keeping with sustainable management; for example, the quantity of fish caught must be limited for the purpose of managing our natural resources."
"Furthermore, it seems necessary to promote responsible consumption, in which quality and viability of production would take precedence."
"in writing. - (NL) The report by my fellow Member Mr Cadec comes at a good time."
"It comes after the consultations on the Green Paper on the reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP) and well ahead of the new European Commission proposals for legislation."
"Imports of fishery and aquaculture products have increased enormously, but that increase has been necessary."
"The consumption of fish is still on the increase in Europe and that increased demand cannot be sufficiently met either by increasing even further the amount of wild fish landed or by European fish farming."
"However, it is of great importance that these imports should have to comply with the same requirements as European fishery products and we cannot confine that equivalence of requirements to food security alone."
"In my opinion, the environmental and social circumstances must also be taken into account."
"Imports are necessary."
"I am not in favour of protectionism by stealth, but we do need to prevent unfair competition."
"Large amounts of cheap imported fish are now posing a threat to European production, to both fisheries and fish farming."
"For that reason, I will be voting in favour of this own-initiative report."
"I voted in favour of the report by Mr Cadec."
"At such a historic time as this, I think that the issue of the arrangements for importing fishery and aquaculture products, or rather the problem of defining the conditions under which products from outside the EU are placed on the single market, is crucial."
"Given that 60% of internal demand is now met by exports and that it is expected to increase significantly by 2030, Europe must provide answers to the questions and legitimate concerns of those operating in the sector."
"I therefore share the view of Mr Cadec: investigation and monitoring is required so that the development of EU policy in this area does not result in differences in treatment between producers from the Member States and those from third countries."
"This report is about the importing of fisheries and aquaculture products by the EU and the conditions under which it should take place."
"Imported products must satisfy the same quality criteria as those produced in the EU."
"The report calls for the creation of an ecolabel for fisheries products."
"This would mean that consumers had information about the origin of the products and the sanitary, social and environmental conditions under which they were fished."
"in writing. - (RO) Bearing in mind the strategic importance of the fisheries sector both for supplying the population and for the food balance of the various Member States and the EU as a whole, I believe that, in a similar way to the agricultural sector, the fisheries sector is a strategically important sector depending on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of natural resources."
"As agriculture, fishing and aquaculture do not lend themselves to a pure free-trader approach, the EU's production is failing to meet European demand, given that currently 60% is covered by imported products."
"Nevertheless, we have to make sure that future EU importation schemes make it possible to strike the right balance so that European production, already in a state of crisis, does not suffer unfair competition from third countries."
"In the negotiations of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), fishery products should be considered 'sensitive products' in the same way as certain agricultural products, which would make it easier to maintain tariffs on imports originating from third countries."
"In this way, European fishermen would be protected by a reasonable and flexible tariff as well as by an ecolabel."
"At the same time, developing countries need to be able to develop their own fishing."
"For this to happen, we need to question the relevance of international agreements allowing the purchase of fishing licences in developing countries and allowing the fleets of third countries to carry out industrial fishing along their coasts, depriving them of an immense part of their natural resources."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the report on the arrangements for importing fishery and aquaculture products into the EU in view of the future reform of the common fisheries policy (CFP), as I believe that issues relating to the import of fishery and aquaculture products to the EU should be given particular attention in the light of these ongoing reforms of the CFP."
"in writing. - (PT) Having voted on Mr Milana's report on a new impetus for the sustainable development strategy for European aquaculture in the previous session, we are now called on to vote on another regarding the arrangements for the import of fishery and aquaculture products."
"According to the report, Europe currently imports 60% of the fish it consumes."
"In addition to this, consumption is expected to rise between now and 2030, and this rise will almost entirely be covered by an increase in imports."
"Without looking to European production to meet our demand (something that would be impossible both now and in the future), the truth is that the future reform of the common fisheries policy (CFP) cannot neglect to consider the issue of imports and seek a better solution, whether by increasing European production (not only by increasing the size of catches, but also by investment in aquaculture), whether by requiring that the imported fish complies with the same standards as that caught or produced in the EU, or whether by giving the consumer sufficient information about the origin of the fish."
"As the rapporteur argues, this is an issue which will deserve serious consideration in the reform of the CFP."
"in writing. - (PT) The EU market, which amounted to approximately 12 million tonnes and EUR 55 billion in 2007, is the world's largest market for fishery and aquaculture products, ahead of Japan and the United States."
"Having grown rapidly since 2005, this market is increasingly dependent on imports. In fact, its level of self-sufficiency is now less that 40% - in other words, the rate of dependence on imports is more than 60%."
"Consumption forecasts indicate that demand could rise by approximately 1.5 million tonnes by 2030, and that this increase will have to be met almost entirely by additional imports."
"I advocate a proposal for a regulation that would consolidate all the Community provisions on aquaculture in a single document, just as I did in the June plenary part-session."
"In this context, and given that Portugal is the largest consumer of fish per capita in Europe, I believe that aquaculture is a strategic priority for the EU."
"For this reason I am particularly glad that a sustainable aquaculture policy has been advocated, so as to reduce dependence on imports in the fishery and aquaculture products sector."
"in writing. - (PT) The work on the collection and systematisation of data that was made possible by this report must be valued, as it is helping us to build a current picture of a situation that is, in many respects, troubling, as this report rightly acknowledges."
"The existence of EU countries with sustainable fisheries and aquaculture sectors is, from an economic, environmental and social standpoint, incompatible with the trade policy which is being conducted by the EU."
"Deregulating and liberalising international trade and directing it towards competitive rather than complementarity logic (which should guide it), means promoting the interests of importers and distributors, but at the same time condemning thousands of producers to ruination and forcing them to abandon their livelihoods, increasing food deficits and jeopardising the basic criteria for food and environmental security and quality."
"The fisheries and aquaculture sectors (like agriculture) are vitally important strategic sectors which are not compatible with a mercantile approach, whereupon there needs to be a trade regulation, which includes the possible use of trade defence instruments, as suggested in the report."
"We would also like to highlight the case for urgent reform of the common organisation of the market for fishery products, which we also support."
"in writing. - (SV) I have today voted against the own-initiative report on arrangements for importing fishery and aquaculture products into the EU."
"I fully support the need to change and revitalise the EU's fisheries and aquaculture sector."
"However, the report assumes that the problems can, to a certain extent, be solved by providing protection against competition from the outside world."
"European fisheries cannot survive in the long term with protectionism and subsidies."
"The problems in the EU fisheries and aquaculture sector should be solved in the context of the forthcoming review of the common fisheries policy."
"It is time to make up for the underestimates and delays of the past."
"Fishing is a key sector in our economic and social system and as such it must be respected."
"Looking ahead to the common fisheries policy reform, we have a duty to take determined action to guarantee incomes, the stability of markets, and better marketing of products, including aquaculture products."
"In addition, greater attention should be paid to food security aspects in order to safeguard consumers."
"This is why I voted in favour of this resolution; in considering the negative impact of the liberalisation of markets on local economies, it underlines the strategic importance of reasonable tariff protection."
"We must in fact curb competition from low-cost imports of non-EU products, which often do not meet environmental, social, health and quality standards."
"We must also introduce stringent criteria for certifying and labelling in respect of the traceability of products, in order to inform consumers of the geographical origin of products on sale, the conditions under which they were produced or caught and, above all, their quality."
"Lastly, I should like to emphasise that in a market that is largely dependent on imports, withdrawing products from the market in order to destroy them is no longer justifiable."
"The money saved as a result could be made available to programmes conducted by producers' organisations."
"in writing. - (DE) The sustainable development of European aquaculture, fish farming and natural fish ponds, as well as the establishment of better basic conditions are essential for the competitiveness of the European fisheries industry."
"The quality of imported fishery products is extremely important in this context."
"In view of the continual increase in imports from third countries, we must ensure that these imports also meet European standards."
"The European fisheries industry has high quality standards and a great deal of specialist knowledge, and these are hallmarks that we must continue to protect."
"In this context, I welcome the IUU Directive for combating illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing that entered into force in January."
"It is an important step towards preventing global distortions of competition and supporting honest, law-abiding fishermen."
"I support Mr Cadec's report, which highlights a far-reaching and important aspect of the European fisheries industry."
"I voted in favour of the report on the arrangements for importing fishery and aquaculture products into the EU with a view to the future reform of the CFP because I believe it is essential to have rules that are in line with the sector's requirements."
"The European Union is the world's largest market for fishery products, and it is well known that EU production on its own cannot meet internal demand."
"The priority is therefore to ensure that third-country imports meet the environmental, health, social and quality standards imposed by the EU, in order to prevent unfair competition from importing countries in the form of cheap, low-quality products."
"The report adopted today by Parliament also makes strong calls for the application of more stringent and transparent criteria in respect of the quality, traceability and labelling of fishery products."
"As the world's largest importer of fishery products, the EU market shares political responsibility with other major fish importing countries for ensuring that the World Trade Organisation trade rules respect the highest possible global standards of fisheries management and conservation."
"The EU must make efforts to sustainably increase fish production from aquaculture so as to reduce imports in the fishery and aquaculture products sector."
"I am especially concerned about the possibility of importing genetically modified fish and bringing it to the marketplace: in my opinion its sale in the EU must be prevented."
"I therefore advocate a stringent policy of certification, which could control these problems effectively."
"I also support the idea of a strong commitment to research and development in the field of European aquaculture, since it represents only 2% of world production."
"in writing. - (DE) For its survival, every state needs to maintain food self-sufficiency."
"Fishing is important for food, and also ensures a variety of jobs."
"As in agriculture, we are prescribing high environmental, animal protection and quality standards for our domestic fishermen, which are naturally reflected in the price."
"With imports, however, adherence to our own rules can hardly be monitored."
"Therefore it is all the more important that there are clear rules here for importing, but also for food labelling and quality, and that we do not encourage competition with the domestic economy."
"We also need to be concerned that we do not score an own goal with aquaculture by adding extra burdens to the ecosystems or making domestic fishermen unemployed instead of providing more environmental protection."
"The measures proposed are a step in the right direction, and I have voted for the report."
"The question of the arrangements for importing fishery and aquaculture products into the EU and in particular the conditions under which products originating outside the Union are admitted - alongside or in competition with European fishery and aquaculture products - is of major importance and any analysis of these sectors of the European economy must necessarily address it."
"Regulation of this subject is essential in a context in which the level of European self-sufficiency is currently very low, with more than 60% of demand met by imports."
"in writing. - This report was originally a defence of a protectionist stance with respect to imports, mostly in the belief that EU fishermen should have preferential access to the EU market, except when they cannot catch enough, in which case EU processors should be able to import."
"Since our belief is that too much international trade leads to over-exploitation and depletion of fish stocks as countries seek to increase their exports, there was a good basis for common ground."
"Indeed, we got a good number of our amendments adopted, the most important one pointing out that, even if international trade in fish products can lead to increased food security in developing countries, it has also led to increased fishing in order to supply the export market, which can exacerbate stock depletion."
"Other amendments stressed the need to strengthen resource management and fisheries surveillance, and the need for responsible consumption, and noted that fish supplies come from a wild natural resource which is limited in quantity, which means that there is a limit to how much fish can be caught, exported and consumed."
"The Community strategy for the sustainable development of aquaculture was recently approved."
"Of course, it is now time to regulate the issue of importing fishery and aquaculture products, as the EU is currently the largest market for these products in the world."
"However, there is not enough production to meet the demand, so the EU is dependent on these imports."
"It is therefore necessary to regulate the way in which these imports are carried out to ensure that the quality and good practice required of Community producers will also be required of third countries."
"I agree with the rapporteur on the issue of customs protection."
"It does not seem practicable, especially in this day and age, to abolish customs tariffs and yet expect our products to substitute and be competitive against those of third countries."
"As I noted earlier, the issue of fisheries and aquaculture is one of the priorities set out by Madeira in the economic and social development plan currently in force, whereupon the region is in the process of promoting competitiveness in the sector through sustainable management of resources, diversification of fish production, evaluation of products in terms of quality, and training for those involved in fisheries with a view to increasing productivity."
"For these reasons, I voted in favour of this report."
"Today, I endorsed the Cadec report, which raises many important aspects of the protection of the EU market for aquaculture products in the context of reform of the common fisheries policy."
"I supported the report because I wanted to emphasise one threat in particular which it mentions: the lack of sound and wide-ranging information for consumers on the health properties, composition and origin of particular species of fish."
"When there is a lack of knowledge among consumers, the only argument in the market becomes price."
"European producers offer products which are often of much higher quality in comparison with imported ones, but in an uneven fight they are condemned to lose."
"Therefore, it is necessary to tighten up legislation on identification. Thank you."

"1."
"Zimbabwe, in particular the case of Farai Maguwu"
"The next item is the debate on seven motions for resolutions on Zimbabwe, in particular the case of Farai Maguwu."
"author. - (FI) Madam President, human rights violations in Zimbabwe have been discussed before by this Parliament."
"Unfortunately, once again we are forced to address them."
"This time it is the case of the human rights activist Farai Maguwu."
"He is simply a prisoner of conscience."
"He has been arrested and imprisoned for standing up for the human rights of others and then providing the media with information on human rights in the country."
"The European Parliament is appealing for his release and for all human rights violations in Zimbabwe to be investigated and, obviously, ended."
"This case is especially blatant and, being so, particularly unpleasant, in that someone who stands up for the human rights of others himself has to suffer."
"Madam President, behind the Farai Maguwu case lies the whole issue of diamond mining."
"Zimbabwe is a voluntary member of the Kimberley Process, which allows signatories to sell diamonds on the international market provided that this trade does not finance armed conflict."
"However, during the meeting on the Kimberley Process held on 20-21 June in Tel Aviv, the participants were unable to reach an agreement on the following question: should human rights not be integrated into the Kimberley Process too?"
"Several international NGOs have condemned human rights violations in Zimbabwe's diamond mines, violations perpetrated by the security services."
"One of their informers was Farai Maguwu, the Director of the Centre for Research and Development on human rights, based in Manicaland."
"That is why Mr Maguwu was arrested on 3 June and why, since then, he has been detained in very difficult conditions, having allegedly breached state security provisions."
"This is clearly unacceptable."
"With this resolution we are calling for the immediate release of the prisoner, the demilitarisation of mining, the inclusion of human rights clauses in the Kimberley Process, and the redistribution of diamond wealth to the people, for example through a dedicated sovereign fund."
"We also call on the Commission and the Council to be extremely vigilant as regards issues of good governance and democracy in Zimbabwe and in the dialogue that we are having with this country, which has been characterised by its insufficient progress."
"author. - (NL) Madam President, we are dealing with two issues here or, to be precise, one person and one issue."
"First of all, we are dealing with Farai Maguwu, a human being and a human rights activist, who was arrested in Zimbabwe and then badly mistreated in prison."
"Secondly, we are dealing with the strange role that the monitor of the Kimberley Process has played."
"This monitor is supposed to oversee the situation in Zimbabwe and yet he has actually established contacts with the Zimbabwean Government and used information which he received from Mr Maguwu, and thus put Mr Maguwu in an awkward position."
"Ultimately, then, we are also dealing with the Kimberley Process itself."
"In my previous role as lobbyist for development organisations, I participated in the negotiations to bring this system in. It has proven to be a successful system."
"It has cut off, or decreased the amount of, finance for the wars in Congo, Angola, Sierra Leone and Liberia raised through the sale of diamonds."
"However, we are now running the risk of the Kimberley system being used to legitimise another practice, and that is human rights violations by regimes."
"They are not covered by this resolution and that is why we are demanding an amendment."
"This resolution by Parliament sends out the message that conflict diamonds, or blood diamonds, are all there is to it."
"After all, all diamonds are mined in appalling conditions."
"That would be an enormous step forward, because that would enable us to denounce not only the situation in Zimbabwe, but also the already longstanding human rights abuses by the Angolan regime against the Lunda."
"So far, we have had no success on that score, because the Kimberley system is a collaboration of countries which take a dim view of other countries interfering in their home affairs."
"However, this signal from the European Parliament could be the first in a series of signals that bring about change there."
"Madam President, firstly I will say that, compared to this morning, there is finally a little peace and tranquillity in this House!"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I supported the resolution on the human rights situation in Zimbabwe, and in particular the case of Farai Maguwu, because our Parliament cannot remain silent in the face of the violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms perpetrated in Zimbabwe for several decades now."
"The Director of the Centre for Research and Development, Farai Maguwu, was arrested by the authorities in his country after condemning the human rights violations in the diamond fields."
"In doing so he was merely exercising his right to freedom of expression and his right to seek information on human rights and fundamental freedoms as a whole."
"Parliament is calling for his release and for Zimbabwe to respect political rights and fundamental freedoms, in order to allow civil society to express itself without fear."
"Furthermore, Zimbabwe must scrupulously adhere to the commitments it made on diamond production in the context of the Kimberley Process, so as to escape the vicious circle of financing armed conflict."
"Madam President, the Chamber is quiet, I would say perhaps a little too quiet, and I for one regret that there are not more of us interested in these issues."
"To say that the situation in Zimbabwe is tragic is unfortunately an understatement."
"It is tragic as regards the economy, society and above all democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights."
"The last elections took place in a climate of fear."
"The arrest of Farai Maguwu, the Director of the Centre for Research and Development, following an interview with Mr Chikane, a monitor for the Kimberley Process, is therefore, unfortunately, just one more episode to add to the long list of human rights abuses in that country."
"The mining conditions in the Marange diamond fields are particularly dreadful: forced labour, torture, contraband, even murders; everything is under military control and done for the benefit of Mr Mugabe's friends."
"Time and again these conditions have been condemned by NGOs, including that of Mr Maguwu."
"This is why it is so surprising that Mr Chikane tabled a positive report concluding that mining at the site meets the requirements laid down by the Kimberley Process."
"The intersessional meeting in Tel Aviv failed to reach a decision on the follow-up to this report."
"Commissioner, can you confirm for us that, in the absence of consensus among the Member States, the European Union has indeed opposed the resumption of legal diamond exports from Zimbabwe; that it will continue to do so at the St Petersburg conference; that it will fight for the extension of the Kimberley Process to include respect for all human rights; and that it will do everything in its power to ensure that Member States take the measures necessary to prevent the import of diamonds from Zimbabwe, while such a situation prevails there?"
"Can you help us understand the reasoning behind Mr Chikane's decision to give the green light, when it seems that some of the notes in his dossiers have been seized by secret service agents?"
"The European Union is the main contributor of humanitarian aid to Zimbabwe."
"Its attitude in this matter must therefore be exemplary."
"It must maintain its positions."
"Can you tell us what the position of the European Union will be in St Petersburg?"
"author. - Madam President, since being elected in 1999, I have done my utmost to galvanise opposition from this Parliament to the massive catalogue of injustice that Mugabe and his henchmen have inflicted on the people of Zimbabwe."
"I have to say this is one area where this House speaks with one voice."
"Today we are discussing the systematic abuse of workers in the diamond fields of Zimbabwe by government security forces."
"Zimbabwe is a full member of the Kimberley Process, the informal body that governs the global trade in rough diamonds and which so far has taken little action to stop such abuses."
"I call on the Kimberley Process to consider tough measures against Zimbabwe for non-compliance and I join the condemnation of the recent arrest of Farai Maguwu, a man of conscience, who dared to expose the violence perpetrated by the Zimbabwean security forces at Chiadzwa."
"The Zimbabwean Government must immediately release Mr Maguwu and, for that matter, all other political prisoners, and we should recall that the right to free speech was one of the main commitments made by all parties in last year's global political agreement."
"At the moment the basic medical and food needs of a large section of the Zimbabwean population are met by international aid."
"The Zimbabwean Government should use the substantial revenue that diamond mining is likely to generate to create a diamond trust fund to kick-start the economy and to provide the health, education and social funding currently provided by international donors."
"Regrettably, Zimbabwe still has a long way to go before we can say that its people live in freedom and democracy and under a respected rule of law."
"It is time for a dramatic change and the EU and the countries of southern Africa should be bringing more pressure to bear to bring about good governance in Zimbabwe."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - (DE) Madam President, the fact that Farai Maguwu was arrested on account of his publication of information on the conditions in the diamond fields of Marange shows who has the real power and where the true holders of power in Zimbabwe are to this day, and that the Government of National Unity, this forced coalition government, in fact only exercises power in the old part, namely in the area where those who are supported by Mr Mugabe live."
"For this reason, I think it is important for us to continue to denounce these conditions and, as the European Union, continue to maintain our black list of those who continue to suppress the people in Zimbabwe."
"For it is those who arrested Farai Maguwu who are at the same time profiting from the diamond mining and who are pocketing the sales revenue for themselves and not making it available to the people via the country's budget."
"I therefore hope that we will denounce this situation with a very broad majority and that both the EU and Southern Africa will finally call for an end to these conditions."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Madam President, things have improved in Zimbabwe but sadly they have not improved enough."
"We have seen the crackdown on Mr Maguwu and on other human rights defenders."
"We have also seen the closure and the arrest of lesbian, gay and bisexual people engaged in HIV prevention and advice."
"If I stand up and speak as an Englishman, they will dismiss it."
"As Europeans, they will dismiss us."
"But let me say the obvious to the African countries: you know what is happening in Zimbabwe is wrong."
"Unless you do something about it collectively, you will lose any moral authority in the continent and in the world."
"We talk about Africa being in your hands, and the future of Africa being in your hands."
"To stand back and do nothing while people are arrested because they seek to expose human rights breaches and to defend ordinary women and men, to do nothing, Africa, is to be complicit."
"Madam President, we are always looking for effective ways to influence countries which are outside the European Union - influence which would bring about a change and a decision to uphold human rights."
"These ways should never affect the population or humanitarian aid, but we must seek an intelligent way of putting pressure on the regime of President Mugabe which would mean that situations such as that of Farai Maguwu will never happen again."
"On the issue of the protection of human rights, this is a question of our fundamental credibility."
"Here, we must say clearly 'Yea, yea;"
"Nay, nay'. Human rights are being upheld or they are not."
"We must not content ourselves with small advances."
"I have the impression that in some of the speeches there was an element of satisfaction with small advances."
"We have said clearly: the government of President Mugabe does not have any legitimacy and its actions are worthy of condemnation - and we should say this most explicitly."
"(RO) I too wish to join those who have called in this Chamber for the immediate release of Farai Maguwu."
"We must condemn the detention conditions he has been subjected to, as well as the failure to respect his basic human rights during the proceedings."
"As you are aware, the role of civil society organisations is essential, not only to ensure the success of the Kimberley Process, but also to safeguard democracy in Zimbabwe in general."
"However, this country cannot make progress along the road to democracy if human rights activists are forced to keep silent when the international media as well highlight violations that have been committed."
"I would also like to stress that the Zimbabwean authorities are duty-bound to investigate impartially human rights violations committed in the diamond fields and to bring those responsible for these actions to justice."
"The keyword in this case is transparency."
"Zimbabwe's citizens have the right to be informed, which means that the authorities must fulfil the commitments they have made voluntarily as part of the Kimberley Process."
"(PT) The case of Farai Maguwu illustrates the brutal repression in Zimbabwe and also the need to extend the scope of the Kimberley Process."
"Diamonds should not only be certified as free of war crimes, but also of violations against human rights, including those perpetrated by exploitative countries and companies."
"The exploitation of diamonds has a role to play in combating poverty and achieving the Millennium Development Goals."
"According to Global Witness, in 2008 Africa exported USD 393 billion worth of petroleum and minerals, which corresponds to nine times the total amount of aid that the continent received."
"The fair use of natural resources for the benefit of local people can be crucial in strengthening the rule of law, in promoting social responsibility among companies and, therefore, in guaranteeing human rights."
"In this sense it is vital that the European Union adopts mechanisms to combat corruption in the exploitation of minerals, as several Members have argued, particularly through the petition online at www.stopcorruption.eu, which I would like to invite everyone to sign."
"(DE) Madam President, I am very pleased that the Maguwu case has been raised today, as it is only the tip of the iceberg, and as we so beautifully put it: the rot starts at the top."
"Robert Mugabe, once a politically skilled fighter for the rights of the black population, is today a brutal dictator and responsible for the collapse of the economy, famines and political terror in his country."
"His land reform, which started chaotically, has finally peaked in the expropriation of the white farmers, the country has become a wasteland and 94% of the population is unemployed."
"At the end of the day, anyone who today arrests activists like Mr Maguwu, threatens them with imprisonment and with torture and also threatens their families, does not meet the criteria that also need to be met in the Kimberley Process."
"I agree with the previous speaker that we also need to enshrine the protection of human rights in the Kimberley Process."
"Instead of making demands and just complaining, we ought to act in a consistent manner and support the other states and impose sanctions in order to put Zimbabwe under pressure, even to the extent of excluding it from the Kimberley Process."
"(PL) Madam President, we all know that diamonds can be a blessing, but they can also be a curse."
"We wish Zimbabwe and its people well, and we want the changes in Zimbabwe to lead one day to a complete and constructive transformation."
"Today, however, we are talking about someone for whom diamonds may become a curse."
"Farai Maguwu was arrested on charges of publishing information prejudicial to the state."
"In fact, this often happens - the authorities in some countries do not understand that their reputation is damaged and degraded by the actions of those who violate human rights, and not by those who expose and publicise such violations."
"Therefore, the release of Farai Maguwu lies in the interest of Zimbabwe itself, and I hope the authorities will listen to our appeal in this matter."
"We know of constructive examples of the use of diamonds for development of the right kind."
"Botswana is one such case."
"Therefore, our appeal for the income from diamonds to be used for health care, education and social needs is both justified and feasible."
"(RO) The case we are discussing today, involving the arrest and detention of Farai Maguwu well over a month ago, reflects the lack of progress made in Zimbabwe in terms of respect for human rights."
"It also draws attention to the serious situation in the diamond fields in the eastern part of the country where the army is frequently accused of committing crimes, acts of violence and serious abuses."
"During the last 30 years the Mugabe regime has made Zimbabwe bankrupt and turned it into a humanitarian disaster."
"Blood diamonds are proof of the cynicism displayed by governing circles lacking scruples and respect for their own citizens."
"Zimbabwe is violating the standards stipulated by the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme for selling rough diamonds."
"I believe that it is the European Union's duty to offer more active support to this cooperation body in order to strengthen the moral aspect of the diamond trade in an effort to eliminate the trafficking of diamonds which fund conflicts and armed groups and derive from barbaric exploitation."
"We call for the immediate release of Farai Maguwu and we appeal to European diplomacy to consider the option of adopting tough sanctions against the Harare regime in order to make it stop the maltreatment of human rights activists and put an end to the bloody slavery of the diamond fields."
"Madam President, it is now less than five weeks since Farai Maguwu was detained by the Zimbabwean authorities."
"Since then he has been kept in detention in unknown conditions and deprived of his personal rights."
"I am happy that this Parliament is united in asking for his immediate release, but I am concerned that his arrest could be a setback to the results of the Tel Aviv meeting and to the Kimberley Process."
"As our colleague, Mr Van Orden, mentioned, there is systematic abuse of workers in diamond mines, and the situation in Zimbabwe is very typical, with huge earnings from mineral exports not being reflected in the living conditions of the population, which is kept in poverty and experiences disease."
"I also agree that African states have an important role to play in improving conditions there."
"I support dialogue with Zimbabwe by the European Commission on condition that Mr Maguwu be released and the Kimberley Process addressed by the Zimbabwean authorities."
"Mr President, in the 30 years since Mugabe took power, Zimbabwe has changed from the breadbasket to the begging bowl of southern Africa."
"The past decade in Zimbabwe has been characterised by the systematic and deliberate impoverishment of most of Zimbabwe's 12 million people."
"However, some of Mugabe's cronies, particularly the military chiefs, have become exceedingly rich through control of expropriated farmland and mineral resources."
"Farai Maguwu has bravely sought to expose extrajudicial killings and human rights abuses by the army, which controls many of Zimbabwe's diamond mines."
"Inevitably the wealth from these mines is now bankrolling Mugabe's henchmen."
"Zimbabwe should therefore be refused readmission to the Kimberley Process."
"The EU should also seek to tighten and extend targeted sanctions against those in Zimbabwe who have enriched themselves by trading in the so-called blood diamonds."
"Of course Farai Maguwu, who was exercising his fundamental right to free speech, should be released from detention immediately."
"(PL) Madam President, decisions made in 2000, and then approved by the governments of interested states and the international diamond industry in 2003 in Kimberly, were motivated by the worthy idea of ending the trade in blood diamonds."
"Agreement was reached concerning rebel movements which were using money gained from the sale of diamonds to fund illegal warfare intended to overthrow lawfully elected national authorities."
"Movements of this type are the cause of the internal destabilisation and conflict which is currently taking place in many countries in Africa."
"Therefore, we are disturbed by the reports of violations of human rights and the deaths of many civilians after the army and the police took control of the diamond mine in Marange."
"We call on the Government of Zimbabwe to apply all necessary measures in accordance with the resolutions of the Kimberly Process to restore the normal operation of the mine."
"In addition, we condemn the illegal arrests which are being made and demand the release of Farai Maguwu."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Kimberley Process is an initiative set up by representatives of governments, the diamond industry and civil society in order to finally put a stop to the international trade in so-called blood diamonds."
"Back in 2008, signs of serious breaches of the Kimberley Process rules in the Marange diamond fields in Zimbabwe had already been detected."
"Farai Maguwu is one of the brave human rights activists who document cases of forced labour, torture and violence in their home country."
"The government of Zimbabwe voluntarily joined the Kimberley Process; we must insist that the obligations that this entails be fulfilled."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I am very grateful for the discussion that is taking place in this Chamber today."
"The Tel Aviv intercessional meeting of the Kimberley Process on 21-24 June this year was very heavily clouded by the arrest of Mr Farai Maguwu."
"The Commission shares the concerns of the European Parliament and has insisted that Mr Maguwu is treated in full respect of his legal right of defence."
"The EU delegation is monitoring his situation very closely."
"It is in contact with Mr Maguwu's lawyers, reflecting our local strategy to support human rights defenders and to reinforce their protection."
"We have also called on Zimbabwe to reaffirm its commitment to the role of civil society in the Kimberley Process."
"While the mandate of the Kimberley Process is focused on preventing the trade of conflict diamonds, it is clear that this process cannot operate in a vacuum and ignore human rights concerns."
"That has been a very strong message conveyed today in this Chamber - all the more so if we recognise that respect for human rights is a principle that underlies the very aim of the Kimberley Process."
"Turning to the Tel Aviv meeting itself, the EU supported the continued implementation of the Swakopmund Decision and the joint work plan to bring mining cooperation in Marangwe into compliance with the rules of the Kimberley Process, including application of the so-called supervised export mechanism."
"We believe that further engagement with Zimbabwe in the framework of the Kimberley Process offers the best chance, not only to ensure technical compliance in the Marangwe mining area with the Kimberley Process, but also to enhance governance in this critical sector of the economy and ultimately to improve the human rights situation in Marangwe."
"It is for these reasons that the EU has called on Zimbabwe to maintain a firm commitment to the Kimberley Process and the joint work plan, so that Marangwe diamonds can, at some point, in due course contribute to Zimbabwe's economic development."
"It is our goal that the participants of the Kimberley Process and Zimbabwe will intensify their efforts in order to forge consensus on this difficult issue, in the spirit of dialogue and cooperation that has always presided over this process."
"Finally, it is important that Parliament is informed that, at a meeting with Zimbabwean Ministers representing the Government of National Unity on 2 July, Baroness Ashton, the High Representative and Vice-President, recalled that the implementation of the global political agreement, which addresses our concern about human rights, the rule of law and democratic principles, is key to achieving normalisation of relations with the EU."
"As stated earlier, we attach great importance to Zimbabwe's compliance with the rule of law and human rights."
"This is an issue we have raised on various occasions and in different fora."
"The Commission finances, and will continue to finance, a wide range of activities in Zimbabwe, in collaboration with civil society organisations."
"We will continue to seek and support ways to create and sustain an open political environment where human rights and freedoms are fully respected."
"With regard to the position of the Commission on trade with diamonds from Zimbabwe, we called for an audit of the existing diamond stockpile before advancing any discussion on the limited resumption of exports."
"The EU is invited to the closed session of major stakeholders called by the Chair of the Kimberley Process at the margins of the meeting of the World Diamond Council on 14 July in St Petersburg, where we will advance further discussions on that issue."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place shortly."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - I join the voices calling for the release of Farai Maguwu."
"He was arrested for providing information on the Kimberley Process."
"He turned himself in to the police, after his family members were beaten, arrested, and detained, and staff members of his organisation went into hiding."
"The arbitrary detention of Mr Maguwu is a message of intimidation that the Government of Zimbabwe is sending to human rights defenders and free citizens in the country, to prevent them from reporting on the realities in Marange."
"Farai Maguwu must be released from prison immediately."
"The Government should restore all confiscated computers, files and materials that belong to his organisation, cease the harassment of the organisation's staff, and establish an independent investigation into the circumstances leading to Mr. Maguwu's arrest and detention."
"The Commission and the Council must address urgently this request to the Government of Zimbabwe and make it a non-negotiable request."
"2."
"Venezuela, in particular the case of Maria Lourdes Afiuni"
"The next item is the debate on seven motions for resolutions on Venezuela, in particular the case of Maria Lourdes Afiuni."
"author. - (ES) Madam President, Judge Afiuni granted parole to Eligio Cedeño, in accordance with Venezuelan law and in line with the opinion of the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detentions."
"This led to her incarceration in a maximum-security prison, in conditions that are putting her life in danger."
"President Chávez has publicly requested that the prosecutor seek the maximum penalty, and that the National Assembly pass a law to increase her sentence with retroactive effect."
"Amnesty International and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights have indicated their great concern."
"This is not an isolated case, ladies and gentlemen."
"On the contrary, it demonstrates the autocratic and authoritarian drift of a regime that, alongside seemingly democratic elections, closes opposing media, orders confiscations and arrests political opponents, showing no respect for human rights and the rule of law."
"We have therefore requested that Judge Afiuni be freed immediately."
"author. - Madam President, once again we are discussing in this Parliament the situation in Venezuela - not because we want to, but because we have to."
"Things have not improved since our last resolution; quite the opposite."
"The very idea of the rule of law is now disappearing under so much pressure put on judges and the judiciary, and this affects the exercise of a whole range of human rights, from freedom of speech - particularly media freedom - to private property."
"Article 26 of the Venezuelan Constitution is very clear, stating that the judiciary is independent and the President is the guarantor of this independence."
"Nevertheless, more and more, President Hugo Chavez is simply dictating through public speeches to the prosecutors and the judges how to act and decide."
"Several judges have become victims of such presidential behaviour."
"Some have been removed from office; others have left the country."
"The case of Judge Maria Lourdes Afiuni is just the most recent and the most prominent in the sense that a judge was imprisoned, accused because of a decision she took."
"How could the judges dealing with her case act independently when the President of the country, instead of waiting for the trial and the analysis of the evidence by the judiciary, publicly refers to Judge Afiuni as a bandit and asks for a maximum penalty?"
"Maria Lourdes Afiuni has spent her last seven months in a place where her physical integrity and even her life are endangered."
"She is in a prison with more than 20 female inmates whom she convicted over the years for very severe crimes."
"There is no doubt this measure was taken to humiliate her and to frighten her."
"Since I do not expect much from the Venezuelan courts, I dare to ask President Chavez to allow her release."
"(ES) President Chávez, Judge Afiuni must be freed immediately."
"There needs to be a fair trial without delay, with all of the guarantees necessary for her to be able to defend herself against the prosecutor's accusations."
"This would not only be fair on your part, but also a notable humanitarian gesture."
"Madam President, in the case of Maria Lourdes Afiuni in Venezuela, is the issue one of combating corruption, which is the official version, or of persecuting a political opponent, which is the New York Times version reported by its correspondent, Simon Romero?"
"The question certainly deserves to be asked, as both combinations are common in hardline regimes."
"However, my group has withdrawn its signature from the compromise and is ready to submit a resolution on its own."
"I think you wanted to overdo it, ladies and gentlemen, and I do not want to use this case, which I feel must be clarified, to criticise the entire Venezuelan regime, which is what you are seeking to do."
"What is the issue at stake here?"
"Using an exceptional procedure, Judge Afiuni granted the release of a banker accused of stealing USD 27 million from a state agency through the use of a false import contract."
"She was arrested following this release and placed in detention."
"It is true that her detention conditions are absolutely terrible, like those in all Venezuelan prisons."
"However, we are not holding an urgent debate on prisons here."
"Therefore, this still does not make the judge a human rights activist - she has never expressed herself on this point."
"Like you, I call for a fair and quick trial with all the associated guarantees of defence, the continuation of the fight against the corruption that exists within the judicial apparatus, and the strict separation of politics from the judiciary."
"I agree with you on that, but I cannot agree with you on the rest."
"author. - (ES) Madam President, I am of the same opinion as Mrs De Keyser."
"When we were asked some days ago to debate this matter as an urgent case, I stated that the specific case of Judge Afiuni deserved attention."
"Perhaps not in the form of an emergency resolution."
"Perhaps in the form of a letter that different Members could sign, demonstrating our concern and detailing the request that we are making - or rather, that we should be making and have yet to make - for the legal guarantees relating to all trials, including the case of Judge Afiuni, to be observed."
"This was the intention, and with this intention our group also presented a motion for a resolution in which we put forward several points coinciding with some of the opinions that have been expressed, and which I believe it is important to recall."
"However, what we have found during this process is that, rather than a resolution on a specific case of violation of human rights, or the specific situation that the judge is going through at this time, there has been an allegation from the point of view of the Venezuelan opposition."
"It will have escaped nobody's attention that we have elections very soon."
"Moreover, it will have escaped nobody's attention that this resolution will be used politically - politically! - in Venezuela."
"I have a very clear lack of affinity or political sympathy for Mr Chávez; a complete lack."
"However, I also do not want the European Parliament to be used to campaign for the opposition, which, at this point, is using an individual case to damage the credibility of an entire policy, with which it is possible to be more or less in agreement, but which needs to be debated politically at all times."
"This is not the debate that we are having today, which may need to take place in another context, but not today, not here, not now."
"The resolution on cases of human rights violations, democracy and the rule of law has a very specific mandate and a very specific purpose, and you have spent a great deal of time using this space to do other things that have nothing to do with individual and specific reports of human rights violations."
"It seems to me that there has been a need for some time for the entire House, for all groups, to reflect on this, for the sake of human rights."
"author. - Madam President, the sheer demagoguery of Venezuela's President Hugo Chávez seems to know no bounds."
"He has now targeted the independence of the judiciary as a next obstacle to his assumption of absolute power."
"The arrest and imprisonment of Judge María Lourdes Afiuni Mora represents his most audacious and brazen attempt yet to silence dissent and undermine separation of powers and the rule of law."
"How this judge can hope for a fair trial is beyond me."
"Chávez has already labelled her a bandit, accused her of taking a bribe, and said she should be jailed for 30 years."
"He has also said that Simón Bolívar would have had her shot, an extremely inflammatory statement in Chávez's increasingly dictatorial regime and, in my view, a reckless incitement to violence."
"Yet Chávez gets away with this behaviour largely because he remains a hysterical critic of the United States and, as such, is popular with many on the Left in Europe and in this House."
"This paradox continues to undermine the EU's collective efforts to expose the alarming trend towards totalitarianism in Venezuela."
"(Applause)"
"(DE) ('Blue card' question under Rule 149(8) of the Rules of Procedure put to Mr Romeva i Rueda) Madam President, I would like to ask Mr Romeva whether he knows that the Rules of Procedure not only mention human rights, but that democracy and the rule of law are also the subject of this debate."
"Moreover, does he know that Mr Chávez poses a danger to democracy and the rule of law?"
"Mr Posselt, it is a question of priorities."
"Two months ago we were debating precisely this question here, in the context of an emergency resolution on Venezuela."
"What I am saying specifically is that we should keep clear what is important and what the priorities are."
"If we need to have a debate on Venezuela in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, let us have it, but we should not use this session to do things that have nothing to do with the fundamental, specific and timely reporting of human rights violations."
"author. - Madam President, this resolution, purporting to be about human rights in Venezuela, exposes a massive hypocrisy among the right-wing parties in this Parliament."
"The real agenda here is not to defend human rights but, in fact, to advance the overthrow of the government of Hugo Chávez in Venezuela and to give succour to the right-wing pro-big-business opposition in Venezuela, which still controls large swathes of the privately-owned media and industry and landed estates and includes those who attempted an open coup less than 10 years ago."
"The Chávez government has carried out certain progressive measures, which have improved the lives of the most impoverished sections of society, but that has meant that Chávez opposed the neoliberal economic policies which the European Union and the United States have been forcing on many countries in Latin America: policies such as deregulation, liberalisation and privatisation of their economies that primarily benefit the major transnational corporations based in the EU and the United States."
"That is why we have this campaign of vilification."
"I demand that this Judge Afiuni and all prisoners in Venezuela are treated with dignity and are afforded a scrupulously fair trial."
"I and socialist colleagues of mine in Venezuela, Socialismo Revolucionario for example, do have major problems with some aspects of the Chávez policies: increasing tendencies towards bureaucratisation and a Stalinist-type tendency to try to abuse and discredit opposition that comes from the left in Venezuela and in the Labour movement."
"We want to see the major resources in Venezuela in public ownership but under a genuine regime of democratic workers' control and management that will lay the basis of enough wealth and services to transform the lives of the big majority of the people of Venezuela, ending horrific problems such as poverty and crime but also providing full democratic social and human rights for all."
"Madam President, in this Chamber, we often ask ourselves a question which is also put to us in our constituencies: how effective is your work in the area of protecting human rights?"
"Listening to the Communist fellow Member who says that the speeches made here may result in the overthrow of a regime, I am pleased, and I would like the dictatorial regimes in Belarus, Zimbabwe and everywhere where people suffer under such regimes to fall because of what is said in this Chamber."
"I am also filled with sadness by the attitude of Mrs De Keyser and Mr Romeva i Rueda."
"Two months ago you said the same - that this is neither the right forum nor the right time to be talking about Venezuela."
"However, this is the time and this is the place, and we should protect those people irrespective of our differing political sympathies."
"President Chávez and the apparatus which he controls constantly commit numerous acts of political persecution and harassment of representatives of the democratic opposition."
"In this context, I demand the release of Judge Afiuni, and I appeal to the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to send - I am just closing - a petition to the Venezuelan authorities expressing the fears of the European Union in connection with breaches of human rights, democratic principles and law and order in Venezuela."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, I am happy that the European Parliament has put the case of Judge Afiuni on its agenda and is raising its voice against human rights violations in Venezuela."
"What is more, I urge the Venezuelan Government to respect the people of Venezuela, as well as the international human rights charters, and take genuine steps towards true democracy where human rights and the rule of law are and will be respected."
"Judge Afiuni's case is a sad reminder of Venezuela's negative attitude towards human rights."
"Judge Afiuni's detention is a violation of her basic personal rights and a very serious threat to the independence of judicial power."
"(FI) Madam President, we discussed the continued erosion of democracy in Venezuela on a previous occasion here six months ago."
"An especially alarming visible development is the government's attacks on the press and the freedom of the Internet, and the closure of newspapers, radio channels, websites and television stations."
"We probably do not know all the facts, but all the same we have to look at the problems and principles associated with the situation."
"In his open persecution of Afiuni, President Chávez has assumed a role where he is attacking the independence of the judiciary, even though he should be its number one protector."
"The separation of powers is the basis of democracy and the constitutional state, and the freedom of the media is essential for democracy and a respect for fundamental freedoms."
"The free public expression of opinion and ideas is a guarantee of participation in the democratic process and makes possible free and fair elections and good governance."
"Hopefully, nobody here would argue otherwise."
"Madam President, democracy in Venezuela is in danger and I would like to add another case which relates to the limitation by the government of the freedom of speech and its control of civil society."
"One recent situation with implications in the entire region is the attempt by Venezuela in June 2010 to amend a draft resolution on civil society participation in the Organisation of American States."
"Venezuela wanted to make civil society participation subject to domestic law."
"There is a bad precedent."
"A similar clause in the Treaty on the implementation of the Inter-American Convention against Corruption was used by Venezuela to prevent NGOs reporting on corruption in this country."
"The Commission and the Council must strongly and openly support civil society in Venezuela and must watch with great care the upcoming parliamentary elections."
"The legitimacy of the next Parliament is crucial in these times of deteriorating democracy."
"Finally, I would like to add my voice in calling for the release of the judge."
"(RO) I would like to reiterate that the protection of human rights has always been and continues to be a priority for us."
"This is why it is natural for us to be concerned about the conditions under which such trials are being conducted and about the detention regime."
"I believe that we must ensure that the trial is fair, transparent and compliant with the fundamental norms of the rule of law."
"However, by the same token, I do not think it is appropriate for us to use such cases, which we are not always very familiar with, as a pretext for internal political struggle."
"(SK) I am outraged at the way President Chávez is governing in Venezuela."
"His style of left-wing rule is reminiscent of the worst communist governments of eastern and central Europe in the period before the fall of the Berlin Wall."
"Maria Lourdes Afiuni has been wrongly imprisoned, and her basic rights have been violated, as well as her freedom to make decisions as a judge."
"It is clear in this case that the judiciary is not independent, and Venezuela and Chávez make a mockery of democracy."
"(ES) Madam President, this is not the first time that I have spoken about Venezuela and the breaches of human rights that are occurring in that beautiful country and I fear it will not be the last."
"During my previous speech I referred to journalists."
"Today I am referring to judges such as Judge Afiuni, and as always to ordinary Venezuelans, who, like the thousands of canaries that live there, only want to live in peace and freedom."
"These people aspire to safeguard their land and their affairs without the permanent uncertainty of 'what will happen tomorrow'."
"Venezuela has been a land of refuge for many."
"Today, unfortunately, it is a country where freedom of expression and other freedoms and rights are mere memories."
"We are talking here today about human rights and who is breaching them."
"May our support go out from here to Judge Afiuni, and to everyone living in Venezuela, together with our hope that political freedoms will once more be a reality."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, the EU is closely following the situation in Venezuela."
"In this regard I would like to note that we share the concerns expressed here about the circumstances of the arrest and detention of Judge María Lourdes Afiuni and the subsequent statements with regard to her arrest made by the Venezuelan authorities."
"It is important to note that the UN Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers and the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention qualified the arrest of Judge María Lourdes Afiuni as a deeply disturbing blow to judicial independence."
"UN experts went further by stating that reprisals for exercising their constitutionally guaranteed functions and creating a climate of fear among the judiciary and the lawyers' profession served no purpose except to undermine the rule of law and obstruct justice, arguing that the immediate and unconditional release of Judge Afiuni is imperative."
"The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights issued a protective measure in favour of Judge María Lourdes Afiuni, stressing the responsibility to protect her life and physical integrity and also to transfer her to a safe place."
"Although the Venezuelan authorities reported that she has been held separately from the general prison population, as has been mentioned here, she continues to be behind bars at the National Institute of Feminine Orientation, whose inmates could include people she sentenced."
"In the context of our dialogue with the Venezuelan authorities, we have always stressed the importance of fully respecting international obligations and commitments on human rights, including freedom of expression, respect for the rule of law and especially respect for judicial independence."
"These issues have been firmly raised in the context of our dialogue with the Venezuelan authorities and, while the authorities have been arguing that this imprisonment is in conformity with Venezuelan legislation, we have felt that this is an issue, based on the judgement of the UN and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and our own judgement, that we are deeply concerned about."
"We are following the tendency of political polarisation re-emerging in the country with concern."
"The September legislative elections are widely seen as a milestone for the future of the country and it is now timely for the EU to underline the importance that these elections be held in a peaceful, transparent and fully democratic environment."
"I would like to take this opportunity to stress that the EU encourages all actors to engage in the electoral process in a spirit of tolerance, civil-mindedness and respect for pluralism of opinions."
"We will continue to follow developments in Venezuela closely in the context and based on the foundation of our commitment to support and strengthen democracy and the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms everywhere in the world, including in Venezuela."
"(Applause)"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place shortly."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The case of Maria Lourdes Afiuni is absolutely appalling to anyone who defends democratic values."
"It highlights the fact that the rule of law is nothing but a meaningless concept in Venezuela."
"The politicisation of the judiciary has increased since Hugo Chávez came to power."
"Judicial authorities do not usually dare speak out against the government."
"When this does happen, the consequences are drastic."
"It is unacceptable that a judge who is only doing her duty in guaranteeing citizens their fundamental rights can be subjected to such reprisals."
"The Venezuelan Government must release Judge Afiuni quickly and stop its attacks on the independence of the judiciary."
"At the same time, we must also put this case in the context of the parliamentary elections in September."
"The practice of criminalising the actions of the government's critics must stop, along with all the attempts to restrict the freedom of expression and the press."
"The authoritarian tendency of the Chávez regime is extremely worrying and I think that we must not be afraid to say so."
"3."
"North Korea"
"The next item is the debate on seven motions for resolutions on North Korea."
"author. - (NL) Madam President, the repression of any potential criticism of the established order in North Korea is so strict that no information about any individual dissident or activist is in the public domain."
"This is the razor-sharp conclusion of an open letter of 14 June which five human rights organisations have addressed to the foreign ministers of the European Union."
"It is also a measure of how serious the situation is in Kim Jong Il's famished empire."
"We do not have the names of any dissidents or activists in the territory of North Korea."
"That information must be allowed to percolate through to us."
"The situation there is even incomparable with that in the former Soviet Union or Ceausescu's Romania."
"The open letter of 14 June urges European government officials to do a great deal more in response to the relentless violations of the fundamental rights of North Korean citizens, both within and without the boundaries of their country."
"Various concrete recommendations to this effect may be found in Parliament's joint resolution."
"Well done!"
"Let us, for instance, continue to remind China, at all European political levels, of its treaty responsibilities towards North Korean refugees."
"I also wholeheartedly support paragraph 14 of the resolution."
"The Commission is protecting the rights of North Korean workers in the Kaesong Industrial Complex by incorporating an unambiguous clause on this point in its Free Trade Agreement with South Korea."
"Madam President, officially North Korea claims that it guarantees religious freedom to its population of 24 million."
"In practice, however, anyone who is found distributing bibles or taking part in secret prayer meetings is liable to be sent off to a labour camp or even executed, according to the testimonies of refugees."
"At the beginning of this month we found out that Son Jong Nam was tortured to death in a North Korean prison for spreading the gospel, the good news, to his fellow countrymen and women."
"What evidence is there of his crime: 20 bibles and 10 worship tapes?"
"It would appear that this is the thing that the North Korean authorities literally mortally fear."
"author. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is good that we have taken the opportunity today to discuss the situation in North Korea, a country that has shut itself off so comprehensively from the scrutiny of the rest of the world that only a few people know what is happening there and the people in this country essentially do not know what is happening in the rest of the world."
"I would like to focus on two things."
"The first is the human rights situation in North Korea, where people disappear off the streets and spend the rest of their lives in camps; where sometimes even a second generation of people spend their whole lives imprisoned in camps because their parents had allegedly committed crimes; where people are publicly executed and other people are obliged to watch these executions, and much more besides. We believe it is high time that the human rights situation in North Korea was investigated by an independent commission, as we have proposed in this joint report."
"There is a second point I would like to mention."
"It is ridiculously difficult to get out of this country, to escape."
"It ought to be one of the most fundamental human rights that should go without saying for people to be able to choose where to live and to move around freely."
"However, we currently have a situation where those who manage to leave North Korea are often not admitted into another country and many are sent back."
"Therefore, I would, in particular, like to urgently call on the EU embassies to take in people who manage to flee to these embassies and help them to get to safer countries and to find sufficient support there to start a new life."
"That is important when we consider the situation that these people are in."
"What is currently happening here is appalling."
"author. - Madam President, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is anything but democratic as it has one of the worst records on human rights violations in the world."
"Indeed, my personal meeting with civil society representatives on the Korean peninsula provided additional painful proof of the extremely disturbing and critical human rights violations in the country."
"I am deeply disappointed that the human rights situation in the DPRK has not improved but rather deteriorated since the last European Parliament resolution."
"Over 150 000 political prisoners are still detained in concentration camps, subjected to forced labour, tortured and deliberately starved."
"Moreover, I am shocked by the practice of guilt by association that results in the imprisonment of entire families, including children."
"Therefore the EU and its Member States must combine their efforts and put more diplomatic and political pressure on the DPRK Government to respect the human rights of its citizens."
"Let me finish with one thought."
"At the same time we must prevent bilateral and multilateral sanctions having a serious negative impact on the ordinary impoverished North Korean citizens already suffering from systematic starvation and oppression."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, it is very good that Parliament is taking an interest in the situation in North Korea, because it is a cause of the greatest anxiety in our societies."
"Recently we have been able to see sportsmen from North Korea playing at the FIFA World Cup."
"We were particularly impressed by their first match, when they played on equal terms in a hard-fought game against Brazil."
"In the following matches they did not do so well."
"Why am I talking about this sports event?"
"Well, there are reports that during North Korea's previous appearance in the World Cup finals 40 years ago, when the country's players achieved great success, their performance was not, however, satisfactory to the authorities of the Korean regime."
"Afterwards, the players met with repression, and they were held in forced labour camps."
"I draw attention to this fact so that we will also look at the situation now, and try to make sure that something similar does not happen."
"We need an appeal and pressure from the sports authorities about this, because they have certain possibilities of putting pressure on the Korean authorities to make sure that something similar does not happen this time."
"We are very worried about what is going to happen to these sportsmen next."
"The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has for many years been presented as the country with the worst violations of human rights."
"It is surely necessary to agree with the draft resolution on the points which call for a halt to public executions, abolition of the death penalty, a halt to torture and the release of political prisoners."
"On the other hand, the call to ensure access to food and humanitarian assistance for all citizens who need it is, in my opinion, hypocritical."
"It is a notorious fact that North Korea has long-term problems with ensuring sufficient quantities of foodstuffs, and unless I am mistaken, many countries in Africa and Asia have similar problems, and yet the European Parliament does not adopt similar calls to the governments of these countries."
"This does not alter the fact that there is a food shortage and that this shortage is an enormous problem in objective terms, causing malnourishment and related health problems among the citizens of the country."
"The situation is indisputably grave and I am not at all sure that a few draft measures in a resolution will bring significant improvements."
"The criticism made by the authors, who have used it against China, is a classic example of hypocritical buck-passing, and reveals the policy of double standards applied by the authors."
"There is a call for the countries of the European Union to accept refugees from North Korea, while at the same time the European Union applies readmission agreements against all of its southern neighbours."
"If this is not an example of double standards, then I really do not know what to call these hypocritical formulations."
"In the entire resolution there is no trace of an attempt to reduce tension and demilitarise the Korean peninsula, namely the necessary steps in the right direction."
"None of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left can vote for a resolution formulated in this way."
"author. - Madam President, first of all I would like to underline that there is broad agreement in this Parliament on the situation in North Korea."
"It was very easy to come to a joint resolution and, as you see, there are no amendments to this resolution, so we are united behind it."
"On the other hand, I would like to raise one point - which was also discussed in my group yesterday - that maybe using the urgencies procedure on such issues is not the best way because nothing really urgent has happened in North Korea."
"Maybe we deserve to have a bit more time to prepare a more comprehensive resolution and to debate a bit more on the possible recommendations and more complex solutions that we may offer."
"I do not want to repeat what has already been said in the resolution about the grave violations of human rights there."
"This is perhaps a country like no other in the world right now."
"I would like to underline, however, that of all those violations, the public executions where children are present are perhaps the most disgusting."
"I do not think we should put all these violations in any order, but this is really something very disgusting."
"Fortunately in our resolution we recognised that China has a role to play."
"The changes in China, including in the human rights area, may not be sufficient for us but are a good example and perhaps China can use its relations to promote some changes in North Korea."
"This should be one of the future topics of our discussions with China when we have our bilateral dialogue."
"Finally, allow me to say that appointing an EU Special Representative for North Korea could be a very good step towards being able to promote a more complex approach on this."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - Madam President, human trafficking in North Korea remains a serious problem."
"Reportedly 80% of North Koreans in China end up as trafficking victims."
"Women are particularly vulnerable to prostitution, rape, arranged marriages and bride traffickers."
"Many victims of trafficking are unable to speak Chinese and are held as virtual prisoners."
"The legal status of North Koreans and the Chinese Government's policy of detaining the refugees and sending them back to North Korea increase the refugees' vulnerability to trafficking for purposes of forced labour and sexual exploitation."
"They have no protection from the authorities in either China or North Korea, and there is little recognition of their plight from the international community."
"China must change its law to protect the victims of trafficking instead of returning them to North Korea."
"Finally, if people are killed, tortured and illegally imprisoned, it is a matter of urgency every day."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Madam President, it is almost common ground in this Parliament that the human rights situation in North Korea is dire."
"Therefore I will not expand on what other colleagues have said."
"The question really is, what can we do about it?"
"Just because North Korea has decided to be the Greta Garbo of the international community - 'we want to be alone' - it does not mean we should leave them alone."
"There are 24 million people in North Korea who need our assistance."
"In keeping with the spirit of the resolution, I would like to suggest four things that we could do."
"Firstly, we must continue to provide humanitarian aid, but we must make sure that aid goes to the people and does not in any way prop up the regime."
"Secondly, we should continue to increase our funding for NGOs that try to get assistance into North Korea and in particular those NGOs who try to get information into North Korea."
"Provision of a radio in a country where there is no information is actually a vital tool."
"Thirdly, we should ask Catherine Ashton to appoint a special representative to enter into dialogue with the Chinese, the Russians and the United Nations, to keep the pressure up on North Korea."
"Finally, we should do our best to assist refugees."
"As other colleagues have said, people flee North Korea and they are not given the assistance they deserve."
"Unfortunately, things are not as Mr Vigenin and Mr Martin have said."
"Unfortunately, it is not true that we in this Chamber are agreed on this matter, because a moment ago we heard from the Communist side that they have some reservations concerning our position."
"This is unfortunate, because it would seem that on this question we ought to be united."
"I come from a country which was ruled by Communism."
"As a young adult I witnessed what Communism is capable of, and I remember the hope with which we waited for the voice of the free world, the Western world."
"Sometimes we overestimated its significance, but we waited with great joy, hoping that someone would speak up for our rights, and I think that we as the free world should ensure that this voice is heard, today."
"Only for this we need, as Mr Häfner said, to ensure the existence of free media as well as access, at least, to these media in North Korea."
"We should strive for this, working of course with the United States, because only by cooperation of this kind will we be able to ensure that North Koreans have access to free media."
"This is something which we should guarantee."
"(DE) Madam President, we football fans are currently experiencing what is good about sport: team spirit, the joy of winning and, as yesterday evening, respect for the opposing team."
"However, there has also been the experience of footballers being made personally responsible for defeats."
"There is a persistent rumour that, following their early exit from the World Cup, the North Korean national players had to do forced labour - this is hopefully incorrect information."
"I call on the North Korean Government to explain the whereabouts of the footballers."
"The fact that we are concerned about them is hardly surprising given that this is a country where the state leadership punishes criticism, where ten thousand people are tortured and ill-treated and where innumerable people are malnourished."
"The EU must continue unabated the serious dialogue with the so-called Dear Leader of the People's Republic of Korea."
"It is time to put an end to forced labour and torture and abolish the death sentence and public executions."
"Even potential victories in football cannot mask the reality of the situation."
"North Korea is still lacking in all areas: human rights, chances of survival and respect for the individual."
"Madam President, such is the DPRK's isolation, we can only guess at the human rights violations that are actually taking place there."
"Occasional news leaks come out from defectors and the reality is truly horrific."
"Forced labour camps, kidnappings, arbitrary arrests and torture appear to be the hallmarks of Kim Jong-il's tyrannical regime."
"The death penalty is applied regularly with no regard to the rule of law."
"We all remain extremely concerned about North Korea."
"Not only because of the internal situation but because of all the country's bellicose and impulsive, even paranoid behaviour internationally."
"Regrettably Pyongyang has nuclear weapons and seeks collaboration with other nefarious regimes around the world, such as Iran."
"Also the recent sinking of a South Korean naval vessel was undoubtedly a deliberate attack by the North."
"In this respect, the PRC needs to assume its responsibility as a member of the UN Security Council by exerting pressure on North Korea."
"But I think a lasting improvement in the human rights situation in North Korea will only come about through regime change and democratisation and hopefully through eventual reunification with the democratic South."
"(PL) Madam President, I have a very difficult name and am used to the fact that people find it difficult to pronounce."
"History shows that in countries ruled by a totalitarian regime human rights violations are an everyday occurrence, but the situation in North Korea is appalling."
"The Government of the People's Republic of Korea denies the existence of the problem of human rights violations."
"This is, however, at complete variance with the eye-witness reports of refugees and defectors."
"There are labour camps which are places of torture, slave labour and hunger for the many thousands of Korean citizens who have dared criticise the totalitarian system or who are politically 'unsafe'."
"In Korea, a person is reduced to the rank of an object, without free will or without the ability to express it openly."
"We know, for example, of reports of married couples who were forced into divorcing because they belonged to different classes."
"Therefore, I appeal to all countries which have any kind of economic ties with North Korea to put pressure on the government there, to demonstrate that the world is not indifferent to the situation of many thousands of Koreans and that this will not remain a matter just for North Korea."
"(PL) Madam President, North Korea and Cuba are the last remnants of Communism in the world."
"Unfortunately, it is tragic that 20 years after the fall of that criminal system in Europe, there are countries where, in the name of that sick ideology, people are dying of hunger, are being tortured, are imprisoned or are forced to work in labour camps and concentration camps."
"The dream of many North Koreans is simply to flee their own country."
"As people of the free world, we are obliged - especially in relations with the People's Republic of China, because these relations are developing - to ensure that these refugees are not returned to the Korean authorities, because for them this means a severe prison sentence or simply death."
"I am concentrating on this aspect of our resolution, because I do not believe in the effectiveness of our Parliament's appeals or the appeals of the whole free world in putting a stop to the violations of human rights in North Korea."
"Therefore, since we cannot effectively bring about an improvement in the situation in Korea itself, let us do everything possible so that those who have managed to escape from that prison have the chance of a better life - even in China, which, of course, as a state is itself far from European standards of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights."
"However, life is better there than in North Korea."
"(RO) The human rights situation in North Korea is giving particularly grave cause for concern."
"The leadership in this country bans any form of political opposition, democratic elections, press and religious freedom."
"We cannot remain unmoved by the suffering of North Korea's inhabitants as they have no access to basic foods or humanitarian assistance."
"I am particularly concerned about the situation of women and children in North Korea as more than a third of them are suffering from malnutrition."
"According to reports, more than 150 000 North Koreans continue to be held in six labour camps."
"They are not given any kind of medical care and receive very little food."
"In fact, the currency reform of November 2009 has failed and led to a rise in the level of poverty among the population."
"I think that the European Union must give its support to setting up a UN committee of inquiry which will substantiate human rights violations in North Korea."
"(PL) Madam President, the United Nations and numerous non-governmental organisations continually report information to the international community about the repression which is being imposed on tens of thousands of North Koreans."
"Torture and sentences in forced labour camps, often because of political views, are an everyday occurrence there."
"A significant part of the population is suffering from malnutrition and a lack of suitable medical care, and the North Korean Government rejects all forms of cooperation with United Nations bodies, which makes it impossible for the people of North Korea to have access to any kind of international humanitarian aid."
"I think the European Parliament has a moral obligation to appeal to the authorities of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to end these practices as quickly as possible."
"In addition, in view of the huge influence of the People's Republic of China on policy in Pyongyang, the European Commission should raise these matters as part of the European Union's dialogue with China."
"In order to coordinate our action better it would be a good idea to appoint a European Union Special Representative for North Korea."
"(SK) The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is perhaps the last surviving relic of the Second World War."
"Ideological differences and power interests have divided the Korean nation into two states, whose leaders still compete over their rights and their philosophical view of the world."
"The north of the Korean peninsula has become an enormous ghetto, incarcerating millions of Koreans, who, under the militaristic administration of their regime, can only dream of a free life."
"The North Korean leadership, under the pretext that the country is in a state of war, continue to keep their citizens within this militaristic regime."
"How can we help the Koreans in this situation?"
"Through an active joint approach by the great powers."
"It was the great powers that divided Koreans, and they must therefore work together now to put consistent pressure on the North Korean leadership, including the threat of criminal prosecution for crimes against humanity, in order to free the North Korean people."
"(RO) There are so many human rights violations in North Korea that we cannot list them all."
"The most serious of these is possibly the starvation of the population and the differentiation made in the distribution of food between those who are close to the regime and government and those who are not."
"According to Amnesty International, last year roughly 9 million North Korean citizens, more than a third of the population, suffered from starvation."
"I also find deeply concerning the situation regarding collective punishments where sometimes up to three generations of a family are sent to prison systems dominated by brutality, torture, forced labour and public executions, as also mentioned by Mr Tannock."
"The majority of those sent to these camps are no longer released."
"If they have children, the latter can spend their whole life in captivity."
"I would like to end by saying that, although the North Korean Government agreed to participate in the Universal Periodic Review carried out by the United Nations Human Rights Council, it is terrible that it has so far not accepted any of the recommendations it has been given as part of this framework."
"(PL) Madam President, to this list of highly dramatic stories about North Korea we have to add one more item."
"I mean the nuclear blackmail which is being used by Kim Jong-il and which has, in a certain sense, paralysed the world."
"Although perhaps unwillingly, the West has rather often turned its attention away from events on the Korean peninsula."
"Therefore, we must talk specifically about the crimes which are being committed and renew our appeals."
"The international community must find a form of sanctions which will be felt as little as possible by the citizens of North Korea themselves."
"We must not, however, delude ourselves: all sanctions which strike at the regime inevitably leave their mark on society."
"Therefore, I think that currently the only effective measure may be cooperation with North Korea's closest neighbours, especially over aid for refugees, because only when we have specific knowledge about the situation under the Communist regime will we be able in the future to act effectively on behalf of people who currently do not have any choice at all."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to congratulate Parliament for undertaking this debate."
"If you allow me, I would like to recognise the young boy behind seat No 582, because the future of North Korea is relevant to the future of our children."
"It is very sad to record that in the past seven years, since the adoption of the first resolution in the UN context condemning the deplorable human rights situation in North Korea, very little if any progress towards improvement has been made."
"The Commission fully shares the concerns about the need to address the very serious human rights situation in the country, as expressed in the joint motion for a resolution we are debating today."
"The EU has been working towards such an improvement in the international context ever since 2003, when it initiated in the Geneva Commission on Human Rights the first resolution condemning the situation in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which as many have already mentioned is not very democratic."
"In addition, the EU continues to raise the issue of human rights in our bilateral political dialogue with North Korea."
"We are also raising it, as a number of speakers have pointed out, in our discussions with China, and specifically the issue of the forced return of North Korean citizens who entered China illegally."
"We will continue to do so."
"These people cannot simply be regarded as 'economic migrants'."
"So many of the elements incorporated in the motion for a resolution are already part of the EU's current human rights policy with regard to North Korea."
"We very much welcome the convergence of views among Members and between the Members of Parliament and the Commission."
"We fully agree on what needs to be done, including a point that has been made by many speakers that we need to maintain the existing programmes to assist the most vulnerable people in North Korea, who are facing tremendous hardship."
"We should not punish them for the sins of their leaders."
"We broadly agree on how to go about it but there are three specific points where the Commission holds somewhat different views - and I would like to explain what they are and why we have some differences."
"The first one is the proposal to include in the EU-South Korea Free Trade Agreement a clause to monitor North Korean workers active in the Kaesong Industrial Complex."
"The negotiated text for this free trade agreement provides for the possibility of designating outward processing zones."
"Both sides recognise that such zones could promote the goal of peace on the peninsula, but, before a zone can be recognised as such under the free trade agreement, it has to be proposed by one side and considered by a special committee of representatives of both sides."
"In the current political circumstances, it is unlikely that such a proposal is to be made in the short term, once the free trade agreement has entered into force."
"However, I would like to assure you that the Commission will pursue the ample opportunities to deal with this issue at a later stage."
"The second proposal contained in the motion for a resolution concerns the possible nomination of an EU special envoy to North Korea, and a number of speakers supported this proposal today."
"The EU is committed to stepping up its contribution to international coordination and the High Representative/Vice President is very seriously interested in pursuing that."
"She is, however, now considering all options to do it in the context of two things."
"One is the review of the mandate of all EU Special Representatives, and the second is the establishment of the External Action Service."
"It would be in this context that the High Representative/Vice President would pursue increased participation by the EU in international coordination."
"The third point is a proposal to press for the establishment of a Commission of Inquiry at the UN."
"The European Commission deeply appreciates the rationale of this proposal in the motion for a resolution."
"At the same time, we believe it would be prudent at this stage to put all our efforts into supporting the mandate of the new, recently appointed UN Special Rapporteur for Human Rights in North Korea, Mr Marzuki Darusman, who has been empowered by the UN Human Rights Council to pursue the matter of human rights in North Korea."
"With this in mind, we need to ensure that he has all the back-up to do his job."
"From the Commission's position, we see this today as the better course in front of us."
"(Applause)"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place shortly."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - (RO) The situation regarding human rights and humanitarian aid in North Korea remains a delicate subject of concern to the European Union as an international player which promotes human rights globally."
"On the other hand, at the United Nations, the resolution of 25 March 2010 expressed concern about the serious violation of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea."
"It is regrettable that the North Korean Government has taken the decision to refuse to cooperate with the UN via the mechanisms for promoting human rights, including the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in North Korea."
"It is the EU's duty to urge North Korea to respect human rights."
"The EU must also act independently to help the population of this country, through continuing the humanitarian aid programmes, maintaining communication channels inside North Korea and granting asylum to North Korean refugees who have arrived in Member States."
"Appointing a European Union Special Representative for North Korea would allow us to monitor the human rights situation more closely in this country and ensure better coordination of the responses from Member States to this issue."

"A spill from a reservoir containing highly toxic red sludge cost the lives of at least three people."
"Many hundreds have been injured."
"On behalf of the European Parliament, I would like to express our solidarity with the families of those who have died and with those who have suffered."
"Ladies and gentlemen, fellow Members, tomorrow is an important anniversary - the fourth anniversary of the assassination of Anna Politkovskaya."
"We remember that she devoted her life to uncovering the truth about the situation in the North Caucasus."
"We know how important independent journalism is in every society."
"We honoured Mrs Politkovskaya's determination in the fight for freedom of speech and the press by giving her name to one of the rooms in our press centre in Brussels."
"While remembering her sacrifice, we do not forget, either, the sacrifice made by others: Natalia Estemirova, Anastasia Baburova, human rights lawyers, Stanislav Markelov and Sergei Magnitsky, and many others."
"Those responsible for their deaths have still not been apprehended."
"We encourage the Russian authorities to demonstrate full commitment to ensuring the rule of law and to bringing an end to the climate of lawlessness and impunity in the region of the North Caucasus."
"(Applause)"
"On 10 October, we will observe World day against the death penalty."
"I reiterate the appeal of the European Parliament for a moratorium on the use of the death penalty to be introduced in all countries of the world."
"Death can never be an act of justice."
"We welcome the changes in this respect in such countries as Russia, Burundi and Togo, but, unfortunately, death sentences are still being carried out in Japan and the US."
"We believe that public debate in these democratic countries can contribute to a change in this situation."
"However, we are concerned most of all by the number of death sentences being carried out in countries such as China and Iran."
"We appeal to the governments and to the authorities of these countries to stop using practices of this kind."

"By agreement with the political groups, I would like to inform the House of proposals to make the following changes:"
"(The majority of the political groups and, in some cases, even the decided majority, was in favour of these changes)"
"Wednesday"
"Addition to the agenda of a new item: statements of the Council and the Commission on the social provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon, after the joint debate on biodiversity."
"Withdrawal from the agenda of the oral question on containers lost at sea and compensation."
"Thursday"
"Voting time will begin at 11.30."
"Withdrawal from the agenda of the vote on the report by Mr Maňka on the draft amending budget No 2/2010, part 2, because the Council has not adopted a position on this matter, and so the debate cannot be held."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, the EPP always welcomes good and thorough discussions on social topics during our plenary sittings, but they have to be well prepared."
"That was the reason why it was initially decided by a majority decision in the Conference of Presidents that the proposal from the Social Democratic group to discuss services of general interest in the Lisbon agenda and public services in the Lisbon Treaty be discussed first in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"We are in favour of this because it is a very complicated topic."
"I understand that the title has changed and that the Liberals have changed their position, but the substance is still very complicated and we still want this to be discussed first in the Committee on Employment, because it is a very important and complicated discussion."
"We do not want to oppose it, but this is the reason why we will abstain in the vote on this topic."
"Thank you, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, for your explanation."
"This means that this item is entered on the agenda, but that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) has abstained from voting."
"The majority of the other political groups wanted this item to be included in the agenda."
"(The order of business was thus established)"
"(The sitting was suspended for a few minutes)"
"Formal sitting - Timor-Oriental"
"Welcome to the European Parliament, Mr President."
"Welcome once again after 18 years."
"President of the Democratic Republic of Timor Leste. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will start by remarks in English, and then I will switch to Portuguese, and then back to English."
"I would be able to address you in five of the European languages, but I will not do that because I will get confused myself, so I will stick to two: English and Portuguese."
"I am grateful for the privilege to address this august institution, the embodiment of Europe's rich cultural diversity and its democratic political culture and institutions."
"My admiration for Europe and for the institutions you have created, for the road you have walked from disunity, rivalries and wars to unity, partnership and peace, democracy, inclusion and prosperity, as well as for your deep belief in solidarity among peoples, led me as a Nobel Peace Prize Laureate in 2008 to nominate the European Union and the European Commission for the Nobel Peace Prize."
"At one end of the globe, there is the overwhelming influence and shadow of the only surviving superpower."
"At the other end, there is Asia, with the shadow of two emerging Asian giants looming over the rest of the region."
"In between, there can be the European bridge - a bridge that could connect all in a new partnership for peace and prosperity."
"This Europe of inclusion extends from the beautiful Atlantic coast that bathes Portugal to the edges of the old continent where Asia begins."
"As I speak here, I am particularly grateful to this august institution, to many of its esteemed Members, to the European Commission and, in particular, to its President, our friend José Manuel Durão Barroso, who has stood behind us for over three decades in our long quest for freedom."
"As a young politician and diplomat, first as Secretary of State, then as Foreign Minister and later as Prime Minister of Portugal, he was a wise and passionate advocate for Timor Leste, as he was also for Africa, Asia and Latin America."
"But I would fail in my duty if I were not to thank the many other Members of the European Parliament, some of whom are no longer here because of the irreversible ageing process from which none of us can escape."
"What we found in this institution from all spectrums, from left and from right, was that you gave us a forum when nowhere else gave us a voice to speak."
"It was, for instance, the Portuguese Members of the European Parliament from all parties who, in the 1990s, gave a portion of their own salaries to the person who is today our Foreign Minister, Dr Zacarias da Costa."
"He was here for five years as a representative of the Timorese resistance, and it was the Portuguese Members of the European Parliament from left and right who every month would give us some financial assistance to keep an office going here in Brussels."
"It was also this institution that gave us for the first time anywhere in the world a pass, an identity card, representing Timor Leste in Parliament to advocate the cause of Timor Leste."
"So, in coming back here, I come with an immense sense of gratitude to all of you."
"Allow me to turn now to Portuguese, and I will address the issue of the Millennium Development Goals, how we are doing in my country, and what we expect the international community to do to assist us and others."
"(PT) Timor Leste was not an independent country in 2000 and only when we submitted our first report on the Millennium Development Goals in 2004 did we set the first targets to be achieved."
"In the last three years, Timor Leste has been truly living in peace, which has enabled robust economic growth of more than 12% per annum; a 9% reduction in poverty levels over the last two years; a reduction in infant mortality and mortality in children younger than five years of age, with the targets set for 2015 even being hit already; school enrolment increased from 65% in 2007 to 83% in 2009-2010; and adult illiteracy is being gradually eliminated thanks to a joint programme between Timor Leste and Cuba."
"We anticipate the eradication of illiteracy in Timor Leste within two or three years from now."
"Around 30% of the country's budget is being allocated to public health and education."
"This turnaround is the result of aggressive public financing of social programmes such as direct money transfers to older people, widows, the disabled and veterans, as well as determined efforts in expanding cultivated areas and increasing food production."
"We are finalising the road map for our 2010-2030 strategic development plan, which will enable us to free our people from centuries of poverty and increase their standard of living to upper middle class level by 2030."
"Regarding the management of our oil resources, I am pleased to be able to note that in its report of 1 July 2010, the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative classified Timor Leste first in Asia and third in the world as regards the strength, transparency and effectiveness of management of the profits from gas and oil."
"Around 30% of the members of our Parliament are women."
"In the executive, we have female heads of key ministries such as Finance, Justice, Social Solidarity, etc., and a female Public Prosecutor of the Republic."
"We have a permanent Youth Parliament, with 130 members who have just been elected across the country."
"The young people elected to this Parliament are aged between 12 and 17."
"We always wanted there to be a gender balance in the Youth Parliament. Nevertheless, our expectations were exceeded: the Youth Parliament is made up of 68 female members and 62 male."
"Timor Leste is proud to have adopted one of the humanistic constitutions in the world, in which the death penalty is banned and the maximum prison sentence is 25 years: we do not have life sentences."
"We have ratified all the main international human rights treaties."
"We have already submitted two reports on the treaties to the relevant institutions, and we will continue to invest our efforts in even further reinforcing respect for human rights, for freedom and for dignity for all."
"Our constitution recognises the primacy of international law over national laws; in other words, our laws must be in line with international law."
"With your permission, I will now switch to English."
"I will now address the issue of climate change - obviously, very superficially, because of the time constraints here."
"While it is a fact that the rich and powerful contributed most to the deteriorating world environment, we acknowledge that the advance of science, technology and industries in the last 200 years has brought enormous benefits to all, even if those benefits have been distributed in an unequal manner."
"But we in the developing world should not put all the blame on the rich and powerful for the harm done to the planet."
"We must acknowledge our share of responsibility in the destruction of our forests, lakes, rivers and seas."
"Asia has no less responsibility than the US and Europe to reverse the climate calamity."
"We are almost half of the planet's inhabitants."
"This alone means that we put enormous pressure on the land, minerals, forests and water."
"To modernise our economies and improve the lives of hundreds of millions of the poor in Asia, we are using increasingly more energy extracted from planet Earth."
"Many of the emerging powers of Asia are also now crossing oceans, searching for energy elsewhere - in Africa and Latin America."
"Therefore, Timor Leste - working together with the Maldives, two of the smallest countries in Asia - calls for an Asian common agenda on sustainable development anchored on environmental protection and recovery, on land and water management, health and education for all, and on the elimination of poverty and illiteracy."
"I have an appeal to the rich and the powerful."
"The rich and the powerful should ask themselves whether they have delivered on the pledges made in front of TV cameras and whether past policies have been effective in addressing underdevelopment and extreme poverty."
"All too often, leaders of the developing countries are blamed for the lack of improvements in the lives of our people, in spite of the generous development assistance we supposedly have received from the rich."
"But donors should also make an honest and critical analysis of the policies."
"We know there is a genuine sentiment of solidarity from men and women in the streets - in the US, Europe and Japan - towards their fellow human beings in poorer regions of the world, but donors must also streamline the lengthy, onerous, superfluous, wasteful, redundant and bureaucratic paperwork that drowns and discourages anyone in our countries."
"(Applause)"
"Donors must invest more of every dollar they pledge in rural development, agriculture, food security, water and sanitation, roads, health and education."
"To strengthen national institutions and the democratically elected leaders, donors must provide more direct sectoral budget support to enable them to deliver services and development to the people."
"It is disheartening that only a handful of rich countries have met the target of 0.7% of gross national product for development assistance."
"At the same time, generous pledges made in the spotlight of international conferences - side by side with movie stars and rock singers - are largely forgotten the moment the Hollywood curtains fall and the floodlights are turned off."
"It is even more disheartening to see how quickly tens of billions of dollars are easily found to rescue failed banks, insurance companies, fraudulent real estate agencies and obsolete auto industries, and how tens of millions of dollars in bonuses are paid to incompetents and crooks responsible for the financial debacle - and yet decades of appeals to the rich to increase foreign development assistance have been met with much resistance."
"We believe that one wise and fair way to assist countries suffering from the consequences of the financial meltdown is to write off the debt owed by the LDCs and Small Island Developing States and to restructure the debt of the debtor countries that are facing enormous internal and external challenges - such as instability, climate change and extremism - in many parts of the world, particularly in South Asia and the region of the Great Lakes of Africa."
"Timor Leste is privileged in that we do not have a single cent in foreign debt, so our appeal to you is not motivated by self-interest."
"Actually if you open the economies yearbook of 2010 - the pocketbook version - you will find some interesting data there."
"Timor Leste today has the highest surplus in the world as a percentage of its GDP and not a single cent in foreign debt."
"Nevertheless, we feel in solidarity with those countries that for decades have incurred debt which they are today unable to pay and which entraps hundreds of millions of people in the world."
"If it has been possible to mobilise billions of dollars almost overnight to rescue failed banks and insurance companies, then there must also be the moral obligation and political wisdom to find the much smaller amount to meet the obligations of the developed countries towards the poor in the third world, to ratify some of the imbalances that are pervasive in the world today."
"As I speak here today with a deep sense of gratitude to you - to the European Parliament, to European leaders and to all our development partners - I wish with humility also to acknowledge our own failings and our limitations."
"We in Timor Leste, and in much of the developing world, should not reverse roles by lecturing the West - in retribution for the West having lectured us for decades - but should also look at ourselves in the mirror and answer our own questions from our conscience."
"What have we ourselves done to lift the hundreds of millions of our people from extreme poverty?"
"We can do that."
"We can all do better, in Timor Leste and elsewhere."
"We have made tremendous progress in the last three years."
"Our country has only been independent for eight years."
"I have shared some of the figures with you, but there are many other areas of achievement that are not quantifiable."
"They are not measurable, but they are equally important."
"We have been able to heal the wounds of our society, reconcile separate communities and heal the wounds between us and Indonesia with which we share a tragic history of 24 years. Today, Timor Leste and Indonesia enjoy the best possible relationship of any two neighbours."
"We have been able to build bridges with the entire region."
"We have established diplomatic relations with more than 100 countries."
"These are non-quantifiable, non-measurable achievements."
"Our people, in spite of the profound wounds of 24 years of occupation, do not harbour resentment towards anyone."
"These are our beliefs and our convictions."
"We are determined to live up to the expectations of our people and lead them towards a peaceful and prosperous future."
"May God, the Almighty and the merciful, bless us all."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you very much, Mr President."
"Eighteen years ago, as leader of the opposition in East Timor, you showed great courage and great vision."
"Today, you are the President of a free, democratic, independent country."
"Congratulations to you, Mr President, and all the best to your country and your people."
"Thank you for your speech."
"(Applause)"
"World day against the death penalty (debate)"
"The next item is the Council statement, on behalf of the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, on the World day against the death penalty."
"Before giving the floor to Mr Chastel, I will read an excerpt from a letter addressed to MEPs by the children of Sakineh."
"This was sent to me through AKI International specifically to coincide with the debate on the World day against the death penalty."
"Here is the extract: 'We would like to thank you for your efforts and the attention that you have given to the case of our mother Sakineh."
"We would first like to ask for your moral support."
"Our only hope remains the international community and, for this reason, we would like to ask the European Parliament to intervene in a decisive fashion with all the instruments that it has available to it, to help our mother."
"We beg you not to abandon us and to listen to our request for help."
"Lastly, in the hope that primitive punishments, such as stoning and hanging, will be eliminated for ever throughout the world, we send you our warmest greetings.'"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as the President has just said, I speak before this House on the World Day and also the European Day against the Death Penalty on behalf of the high representative, Baroness Ashton."
"As you know, the picture of the use of the death penalty in the world is still a mixed one."
"On the one hand, the vast majority of states today are in favour of its abolition, either in law or in practice, and it is encouraging to see that the number of such states continues to grow."
"Indeed, we are seeing a strong tendency towards abolition and the restriction of capital punishment in most countries."
"On the other hand, the number of executions and the procedures in place for using the death penalty around the world are unfortunately alarming: the 5 679 executions reported in 2009 were 5 679 executions too many."
"And with 58 countries and territories still using the death penalty, our work is far from finished."
"Furthermore, we all know that wherever capital punishment remains in force, there are serious problems with regard to respect for international rules and standards, especially with regard to limiting the death penalty to the most serious crimes, excluding juvenile delinquents from its scope of application and guaranteeing a fair trial."
"The conclusion is clear: there is no room for complacency in the matter."
"Therefore, we must use every available means, including diplomatic channels and public awareness, to achieve our goal, and that is why the High Representative has made the European Union's action for the abolition of the death penalty a personal priority."
"What does this mean in practice?"
"The future European External Action Service will undoubtedly be able to rely on the fact that the European Union is already today the leading institution in the fight against the death penalty, but the service will also stand as our best opportunity for fulfilling our potential."
"It will notably strengthen our ability to speak as one, giving us the opportunity to engage and bring together all the instruments available in Europe for the fight against the death penalty."
"Moreover, the European Union is also continuing to improve the way that it joins forces with other international and multilateral organisations that work for the abolition of the death penalty."
"The resolution calling for a moratorium on the use of the death penalty under the 65th United Nations General Assembly this autumn should reflect progress towards universal abolition."
"It should reinforce and extend the tendency towards abolition that we are seeing in every region of the world."
"Close cooperation between the European Union and the Council of Europe is another asset in our fight against the death penalty."
"In this regard, and as a very specific example, we are going to join our efforts to encourage Belarus to abolish the death penalty, especially by organising joint events in Minsk during this World Day."
"Ladies and gentlemen, because we fundamentally believe that the abolition of the death penalty is essential to the protection of human dignity and to respect for human rights, we oppose the use of capital punishment in all cases and under all circumstances, and we will continue to call for its universal abolition."
"Universal abolition is, and will continue to be, a key priority of our external action on human rights and so I reaffirm here, on behalf of Baroness Ashton, our determination to keep the European Union at the fore in the fight for the universal abolition of capital punishment."
"I must clarify that, on the basis of a proposal from the Conference of Presidents, a debate will take place with only one speaker per political group."
"Therefore, it will not be possible to take the floor under the catch-the-eye procedure."
"This is a shame, because the debate is very important."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - Madam President, the European Union is based on values and the respect for human rights, which need to be continuously defended and protected worldwide."
"The right to life lies in the very foundation of them."
"The World day against the death penalty reminds us that there are still countries in the world that continue in the practice of capital punishment."
"It is the reason why we need to continue in our efforts and step up the struggle against this practice."
"Robust opposition by the EU against the death penalty puts us in the forefront of this struggle."
"Since the European Parliament is the first EU institution to engage in this effort, it is our duty to influence other states in order to reach a universal abolition."
"For the European People's Party, the fight against the death penalty worldwide is a key priority of our external human rights policy."
"The EU should continuously raise awareness on this issue and support initiatives which could lead to universal abolition."
"Saying that, I would also like to call on the High Representative, the Commission and the Member States to keep encouraging the countries that have not ratified the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to do so."
"Those Member States that did not ratify Protocol 13 to the European Convention on Human Rights should do this as well."
"I regret to say that Belarus is the only country in Europe which still applies the death penalty in practice."
"We should make every effort to change this situation."
"Equally, the EU should constantly raise awareness on the abolition of the death penalty, both in bilateral negotiations and in international fora."
"In conclusion, the EU has to be an inspiration to the rest of the world."
"Only a few days before the World day against the death penalty seems like the right time to reaffirm this as our position."
"Belarus, China, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Sudan: what do these countries have in common as regards respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms?"
"They continue to share a primitive and abominable practice: the death penalty."
"Some countries use this barbarous method in secret, without even making their statistics on capital punishment public, such as China, Egypt, Iran, Malaysia, Sudan, Thailand and Vietnam."
"Only one Member State of the European Union still retains national legislation permitting the death penalty for certain crimes under exceptional circumstances, and in this resolution, Parliament is calling on Latvia to take urgent steps to repeal this legislation."
"It is Parliament's view that the European Union should make use of every opportunity to promote abolition of the death penalty, in particular, at bilateral and multilateral summits and meetings, and especially at the United Nations; when negotiating international agreements during official visits; or during dialogue with third countries within the framework of external action, cooperation and financial assistance policies."
"It is important for the Member States of the European Union to strive for the application of the Resolution of the United Nations General Assembly on the universal moratorium."
"The High Representative, Baroness Ashton, should instruct the European External Action Service to actively promote the universal abolition of the death penalty."
"There is still a long way to go."
"Despite everything, today there are already 154 countries that have abolished the death penalty in law or in practice."
"European Union delegations must include an adequate number of officials specialised in human rights and dedicated to pursuing the universal abolition of the death penalty."
"I call on the High Representative to promote a system for identifying all EU citizens sentenced to death in any country of the world and to mobilise all efforts to save them from execution."
"As regards the EU's domestic policy in this area, Parliament hopes that the review of European Union directives on the death penalty planned for next year will be brought about quickly."
"Externally, the Union must not just comply with its obligation under the Charter of Fundamental Rights to ensure that no one is deported or extradited to a country in which they run the risk of being subjected to the death penalty, but must also make sure that no information sent to third countries within the framework of international agreements on data exchange puts anyone at risk of being sentenced to death."
"In this resolution, the European Parliament makes clear its disgust at the most brutal forms of carrying out this type of punishment, such as stoning."
"This resolution includes the names of some men and women who are on death row in their countries: may the light of civilisation and compassion save their lives."
"This House therefore calls on the Commission to use every means to act and save them."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, it gives me great pride that the European Union, as a community of values where the death penalty is abolished, is strongly committed to act as a global player on the abolition of the death penalty everywhere."
"In negotiations with candidate Member States and in our dialogues with other countries, whether it is the United States or whether it is Iran, we consistently push for the abolition, de jure or de facto, of this most inhumane punishment."
"The impact of the death penalty in preventing crime is not even proven."
"Therefore, its practice is even more contested."
"While there should not be impunity for the most serious crimes, the death penalty in and of itself constitutes a human rights violation according to the right to life, as declared in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
"We believe in prosecuting crimes under international law, but always under fair trial and with due process."
"Too often, this is not the case and, in any case, the United Nations has established that drug-related crimes do not qualify as the most serious crimes."
"The United Nations has also spoken out in favour of a moratorium on the death penalty, and this is an important statement."
"At the same time, the UN is struggling for its credibility when Iran is among the members of the Women's Rights Council."
"The EU should still speak with one voice and operate more strategically when it comes to addressing important human rights topics, such as the abolition of the death penalty."
"Today, the China-EU cultural summit is taking place here in Brussels as we speak."
"This important step should be applauded, but at the same time, we cannot overlook the fact that China holds the record for the highest number of death penalties, the true number of which we do not even know, due to a lack of transparency and the fact that certain people are qualified as non-people."
"China is beaten only by Iran when it comes to the execution of juveniles, and killing children cannot be justified under any circumstances."
"A celebration of culture reminds us of the essential freedom of expression, but too many people across the world are subject to the death penalty and a fear thereof as a result of the words that they have expressed."
"The EU should also step up its responsibilities in providing shelter for people from countries that practise the death penalty."
"The Shelter Cities programme should become operational as soon as possible."
"Madam President, the annual anti-death penalty resolution really is a very impressive example of how much the EU is doing and has done in the struggle to get the death penalty abolished worldwide."
"Granted, there are still too many executions - a great many executions - as the representative of the Commission Vice-President has stated."
"We should not forget, however, that the global fight against the death penalty is a success story."
"There are now only 43 countries that impose the death penalty."
"At international level, the EU is one of the most important active players driving this fight forward and also including it in all bilateral relationships, and we cannot afford to scale back our efforts."
"Perhaps we should give some consideration to acting in a more targeted way, because different countries and different governments are structured differently and we may need to apply differentiated strategies."
"It will be different in Japan, where top politicians are fighting elections and use the death penalty as often as possible."
"We need a different strategy there to the one we adopt in Iran or Belarus."
"We may have to proceed one step at a time; for example, by narrowing the circle of those on whom the death penalty may be imposed so as to exclude minors and those with learning difficulties, or by limiting the range of crimes for which the death penalty may be imposed."
"In China, for example, people can still be executed for what is purely a crime against property."
"These could be steps along the way to our real goal, which is to abolish the death penalty completely."
"The EU needs to be somewhat more sophisticated in its approach."
"What we cannot do, on any account, even if we take a different approach with different countries, is apply different standards and make different demands of those countries that still have the death penalty."
"This year's anti-death penalty resolution has a particular focus, which is the US."
"As an example, I would like to present one case to you here."
"This is the case of Mumia Abu-Jamal, who has been on death row for over 20 years."
"He is not rich, he is an African American, and at the time of the offence, he was a journalist whose thoughts and writings were politically radical."
"Justified doubts and shortcomings have been brought to light concerning his trial."
"In this case, I am asking the EU to do everything it can and to use every means at its disposal to ensure that the death penalty is not enforced and that he gets a fair trial."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, whilst I rise under the umbrella of the ECR Group, my comments are entirely based upon my personal convictions."
"I welcome the debate that is taking place in this House today, as it is quite clearly a display of our commitment to a fundamental value of our Union."
"Last year, at least 714 people were executed by states."
"This excludes China, as it will not provide transparency on the issue."
"Many of the states that still have the death penalty as a punishment tool do not have the mechanism to deliver fair trials to those that they accuse of capital punishment crimes."
"The distinction between those countries that have capital punishment and use it, and those that retain the power but do not actually carry out the death penalty, is not as dramatic as one would first assume."
"The figure I stated earlier does not include all those who sit waiting to see what their fate may be, many of whom are actually innocent and have been denied the possibility of a fair trial."
"So, whilst we have this debate, it is a very personal one."
"It is not just about those who are facing conviction and the death penalty but, along with them, all the many others that are affected, their families and so many other people in society, simply because those people face execution without any opportunity of a fair trial."
"We should concentrate on addressing those cases as well."
"Madam President, the motion for a resolution that we are debating today sets out our categorical opposition to the death penalty."
"There are simply no excuses for States coldly and deliberately exterminating defenceless people in their charge."
"The death penalty is therefore a crime in itself."
"It is often more than that, however."
"When people who have been sentenced to death are waiting for years in wretched conditions, the death penalty is also a form of torture."
"When the death penalty is used to make people frightened to rise up against oppression and dictatorship, as we have seen in Iran, for example, the death penalty is also a form of terrorism."
"As Mrs Lochbihler quite rightly said, the African-American journalist Mumia Abu-Jamal is today a symbol in the fight for the abolition of the death penalty - 'the voice of the voiceless', as he was called when he was charged with the murder of a white police officer in 1981 and sentenced to death."
"For nearly 30 years, this man has been sitting on death row following a trial characterised by errors and shortcomings and with racist undertones."
"It is therefore also fitting for the motion for a resolution to highlight the case of Mumia Abu-Jamal as one of the specific cases on which to focus in the coming period, among other things, by representatives of the EU taking up the case with the US authorities, the US administration and, of course, the US President too."
"This example is no less important because it comes from the United States, which is, of course, the EU's ally in many areas - in fact, it is perhaps more important, because in the fight against the death penalty, there is no room for double standards."
"In the fight against the death penalty, only one standard applies: an unconditional 'no' to the death penalty."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we all agree on the fact that Europe must use its moral and political influence to further the cause of abolishing the death penalty."
"If, however, we are not to remain at the stage of abstract declarations of principle, the European Union really must start using the specific instruments at its disposal."
"For example, Europe must remember that many third countries that still apply the death penalty in the most brutal and barbaric ways are countries with which the Union has concluded lucrative economic and trade agreements. Above all, Europe must remind these countries that, by signing such agreements, they have committed themselves to respecting minimum standards of fundamental rights."
"This requirement is routinely ignored, while Europe looks the other way."
"Let us then begin to speak clearly about the death penalty with China, Egypt, India, Pakistan, Yemen, Bangladesh, and so on, forcing these countries to honour the undertakings they have assumed in terms of respect for human dignity."
"So far, Europe has only preached."
"We can only hope that it begins to put its words into action as soon as possible, something that it has unfortunately not yet succeeded in doing in many cases."
"(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, for the eighth World day against the death penalty, I have a thought for all those who have not been spared death: for the 200 000 innocent unborn children we get rid of every year in France; for Natasha Mougel, the young 29-year-old woman murdered a few weeks ago, stabbed with a screwdriver by a repeat offender; for the four year-old child whose throat was cut a few days ago near my home in Meyzieu; for the elderly gentleman stabbed in Roquebrune in January by a man who had already been prosecuted for knife attacks; for the six to seven hundred innocent people killed each year in France and the many thousands of others in Europe and across the world; for Marie-Christine Hodeau, Nelly Cremel, Anne-Lorraine Schmitt and so many like them, whose only crime was to one day cross the path of a criminal freed by the law after committing a first terrible crime; for the victims of all the likes of Dutroux, Evrard and Fourniret, whose lives have been wrecked forever if not lost; for those who were killed in London, Madrid and elsewhere, victims of blind terrorism."
"I think of them because no one organises a world day for the victims, but they do organise days for their executioners, who often do indeed deserve death."
"In a state governed by the rule of law, and only in such a state, the death penalty is not a state crime."
"It helps protect society and citizens against criminals for whom it is sometimes the only means of redemption."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I can only thank you for your interventions as almost all of them back up our actions."
"It is clear to me that we agree on the importance the European Union must attach to this action for the abolition of the death penalty."
"As I said earlier, and as I repeat once again, the High Representative, Baroness Ashton, has made this a personal priority."
"We sincerely hope that with its partners, the European Union will draw a satisfactory result, as I have already said, from the 65th United Nations General Assembly with a resolution that will further strengthen the move for a universal moratorium."
"Because we fundamentally believe that the abolition of the death penalty is essential to the protection of human dignity and to respect for human rights, we oppose the use of capital punishment in all cases and, I repeat, under all circumstances, and we will continue to call for its universal abolition."
"As I said earlier, the conclusion in the matter is clear: there is no room for complacency and therefore, we will use every available means to achieve our goal."
"I have received five motions for resolutionstabled in accordance with Rule 110(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 7 October 2010."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The death penalty infringes man's fundamental right to life and there is no justification for it."
"Various studies have shown that the death penalty has no impact on violent crime trends."
"This is why I wish to stress that Europe and the whole world must take uniform action aimed at the universal abolition of the death penalty in states where it is still frequently applied, as well as against its reintroduction."
"As of the end of 2009, governments in 43 countries, retain this measure, including one in Europe."
"The reality of this situation should give us food for thought."
"We have the clout to persuade governments and citizens globally to stop using this act of torture, which is unacceptable to states that respect human rights."
"This is a priority objective and can only be achieved through close cooperation between states, raising awareness and education."
"I welcome the European Parliament's resolution on World day against the death penalty, emphasising that total abolition of the death penalty remains one of the European Union's main human rights objectives."
"in writing. - The death penalty is the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment."
"Indeed, let us not forget that the death penalty affects, first and foremost, underprivileged people."
"I am opposed to the death penalty in all cases and under all circumstances and would like to emphasise that abolition of the death penalty contributes to the enhancement of human dignity and the progressive development of human rights."
"This resolution was timed to coincide with the European and World day against the death penalty, which are both on 10 October."
"The EU is the leading institutional actor and lead donor in the fight against the death penalty worldwide and its action in this area represent a key priority of its external human rights policy."
"In the United Nations, the EU has successfully sponsored from 1997 a yearly resolution at the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) calling for abolition and, in the meantime, to establish a moratorium on the use of the death penalty."
"I urge the EU institutions to redouble efforts and use all tools of diplomacy and cooperation assistance available to them to work towards the abolition of the death penalty"
"The death penalty is an irreversible, inhuman punishment that breaches human rights."
"It is cruel and demeaning, and a punishment to which an innocent person can be sentenced."
"The death penalty has not been proven to prevent or reduce crime significantly."
"It is most regrettable that it is still in use in 43 countries."
"Prohibition of the death penalty is one of the priority areas of EU human rights policy."
"I am glad that on this day, the World day against the death penalty, the European Parliament is taking a tough stand against capital punishment, which should be banned everywhere in the world."
"It cannot be regarded as proper justice in any circumstances."
"Thank you."
"in writing. - As we mark the World Day and the European Day Against the Death Penalty, I recall that this Parliament stands united in its opposition to the death penalty."
"This is because capital punishment erodes basic human dignity and contradicts international human rights law."
"Studies show that there is no evidence that the death penalty has a significant deterrent effect on crime, while it does disproportionately affect underprivileged citizens."
"Despite these facts, there are over 20 000 people around the globe on death row; dozens of them are European nationals."
"From this Parliament, we must continue to oppose executions in all circumstances and support an unconditional international moratorium on capital punishment."
"We also need to encourage states to provide accurate and official statistics on their use of the death penalty."
"Under our treaties, Parliament must give its consent to international agreements with third countries."
"We should keep in mind the stance of these countries on capital punishment when we do so."
"in writing. - The World day against the death penalty is an important cause that reminds us of the unfortunate fact that 43 countries worldwide still retain capital punishment."
"I agree wholeheartedly with President Jerzy Buzek, who stated at the opening of the plenary session that death can never ever be considered an act of justice."
"I welcome the European Parliament resolution reiterating the commitment of the European Union to the abolition of the death penalty everywhere and calling upon the countries applying the death penalty to declare an immediate moratorium on executions."
"However, I would like to see the wordy commitment reflected more concretely in the actual policies of the European Union and its Member States towards third countries."
"Highlighting the importance of the matter on 10 October every year is worthwhile, but we must go further than this in order to see some real progress."
"The European Union must act in a coherent manner and have the abolition of the death penalty on the agenda as an actual priority item in order to live up to its image as a torchbearer of human rights and human dignity."
"Currently, 43 countries use the death penalty."
"Most death sentences are carried out in China, Iran and Iraq."
"China alone accounts for 5 000 death sentences or 88% of all executions in the world."
"There are also EU Member States where the majority of citizens are in favour of the death penalty."
"There are even more countries like this in the world at large."
"The main argument is that such a punishment apparently deters potential criminals and reduces crime."
"However, the statistics tell a different story."
"I agree with this resolution because I believe that the instruments of the death penalty belong in a museum."
"The strong calls on Belarus - the last country in Europe using the death penalty - to abolish it at the earliest opportunity are justifiable."
"There, execution still remains a state secret."
"Relatives of those sentenced to death do not know whether or not the condemned are still alive, because the bodies of those executed are not returned to their parents or children."
"Although the campaign against the death penalty is already one of the European Union's human rights priorities, creating the new European External Action Service offers a good opportunity for us to restate the importance we attach to this issue at EU level."
"To be able to conduct an effective campaign, it is important for us to differentiate between, on the one hand, the progress made in certain countries and, on the other, the critical situation elsewhere."
"Therefore, although we are concerned that the death penalty continues to be applied in the US, we must acknowledge that there has been a 60% drop in the number of executions in the United States during the last decade."
"On the other hand, we must strongly condemn the Chinese Government which has executed more people in 2009 than the rest of the world put together."
"I absolutely deplore the fact that, after not having had, for the first time in modern history, a single person condemned to death in Europe in 2009, the Belarusian authorities have condemned two people to death and are likely to execute them during this year."
"In conclusion, I believe, as does President Buzek, that the death penalty cannot be regarded, under any circumstance, as an act of justice."
"Use of the death penalty is based on the mistaken conviction that the severity of the sentence deters others from committing crimes."
"In reality, it is not the severity of the punishment which determines its importance in prevention, but its inevitability."
"Therefore, it is important to have an effective system for the pursuit and prosecution of criminals."
"It is essential that those who break the law be aware that they will be apprehended and punished."
"In 2009, the greatest number of executions were carried out in China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, North Korea and the US."
"The use of capital punishment has not been observed to reduce the incidence of the most serious crimes."
"This is why, during their social development, civilised countries abandoned the use of capital punishment, as they had first abandoned particular forms of it, such as the breaking wheel, dismemberment by horses, burning at the stake and impalement. For they are practices which unleash the basest instincts and have a brutalising effect on society."
"In Poland, restoration of the death sentence is advocated by right-wing conservative parties, who equate government with the intimidation of society."
"Such methods cause fear in society and uncertainty as to what will happen tomorrow, and this, in turn, makes them lead to still greater brutality and crime."
"Capital punishment, therefore, causes the opposite effect to the one intended."
"Therefore, it is essential to educate people properly about this and to make society aware that capital punishment does not solve the problem of the most serious crimes."
"The death penalty is outlawed in the Member States of the Council of Europe and hence, in all 27 EU Member States, but it is still routine practice in many countries in the world."
"The sad thing is that in many cases, the death sentence is handed down not for common criminal offences but for the consistent, courageous expression of political or religious views or for infringements of cultural customs."
"Europe has come to recognise that it cannot enact laws that permit ending a human life by violent means."
"The time has come for it to firmly assert this wise recognition and extend it to those countries around the world that do not think this way at present."
"Cultural diversity and different world views are a source of enrichment for human civilisation, and no law can justify the practice of the death penalty."
"Unfortunately, 'man is not a beautiful animal', if I may quote the great Polish philosopher, Barbara Skarga."
"There are many among us, citizens of the free and democratic Member States of the European Union, who are supporters of capital punishment."
"This is horrifying, but true."
"Fortunately, the death sentence is not found in the legislation of the European Union, and no Union government, not even the most populist, can introduce it."
"However, the European Union, by its values and the way it upholds them, should be extending its influence to other countries, as indeed it does want to do."
"Therefore, it is important that we act at global level."
"Perhaps the World day against the death penalty, proposed by the Belgian Presidency, is a step in this direction."
"I hope it will focus our attention on this important matter and strengthen respect for every human being, but also that it will strengthen our responsibility for human rights standards in the European Union as well as in those parts of the world where the death penalty is in use."
"The European Union has introduced a ban on the use of capital punishment."
"This is the end result of a process which has been taking place in the countries of Europe, although the continent does still have many supporters of the death penalty."
"I do not think it is the role of the European Parliament to adopt a position on the deterrent effect of capital punishment, particularly because numerous studies which have been carried out recently, mainly at universities in the US, show that the death sentence does act as a deterrent."
"Our role is to take care to ensure that our societies are safe."
"Regarding currently prevailing law in the European Union, we should remember that just as we demand respect for our decisions, so we should respect views encountered in other democratic societies and not impose our vision of justice upon those societies."
"The societies of the US, Japan and South Korea are entitled to establish such laws as they see fit."
"We, however, in Europe, should remember that renouncement of the death penalty must not mean indulgence towards the most abominable of crimes, the crime of murder - in such cases, we need severe punishments which are a deterrent and which isolate the perpetrator, such as a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of conditional release."
"For if we want to live in a secure society, we must have severe laws against those who violate the fundamental human right - the right to life - and who, in addition, are often prepared to violate it again and to kill innocent people."
"in writing. - As we move forward with our efforts to fully abolish the practice of capital punishment, it is important to recognise that there are 58 countries worldwide that still utilise capital punishment when sentencing in criminal cases and a handful of others that use it in particular situations such as wartime sentencing."
"The European Union has worked diligently as a whole to abolish this inhumane practice and our continued efforts will pay great dividends."
"There is, however, work to be done; we have European neighbours that have not fully abolished this practice and it should remain our focus to continue our efforts toward complete abolition."
"It is my belief that through continued communication and resolve, we will be successful."
"Although it is clear that this practice violates fundamental human rights, many cultures around the world have laws that are based on other factors such as religion, tradition and control."
"These factors make the abolition of capital punishment increasingly difficult, but it is our duty, not only as Members of the Parliament, but as members of the human race, to continue our tireless efforts to bring this practice to an end."
"EU action on oil exploration and extraction in Europe (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Council by Jo Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the implications of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill for the EU: action on oil extraction and exploration in Europe (B7-0470/2010), and the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Jo Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the implications of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill for the EU: action on oil extraction and exploration in Europe (B7-0551/2010)."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Gulf of Mexico has probably suffered one of the biggest environmental disasters of recent years, and we in Europe - in the European Union - must do everything we can to ensure that such a disaster cannot happen here."
"I believe we are in agreement on that."
"We have four seas adjoining the EU or situated within the EU: the North Sea, the Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean and the Black Sea."
"Oil drilling takes place in these European waters."
"In this regard, the subject is also an issue for the European Union."
"Deep-sea drilling especially represents a particular risk."
"That has become evident from the oil well in the Gulf of Mexico."
"There are problems here that are beyond our control."
"A great many outstanding questions have arisen to which we still do not have answers."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, that is why we are recommending to you in our resolution that it would be appropriate to have a moratorium at least on new applications for deep-sea drilling until such time as we have a complete overview of what is needed and how we can close the gaps and remedy the shortcomings."
"I believe that the citizens of Europe expect us to ensure an equally high level of security for all 27 Member States, and thus for all four seas of the EU, and that there is no gap between countries that are already doing a lot - and that should be recognised - and those that are perhaps somewhat more lax in this area."
"I am also addressing our neighbouring countries here."
"We have a Neighbourhood Policy, and in the Mediterranean, in particular, there are, of course, also drillings by countries that are not members of the European Union."
"Commissioner Oettinger, I believe you are taking initiatives - and that is something you must indeed do - to talk to Libya in particular, but also to others, concerning our standards and our approaches."
"The question is: would the EU be prepared for such a disaster?"
"What control mechanisms and intervention mechanisms do we have in the event of such a disaster?"
"We need answers to this too."
"We have the agency in Lisbon, the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), which was established in the aftermath of a disaster involving the break-up of supertankers."
"The agency thus checks the safety of vessels, but not the safety of the seas - in other words, precisely what we have now seen in respect of deep-sea drilling."
"In our opinion, it would be a good idea to expand EMSA's mandate to allow these things also to come within its remit."
"That would at least address the problem adequately."
"I imagine that new resources would be needed for this."
"That is always a problem, of course."
"However, if we want to deal with such a major issue, then the resources will have to be found."
"I would also like to mention liability for such major events."
"What, in fact, is the insurance situation?"
"What possibilities are there for getting the funds needed?"
"We need to gain an overview of liability and insurance law relating to deep-sea drilling, and that is something we are discussing."
"Naturally we also, and above all, need to see how this applies to small companies operating in this field."
"Not all the companies active in this area are multinationals; there are many small companies too."
"How will they manage?"
"How can they insure themselves?"
"Do we need solidarity funds?"
"Do we need collective solutions to ensure that those who suffer are compensated - the fishermen and others who are affected by such disasters?"
"We also want to know whether the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive, which demands environmental impact assessments for activities on land, also applies to deep-sea drilling and related areas."
"There is much we do not know about the high seas."
"What kind of working conditions and social standards are effective there?"
"After all, the human factor can also play a major role."
"We have good technology, but if the human factor fails, then it could result in such disasters."
"Commissioner, you have overall responsibility for energy."
"Offshore oil has its problems; offshore wind would be better."
"I believe that this debate naturally opens the way for a different energy policy in the EU - and that also lies within your remit."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the absence of new proposals from the Commission relating to oil exploration and extraction - an absence which I should immediately like to point out is quite legitimate since the Commission is engaged in ongoing consultations with the industry and the numerous regulatory authorities concerned - I can only reiterate here our deep concern following the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico and its far too numerous human and environmental casualties."
"This disaster demonstrates that there cannot be too many precautions in this sector and that we must do everything we can to prevent a repeat of this type of accident."
"We can only hope that, as happened after the Exxon Valdez accident in 1989 and the Erika accident in 1999, the EU and US regulatory framework for offshore oil exploration and exploitation activities will be strengthened this time too."
"The aim is obviously not to develop a framework that is so onerous to implement that it makes these activities unprofitable, but to ensure that they are carried out safely, particularly at a time when the earth's resources are diminishing."
"While we have been awaiting legislative proposals, this issue has obviously continued to be of concern for us, and, although like others, we were pleased when the Macondo well was shut down in mid-July and finally capped on 19 September, bearing in mind the scale of the rehabilitation works to be carried out, we believe that this is just one stage in a longer process."
"This is why the Presidency wanted Commissioner Oettinger to share his initial assessments with us at the recent Informal Meeting of Energy Ministers from 6 to 7 September."
"In our opinion, there are two things we can take away from what he said at that meeting."
"First of all, the safety provisions that are already in place in the EU are the most stringent in the world."
"Secondly, due to the fact that oil activities come under various regulatory fields, any proposals planned by the Commission will have to cover these various fields: firstly - since prevention is better than cure - we will have to improve the safety standards applicable to all European waters, but we will also have to tighten up the liability regime, strengthen regulatory oversight and step up international cooperation, for example, with our OPEC partners, as we already did in June."
"An initial communication from the Commission is expected between now and mid-October, and due to the large number of fields it must cover - which I mentioned just now - it will need to be discussed by several Council configurations and probably by several parliamentary committees as well."
"We must not, however, allow the complexity of this issue to be an excuse to postpone our response."
"We intend to ensure that this communication is studied as soon as it is received so that it can be tabled at Council level as quickly as possible."
"With regard more specifically to environmental protection, the EU already has quite an advanced legislatory framework."
"The precautionary and polluter pays principles are fundamental principles of EU environmental policy and are, in fact, laid down in the treaty."
"The oil spill disaster caused by that platform in the Gulf of Mexico may also represent an opportunity for the Commission and the Member States to reassess certain aspects of current environmental legislation."
"In this context, it should be remembered, for example, that the Seveso II Directive is currently being revised, and that we are awaiting a proposal from the Commission before the end of the year."
"I should also like to point out that the Commission is currently examining the EU's disaster response capacity, with a view, in particular, to its improvement."
"We look forward to receiving this communication between now and the end of November."
"Finally, I should like to confirm that the Presidency will do everything in its power to ensure that the proposals which the Commission will present to us are taken further."
"Madam President, Mr Chastel, honourable Members, we are all agreed on the magnitude of the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico."
"Damage has occurred that will have long-lasting adverse effects on the environment, on nature, on culture, on tourism and on fisheries, and these can only be partly mitigated by financial means."
"Nonetheless, we should be thankful that we are dealing here with a capable company such as BP, which we can expect to do all that can be done in terms of providing financial compensation where appropriate."
"We are in the process of finalising a communication."
"In no more than two weeks' time, the Commission will officially consult on this subject and issue its communication."
"I am here today to listen to your expectations, under the general leadership of Mr Leinen and his specialist committee, along with Mr Reul."
"I can tell you that we will be incorporating Parliament's expectations and specialist statements into the communication that will be issued in two weeks' time at the latest."
"A few days ago, we received a statement from BP that at least contained sufficient self-criticism and which also proposed and announced voluntary steps and remedial action that can be taken by the industry."
"We are paying close attention to what is going on in Washington, which is currently somewhat delayed by the electoral campaign, but we note that the government in Washington wishes this very serious incident to have far-reaching consequences for US legislation and policy."
"We aim to formulate the highest security standards worldwide for the waters within our reach: the North Sea, the North Atlantic, the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea, the Mediterranean and the Atlantic off the coast of West Africa."
"We have authority in our own territorial waters, but we are also endeavouring to pass on these standards to areas beyond our borders."
"Mr Leinen indirectly referred to Libya."
"We are also concerned with drilling that affects our coastlines and seas, but which does not take place directly in our seas."
"We are talking about oil, and also about gas."
"We are talking generally about offshore exploration and extraction of hydrocarbons and the best possible level of technical security."
"We note that the United Kingdom - the UK - and Norway can be assumed to have the most experience as well as high, acceptable standards, and we therefore consider it particularly important to cooperate with the government in London and with the Norwegian Government."
"Firstly, we want to check the security precautions for future licences; in other words, what higher or highest standards are possible for new authorisations."
"Secondly, we want to look into upgrading existing rigs, some of which are 20 or more years old."
"The standard that was acceptable at that time is not comparable with what is feasible and politically expected today."
"Then there is the matter of regular checks."
"We need to increase the density of our control network, and increase the frequency and quality of checks accordingly."
"There are also questions relating to insurance law, such as the matter of how far we can make comprehensive insurance cover obligatory for companies engaged in extraction so as to minimise and remedy any damage - at least economically and financially - as far as possible in the event of a worst case scenario."
"A further matter that concerns me is how we can export our security standards to other parts of the world."
"If BP now intends to carry out extraction and build rigs off the coast of Libya, then this gives us an opportunity to approach the European energy industry - namely BP, Shell, Total - and obtain voluntary commitments that they will voluntarily accept and apply the same strict standards that they are obliged to adopt within the territory of the European Union in these neighbouring regions as well."
"In specific terms, this means that an offshore oil rig off the coast of Libya that is built and operated by BP, or perhaps a rig off the coast of West Africa that is operated by a European energy enterprise, should and must maintain the same standards as those operated in the North Sea where such standards are enshrined in law."
"Overall, then, please give us two weeks."
"We are on track to meet the objectives of our communication."
"Any other expectations that you, the honourable Members, convey to us today will be taken into account and we will be sure to present legislative proposals for what is set out in our communication in the first half of 2011."
"Madam President, I would first like to thank Commissioner Oettinger for having taken up the reins and for having reacted as soon as the oil disaster occurred."
"Naturally, we must take into account the fact that the starting point in the US is different to that which we have in Europe."
"Nonetheless, I believe that there is a need to act here in Europe too, and there is a need to carry out a thorough analysis of both the actual conditions in Europe and the legal situation in order that we can make appropriate proposals."
"We must bear in mind that the legal situation is, of course, complicated by the fact that we are dealing, in part, with international waters and, in part, with waters belonging to the Member States."
"I believe that we must look into the matter of where exactly the Community can act as a community and make legal proposals to improve the situation."
"Our starting point must always be to create the highest security standards for people and for the environment, so as to prevent such disasters from the outset."
"Nevertheless, I feel that it is important that we continue to explore for oil and gas throughout Europe in order to further diversify our energy sources."
"That should remain in the back of our minds."
"As I mentioned, however, security must take precedence."
"I see three areas in which we can act here."
"The first is to look at where we need to change the legal situation in the EU."
"The Seveso II Directive, the directive on environmental liability and the third maritime safety package all come to mind here."
"These are definitely areas which the Commission needs to address and we look forward to hearing your proposals."
"The second is the financial framework."
"I believe that insurance solutions would offer the appropriate security to enable financial compensation to be provided following disasters."
"A third area is emergency management within the EU."
"Is it really necessary for each Member State to maintain the full capacity needed to deal with such disasters?"
"Could we not find a means of cooperating here at EU level and strengthen this so as to relieve the pressure on the Member States a little?"
"The environmental disaster in the Gulf of Mexico highlighted the lack of safety and security of oil operations."
"This heart-breaking tragedy, which claimed human lives and did untold damage to the environment, must also be an important lesson to us in Europe."
"I welcome the Commission's initiative to carry out a test of the safety of offshore oil platforms operating in the territory of the European Union."
"However, in order to ensure this fully, it is necessary to take measures on a wider scale."
"Above all, the Commission should assess the European Union's capacity for immediate and effective response to accidents and develop a European action plan."
"Current regulation is clearly lacking in content and scope, both in terms of safety and responsibility for damage done."
"Huge infrastructure projects are currently being implemented in the European Union whose safety has perhaps not been assessed comprehensively and properly."
"This includes the much debated Nord Stream gas pipeline and other oil and gas infrastructure, which is necessary for Europe to achieve energy security, but which must satisfy environmental requirements of the highest level."
"The issue of responsibility must therefore be resolved clearly: the polluter compensates for damage done and furthermore, it is necessary to adopt compulsory EU-wide insurance schemes."
"In order to avoid similar disasters, particular attention should be paid to preventive measures."
"Therefore, in my opinion, the Commission should analyse the establishment of an effective monitoring system, strengthen inspection methods and tighten minimum compulsory EU safety rules."
"I agree with the proposals made by our colleagues for the Commission to also provide annual reports, which would allow us to both assess the true situation and take measures in time, as and when necessary."
"In conclusion, I would like to thank the Commission and the Member of the Commission for the fact that we will have a communication so soon and will be able to begin to examine in more detail what Europe really needs."
"Madam President, Mr Chastel, Commissioner, the Gulf of Mexico incident is a watershed."
"As the events taking place at this very moment in Hungary unfortunately demonstrate, Europe is clearly not safe from large-scale industrial accidents."
"Our joint task is precisely to anticipate disasters, not to simply wait for them to occur and then muster the resources to deal with them."
"What do I mean by 'anticipate'?"
"Firstly, to have suitable, preventive legislation."
"No such legislation yet exists."
"We need to conduct sound preliminary studies, and I am pleased to hear about the plans to apply Seveso II to offshore platforms."
"We also need to carry out sound impact assessments and - this is extremely important - establish a liability system that acts as a deterrent, so that it is in operators' economic interests to guarantee safety."
"Finally, the technical resources must be in place to ensure that any eventuality can be dealt with within a few days or even hours."
"This does not mean simply being able to react on paper; it means being able to react in the real world."
"I dare not imagine what would happen if there were a situation similar to the one in the Gulf of Mexico in an enclosed sea such as the Mediterranean that lasted for several weeks or even months."
"Of course, we also need - as you mentioned - a fair liability system to compensate damage."
"The Environmental Liability Directive, I recall, does not cover economic damage."
"That is why I think it is essential for us to do as the US had no hesitation in doing, and introduce a moratorium on new installations so that the conditions mentioned just now can be fulfilled."
"This does not mean shutting down current operations, but suspending the issue of any new licences so as to ensure that all public and private stakeholders have the same objective: to establish, as quickly as possible, the legislation and technical resources to protect us from a disaster on the scale of the one in the US."
"I think that all these actions would be a step in the right direction; although I would point out that our common goal is to gradually wean society off oil, not to ensure that we remain dependent on it."
"Madam President, I concur with the speech by Mrs Lepage, particularly the last section."
"Five months ago, on 20 April, the unthinkable happened, in the form of the terrible disaster in the Gulf of Mexico."
"It took five months for the leak to be stopped for good."
"Therefore, we, the European legislator, need to ensure that a disaster of this kind can never occur in European waters."
"That is why we are holding this debate."
"That is why we are taking action."
"The resolution on which we voted in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is largely in keeping with the analysis and with the policy and the willingness of Commissioner Oettinger."
"Commissioner Oettinger has already appeared in plenary a couple of times to set forth what he stands for and what he wants to do."
"Our resolution is much in line with this."
"I regret the Council's stated intention to await proposals from the Commission before reacting."
"I had, in fact, expected the Council to react to the proposals being put forward by Parliament in the current debate."
"These proposals, of which there are many, are important."
"We are, in fact, calling on Member States to establish a moratorium until accidents can be ruled out; until compliance with adequate safety rules has been ensured."
"We want there to be a moratorium until we can be sure that the legislation on liability is fully in order."
"We want to look into the situation as regards the supervision of the supervisors."
"We want to ensure that steps are also undertaken to decommission installations that are still operational and which may need to be decommissioned shortly."
"We want to see the mandate of the European Agency for Maritime Safety (EMSA) extended."
"We want that organisation to be responsible for marine pollution caused not only by seagoing ships but also by oil platforms in the event of a disaster."
"These are all very tangible things that are set out in this resolution."
"Mr Chastel, I regret that you are refraining from giving a reaction, on behalf of the Council, to Parliament's proposals in this House and are awaiting the proposals to be presented by Commissioner Oettinger, the first of which is due as soon as next week in the form of the stress test on the existing legislation."
"Hearty congratulations to the Commission, then, and a rather reserved attitude towards the Council."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, the Gulf of Mexico oil spill was a wake-up call for the oil sector."
"There is no question about that."
"We are all keenly aware of that fact, but let us be careful we do not overreact."
"I agree when we say that we must have proper compensation for all those, particularly in the fisheries sector, who lose their livelihood because of an oil spill or any accident of this nature which - heaven help us - I hope does not happen in any of our waters."
"We must set up either a compensation fund or an insurance fund to which the oil companies themselves would contribute."
"However, when I hear good colleagues like Mrs Lepage calling for a moratorium on exploratory drilling, I really feel that is going too far."
"That is an overreaction."
"We have 20 years, two decades, of experience in deepwater drilling in the North Sea and off the west coast of Scotland - two decades in which we have exported some of the highest level safety technology in the world."
"We have got more than 315 deepwater wells, i.e. wells over 300 metres deep, while some of them have been up to 1 600 metres deep."
"It is early days to look at the analysis of what happened in the Gulf of Mexico, but from the evidence, it already seems that if our technology, which we have been using for two decades in the North Sea, had been used there, we would not have had the oil spill, or it would have been contained much more rapidly."
"So do not let us suddenly slam the door on one of the safest and most secure industries that we have in Europe, when this year alone, we have already invested GBP 6 billion in exploratory work in the North Sea and off the coast of Shetland."
"Do not overreact and send the message worldwide that we in the European Parliament feel that our European industry is no longer safe."
"This is one of our great export earners."
"Madam President, I should like to congratulate Mr Leinen and the Commissioner on their briefing."
"I should also like to express my displeasure at the fact that the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, which is responsible for industry and research, is absent from the resolution."
"I would say that, because of this absence, we have paragraphs which are unrealistic or create huge problems for extraction industries."
"We said we would control them, not wipe them out."
"That is why we absolutely agree with the amendment tabled by Mr Callanan to delete paragraph 17 and I would also note that paragraph 22 puts a financial burden on extraction companies which we should be careful about."
"I would further note that there is a major omission in the text: there is no reference whatsoever to promoting research and development in the extraction sector."
"We could work with the Americans here and advance research and technology, which will help us to deal with this sort of crisis."
"Madam President, the real significance of the Deepwater disaster is being missed."
"The real question is why BP is drilling for oil through 5 000 metres of rock, in water 1 500 metres deep, in the middle of a hurricane zone."
"The answer is peak oil - the point at which we have used the half of the world's reserves that were easy, safe and cheap to produce, and now rely on shrinking reserves which are increasingly inaccessible, dangerous and expensive, both financially and environmentally."
"Deepwater is merely a symptom of peak oil."
"Using it as an excuse for yet another EU power grab will not stop us reaching peak or suffering its potentially catastrophic consequences."
"Instead of talking about symptoms, it is time to get serious about the disease: the fact that we have used all the easy oil and are still addicted to the stuff."
"In recent months, this reality has begun to dawn on - among others - President Obama, the British Government and the German military."
"It is time for the EU to take its head out of the sand, stop obsessing about climate change, and study and address the real crisis: peak oil."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Chastel, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this was a major disaster, and there are various ways of reacting to disasters."
"You can rush about taking action and make a new declaration every week, or you can investigate the situation thoroughly and then consider where things need to be changed."
"Where the starting point is concerned, for example, it has been established that the situation in the United States is not really comparable with that in Europe."
"Commissioner Oettinger has chosen the latter path: to proceed in a sober, objective manner, one step at a time."
"That is how you make policy, and it is how you gain the support of our citizens."
"I am grateful firstly that the Commissioner has chosen this course, and secondly that he has involved all the committees."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy were jointly involved in plenary and both participated in the discussions with the Commissioner at which we were able to go into the facts in more depth."
"Unfortunately, I must point out - as Mrs Tzavela has already mentioned - that the Environment Committee then felt it had to submit a resolution unilaterally."
"I consider that to be absolutely unacceptable."
"Moreover, rushing out any old hasty document does not serve the end of parliamentary cooperation and does not serve to deal with this issue properly."
"We have learned - as, in fact, we all knew - that the Commission is to present a communication next week or the week after that analyses the consequences of what has occurred."
"We will then, as the Council quite rightly points out, be able to consider intelligently what the consequences should be."
"The Environment Committee felt it had to present a motion for a resolution on this quickly, so now we have been presented with a resolution that I consider to be overhasty throughout."
"As far as I am concerned, it contains errors and completely disregards a great many aspects relating to research and technology, as Mrs Tzavela has just pointed out."
"Who cares?"
"All that matters is to get something out, even if it addresses the matter from only one perspective."
"This is absolutely unacceptable."
"Moreover, drawing the conclusion that a moratorium should be pronounced is a successful attempt to draw attention to Europe as a centre of industry."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is no way to go about things."
"I am grateful for being allowed to take the floor."
"Here at least, one can still speak."
"My committee was not involved in the resolution at all."
"(CS) The explosion of the Deepwater drilling platform was most definitely a major disaster."
"It was a warning both for the United States and for Europe."
"However, there was one warning we overlooked."
"At the same time as the ENVI Committee was discussing Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico, oil was escaping from the Jebel al-Zayt drilling platform, which is a few kilometres offshore in Egypt, and we learned about the leak from tourists."
"We did not even hear about it from the mass media, and when I asked a Commission representative during a session of the ENVI Committee whether he had information on this rather small but nonetheless near at hand disaster, or rather oil leak, he had none."
"No one had this information."
"Therefore, in addition to the other subjects which fellow Members have discussed here, I would like to mention one more, namely, that it is always necessary to have timely and high quality information which will not be misreported for political reasons, as was the case when the Egyptian Government misreported the oil leak in Jebel al-Zayt."
"In my opinion, a moratorium is one of the possible solutions, though we obviously cannot prohibit and restrict the energy industry if it is to supply us with what we need."
"It is necessary to have unified safety standards, because European Union standards in the North Sea are very high, but in the Black Sea, they are no longer applied."
"Such a divergent approach is unacceptable, and we must ensure that there are unified safety standards to protect the entire European coastline."
"(NL) Madam President, the circumstances in the Gulf of Mexico are not comparable with those in our waters, of course, but I am delighted that the European Union has nevertheless seized the opportunity to examine its own legislation."
"After all, this is urgently needed."
"There are two very important elements as far as I am concerned."
"The first is the controls."
"Several of my fellow Members have spoken about this."
"These controls are essential."
"Even more important by far in my eyes is the element of liability; and, to be honest, it was rather a shock to me that this is not well organised even in our European waters."
"Why is liability so important?"
"Sound regulation would be the big stick par excellence to induce oil companies primarily to take a great many measures themselves to reduce the risks - that is why I consider this important."
"For that reason, I strongly advocate not granting new licences until that liability has been regulated."
"(NL) Madam President, I should like to address, in particular, my fellow Members, Mr Stevenson and Mr Reul, who say that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety was too quick to react."
"Let us be honest; this disaster happened five months ago and Europe is only now presenting a resolution: that is by no means too quick."
"We in the Committee on the Environment have been working on this for a long time."
"I should also like to express my warm thanks to the Commission, as it was proactive and admitted that the legislation on liability is not clear and that, quite simply, there are gaps between European and national legislation."
"Such things are not regulated properly."
"Until we know that this area is regulated properly, we must simply stop any new deep-sea drilling."
"This moratorium would apply not to the whole sector but only to new deep-sea drilling."
"It is not an overreaction; it is a very calm reaction."
"We are also aware that an investigation is still under way in the Gulf of Mexico into what went wrong."
"This needs to come to light and, until then, there should be no new activity."
"(PL) Madam President, catastrophes and very spectacular events, such as the leak in the Gulf of Mexico, are very often the stimulus for general changes in policy and great schemes of regulatory reforms."
"However, action which is dictated by emotions is not always rational, so I would appeal for a great deal of caution and care in imposing new obligations on firms, be they in the area of insurance, environmental standards or safety standards, because in the European Union, these standards are, in any case, the highest in the world."
"We are at a different stage of development in this area of legislation."
"The only consequence of such hyper-regulation can be a weakening of Europe's competitiveness and a stronger position for the extraction industry everywhere outside the European Union."
"The situation is similar in the case of a moratorium on off-shore drilling - such a moratorium will produce effects which are, most probably, completely the opposite to those which were intended."
"A moratorium means more ships sailing to European coasts and, therefore, more danger to the environment."
"This is why I am appealing, in both cases - in the case of legislation, and in the case of the moratorium - for a great deal of caution."
"(PL) Madam President, this is now the third debate in the European Parliament which shows the great importance we attach to safety in the extraction of crude oil in European seas."
"We do not want a repetition of the catastrophe which occurred in the Gulf of Mexico to be possible on the coast of our continent."
"In the first three months of this year alone, there were 175 disruptions to the operation of drilling platforms in the North Sea, of which 8 were described as very serious incidents."
"In 32 cases, operation of these installations was halted."
"Another problem is that these platforms have been heavily exploited."
"Of 103 platforms which were commissioned in the North Sea at the beginning of the 1970s, 44 will have reached what is known as technical death in five years' time, and 26 have already exceeded the permissible exploitation period, but have been given an extension of the right to extract oil."
"Installations have also changed owners over the last 30 years, and the new administrators do not necessarily share the same culture of exploitation in terms of safety."
"The pressure to maximise extraction does not go hand-in-hand with measures intended to improve safety or with proper risk assessment."
"Therefore, we support the Commissioner's work, which aims to make a thorough analysis of legislation on oil extraction in European seas, and, if the need arises, to introduce new and essential provisions in order to cover the dangers resulting from the extraction of oil at sea and to tighten up the principles of liability in the event of accidents which cause contamination involving crude oil."
"It is essential to establish the highest standards of safety for deep-sea drilling in European seas and to apply them to all parties working in European territorial waters."
"This must also apply to firms which come from outside the European Union."
"We must not allow a situation, for example, if exploitation of deposits in the Arctic is to be undertaken by Norway and Russia, in which one of these countries is going to use technology which does not incorporate the highest standards of safety used by firms belonging to the European Union."
"Madam President, as many other speakers have said, the Gulf of Mexico disaster was a wake-up call for the industry."
"However, I listened carefully to what the Commissioner said in his introduction and his comments and I agree with the commitments he gave that we need to improve standards, we need to improve quality, and we need to ensure that the EU can be a leader in this field and that we can export our safety systems around the world and make sure that others follow. I also welcome his recognition in his contribution that, in the North Sea, the UK and Norway are already operating to some of the highest standards in the world."
"We in Scotland have had our disaster in the North Sea - in the Piper Alpha disaster, just over 20 years ago, when over 100 people were killed."
"That led to a wide-scale review of safety standards which has resulted in the very high standards that we now have today."
"I support much of what is in the question that Jo Leinen has led on today, but I do not believe that the open-ended call for a moratorium is proportionate and is a sensible response to the challenge we face."
"I hope Parliament will think twice about going as far as that."
"(PL) Madam President, there is no doubt that the safety of the extraction and of the transport of natural materials should be monitored by the European Commission."
"A key issue, besides that of optimal safety standards, should also be the preparedness of the enterprises which extract and transport natural materials for emergencies which might cause contamination of the environment on a large scale."
"We must not forget the necessary financial resources which should be set aside by firms engaged in this kind of economic activity."
"Soon, a gas pipeline pumping huge amounts of gas along the bottom of the Baltic Sea will be commissioned."
"I think this is the perfect opportunity to ask if the European Commission has done anything to protect the interests of millions of Europeans who live on the Baltic coast and who might be the victims of an ecological disaster on an unprecedented scale as the result of an explosion or leak from this gas pipeline."
"It should also be recalled that a European Parliament resolution drafted two years ago concerning preparation for the ecological effects of this investment has been completely ignored, and the investment is now under way."
"What will the European Commission do on this matter so that we will not regret the wasted time when a disaster occurs?"
"(FR) Madam President, the scale of the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico is clearly such that it demands us EU political representatives to ask ourselves questions about the safety of our own oil installations."
"In fact, one of the keys to protecting the marine environment is to ensure that oil exploration sites are as safe as possible."
"Nevertheless, the idea of a moratorium on current and future oil drilling in our waters is clearly premature and inappropriate."
"Premature, because the outcome of the investigation into the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico is not yet known, and some preliminary conclusions confirm that it was due to a combination of behavioural, organisational and technical errors."
"Inappropriate because - as has been said several times - different regulations apply in the North Sea, in the Mediterranean and in the Gulf of Mexico."
"Is it worth pointing out here the serious economic and social consequences that a moratorium would have, not to mention how it might jeopardise our energy independence?"
"Last week, Norway and Russia ended a 40-year dispute and a 30-year moratorium by confirming the principle of a common maritime border in the Barents Sea and the Arctic."
"This agreement will, in practice, result in the two countries sharing a hydrocarbon-rich area."
"How, then, could the EU executive at the same time plan to ask for these oil activities to be suspended and for them to voluntarily place themselves in a position of weakness from an energy and economic point of view?"
"(PL) Madam President, the unprecedented ecological catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico should persuade the Member States of the European Union to carry out close monitoring of drilling platforms in waters where crude oil is extracted."
"We are even seeing the appearance of proposals to introduce a moratorium on new drilling until the risk of danger to the environment has been excluded."
"These suggestions are based on the assumption that since sea basins have no borders, an ecological disaster in one of them would affect them all."
"Such an approach is in accord with the resolution adopted two years ago by the European Parliament on the ecological hazard to the Baltic in relation to the Nord Stream project."
"We hope the European Commission will adopt an equally resolute and judicious approach to monitoring gas investments on the Baltic sea bed and that in doing so, it will make use of all possible instruments."
"It is worth considering, too, if support should not also be given to alternative technologies, such as the extraction of shale gas."
"(HU) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have heard a great deal about this oil disaster and we all saw the shocking pictures on our television screens."
"However, did you know, ladies and gentlemen, that in past years, 97%, I repeat, 97% of all deliberate infringements of safety regulations by American oil companies were committed by British Petroleum?"
"Did you know that in the last ten years, numerous accidents were caused by that company?"
"Are you aware that British Petroleum has significantly reduced its safety and maintenance budget in order to maintain profits?"
"This has also played a role in the ever-increasing number of accidents."
"Mrs Lepage has just mentioned that the most important thing is to anticipate and prevent disasters."
"We all know that prevention is the most important thing."
"She is right about that."
"However, I think the American disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, just like other industrial or natural disasters of the past years or the catastrophic event the day before yesterday in Hungary, clearly proves that natural and industrial disasters can happen anywhere and at anytime."
"This is why I believe that compensation for damages, as well as rapid and effective damage control are very important."
"We talk a great deal about extreme weather conditions and their consequences and hazards, and how they increase the risk of natural and industrial disasters."
"I think this is true, and if it is true, then we have to think ahead."
"We must also heed the warning signs, such as the Hungarian disaster two days ago, or the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in the spring."
"I therefore suggest to my fellow Members and to Parliament that we set up a European disaster fund for effective damage control."
"(SL) The disaster in the Gulf of Mexico is terrifying."
"It has highlighted a lack of safety standards and an inadequacy in the action taken in the wake of the oil spill."
"Although it has occurred in the United States, i.e. under American regulatory requirements and standards, we must all learn some lessons from it and prevent any similar accidents."
"In doing that, however, we must take into account what the actual situation is here."
"As far as I know, European laws already have mechanisms in place to prevent similar accidents occurring in the Union because they are more stringent and more demanding than the equivalent American laws."
"I would therefore argue that we in the Union are in no hurry."
"Let us take our time and carry out an in-depth expert analysis of the causes and consequences of the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico."
"We can then formulate any new requirements and measures on the basis of that."
"I am troubled by some of the wording in the resolution which creates a sense of panic, such as 'as early as possible', and I am also against a moratorium on oil extraction."
"On the other hand, I do agree that we need to ensure we implement our laws according to the highest standards and that we offer fair compensation in the event of an accident."
"Above all, we must also take action outside our own borders."
"It does not matter which sea has been polluted; an American, European or any other sea."
"In such cases, the world as a whole will be more polluted and animals and plants will be dying and people suffering on account of the pollution."
"We must therefore do the hardest thing of all, which is to attain high international standards, not only tighten regulations within European borders."
"Conversely, I think that we must take urgent action in the case of the accident in Hungary because it has taken place within our borders."
"We urgently need answers to the questions of what that thick red substance is - is it really hazardous to health?"
"Is it really true that it is not included in the EU's Hazardous Waste List?"
"And how should we prevent similar accidents?"
"(LT) First of all, I would like to thank those fellow Members who contributed to the drafting of this resolution, and I would also like to thank the Member of the Commission who gave us much hope and joy with his announcement today of the measures that the Commission intends to take."
"And indeed, fears that the resolution is hurried, and perhaps not researched enough ... I still feel that it is the voice of the European Parliament and a message to society, the Council and the Commission."
"Some time has now passed since the accident and it is very important that at least the European Parliament is now letting its voice be heard."
"I think that as others here have said, it really is very important to review legislation currently in force in the European Union and legislation related to safety and quality standards."
"Indeed, we are not talking about halting oil exploration as a whole, but simply about monitoring the situation and determining what further measures should be taken to prevent an accident and disaster like that in the Gulf of Mexico from being repeated."
"Personally, I am very pleased with the provisions in this resolution on the responsibility of third countries."
"In general, the European Commission and the European Union should strengthen dialogue with third countries as regards certain energy infrastructure projects."
"That does not necessarily just mean the Baltic Sea and oil platforms or the Nord Stream gas pipeline, but also the Black Sea, the Mediterranean and conflict situations with North Africa."
"I feel that it is very important that third countries are included in this resolution."
"(PL) Madam President, the experience we have gained from the events of recent months, and our concerns over the complicated situation in the fuel market which is a consequence of the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, should drive us to take effective and emphatic steps to protect the environment and, above all, to prevent similar disasters in the future."
"All efforts should be geared to increasing the safety of crude oil extraction."
"The experts are trying to persuade us that the right preventive measures mean the oil companies have relatively few accidents - yes, this is true."
"However, the facts that procedures are being ignored and savings are being sought at the cost of safety mean that catastrophes similar to the one in the Gulf of Mexico might happen in the future in Europe, too."
"Worldwide, there are currently around 1 600 drilling platforms in operation, and this number is constantly increasing."
"New, ever larger and more powerful oil wells and drilling platforms continue to be opened."
"Extraction is reaching into deeper parts of sea basins in areas which are ever further offshore."
"Therefore, the significance of classical oil wells is falling, while that of drilling platforms is growing."
"Debate on the safety of extraction is inevitable, and a comparison of theoretical safety standards with those which are actually being applied may prove surprising."
"It is essential to subject oil firms to additional restrictions and to introduce new regulations which can improve safety."
"I know that some countries have already begun inspection of drilling platforms on their own initiative."
"The first inspections have already revealed certain breaches of safety norms."
"It has turned out that many platforms in the North Sea have been operating in breach of basic safety principles."
"I think preventive action should be taken immediately to subject drilling platforms and all sites where natural resources are extracted from the sea bed to suitable regulations and oversight."
"It is essential to introduce new safety standards and principles which will have to be followed by all parties which are involved in and jointly responsible for the extraction of crude oil."
"The possession of valid certification is a key requirement."
"(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is quite rightly asking itself whether an oil disaster such as the one that occurred in the Gulf of Mexico could happen in our waters."
"Since oil spills have destroyed our coasts and left a lasting impression on us numerous times in the past, we quite rightly believe that the preservation and protection of marine ecosystems, animal biodiversity and the economic sectors of fishing and tourism are of paramount importance."
"However, we must keep a cool head and resist adopting an extreme position which the introduction of a moratorium on any further deep-water oil drilling in Europe would represent."
"Firstly, because we have very strict safety standards for exploitation and exploration in Europe."
"Furthermore, national regulators and oil companies in Europe have themselves pledged to amend the exploitation and safety rules and procedures if the outcome of the US investigation into the disaster so demands."
"Secondly, in view of our requirement for energy independence, it would be highly risky, from a geostrategic point of view, to abandon our North Sea drilling operations."
"Ultimately, it is the future of our oil industry that we are jeopardising if we shut down its exploration and extraction activities."
"How could we justify the consequent impact on employment growth in a time of crisis?"
"Madam President, I think we all were shocked at the daily spill that was occurring in the Gulf of Mexico and the environmental damage that occurred as a result of it."
"It is only right that, as a result of that, we should be discussing this issue here to find ways to ensure that it will not happen again."
"I think a few points spring to mind."
"Number one is that the security and safety standards that we have must be rigorously applied so that accidents are prevented rather than having to be dealt with, and certainly there are good standards at the moment which need to be applied everywhere."
"Secondly, I agree totally with the Commissioner when he said that we must transport our safety standards throughout the world, because if something happens in the Gulf of Mexico or anywhere else, we are not immune to the fall-out from it."
"You cannot put an iron curtain around the waters of Europe and say nothing is going to happen if we abide by high standards ourselves, so there is great need for a worldwide agreement in that regard."
"Also, we need a disaster management fund."
"This has been mentioned and I agree with it."
"People have spoken about a moratorium and certainly, at this point in time, it does not seem to me to be a feasible option, because if we were to do that, there is a grave danger that we could become like a rich man who decides to give away all his money and finishes up having to beg from those he gave his money to."
"We would be in the same position, with other countries continuing to explore as they do now without using the rigorous standards that we would be applying."
"(PT) Madam President, Commissioner, following the environmental disaster that occurred in the Gulf of Mexico, it is important for the EU to ensure that its coasts are protected through its capacity for preventing and responding to this type of problem."
"The European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), located in Lisbon, provides aid and technical assistance in the area of safety and maritime protection from pollution caused by ships."
"In June of this year, I submitted a written suggestion to Commissioners Oettinger, Kallas and Georgieva to expand EMSA's powers to create mechanisms for supervising safety on European oil platforms and preventing environmental disasters."
"This suggestion would provide an economy of scale in terms of financial, human and technical resources."
"I welcome the response of the commissioners, who have shown themselves to be open to considering a review of the EMSA regulation to expand its powers."
"I call on the Commission once again to analyse this issue and expand the powers of the agency situated in Lisbon, so as to ensure effective protection for Europe's coasts."
"Madam President, disasters like this should make us think."
"They make me think about the Arctic, an area where the EU has no direct jurisdiction but much influence."
"Commissioner, you rightly said that EU companies operating outside the EU should export EU standards."
"I hope that will happen in respect to the Arctic area."
"It is far more challenging and hostile than the North Sea and to me, it is a conundrum."
"We, as Europe, champion a move from an oil-based economy and we champion renewables."
"Yet indirectly, we are encouraging oil exploitation in the most vulnerable and fragile part of our globe, where the consequences could be horrific."
"Maybe we should think quite carefully about what happens in the Arctic."
"(EL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I disagree with what has been said in this House with reference to corporate protectionism."
"At the moment, China is running a race by taking measures, by putting the necessary arrangements in place, by preparing a five-year plan on how exactly it intends to change its industry, by closing polluting industries, because it is competing with us on a huge market, the USD 13 billion clean energy market."
"This is a challenge to which we need to respond not with protectionism, but with courageous measures."
"Commissioner, yes, you should go ahead with the moratorium, which will be permanent, not temporary, and which will be a new step towards clean energy."
"Also, Commissioner, we need to examine environmental responsibility, to which you and other Members referred, and which will need to include the entire exclusive economic zone, because that is the zone in which companies are working."
"(PT) We must learn from the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and the resulting environmental disaster."
"These lessons will surely include more demanding, more rigorous and more regular monitoring of safety conditions on similar infrastructure in Europe, but must go much further than that."
"Alarm bells are ringing and they cannot be ignored."
"The limits of the world's oil reserves are reasonably well known today."
"There are many things in addition to energy for which humanity is highly - too highly - dependent on these reserves."
"These reserves must, therefore, be managed extremely wisely, meaning, above all, that they should be used very sparingly."
"We have already called attention in this Chamber to the importance of a plan that aims to manage these resources well and fairly, mitigating their increasing scarceness, and moving towards other sources of primary energy in a controlled way."
"I am talking about the Oil Depletion Protocol proposed in Uppsala in 2002 and in Lisbon in 2005 by a body of peak oil specialists."
"(DE) Madam President, if we have learned one thing from the oil crisis, it is that in times of high oil prices, it becomes profitable to develop poorly accessible oilfields and to extract under the most adverse conditions, such as from deeper and deeper depths."
"Assuming that the experts are correct in forecasting huge increases in the price of oil, we must assume that even more risky exploration for oil will take place in the foreseeable future."
"Although, under international agreements, it would have been appropriate to heighten the security precautions for the extraction of oil from depths greater than 200 metres following the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, as we know, the countries neighbouring the north-east Atlantic were unable to reach agreement."
"The depths being worked in the area concerned and the risks are entirely comparable with those in the Gulf of Mexico."
"Improving security standards and securing financial liability are matters which must be tackled - all the more so since the Commission is evidently planning a CO2 pipeline network and wants to sell emissions from Europe's power stations to the oil industry in the North Sea."
"We have not yet got to grips with how to dispose of nuclear waste - even though this technology has been in use for decades - and now, all of a sudden, hazardous greenhouse gas is to be disposed of in the North Sea."
"In my opinion, it is therefore high time that we thought about security provisions."
"(EL) Madam President, the general perception is that this sort of accident, like the most recent one, and like a series of similar accidents before it, alert us, and especially the rapporteur, whom I congratulate, to the need for certain provisions in connection with the future of all these extractions being carried out now and those carried out in the past."
"It is a fact that the level of control of these installations is a very important factor and, as such, it should be increased and carried out at shorter intervals."
"It is also a fact that responsibility must be apportioned and that it should be possible to apportion it exclusively."
"This will inevitably result in a change to insurance law and, as a consequence, it will also inevitably result in these companies insuring themselves against all factors which may cause damage in the wake of such an incident."
"(IT) Madam President, the disaster of April 2010 is one of the most serious environmental disasters ever to have happened in the world."
"If the same thing happened within a closed sea such as the Mediterranean, the lives of tens of millions of European and non-European citizens would be threatened, with no way back."
"Yet in Italy - as Lega Ambiente protested with regard to an ill-conceived energy policy - we are seeing an extraordinary increase in research applications and permits granted by the ministry for identifying and extracting oil resources that would be sufficient to cover the Italian energy requirement for little more than one year."
"It is obvious that the sacrifice is not worth it."
"All this is compounded by concern over the fact that BP has announced an agreement with Libya for offshore extraction just under 500 km south of Sicily."
"I hope that the Commission undertakes, through this now imminent measure, to defend life in the Mediterranean against the attacks of multinationals and governments who are complicit and care little about our collective welfare."
"Madam President, the resolution is looking at one problem, that of the risks of deep-water drilling, in isolation from the related problem that we are running short of easily accessible oil."
"We might already have passed the point at which we have used over half the world's supply."
"Those who would stop or inhibit deep-water drilling must explain how they would find an energy-dense substitute for oil."
"Or would they be happy for future generations to be returned to a non-industrial society?"
"There is no comparison between the risks of drilling in the shallow waters of the European continental shelf and the waters in the Gulf of Mexico."
"The proposers of this resolution are quite right to be horrified by the environmental and other costs of the BP tragedy in the Gulf."
"However, they must also be aware of the costs of a moratorium on deep-water drilling."
"(DE) Madam President, unfortunately, none of us can undo the Deepwater Horizon accident."
"We must therefore take every necessary step to ensure that such an environmental disaster never occurs in EU waters."
"I feel that to do this, three things are absolutely essential."
"Firstly, we must make as much provision as possible; in other words, we must cost in all the risks of offshore extraction."
"Secondly, we must ensure the highest level of security and create binding EU minimum security provisions."
"Thirdly, we must guarantee the highest standards of environmental protection."
"I believe it to be of the utmost importance that we investigate our capacity to react to accidents and that we create a common European and, I hope, worldwide system to avoid such environmental disasters."
"Madam President, honourable Members, representative of the Presidency of the Council, I would like to express my thanks for your committed, factual and very numerous contributions regarding the consequences and the measures to be taken."
"That applies to your many parliamentary questions in recent weeks that we have had to answer, as well as to today's debate, which we have followed attentively and will evaluate and take into account in our communication that will follow within the next two weeks."
"I agree with many of the suggestions made and add my support to them."
"For example, we are having intense dialogue with BP to ensure - and there is a good chance of doing so - that BP not only accepts the highest security standards, higher than those at present, in European waters, but also exports these standards, if I may put it like that."
"BP will be prepared to apply the same standards to similar drilling and rigs off the coast of Libya as in the North Sea, even though, under Libyan law, this may not be necessary in order to obtain authorisation and may not be laid down in legislation."
"Then we must tackle the issue of where we only want to make proposals for standards to be observed in national law and where we want to create European law."
"This will be more limited in the case of oil vessels than in the case of mobile transport, but does not exist at all at present in respect of stationary rigs."
"Some have called for us to move out of oil and into renewable energy instead."
"We support this too."
"Let us not be under any illusions, however."
"Our European economy and society will continue to require large volumes of oil for transport for the coming 20 to 30 years at least."
"There is no prospect of the aircraft taking you home from Brussels to your home countries - to Madrid, Lisbon, Sofia, Riga or Munich - managing without oil in the next 20 to 30 years."
"As members of a mobile community who take flights, we all need oil if Europe is not to come to a standstill."
"The same applies to long-distance coaches and buses; the same applies to transport by heavy goods vehicle; and, despite the development of electric cars, it will still be true for individual transport, for cars, for a long time to come."
"At present, there are just over 200 million cars registered in the countries of the European Union."
"If Poland and the new Member States achieve the same density as currently exists in France and Germany, then in 15 years' time, there will be 300 million cars."
"While they may be energy efficient, the vast majority of these will nonetheless run on oil."
"In other words, moving away from oil and into renewable energy is a long-term policy, but over the coming 10 to 30 years, demand for oil in Europe will not decline."
"Given the need for the vehicle density of some states to catch up, it will instead tend to increase slightly - however efficient we make it."
"This is even more true at a global level."
"This is why we need the highest level of security possible: for the required extraction of oil for our economy and society, as I have outlined."
"We will come back to you on this and I am counting on your support."
"I would also like to thank the Member States, who have been very constructive in this area."
"Nonetheless, I would urge you to work on your national governments with the same intensity as you have demonstrated here today, so that the Council may also be prepared to pass such legislation on higher standards either unanimously or with a clear majority."
"I am not yet convinced that all the Member States are currently prepared for European standards to be passed by you and the Council following proposals by the Commission."
"Madam President, I should, in turn, like to thank you for this interesting debate."
"Indeed, the speeches at times revealed very different points of view."
"I heard what were, at times, diametrically opposed views from the same political group."
"This is highly instructive."
"I wish to make three points."
"Firstly, do we need more legislation to improve the safety of the offshore industry?"
"As I indicated in my speech, the assessment conducted so far indicates that stringent measures are already in place - this point has been made."
"The Commission, which I should like to remind you has the monopoly on initiating actions, is currently finalising its assessment, but it has already noted that for an industry to be made safer, there first needs to be better monitoring and better enforcement of the existing regulatory framework."
"We will therefore see what it intends to propose to us in this area."
"Furthermore, as I have already said once today, the Commission is examining the EU's disaster response capability with a view to improving the safety of the offshore industry, which is an important factor in this area."
"In anticipation of legislative proposals, I should like to point out that, unlike what some Members have said today, this issue is clearly still a concern for the Council."
"At the Informal Meetings of Energy Ministers on 6 and 7 September, the Presidency asked for the first assessments to be carried out, communicated and discussed."
"The second point: can a moratorium be justified?"
"Clearly, it is difficult to answer that question directly."
"In any event, we think that the first requirement for any given piece of legislation is to actually enforce it."
"We also note that the industry does not seem to be waiting for this future regulatory framework to be established; the industry itself is reviewing a number of safety-related measures at the preventive and operational stages."
"Finally, it must be understood that the material situation in Europe is quite different, since most of the drilling in the Gulf of Mexico takes place at a depth of 1 500 metres, which clearly makes it difficult to shut down operations in the event of a disaster such as that which occurred."
"Most drilling in Europe takes place at depths of no more than 200 metres, which allows much more scope to act, or, in any case, makes taking action easier."
"Finally, Madam President - and the Commissioner just spoke about this - is this accident going to speed up EU energy and renewable energy policy?"
"This policy is, of course, already ambitious, but we are going to keep on aiming higher."
"The policy will definitely help us to reduce our dependence on oil and, generally speaking, to move towards a low-carbon society."
"As the Commissioner has just said, however, we cannot simply wave a magic wand and get rid of oil within the next 10 years."
"I am confident that the 2011-2020 energy strategy, which is due to be adopted at the start of next year, will accelerate this transition to an oil-free economy."
"I have received one motion for a resolutiontabled in accordance with Rule 115(5) of the Rules of Procedure on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 7 October 2010."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Thanks to the non-legislative resolution which was adopted by a huge majority, the European Parliament has sent a very clear signal to both the Commission and oil companies, specifically for them to take the necessary measures to eliminate the current shortcomings in terms of safety standards and liability in the oil extraction industry."
"Deep-sea drilling licences must be tightly controlled."
"Additional measures are required to prevent oil slicks, real environmental disasters which the European Union cannot tolerate."
"Given the ever-growing difficulty in finding oil and the increase in potentially dangerous deep-sea oil production activities, some general consideration must be given to the measures which need to be taken in the future."
"The efforts promoting environmental protection must be continued at a steady pace and the European Union must fulfil its role of protecting its citizens and nature, with which we all must live in harmony, by regulating oil extraction activities."
"Any oil spills which have happened, even in the past, would have a disastrous impact on the environment, causing damage to fishing or tourism as well."
"Consequently, European environmental liability legislation must also include the damage caused to marine waters."
"I welcome the view put forward by my colleague, Jo Leinen."
"Europe must take a stance on one of the biggest disasters of the century."
"The incident involving the Deepwater Horizon oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico and the huge volume of oil spilt into the Atlantic Ocean has, and will have, a major impact on the world's climate."
"The North Atlantic Current is undergoing significant changes in temperature, which will result in lower minimum temperatures in Europe this winter."
"The Council and Commission must take precise, transparent action, adopting measures which will guarantee the safety and security of oil extraction operations, as well as a high level of environmental protection and ecological disaster prevention in the European Union."
"The European Union must also maintain its position on climate change, while also protecting and facilitating the proper exploitation of oil fields to guarantee fossil fuel requirements."
"Parliament, the Commission and Council must collaborate with each other to devise a foolproof action plan."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Commissioner Günther Oettinger for his attempt, on the heels of the American oil platform accident, to analyse whether EU regulations would be adequate to prevent similar environmental disasters."
"Perhaps we can conclude that Community rules put more emphasis on post-disaster measures than on prevention."
"This deficiency was made painfully evident by a serious environmental disaster."
"On Monday, there was a breach in the reservoir dam of a Hungarian alumina plant."
"The mud with its highly toxic chemical contents flooded the neighbouring fields and villages."
"The disaster caused fatalities and may cause soil and water contamination of an as yet unknown magnitude."
"To make matters worse, the heavy metals may cause serious air pollution."
"Responsibility belongs to the company operating the plant, but it will hardly be able to compensate for the incalculable damages by itself."
"The lesson is obvious."
"First, there must be insistence at Community level as well that national authorities enforce the seemingly severe regulations rigorously."
"Secondly, the relevant regulations must be strengthened by requiring companies to have adequate insurance coverage even for accidents of this magnitude."
"Until we move forward in these areas, the cost of any compensatory damages will be borne by innocent taxpayers."
"in writing. - Madam President, The Gulf of Mexico oil disaster serves as a reminder of the inherent risks involved in maritime oil exploration."
"The investigations into what went wrong in American waters must be full and rigorous and the EU should pay careful attention to any lessons needing to be learned."
"Nevertheless, the calls for a moratorium on all deep-sea drilling in EU waters are premature and wholly disproportionate."
"The regulations in place in Scottish waters are not those which were in place in the Gulf of Mexico and we have decades of experience in this industry."
"Scottish oil exploration has not been without incident and the Piper Alpha catastrophe showed that some prices are too high in the pursuit of oil."
"However, lessons were learned from Piper Alpha and regulations were tightened up."
"If further lessons emerge from the Gulf, appropriate amendments can be made."
"These amendments should, however, be the responsibility of the democratic institutions of Scotland - and knee jerk reactions from this Parliament are unlikely to solve any problems."
"The European Union urgently needs to establish a strategy in order to be able to easily prevent future environmental disasters like the disaster caused by BP in the Gulf of Mexico."
"The Deepwater Horizon accident was one of the greatest disasters of recent times, with some 4.4 million barrels of crude oil spilling into the sea over the duration of the leak."
"Even the rescue operation was questionable due to the difficulty in deciding which type of technology to use and how to proceed."
"Meanwhile, the oil gushing from the bottom of the sea destroyed all living creatures."
"In the opinion of British environmental chemists, no other intervention should have been made besides keeping the oil slick away from the coastline."
"Marine biologists said that burning some of the oil slicks and using dispersants to get rid of pollutants does more harm to wildlife than the oil spill itself, given the relatively fast breakdown of the type of oil in question."
"At this point, I would also like to recall what happened in Hungary a few days ago when several tonnes of a caustic red sludge covered the residents of three communities in Veszprém County after the dam of a waste reservoir burst at an alumina plant near Ajka."
"I would like to call upon the European Commission to provide adequate material aid from the EU to assist the victims of the disaster and to help clean up the area."
"Thank you."
"It is absolutely imperative for us to take every measure we can to ensure that a disaster like Deepwater Horizon will not be repeated in European waters."
"The review of environmental as well as of health and safety legislation governing deep-sea oil drilling is a welcome and necessary process."
"The Council and Commission must aim to develop a strategy which will ensure harmonisation between the levels of protection across the whole of the European Union."
"Otherwise, discrepancies between operation and drilling standards in Member States will enable companies to provide high protection levels only when and where they are forced to do so."
"It is impossible to quantify the human, social and environmental costs of the Deepwater Horizon disaster in financial terms."
"However, oil extraction operations must be appropriately insured to cover worst case scenarios."
"This is the only way to ensure that the taxpayer will not be obliged to bear the cost of clean-up operations, while local companies and communities affected by oil spills can receive the compensation to which they are entitled."
"The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico must stand as a warning for Europe as well."
"We must do everything possible to prevent this kind of disaster occurring in our own seas."
"I believe that the resolution approved today is a step in the right direction to ensure the protection of marine and coastal environments in Europe."
"I also believe it is imperative for the Member States to examine urgently all aspects of oil extraction and exploration in the European Union."
"Safeguarding our planet must be a priority, above all, to guarantee future generations a sustainable environment."
"We must therefore approve tough legislation in this sector as quickly as possible in order to ensure the application of high safety standards to all existing oil platforms and to limit future extraction."
"Contribution of biodiversity and ecosystems to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals - Conference on Biological Diversity - Nagoya 2010 (debate)"
"Τhe next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"the oral question to the Council by Jo Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on key objectives for the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity in Nagoya, 18-29 October 2010 - B7-0467/2010);"
"the oral question to the Commission by Jo Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on key objectives for the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity in Nagoya, 18-29 October 2010 - B7-0468/2010);"
"the oral question to the Council by Michèle Striffler, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the contribution of biodiversity and its ecosystem services to development and the achievement of the MDGs - B7-0464/2010);"
"the oral question to the Commission by Michèle Striffler, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the contribution of biodiversity and its ecosystem services to development and the achievement of the MDGs - B7-0465/2010)."
"deputising for the author. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a few days ago, I was sitting down with a group of journalists talking about matters that were particularly close to my heart this autumn."
"One of these, quite rightly, is biodiversity."
"As you know, the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity is shortly to be held in Nagoya, and I have the honour and the pleasure of participating as part of the parliamentary delegation and as co-author of the resolution on biodiversity that will be voted on in Nagoya."
"So I was sitting talking to the journalists when I was asked why we permit ourselves the luxury of, say, saving the beaver."
"My home region of Lower Austria has succeeded in saving a species that was threatened with extinction and these have now spread out over a wide area - somewhat to the chagrin of farmers and foresters, whose feelings on the beaver are rather different."
"While the European Union and many agencies in the Member States work very hard and with great commitment, supported by NGOs, to protect species, this conversation demonstrated once again that many people see the protection and maintenance of biodiversity as something of a luxury."
"They ask whether the EU has nothing more pressing with which to concern itself than saving a couple of threatened orchids or animal species."
"Does it make any difference, people often ask, whether there are 500 or just 499 different animals to gaze at in the zoo?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, for these people, the subject of species preservation and biodiversity is hardly a priority."
"Let us be honest; the subject of biodiversity is nowhere near as high on the political agenda as topics such as economic growth or security."
"It should be, however, because we are underestimating the importance of this matter."
"The matter of species preservation - and this is my point - is not some kind of charitable institution for a few poor little bugs that we should simply manage to do without."
"Do not misunderstand me: species preservation is indeed related to a love of flora and fauna, but principally, it concerns security, labour market policy and migration policy."
"For what is often forgotten in discussions of biodiversity is the role that animals and plants play in our ecosystem."
"They are nature's service providers that keep our ecosystem running."
"It is thanks to the multitude of different species and their interaction with each other that coastlines are not eroded away, that avalanches do not occur, and that bodies of water are self-cleaning."
"We are talking here about an essential element of sustainable development, with their vital goods and services such as providing food, binding carbon and regulating waters - things that form a basis for economic welfare, social well-being and quality of life."
"If the species die out, the natural equilibrium is disturbed - triggering a dangerous domino effect."
"Replacing the services provided by these plants and animals is an expensive business."
"Eventually, certain regions and habitats become no longer habitable or can no longer be used."
"As a consequence, these habitats may no longer be able to provide the ecosystem with their valuable goods and services."
"Not only that; the possible further consequences such as unemployment, lack of security and emigration are things we all fear."
"Protecting species is thus quite clearly a matter that affects a number of policy areas."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety emphasised this recently, having worked intensely on ascertaining the position of the European Parliament."
"I should also like to mention a few figures."
"Scientists estimate that replacing these natural services and dealing with consequences such as unemployment and migration would cost 7% of gross income worldwide."
"If that does not astonish you, then here are some more figures."
"According to the latest study by the European Commission, 25% of European animal species are threatened with extinction."
"The same study also says that the coastal ecosystems of Europe are constantly being destroyed."
"Certain regions that have considerable biodiversity are similarly in decline."
"In contrast, areas of manmade development such as industrial parks, residential developments and transport infrastructure have increased by 8% since 1990."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as you will be aware, the actors negotiating in Nagoya do not always agree on what the conference hopes to achieve."
"Developed countries want strong goals, NGOs want ambitious goals, while - not surprisingly - the economic players are happy with realistic goals."
"In my opinion, the EU must set the bar high in Nagoya and, just as here in Europe, must work to bring the business community more on board - particularly those sectors and branches of industry that make significant use of biological resources."
"The EU can decide whether it wants to be a good example or a poor one."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is October already and many people in Europe have not even heard yet that this year has been designated the International Year of Biodiversity."
"Let us together ensure that biodiversity is given the status that it deserves and that it needs if it is to continue to offer its ecological services in the future."
"Allow me to repeat an oft-quoted Indian proverb: 'Only after the last tree has been cut down, only after the last river has been poisoned, only after the last fish has been caught, only then will you find that money cannot be eaten'."
"deputising for the author. - Madam President, I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in this debate."
"Last week, I chaired Parliament's delegation to the UN summit on progress towards the Millennium Development Goals."
"For the duration of the summit and at each side event, I was gripped by the enthusiasm of my colleagues, governments, international organisations and the people on the ground who are committed to achieving the ambitious targets set in 2000."
"Some progress has been made and there is much we can be proud of, but much more needs to be done."
"Access to education is rapidly improving."
"Enrolment in education has reached 76% in Sub-Saharan Africa and 94% in North Africa."
"Access to drinking water is increasing."
"By 2015, 86% of those living in the developing world will be able to access clean drinking water - up from 71% in 1990."
"Targets for accessing drinking water have already been met in four regions - Northern Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, East Asia and South-Eastern Asia."
"Access to energy is increasing."
"There is near universal access to electricity in North Africa."
"However, although progress has clearly been made, there is so much more that needs to be done."
"It was put to us by an Assistant Secretary of the United Nations that we really do need 'a dash to the finish' over the next five years."
"One billion children live in poverty, 1.4 million children die each year from lack of access to safe drinking water, and 2.2 million children die each year because they have not been immunised by vaccines that are so easily accessible in the developed world and which we have had for over 30 years."
"Goal 7 of the Millennium Development Goals is to ensure environmental sustainability."
"Within this goal, there are several sub-targets."
"Target 7b is perhaps the most encompassing: 'reduce biodiversity loss, achieving, by 2010, a significant reduction in the rate of loss'."
"The indicators of biodiversity include, inter alia, the proportion of land area covered by forest, CO2 emissions, the proportion of total water resources used, consumption of ozone depleting substances, and the proportion of fish stocks within safe biological limits."
"The reduction in biodiversity loss is therefore a key component of the Millennium Development Goals."
"Seventy per cent of the world's poor live in rural areas and depend directly on biodiversity for their survival and well-being."
"The urban poor also rely on biodiversity for ecosystem services, such as the maintenance of air and water quality and the breakdown of waste."
"There can be little doubt that biodiversity and climate change will affect the world's poor first."
"It will affect countries like Tuvalu in the Polynesian islands - a country that is merely four and a half metres above sea level - and the Maldives, where President Nasheed held an underwater cabinet meeting this year to highlight the fact that by the end of the century, his country could indeed be under water."
"I am calling on the Member States and the Commission to give new impetus to the global climate change alliance and its support facility in order to increase developing countries' capacity-building and knowledge base on the expected impacts of biodiversity loss and to effectively integrate it into development plans and budgets."
"I have also highlighted the fact that programmes aimed at the protection of biodiversity and poverty reduction must address the priorities of the poor and put more emphasis on locally-based environmental management, ensure access to biodiversity resources, land reform, and acknowledgement of customary tenure."
"By 2050, there will be two billion more people on the face of the earth and 90% of these will be born into what is now the developing world."
"If we allow abject poverty to continue in those countries, there will be massive migration from south to north and inequality could well be the cause of a world conflagration."
"Many of us did not believe we would see the Berlin Wall come down in our lifetime."
"Now we take it for granted that the former Soviet-dominated countries are our EU partners."
"The wall of poverty between north and south can also come down and we can make a world that is better and safer - a place where we can have new partners and an environment safe for us all."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, the European Union's strategic objectives for Nagoya are set out in the Council conclusions of 22 December 2009 and 15 March 2010 and will be further elaborated and refined by the Environmental Council on 14 October 2010."
"Three issues stand out, in particular, as priorities for the European Union."
"The first is the adoption of the new strategic plan for the convention for the period 2011-2020."
"It should reflect the best available scientific knowledge about the state of biodiversity and provide an effective framework of implementation that is sufficiently ambitious to trigger step-up action by all the parties to the convention."
"This is vital if we are to prevent further species extinctions and enable biodiversity to continue providing the essential goods and services that we all depend on, and especially the poor."
"The second strategic priority for the European Union is to conclude negotiations on the Protocol on access and benefit sharing as a key contribution to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity beyond 2010 and in line with the commitment taken by all the parties at COP 8 in 2006."
"This is an expectation widely shared by developing country parties to the convention, many of which see it as their top priority."
"The third is to ensure that adequate resources are mobilised to enable the implementation of the post-2010 biodiversity policy framework, including the new strategy plan."
"The EU as a whole is committed, as part of its 2020 biodiversity target adopted earlier this year, to step up its contribution to averting global biodiversity loss, but I think we can also be pretty proud of what we are actually doing."
"Over the period 2002-2008, the European Union provided over USD 1 billion, approximately EUR 740 million, for global biodiversity annually, largely through the Thematic Programme on Environment and Natural Resources under the Development Cooperation Instrument, but also the EDF, both of which include adequate provisions for biodiversity."
"Member States have also contributed significantly to the recent replenishment of the Global Environmental Facility, for which USD 1.2 billion is earmarked for biodiversity."
"This represents a 28% increase compared to the last replenishment, and the new EUR 1 billion MDG initiative announced by President Barroso at the UN General Assembly in New York last month can clearly also benefit biodiversity."
"The Commission is currently updating its own biodiversity-related development cooperation figures, using the same methodology as it has used to account for climate-related funding, and we are, of course, encouraging Member States to do the same so that we can present a consolidated figure in Nagoya."
"We also need to look at other ways of how we can contribute to enhancing implementation of the Convention on Biodiversity and help developing country parties deliver on their commitments under the convention, in particular, the new post-2010 strategic plan that will be adopted in Nagoya."
"We intend to explore ways and means to do this, together with our partners in Nagoya."
"Biodiversity loss is not a new challenge to poverty alleviation, as already mentioned."
"The 2010 Biodiversity Target was incorporated into MDG 7 already in 2002 and the EU itself has explicitly underscored the important linkages between biodiversity and development on many occasions."
"Just last month in his statement during the High-Level Event on Biodiversity at the United Nations General Assembly, President Barroso remarked that our ability to end poverty and hunger and improve child and maternal health depends on the long-term availability of fresh water, food, medicine and raw materials that nature provides."
"This is also recalled in the 2010 MDG report, in the EU policy framework to assist developing countries in addressing food security challenges, and in the Commission's Policy Coherence for Development work programme 2010-2013, which includes a specific target for biodiversity and accompanying indicators as part of the operational framework to enhance the coherence of EU policies with development objectives."
"What is perhaps new is the increasing knowledge and awareness about economics of biodiversity loss and the extent to which this undermines prospects for alleviating poverty in the long term."
"The international study of The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) shows how costly biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation is to our economies, including the economies in developing countries."
"So it is not any more a moral question; it is actually a question of our quality of life, and yet the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystems is not seen as a development priority."
"It is hoped that TEEB will go some way towards changing this situation so that more of our developing country partners give higher priority to biodiversity conservation and sustainable use in their development strategies but, even where it is not a focus of action in country and regional support strategies, European development policy nevertheless requires that environment and sustainable management of natural resources be treated as a cross-cutting issue to be integrated into all development activities."
"Both the Development Cooperation Instrument and the European Development Fund include provisions for addressing biodiversity."
"To conclude, with regard to mechanisms for ensuring the right of access to information and public participation in decision making related to biodiversity, the EU fully supports the draft COP 10 decision on the strategic plan, which urges parties and other governments to enable broad and effective participation in the full implementation of the objectives of the convention and strategic plan."
"We also believe that the Protocol on access and benefit sharing should oblige contracting parties to establish domestic frameworks that allow indigenous and local communities to take prior and informed decisions on whether or not to give access to their traditional knowledge."
"I would endorse everything said by the authors of the questions and I am truly grateful for their valuable contributions."
"Madam President, Mrs Schauvliege, Commissioner, the most important thing we shall be asking of you tomorrow in our resolution will be ambitious yet realistic objectives in Nagoya."
"The intelligent approach would be to agree measures there that not only safeguard biodiversity but also combat the effects of climate change, help to achieve the Millennium Development Goals - about which a good deal has been said already - and create green jobs, not least in the European Union."
"Four birds with one stone - that is what I call value for money."
"In order to achieve this, however, the European Union does need to speak with one voice."
"I have to be honest with you: my spirits are sinking a bit in that regard."
"I have heard many references to Council statements from previous years and from March of this year, but I have heard little in the way of specifics."
"Nevertheless, I should hope that the thoughts of the Commission and also of the Council have advanced since the generalities in the 15 March statement."
"I hope so, at least - we shall see on 14 October."
"I also hope that we learn from our past mistakes; that we do not go to another international summit armed with a mandate characterised by vagueness and generality and that we, the European Union, do not again spend all our time there in mutual consultations on how to react to developments, leaving no time to play the leading role for which Mrs Kadenbach, among others, has called."
"The final point to which I should like to draw attention concerns the mainstreaming of biodiversity into other policies."
"We, Parliament, called for such coherence in the field of the environment and other policies in the recent report on biodiversity in the European Union; similarly, we must also mainstream biodiversity at international level."
"Biodiversity is not just a matter of the environment or of the Millennium Development Goals; in other spheres, too, such as the World Trade Organisation (WTO), non-trade concerns such as biodiversity must be placed much higher on the agenda."
"Commissioner, I know that biodiversity is something you hold dear."
"I hope that you do convey this message about international mainstreaming to your counterparts at international level."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Madam President, I was also at the UN with Mr Mitchell and represented the Parliament on the issue of the MDGs."
"I want to congratulate the Commission on what they are doing, but I want to inform the House that we in the EU lead internationally on these issues - on biodiversity, on climate change and, indeed, on the MDGs' poverty alleviation - but, interestingly, at the UN, we are only given observer status."
"That must change, as we lead the world on these issues."
"We have the Year of Biodiversity, but I would suggest that every year should be the year of biodiversity."
"Our citizens - maybe in the visitors' gallery, maybe watching at home - will ask what this has got to do with them."
"Without public awareness and the raising of awareness, nothing will change."
"They must realise that the tin of tomatoes that they pick up in the supermarket would not be there if it were not for biodiversity."
"We need a 360 degree awareness of what this means."
"As Mr Mitchell brilliantly put it, this wall of poverty - and, may I add, deprivation - must come down."
"We talk of policy coherence in this House, but let me just refer to some of these issues: without policy coherence on access to energy in the developing world, deforestation, climate change, food security, the reform of the common agricultural policy, the common fisheries policy, land grab, natural resources and access to water, we will never protect biodiversity and we will never end the suffering of the world's poor."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, as we discuss the European position at the Nagoya Summit, outside this House, a hunt is being undertaken: a relentless hunt for resources, a hunt for oil and gas, minerals, timber, food and water, a hunt for resources that are all provided by nature."
"In this hunt, Chinese investors want to construct a highway through the Serengeti National Park to exploit the resources of Central Africa."
"There are Saudi investors putting billions of dollars on the table to build 6 000 kilometres of roads through the rainforests of the Congo to start huge palm-oil plants."
"We all want to stop the loss of biodiversity, but in the real world, this hunt for resources is frustrating our goals."
"That is reality."
"Therefore, the only way to stop the loss of biodiversity is by radically changing our behaviour."
"We need biodiversity for food, shelter, medicines, clean air, water, and so on and so forth. We simply cannot survive without it."
"We are reaching a tipping point at which damage is irreversible and, even worse, accelerating."
"That is the sense of urgency of the Nagoya Summit and that is the sense of urgency I expect from the ministers and commissioners who attend."
"Unfortunately, political declarations and resolutions will not be sufficient to reach this sense of urgency."
"We need much more pressure."
"For that reason, I have started an online campaign, along with many colleagues from all over the world."
"I want all of the people to have their voice heard on this issue; because people care about this."
"Go through Facebook to stop biodiversity loss and support this campaign."
"I will, together with many colleagues, present the thousands of signatures to the decision makers in Nagoya, to let them know that people depend on their perseverance and persistence to make Nagoya a success."
"Madam President, Mrs Schauvliege, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the commitments made in 1992 in Rio and in 2002 in Johannesburg have not been respected."
"Our strategies for halting the loss of biodiversity have been a failure, and we know the reasons for this failure."
"The climate is changing, biodiversity is diminishing, and humanity must be determined to adapt itself more and more quickly, and in ways which are more and more difficult."
"In Nagoya, with a few weeks to go before Cancún, the European Union has the opportunity to argue in favour of adapting our economic development model to face up to the challenges of the 21st century."
"Climate deregulation, halting the loss of biodiversity and combating poverty: these three challenges, and the responses needed to face up to them, are intimately linked."
"We have the responsibility of proposing and introducing a new development model which is fairer, more equitable and more sustainable."
"So let us speak clearly and practically."
"Parliament's resolution identifies three key challenges which now raise several questions about the Commission's and the Council's position."
"The first challenge, of course, is to start protecting and restoring biodiversity."
"This presupposes adequate financing, the withdrawal of all public aid which is harmful for biodiversity and a dedicated budget which we propose should be multiplied tenfold."
"However, is the European Union ready to commit 0.3% of its GDP to its policy for halting biodiversity loss and to convince the OECD countries to do the same?"
"The second challenge is the cost of biodiversity loss to society, which has only just begun to be evaluated."
"It is thought to be around 1% of global GDP, but this evaluation does not take into account the social, cultural, moral and scientific value of biodiversity."
"Is the European Union determined to resist the monetisation of living things?"
"Is it determined to defend the common inheritance of humankind and to reaffirm that nature is priceless and is not for sale?"
"Finally, the third challenge is to stop the pillaging of genetic resources by businesses and industries."
"One solution is to regulate access to genetic resources in a way which, in particular, respects fully the rights of indigenous and local communities."
"The European Union will still have a particular responsibility in these negotiations."
"As such, is it determined, firstly, to defend the principle of the non-patentability of life and, secondly, to support the repayment of the ecological debt to the countries of the South by supporting the retroactivity of the system which is to be adopted?"
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, biodiversity is not some abstract word that is used by abstruse scientists to look after some environmental peculiarity."
"Biodiversity is the very core of our survival on this planet as a human race."
"Take, for example, a recent calculation done by Dr Pavan Sukhdev about the loss of biodiversity and the value of that loss."
"His findings show that deforestation alone - the loss of the Earth's lung, which changes carbon dioxide to oxygen and which enables us to breathe - is costing USD 4.5 trillion every year."
"Every year, we are losing in replacement costs 4.5 trillion US dollars' worth of oxygen manufacturing process."
"That is about the size of the New York Stock Exchange."
"If, every year, we lost an asset with the value of the New York Stock Exchange, I am sure everybody in this room would be up and running around, but because it is biodiversity, nobody seems to care."
"That is an enormous amount of funding that would be required to replace the loss of oxygen that we cut down by cutting these trees."
"Take the collapse of the Newfoundland cod fisheries in the 1990s."
"It has cost CAD 2 billion in replacement costs."
"If we lose - as we are doing - some of the pharmaceutical genetic material which comes from biodiversity, we will be losing about 640 billion dollars' worth of raw materials."
"This is a very serious issue and we need serious people making serious decisions."
"Madam President, in two weeks' time, we shall all be heading to Nagoya, Japan, to discuss biodiversity."
"I wonder whether bluefin tuna or whale will be on the menu served up by our hosts."
"However, the big debate there will once more concern whether to start by coming forward with money or by talking about objectives."
"Developing countries would prefer us to start by putting money on the table and the EU would prefer to start by discussing objectives."
"One thing is clear, however, and that is that we have to halt the loss of biodiversity no matter what."
"The costs of failing to act are estimated to exceed USD 4 000 billion by 2050."
"Failure to act is not an option, therefore, and so I am disturbed that, inter alia, the new Dutch Government means to reduce the budget for development aid - one of the most vital financial resources for combating biodiversity loss in developing countries - by EUR 1 billion."
"If the EU really wants to achieve something in Nagoya, it must take the lead and develop sound agricultural and fisheries policy itself rather than waiting until after Nagoya to come up with proposals on this."
"When reforming agricultural policy, we must look beyond merely sustainable agricultural policy and must take a firm stand."
"Therefore, I call on the Commission to transpose what is agreed in Nagoya into proposals that can be measured and monitored and to develop a long-term vision, so that, in 2011, we do not need to say once again that we have been unable to halt biodiversity loss."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - (DA) Madam President, biodiversity has a bearing on everything - quite simply."
"Therefore, we must fight to conserve it at the conference in Nagoya."
"However, as we are constantly felling forests, cultivating new land and damming rivers, there is clearly a lack of knowledge and ability when it comes to including habitats and ecosystems in national legislation."
"Everything from modern agriculture, fisheries, housing development, road networks and transport to numerous types of industry have a negative effect on the planet's biodiversity."
"Marine life is in a poor state."
"Over 60% of all fish and shellfish eaten in the EU are caught outside the EU."
"We have overfished, and stocks are having a difficult time recovering."
"The Baltic Sea has a historically high level of pollution."
"Pregnant women in Sweden were advised not to eat locally caught fish."
"The EU Member States may have taken steps towards improving natural conditions, but where is the rest of the world?"
"What can we do to help other parts of the world to progress in their development?"
"Global biodiversity will diminish as a consequence of human activities - whether we have global warming or not."
"However, we must not make unrealistic demands here."
"Biodiversity is best served by remaining realistic."
"It is therefore high time that we found practical, realistic solutions to preserving healthy terrestrial environments, healthy flora and fauna, as well as healthy aquatic environments."
"(RO) I would like to begin by emphasising that it is absolutely imperative for the European Union to adopt a clear, united position on the issue of biodiversity for the COP 10 meeting in Nagoya."
"Failure to adopt such a firm, consistent position would result in another scandalous outcome, like that of the CITES Conference in March 2010."
"This is why I would like the recommendations made by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety to be accepted without reservation, as they may offer the best guide which the European Union can use to draft an official position which our representatives will be able to support wholeheartedly in Nagoya this month."
"In addition to these considerations, we must not forget that it is not only the European Union's credibility at stake as a clear thinking, responsible partner in the process of making global decisions but also, above all, the destiny of the planet's future."
"(DE) Madam President, let me begin with a detail."
"Commissioner Potočnik - whom I hold in very high esteem - gives figures in dollars, although he then converts these into euro."
"Mr Deva also gives figures in dollars."
"I have not looked into this in detail, but actually it demonstrates to us that the debate on biodiversity has clearly not yet arrived in Europe."
"Apparently, we in Europe are not yet capable of forming our own opinion on this and I think it would be a good idea if we could take this debate seriously enough to actually translate what it means in concrete terms into figures."
"I believe this is an elitist debate far removed from what is actually going on in the homes of our citizens."
"I believe that until we succeed in getting this debate into the homes and households of Europe, then we have no hope of it gaining political weight here in Parliament."
"In other words, I believe that the communication strategy that we should now adopt is simply to take this matter to the people, as I said, and once we know how people react, then we can set ourselves specific goals."
"The Commissioner has mentioned some very specific objectives."
"I hope he will be able to get these adopted in Nagoya and I also hope that the Community will speak with one voice."
"That is always the big challenge at these international conferences."
"I also believe that money alone is not enough."
"Many of my fellow Members have called for additional funding."
"That may be one way, but it is not sufficient to ensure success."
"Secondly, as I mentioned, we need to change our communication strategy; and thirdly, we need to improve the quality of the data that we have."
"It is clear that much data is still lacking and I believe that this is an area in which the Community, with its research problem, could yet do something specific."
"As you know, my pet subject is water."
"If we get the new fisheries policy off the ground, for example, then we will have a great deal of catching up to do as regards species that need protecting."
"The fisheries ministers will probably pass excessive fishing quotas again, and biodiversity will once again be pushed to the sidelines."
"For that reason, I believe this gives us a real opportunity to show in this House that we are serious in what we say."
"Let us see what shape the proposals take then."
"(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, representatives of the Council, we in this House are indeed hotly debating the objectives and implementation of the new objectives for biodiversity."
"However, at the moment, while we are engaged in debate, the negotiations are in danger of collapsing completely and we are to blame, the European Union is to blame."
"That is why I wish to address the Council and to call on it to change its stand."
"We need to 'unblock' negotiations on the ABS protocol, on genetic information access, and on benefit sharing."
"In fact, if we do not, not only will we be guilty of maintaining a situation which fosters bio-piracy and is a crime at present towards local communities and genetic resources; we will also miss yet another opportunity for the environment, the negotiations will collapse and we shall have a second Copenhagen."
"I therefore urgently call on the Council to examine this issue in depth."
"We need to change our stand before it is the European Union which, for the first time in its history, causes environmental negotiations to collapse."
"Madam President, the challenge we face in reversing the loss of unique species of life becomes depressingly apparent as this debate continues."
"A lot is going to be said at the biodiversity conference about the need to put in place the correct measures, but if all we end up with is a pious declaration, we will achieve very little."
"I hope we can put in place a set of targets and the financial support mechanisms - no doubt linked to access to biological resources - to make them worth something."
"I hope we can ensure that procedures are put in place to assess and confirm compliance, and I hope that we can put in place arrangements for frequent review of the targets and for improvements to be made to the procedures as time progresses."
"It is quite clear that this conference cannot possibly halt the loss of biodiversity; the pace is simply too rapid."
"However, if we can at least put in place the mechanisms and the structure that can eventually slow and perhaps one day reverse that loss, then it will be judged a success."
"(NL) Madam President, first of all, I should like to offer Commissioner Potočnik sincere thanks for his commitment to the conservation of biodiversity."
"We know that his heart is in the right place and that he is striving hard for this."
"In this respect, things are looking good in terms of Europe's commitment to Nagoya."
"However, we still need to agree objectives in part-fields such as fisheries, agriculture and forestry."
"We are still expecting ambitious objectives in all these fields, not least on Europe's part."
"Yet even more importantly, ultimately, when we return from Nagoya, this has to be translated into European policy."
"In the coming year, we are going to review our agricultural policy, and also our fisheries policy."
"The Commissioner has told us that he is also endeavouring to ensure that the term 'biodiversity' features clearly in this policy."
"Yet the Council is silent."
"Hence, the question to the President-in-Office, Mrs Schauvliege, as to what the Council is planning to do in the near future."
"We can, of course, make fine promises in Nagoya, but what are we going to do in the near future with regard to our own fisheries and agricultural policies?"
"That is when it becomes really important; otherwise, our promises in Nagoya will be nothing but empty words."
"(NL) Madam President, tomorrow, we shall be voting on the motion for a resolution on the Nagoya conference and, in my speech, I should like to call for attention to Amendment 1, which Mrs de Lange and I have tabled on behalf of our two groups."
"This amendment reconfirms the principle that life forms and living processes must not be subject to patents."
"It therefore requests a breeders' exemption, enabling the further development of plant varieties to take place freely."
"Without such an exemption, there is a danger that only the companies with the most money and the largest portfolios of patents will be able to survive."
"They would then be the ones to determine what species were placed on the market, and that would definitely not be to the benefit of biodiversity."
"Therefore, I make an emphatic call for your attention to and support for Amendment 1 in tomorrow's vote."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, from 18 to 29 October, COP 10 on biodiversity will take place in Japan, and it is important for Parliament to know what the Council intends to propose for the purpose of protecting and guaranteeing biodiversity."
"Research has shown that in a study on 4 000 plants, no less than 22% were classified as threatened."
"This means that one in every five plants is at risk of disappearing and - another alarming statistic - many plants will also disappear that have not yet even been discovered."
"The same thing applies to many animal species."
"Along with them, we risk losing active ingredients, in the case of plants, that are fundamental to industries that are engaged in developing new products that may help to combat diseases that are currently incurable."
"As far as animals are concerned, if they disappear, we will lose characteristics that are important for our planet."
"This September, the European Parliament approved an EU regulation on this topic with a clear vote that cannot fail to commit the Council to the same approach."
"We should not forget that the fight against poverty and thus, hunger too, is also fought by preserving the wealth of our natural resources, of our inestimable flora and fauna, a wealth that we cannot afford to lose and must do everything in our power to preserve."
"(IT) Madam President, in 2002, government representatives from around the world made a commitment to significantly reduce biodiversity loss by 2010."
"Despite the fact that this goal was brought up and stressed in various international forums, it was, unfortunately, not achieved."
"The rate of this loss from the planet has accelerated to a point where it is occurring at least 100 times faster than natural cycles, and during the last 50 years, it has reached unprecedented levels."
"In Europe, one mammal in six is at risk of extinction, and when one species disappears, it can create a domino effect with regard to all the others."
"Over the last 30 years, at least 30% of all animal and plant species on the planet have been lost."
"Without ambitious targets, to be adopted immediately, the biodiversity loss - this has already been stated more than once, and also reported by the WWF - that will occur between now and 2050 will cost Europe EUR 1 100 billion."
"Therefore, as Mrs Striffler emphasised in her question, safeguarding biodiversity represents an important aspect of the Millennium Development Goals and the Europe 2020 strategy."
"Promoting biodiversity means having more weapons in our arsenal to combat extreme poverty and hunger, through the implementation of environmental sustainability policies that maintain our rich and fertile planet."
"We need a new strategic vision and new targets that take into account the consistent species loss and reflect the importance that we attribute to this problem."
"(PT) When we talk about preserving biodiversity, we are also talking about fighting climate change, about food security, about public health, about fighting poverty, about achieving the Millennium Development Goals, and about the planet's sustainable development; in other words, about our collective future."
"As has already been said in this Chamber, the European Union must speak with a single voice at the Nagoya conference and do everything it can to obtain good results."
"Political will is needed in order to save the most threatened species of flora and fauna."
"Several Members have also already said that the costs of the loss of biodiversity are of the order of EUR 50 billion per annum: in other words, roughly 1% of gross domestic product."
"It has also been said, however - and there are studies demonstrating it - that by 2050, these costs may have increased to 7% of gross domestic product, but the return from investment in preserving biodiversity is 100 times greater."
"Biodiversity is essential to mitigating and adapting to climate change, given, for example, the role of land and sea ecosystems as major carbon sinks."
"We therefore hope that good results will come out of the conference."
"That is what the European public is hoping for, and we also hope that the results will make them more aware of these challenges that we must all confront."
"Madam President, 'biodiversity' is a word I often hear bandied about by Eurocrats, MEPs and lobbyists out here in Brussels."
"But I wonder if anybody in here can actually define what it really means, because I bet my bottom dollar that none of you can."
"Oddly enough, I think it does matter that you understand what you are talking about if you are making laws for the whole of the EU."
"But what does the conveniently vague and ambiguous term 'biodiversity' actually mean?"
"Because the truth of the matter is that there is no correct number of species, whether it is on a Cumbrian farm or a Liverpool suburb or even in a Cheshire forest, and I defy the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety to come up with a proper definition or stop using such ragbag words."
"And, may I ask, where is the boundary of the biodiverse area?"
"Is it ever applied to offshore marine environments?"
"And if so, why are you so keen to build monstrous wind farms that are detrimental to wildlife and do not even work!"
"Let us be frank, you have not got a clue."
"There is no clear thinking, no coherent policy and no logic to what you are proposing."
"If you are going to preach, which is what you are doing, look in the mirror first, sort your own house out and let us start with the disaster which is the common fisheries policy."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Madam President, I wonder if the honourable Member would agree that we are losing unique forms of life on this planet each and every day and that there is a need for international action to try and counter that?"
"I did not hear anything in his remarks that suggested that he did agree with that but I invite him to explain his position to the House."
"Madam President, let us put a few facts in order."
"If you want examples of species which are disappearing, there are a lot of dodgy statistics out there - take polar bears as an example."
"People constantly say that the polar bear population has fallen."
"Yet the polar bear population is actually bigger now than it was in the 1940s."
"I agree that species are disappearing, but I do not believe that the European Union - which is fundamentally undemocratic, the British people have never had a say on it - is the forum to decide this matter."
"It should be done in nation states."
"(HU) Commissioner Potočnik, I would warn fellow Members against believing that the European Union can achieve its objective."
"It is right for us to wish to lead the way in Nagoya in protecting biodiversity, but even the European Union has not been able to stop biodiversity loss."
"Let us therefore be cautious and take a look at what our own tasks are."
"Commissioner Potočnik, who comes from a Slovenian farming family - I myself come from a Hungarian farming family - would also like to draw attention to the great contradiction between biodiversity and agricultural regulation."
"On the one hand, we are offering farmers support to set up artificial nests for birds, while on the other, we decree, for purposes of supporting grazing land, that the proportion of trees and shrubs may be no more than one third, and that farmers must cut out any trees in excess of that limit."
"In other words, we reduce the habitats of birds and other animals."
"The future common agricultural policy must reconcile biodiversity with agricultural subsidies."
"I agree entirely with the report that we must determine the value of environmental protection assets, including the market value of biodiversity, which is very difficult to determine."
"This is why it is very important for us to encourage and reward farmers in the future, since the market is not doing so."
"(RO) Ensuring environmental sustainability is one of the Millennium Development Goals, which has direct, major implications for human life."
"Pollution and the reckless use of agricultural land, forests and water resources cause climate change, which jeopardises the planet's natural resources."
"I would like to mention one of the most serious threats, which is the increasing difficulty in accessing water sources, presenting mankind with the gloomy prospect that, by 2050, around 45% of the world's population will be threatened by water scarcity."
"Unfortunately, it is only this year that the UN General Assembly has declared that the right to clean, good quality drinking water and the right to sanitation are basic human rights required to enjoy life."
"However, this declaration is made at a time when already more than a quarter of the planet's population has no access to drinking water and suitable sanitation."
"The morbidity and mortality rates resulting from drinking water unfit for consumption remain, in these circumstances, alarmingly high, especially among children."
"This is why I believe that the European Union must push at the Nagoya conference for a much quicker and more precise solution to these problems in the developing world, which are exacerbating poverty and the lack of prospects."
"I think that the historical responsibility which developed countries have for the material and ecological state of the planet should provide a further argument in support of policies which will go against the current trend of encouraging the unsustainable exploitation of natural resources in developing countries dependent on raw material exports."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, on 18 October the Tenth International conference on biodiversity will open in Japan."
"This will be attended by the European Union, despite the fact it has not achieved the target set in 2001, in other words, that of halting biodiversity loss by 2010."
"Recent studies show that our natural resources are seriously threatened, particularly marine areas of Mediterranean countries."
"The European Union has set in motion important actions to combat climate change but must make a greater commitment to protecting biodiversity: an undertaking to increase funding for the Natura 2000 programme and more incisive action by the Commission to exercise the supervisory powers invested in it by the treaty."
"What action is being taken to reduce the delay in applying the Natura 2000 directives?"
"(RO) If we reflect on not only the environmental, but also on the social and financial impact of the destruction of biodiversity, we cannot underestimate the importance of the forthcoming Nagoya conference."
"The ecological disaster which has occurred in Hungary, killing four people, has affected seven towns and the ecosystems of a number of rivers, threatening to reach the Danube and the Danube Delta in Romania."
"It provides us not only with a sad backdrop to today's debate, but also with a serious jolt into taking stronger measures to protect the environment and biodiversity."
"It is time for us to reignite the debate about the ban on using hazardous substances in the mining industry in order to put an end to these tragedies."
"The resolution on biodiversity presented by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety contains many important points."
"However, I would like to highlight a few of them which I regard as being essential."
"First and foremost, the main objective of the negotiations should be to adopt ambitious, specific targets which are relevant to a number of areas and sectors of activity, ranging from construction and transport to forestry and agriculture."
"(SK) As a member of the Committee on the Environment, I am extremely concerned about the results of recent studies that present alarming statistics on biodiversity loss in the European Union."
"The urgency of this problem demands even greater efforts at the level of the EU and the Member States, and I therefore consider it essential for the Commission and the Member States to act in unison at the conference taking place at the end of October in the Japanese city of Nagoya in order to increase the effectiveness of their approaches and to achieve measurable and realistic targets with binding time limits."
"I would also like to emphasise the need to raise awareness in the private sector of the economic benefits of the fight to preserve biodiversity and of the return on investment in its preservation."
"Biodiversity loss is already reducing people's level of well-being and causing losses running into the billions, which are due to rise to several trillion by 2050."
"(RO) Europe can be split into nine distinct biogeographical regions according to similar climatic, topographical, geological and vegetation features."
"The Danube region is among the top 20 ecoregions in the world."
"This region's biodiversity is extremely rich."
"It is home to 2 000 plant species and 5 000 animal species."
"Since 1991, the Danube Delta has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the Danube region includes several Special Protection Areas and Special Areas for Conservation within the framework of Natura 2000."
"As the Danube and the Danube Delta have a unique and fragile ecosystem, which is home to rare plant species that are under threat due to pollution, we believe that it is important for the European Commission sometimes to enhance forecasting and response capabilities for flooding, extreme drought and accidental pollution."
"The European Union has adopted a number of measures to protect diversity, especially biodiversity."
"Nature is not only an important part of Europe's heritage and does not only provide economic benefits, but it also offers numerous valuable services, such as water purification, flood control, prevention of soil erosion, pollination of crops and leisure activities."
"The farming of land, the rapid process of urbanisation and the development of the transport infrastructure have had a severe impact on the natural habitat and, for example, large-scale drainage schemes have reduced a large section of the natural floodplains."
"(FR) Madam President, the successive conferences on biodiversity protection, rather than offering solutions, are, at best, a way of keeping the rather paltry balance sheet up to date in this area."
"Is this a question of money or of responsibility?"
"I would say both."
"Forests, which contain the majority of species, are threatened by corruption and indifference, among other things."
"Corruption - for which the leaders of developing countries are as responsible as those who profit from bad governance - only partly explains the failure in this area."
"As for indifference, let us remember that our consumption habits are not neutral, either, in this regard."
"How can we be more responsible?"
"As I do not have much time, I will take just one example: forest certification."
"Models are in place."
"Can the Commission tell me if, in its opinion, the restrictions on imports, as well as the introduction of the two systems of forest certification, are helping to limit the damage in this area?"
"Is there an evaluation, and if so, could you tell us about its main conclusions?"
"Madam President, if the EU is to have any credibility in Nagoya, it has not only to propose strategic plans but also to act on its present policies at home."
"The compromise proposal the Commission is presently preparing to allow a continuation of the exportation of the acutely endangered European eel, a CITES Appendix II species although it clearly qualifies for CITES Appendix I, is nothing other than a shame."
"The European eel stock, one common stock, has declined by 40% since 2007."
"If the EU is to have any credibility at all at Nagoya or in the next CITES meeting, there can be no other option than the implementation of a total export and import ban on eels."
"It should not listen to a small fishing sector that wants to export baby glass eels - threatened glass eels - to Japan for the present price of EUR 600 a kilo."
"(PT) The preservation of biodiversity, more importantly than any economic consideration, constitutes an ethical imperative and an essential condition for the future of the human species itself."
"Before the Nagoya conference, the European Union must learn from its failures in this area and set itself on the right path if it wants practical results rather than repeated and meaningless declarations of intent."
"Among other things, it will have to thoroughly change its sectoral policies."
"The reduction in the diversity of species and varieties being cultivated must be halted and reversed, as must the erosion of the genetic base on which food depends."
"The use of agricultural varieties specific to given regions must be promoted."
"The homogenisation of agricultural production, disease-spreading intensive models, and the abandonment of small- and medium-scale farming resulting from current agriculture and trade policy must be fought."
"Those are just a few examples."
"Biodiversity and the series of environmental equilibriums that are dependent on it constitute part of our planet's heritage: a common good that must not, under any circumstances, fall into private hands; a priceless common good that everyone must be guaranteed the right to make use of and enjoy."
"(DE) Madam President, 2010 is the International Year of Biodiversity."
"At European level, we already have excellent instruments for protecting biological diversity;"
"I am thinking here of the Natura 2000 networking programme or the Habitats Directive."
"However, any idea is only as good as its execution, and I regret to say that in many Member States, this leaves much to be desired."
"As members of the Committee on Petitions, our attention is constantly being drawn to serious problems in designated Natura 2000 sites."
"The Member States and the Commission must together take a leading role at the forthcoming conference in Japan."
"However, somewhere along the line, people will stop buying into this unless our words are followed up by visible action."
"(LT) Biodiversity is a difficult and complex issue which is, of course, important, both in the European Union and the world as a whole."
"However, it raises another issue: how do we balance environmental protection and economic growth?"
"That is probably the overall issue giving us the greatest headache."
"It is known that biodiversity loss is mostly related to irresponsible human economic activity."
"It might always be argued that environmental protection requirements hamper competitiveness because the European Union's standards are high, while those of other countries are not, resulting in certain problems in this area, and it is, of course, difficult to strike a balance."
"However, there could still be certain preventive instruments."
"I am talking about activities carried out in the European Union and the use of analyses to justify those activities."
"It is important for these analyses and the environmental impact assessment to be of a high quality and independent."
"Of course, realistically, it will be difficult to reach an agreement in Nagoya, but I would still like to wish the European Union and the Member of the Commission all the best."
"(PT) I welcome this debate with the Council and the Commission in which we can discuss the European Union's plans and main strategic objectives for halting the loss of biodiversity on the eve of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity."
"I hope that the European Union can take a strong and consistent position to this conference, with ideas about the specific measures that will be taken to ensure that biodiversity protection can contribute to sustainable development."
"I would point out that preserving biodiversity is fundamental to the quality of ecosystems, has direct effects on essential functions such as food production or the availability of water, and prevents landslides and floods."
"Finally, I would like to see the political responses intended to ensure the integration of biodiversity into the activities of economic sectors such as agriculture, forestry, fishing and tourism having the courage and ambition to protect this invaluable yet extremely fragile heritage - as in my region, the Azores - from outside interests that blindly threaten it."
"(ES) Madam President, this week, we have heard the wonderful news that more than 20 000 new species have been discovered in the sea."
"This is what the Nagoya conference is going to take responsibility for, not only so that these species continue to exist, but also so that even more species can be discovered and they do not disappear before we are aware of them."
"However, the credibility of the European Union - the Commission, the Council and the Member States - is not only going to be at stake in Nagoya."
"It will also be at stake a month later in Paris at the meeting of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, where the future of bluefin tuna, which is a highly endangered marine species, is going to be decided."
"It is this consistency that I think it is important to demand, because what the Commission says about maintaining biodiversity is good, in fact, it is very good, but it needs to be consistent when applying it to sectoral policies, for example, fisheries policy."
"It will be important and essential to observe how the consistency that we are going to see and hope to see - as we are demanding for Nagoya - is maintained in Paris, when we really understand that protecting bluefin tuna means protecting not only an animal, but also a way of life, a culture and, above all, a way of seeing the world that relates to humanity."
"Madam President, this has been a very interesting debate because we now conclude that biodiversity loss is a problem for the developed world and in the developing world."
"Gay Mitchell spoke very eloquently about the difficulties for the developing world when erosion of biodiversity occurs."
"He also spoke positively about where improvements have been made."
"In order to guarantee food security for the world, we need sustainable agriculture in a sustainable environment."
"I think another colleague mentioned that we have perhaps failed to communicate outside our own ranks, to those who are managing farms and ecosystems, about how important biodiversity is."
"We have failed to pay for it in the price we pay for our goods."
"As has been said, we have to put a market value on biodiversity if we are serious about reversing the loss."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, first of all, after hearing everything that the honourable Members of Parliament have said, I should say thank you because I think that the messages and the awareness which they are sharing, not only with me but, I hope, sharing with the whole European public, are more than clear."
"I should start by saying that we should hide nothing."
"We have failed in delivering 2010 biodiversity targets and we are responsible for that and we should do better."
"There are basically two lines on which we should and can act."
"One is our European line, the other is the international Nagoya line, about which you had more to say."
"But soon, after Nagoya, we will also come with the proposal for the European Union strategy on how to deal with this serious question and then, of course, many of the matters which you today underlined will have to be addressed."
"It will have to include a baseline, which we currently, finally, have."
"It will have to have measurable targets, not a lot, but a few that are the closest to something we would like to achieve: the best proxies for what we would like to pursue."
"Why a few?"
"Because this has to be fundamentally understood, so that we can share the understanding of biodiversity."
"We have done quite a lot in Europe up to now."
"I am very cautious when we talk about implementation of Natura 2000."
"I think that Natura 2000 will still give some advantages in the future but, when we talk about our strategy, I think we have to be ambitious, as we are when we talk about when we are going out, when we talk about international appearances."
"Many of you mentioned financing."
"I am not underestimating the question of financing, but do not fix your debate only on financing."
"It is much more than just financing and much more than just fresh money for biodiversity."
"It is about environmentally harmful subsidies."
"It is also about private financing."
"It is about many of the things which you in this House have adopted."
"Illegal logging is a typical example of how we can really help, and finance even, the countries which are exporting timber, also in Europe."
"I think it is extremely important that we understand that."
"As some of you mentioned, it is truly and fundamentally a moral and ethical question but, for those who do not understand that, it is becoming more than obvious that it is an issue of our quality of life and an issue of our economic success."
"It is important that this is understood too, because this was a turning point in the climate change debate, if you remember."
"I think it is important also that governments, not only in Europe, also our partners around the world, understand very well how important it is that they also engage their priorities in following the things that we are discussing in this House today."
"The next question which I would like to mention is access and benefit sharing (ABS)."
"For me, after sitting in New York discussing with practically all our partners, ABS will be an important, if not the breakthrough, issue in Nagoya."
"So we should do our utmost to ensure there is a breakthrough there."
"Of course, you can make a difference, but it is not only about you and, after all the discussions which we have had with the Member States recently, I can confirm that there is a strong willingness on the part of the Member States to have a breakthrough on that point."
"The next question is something which we will also need to discuss in the future, and how to deal with it is also closely connected with answering some other questions."
"You know that there were two Rio conventions."
"One was for climate change, the other was for biodiversity, and there was also the separate issue of deforestation, an important one."
"Increasingly, they are separate and they are developing in parallel; we are increasingly understanding that we should start to reconnect them."
"Many of the issues about mitigation and adaption in climate change have to do with biodiversity."
"Red Plus is as much for climate change as for dealing with biodiversity."
"So let us also prioritise the questions of biodiversity when we set the priorities on how we will use the money which is committed to Red Plus activities."
"And, when we talk about Millennium Development Goals, it is the same story."
"I met and talked with Helen Clark in New York about how we can cooperate better between the Commission and the UNDP in the future to ensure that these issues are more interconnected."
"The next issue which some of you underlined, and which I think is the basis of all the issues, is the integration of biodiversity, the mainstreaming of biodiversity in other policies."
"I fully share the view that if we want to talk about the CAP, the fisheries policy, cohesion and other policies, we have to take that angle into account, too."
"When we talk about the common agricultural policy - which will soon be on your table, you will soon be discussing it - I think we should develop more the concept of the public good."
"I believe that farmers should be partially repaid for what they do for us: they are providing food and we are grateful for that, but we should also be grateful to them for keeping up biodiversity."
"This is an important debate which lies ahead of us."
"Nagoya/Cancún are pretty much connected stories."
"It is not only about biodiversity; it is not only about climate change; it is also about the success of multilateralism and governance globally."
"So it is very important that we achieve success there."
"All your calls for us to speak with one voice are well heard."
"We are doing everything possible to make this true in reality and here, I would like to thank the Belgian Presidency for having a very constructive stance on that."
"The next thing which I would like to mention, and with this I am almost coming to an end, is a remark on euros and dollars."
"I took it positively but I am a bit afraid that, when we talk about biodiversity and international help, we will talk more about euros than dollars."
"So, finally, we have to come away from Cancún with something which is a success, which we can consider a success, and which will be connected with solutions, because there is simply too much at stake."
"We have responsibility, but I think it is fair to say others also have responsibility."
"But having Parliament firmly behind us is really helpful."
"Mr President, honourable Members, I should like to thank all the speakers who have underlined the importance of biodiversity."
"This is a very important message that has come across here in this debate."
"I have already discussed, in my introduction, many aspects that have been touched on here."
"There are certain points I should like to discuss in rather more detail."
"First and foremost, access and benefit sharing (ABS)."
"An important point to make is that the Council undertakes to complete the Protocol on access to genetic resources and benefit sharing (ABS Protocol) at the 10th Meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 10) to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) given that it will make a very important contribution to achieving all the objectives of the CBD."
"The development and implementation of the ABS Protocol must be regarded as an integral part of the process surrounding the CBD."
"Progress has already been made in this field in the recent discussions in Montreal, but it is true that a number of other issues need to be resolved ahead of COP 10."
"This will require sufficient flexibility from all the negotiating partners, and thus also internally within the EU."
"Secondly, as regards the motion for a European Parliament resolution, this resolution discusses the key elements of the biodiversity policy: the urgency to act, the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity, the overall mission, vision and goals of, and indicators for, the CBD and the CBD strategic plan, and also the more specific aspects such as ABS and synergies between the three Rio conventions, and so on."
"The conclusions on this should be adopted by the Environment Council on 14 October."
"As regards the question concerning the package and sectoral integration into areas such as agriculture and fisheries, I would remind you that, on 15 March, the Council expressly asked the Commission to propose a package."
"I understand from what the Commissioner said a minute ago that the Commission is working hard on this and that we can therefore count on it."
"The Council will be asked to adopt the conclusions on biodiversity at its meeting on 14 October - next week, that is."
"They will then serve as political guidelines for the negotiations in Japan in October."
"These conclusions are to form the basis for determining the important issues for COP 10 and also the Council's position on these: the revised, updated CBD strategic plan, the negotiations with a view to the ABS Protocol, the strategy for mobilising funding, particularly via innovative financing mechanisms, sectoral integration and synergies between the fight against climate change, desertification and policies to promote biodiversity."
"I should like to thank everyone who has underlined the importance of this."
"I also wish to thank the Commissioner for the constructive cooperation we have enjoyed up to now and also for the pleasant cooperation we are likely to enjoy in the run-up to, and on the spot in, Nagoya."
"I have received one motion for a resolutiontabled in accordance with Rule 115(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 7 October 2010."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Biodiversity is, and will remain, an important issue for the European Union, because biodiversity goes hand in hand with securing the food supply in Europe and therefore represents the prospects for a positive future for the next generations."
"European agriculture is aware of its important role as promoter and preserver of biodiversity."
"Through CO2 storage in soils or near-natural land management, our European farmers are actively contributing to the preservation of biodiversity."
"However, all of this effort will be of no benefit if there is little or no public awareness."
"We need to make European citizens aware of the fundamental importance of biodiversity for our countryside, our economy, our lives and our children's future, and to spur them into action."
"The European Union will not be spared from the extinction of a diverse range of species."
"Already today, numerous ways of life are under serious threat."
"Let us take action now and set the course for a species-rich future."
"I would like to emphasise, in the context of this debate, the important role played by 'The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity' (TEEB) project, funded by a number of European states, which calculates the financial value of nature and the costs incurred as a result of biodiversity loss."
"TEEB allows us to raise awareness about the magnitude of the challenges involved and to prepare the future decisions in this area."
"I would simply like to mention a few facts presented in recent TEEB findings."
"The cost of deforestation is rising to approximately USD 4.5 trillion per year."
"According to other similarly recent estimates, more than a quarter of the world's initial biodiversity disappeared by 2000, with the expectation of a further loss of more than 10% by 2050."
"I can give you more examples."
"In these circumstances, the timing of the Nagoya Summit could not be better."
"Furthermore, I believe that this parliamentary debate is particularly timely as well because it allows us, at EU level, to harmonise our position for the forthcoming summit."
"This year is a crucial time for stepping up global efforts and commitments in order to halt biodiversity loss."
"We must seize this moment to create a vision and some clear objectives concerning biodiversity and its sustainable conservation after 2010. We need to define a strong common position and ensure the European Union's active participation in future international negotiations."
"A long-term global vision must take into account the links between biodiversity, ecosystem services, climate change, desertification, economic prosperity and citizens' health and well-being."
"Achieving the proposed biodiversity objectives and targets is subject to mobilising the necessary resources to implement adequately the measures promoting conservation and sustainable use of natural resources."
"In this respect, Romania supports greater involvement from the private and public sectors in finding innovative solutions and mechanisms for funding biodiversity."
"Homo sapiens produces the most waste of all the biological species."
"Industrial pollution, municipal waste, CO2 production, noise, light smog, heat pollution and all the other known and unknown waste products of our civilisation create an enormous ecological footprint."
"The effect of the ecological footprint of our species is to prevent the continuing existence of certain other species in the planetary ecosystem."
"This is the basis for the present day decline in biodiversity."
"Biodiversity is a defining precondition for the existence of the planetary ecosystem in the metastable state which we know and which enables the existence of our own civilisation."
"The interdependency and interconnectedness of our existence with other forms of life on the planet is neglected, undervalued and played down."
"If biodiversity declines, the absorptive capacity of the planetary ecosystem will decline as well."
"The ecosystem will become less resistant and more susceptible to changes, including step changes."
"At a certain stage, it will then tip over into another state."
"The question is whether this new state will allow the continuation of our civilisation, or of the current number of people on the planet, and whether it will allow the very existence of our biological species."
"In the present time, it is no longer a question of one or another animal species, nor even of the protection of any individual ecosystem."
"It is a question of the preservation of our own species, of our own ecosystem."
"Unfortunately, we still behave like a patient suffering from cancer."
"We lie to ourselves and we fail to take the measures which might save our lives."
"Social provisions of the Lisbon Treaty (debate)"
"The next item is the Council's and Commission's statements on social regulations in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Mr President, thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak on behalf of Mrs Onkelinx, the Deputy Prime Minister, on the various new perspectives on social matters offered by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I truly believe that we have to look at the social advances in European law."
"Thus, Article 9 of the treaty provides for a horizontal social protection clause which obliges the European institutions to take into account requirements linked to the promotion of a high level of employment, the guarantee of adequate social protection, the fight against social exclusion, and a high level of education, training and protection of human health."
"This requirement follows the statement in Article 3(3) of the treaty that the internal market shall be constructed through policies based on a social market economy which is highly competitive and which tends towards full employment and social progress."
"Article 9 accordingly calls for the social dimension to be taken into account from now on in the definition of all European policies."
"This is about restoring a fair balance between aspects that we will have to realise in practice."
"This is a priority cross-cutting objective of the Belgian Presidency."
"In future, then, we will have to pay much more attention to the social impact of policies developed at European level."
"While we need to maximise economic growth within the European Union, we must also encourage the fair and just distribution across the board of the fruits of this growth, and we must take particular interest in the fate of the most vulnerable people."
"We must also take the social dimension into account in the Europe 2020 strategy, which, as you know, was adopted by the European Union during the June European Council."
"This strategy, which is targeted at employment and growth, incorporates the economic, social, employment and environmental dimensions."
"It is based on a limited number of quantified objectives and some guidelines."
"Of the five fixed objectives, one is specifically dedicated to the fight against poverty and social exclusion."
"It sets the objective of taking at least 20 million people in the European Union out of poverty by 2020."
"Along with guideline 10, it constitutes the social pillar of the strategy."
"Although we may be disappointed by its lack of ambition, it nevertheless shows a desire to attain a specific and clearly identifiable objective, which is new in this area, and it introduces a new dynamic of which we need to take advantage."
"The Member States will have to report each year, in their National Reform Programmes (NRPs), on the progress made in implementing this objective."
"It has always been my view that we must maximise the benefit of this social dimension of EU 2020."
"I want to make the Belgian Presidency a social presidency par excellence."
"In this context, the Europe 2020 strategy provides an opportunity for visibility: a European social policy."
"This will be a genuine challenge, because the Member States are busy defining their reform plans, and therefore their policies for achieving the quantified objectives, and, at the same time, they are busy working on their national budgets, which limit their financial freedom."
"In addition, the financial crisis is still recent, and the economic recovery is slow in making itself felt."
"As such, we must make sure that fiscal consolidation does not have a negative impact on employment and social policies."
"The EU 2020 growth strategy must be sustainable and inclusive."
"It must not be characterised by growth without jobs; it must show a desire to combat job insecurity."
"Thus, the fight against poverty really has to be a major concern of ours."
"In the Council, the Belgian Presidency is working hard to make this dynamic work, but it is also sensitive to the role that the Commission must play in this context."
"We would genuinely urge the Commission to be dynamic on this matter."
"I am thinking here of the flagship initiatives that it needs to adopt, especially the platform for combating poverty and social exclusion, which must offer a broader perspective on the social challenges which Europe faces."
"Among other things, the Commission must use this method to propose ways for us to specifically implement the new horizontal social clause in Article 9 of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"As you can see, the Belgian Presidency has a great deal of ambition, but I truly believe that it will meet the needs and demands of our fellow citizens."
"Without a social dimension, the European project is doomed to failure."
"Here too, you have your role to play in continuing the debate concerning this strategy, not only at European level, but also by highlighting the social dimension in your respective countries."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the horizontal social clause laid down in Article 9 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states: 'In defining and implementing its policies and activities, the Union shall take into account', inter alia, 'requirements linked to the promotion of a high level of employment, the guarantee of adequate social protection' and 'the fight against social exclusion'."
"The Commission is committed to implementing this clause, including through strengthening the assessment of social impact, as part of its overall impact assessment system."
"In relation to the specific situation of social services of general interest (SSGI), the Commission believes that it is important to ensure legal certainty for public authorities in the Member States."
"However, the Commission does not consider it necessary, at this stage, to set up a multi-stakeholder taskforce to tackle the difficulties some providers of SSGI are experiencing with the interpretation of the single market rules."
"The Commission is aware that a significant number of public authorities and stakeholders consider the EU rules applicable to social services as an obstacle to the organisation and financing of such services."
"However, consultations of public authorities and stakeholders show that the existing rules, to a large extent, take account of the specificities of social services of general interest."
"The problems reported are very often due to a lack of awareness of, and information about, the rules, or to doubts about the way such rules are to be implemented."
"For this reason, the Commission has put a strategy in place, including the interactive information service, the frequently asked questions documents and the training initiative for local public authorities."
"The Commission is in the process of updating the frequently asked questions documents."
"Once finalised, the Commission will present them to the Member States and the stakeholders within the Social Protection Committee."
"Another discussion forum with the Member States is the Advisory Committee on Public Procurement."
"A public consultation on the SGEI package - Services of General Economic Interest - which aims to clarify and simplify the application of State aid rules to those services, has just ended."
"The Commission will share its assessment of the contributions received with Parliament, the Committee of the Regions, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Member States."
"As the Commission has stated on numerous occasions, the specificities of social services will be duly taken into account in the revision of the package."
"In addition, the Commission has had a fruitful dialogue with the main stakeholders over the last few years on possible adaptations to the existing EU rules - in particular, within the Social Protection Committee and Parliament's intergroup on public services."
"In July, the Commission participated in a seminar organised by the Belgian Presidency with the Member States and various stakeholders."
"Once again, these discussions have shown that, while there is a strong and legitimate interest in fine-tuning, there was no real need to change the fundamental structure of existing EU rules in order to adapt them to the specificities of SSGI."
"This being so, the Commission is aware that the Belgian Presidency has put forward some suggestions with a view to clarifying and adjusting the existing rules."
"The Commission is carefully considering these suggestions."
"I also recall that the Third Forum on Social Services of General Interest, to be organised on 26 and 27 October under the auspices of the Belgian Presidency, will provide an opportunity to discuss these suggestions and possibly others as well."
"Lastly, the Commission is working within the Social Protection Committee on a voluntary quality framework for social services."
"The Commission has worked very closely with the main stakeholders, social partners, local authorities, service providers and users in drawing up such a framework."
"In summary, the Commission is committed to implementing the new horizontal social clause, including the relation to SSGI."
"As I have explained, there are numerous fora for discussion and dialogue with the SSGI stakeholders."
"The Commission, therefore, does not see the need to establish an extra taskforce."
"However, the Commission is committed to tackling the difficulties faced by some providers of SSGI with the interpretation of the single market rules, including under the forthcoming Single Market Act, to be adopted by the Commission before the end of October."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon did not give the European Union any fundamentally new powers in the area of social policy."
"Article 9 - the representative of the Council has already referred to this - expands the existing powers within the context of the basic principle of the social market economy, which is very important to the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), and which we introduced into the European Convention, which essentially prepared the way for the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Our second point is that with the report by former commissioner, Mario Monti, entitled 'Putting citizens at the heart of the Union', the European Commission made an interesting and valuable contribution to how we can succeed in combining the great positive impulses of the internal market with social elements of the common consumer market."
"For this reason, Commissioner Andor, we are expectantly looking forward to the so-called Single Market Act that Commissioner Barnier is currently working on. We believe that this can really get to grips with the Monti-Kroes package in a constructive way."
"However, we are sceptical as to whether the opening up of the public procurement directives and the creation of a concession directive will, in the end, really result in us putting the internal European market on the right track, since obviously, we are clearly against any inflation of the public sector."
"The representative of the Council has already made reference to this, but it is all the more important, as great and significant as social consolidation may be - and I say that as a member of the younger generation in this Parliament - that we include all the shadow budgets - the Freiburg-based professor Bernd Raffelhüschen has spoken of the fact that we have a series of hidden budgets as regards pension debts - when we consider social consolidation, and that we make a policy that also gives the younger generation a fair chance in the coming decade."
"I therefore believe that together - and the representative of the Council has already made reference to this - we face great challenges; that the European Parliament and the EPP Group have a shared view of this challenge and that we should all do everything we can to support the efforts by the European Commission in respect of both this package of measures for the internal market and, on the other hand, the social measures that must supplement this internal market, against the background of the social market economy."
"I am therefore looking forward to further debate and am grateful for your attention."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, first of all, I want to thank the Council and Commission for their statements today and I want to thank the ALDE Group, the Greens/EFA Group and the GUE/NGL Group for their support in having this matter on today's agenda."
"The new social clauses do not relate solely to services of general interest as implied by the EPP intervention earlier this afternoon and, as regards social services of general interest (SSGI), we need to come to conclusions on these matters which have been heavily debated over many years, rather than rehashing old arguments."
"As rapporteur on the future of social services of general interest, I look forward to working with all the groups which recognise the need for a strong social market economy and I hope to bring forward concrete proposals to resolve the dilemmas faced by providers of SSGI."
"As you are no doubt aware, Europe's citizens have high hopes regarding the development of a more coherent and dynamic social dimension to European policies and legislation following the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty."
"Indeed, one of those important debates in Ireland during the referendums on Lisbon concerned the new social clauses, including Article 3, Article 9, Article 14 and the social protocol, and indeed many others in relation to disability and equality."
"It is always important that we live up to citizens' expectations."
"It is doubly important at this time of economic and social crisis for many millions of our citizens who have already lost, and many more who will lose, their jobs, their homes, their savings, their pensions, their public health services and, indeed, educational opportunities for their children because of the crisis and the remedies being applied."
"It would be deeply destabilising for the European Union if the College of Commissioners and the European Council were to take the view that these new treaty articles change nothing and continue treating social objectives as secondary to market objectives."
"If we fail in our responsibilities, there are waiting in the wings extreme xenophobic and intolerant political parties willing to capitalise on the anger and the discontent that is out there."
"My specific request to the Commission today, and to the Council, is to accept that we need a dynamic process for making progress with regard to services of general interest, particularly social services of general interest."
"I regret the statement today by the Commissioner."
"I hope, over the next few months, to persuade him that he is wrong, that we do need a dynamic process, that we do need a high level taskforce which includes not only himself and other DGs but members of civil society, the trade unions, the Council and the Committee of the Regions."
"We need a mechanism which will drive the change which everybody recognises."
"Commissioner I have heard you saying, and I have heard Mr Barroso saying, that the stakeholders apparently tell you that there is no real problem."
"The stakeholders are not telling me that."
"I have met dozens of them in the past six months."
"They are telling me there are administrative problems and there are legal problems and that they need to be addressed urgently."
"They are not going to be addressed urgently, I am afraid, on the basis of what you and the Council said here today."
"I hope, as I say, I can change your mind over the next few months."
"However, there is an urgent need for a mechanism, a high-level mechanism which will include the stakeholders and ensure that the decisions that need to be made are made and followed through."
"I think it is most important that Parliament is involved in that process."
"We have to bear in mind that we must address the concerns and demonstrate that Europe is serious about creating a social market economy and not a single market on its own."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I have here a well-worn, annotated, underlined, dog-eared, tea-stained copy of the Lisbon Treaty."
"For 12 months, this was my constant travelling companion when I was trying to persuade Irish citizens to vote 'yes'. When Irish citizens asked me why they should vote 'yes', one of the top five reasons that I gave them was that this treaty would bring about a more social Europe."
"Just 12 months ago, we ratified this treaty and now we, as politicians, have to deliver on our promises."
"We have spoken about the new horizontal social clause - Article 9 - that obliges the Union to consider the social consequences of decisions when making its policies."
"This is a cross-cutting objective and it gives us greater scope to be more ambitious when writing, amending or implementing EU legislation, but Article 9 does not guarantee desired policy outcomes."
"It is a powerful tool which is at our disposal, but we have to ask ourselves whether we are using it or whether it is just window dressing."
"Social policy was poorly built into the original treaties, but I believe it is much stronger in the Lisbon Treaty."
"Apart from the Protocol on services of general interest, Article 14 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union has been mentioned."
"That clearly states the shared responsibility of Member States and the EU as regards SGIs."
"To date, the EU has applied internal market rules, but Article 14 states that in the application of the treaties 'the Union and the Member States ... shall take care that such services operate on the basis of principles and conditions, particularly economic and financial conditions, which enable them to fulfil their missions.'"
"That is a shift in EU policy and it must be reflected in the Commission's communications and proposals."
"Also, in the Council, the anti-discrimination directive is still blocked."
"That is an important piece of legislation."
"We need to see it implemented."
"So, while the fundamental principles are established and social policy legislation is protected in the Lisbon Treaty, the future direction of social policy is not settled definitively."
"We - the Commission, the Council and Parliament - can, and must, use the tools provided by Lisbon."
"(FR) Mr President, Mr Courard, Commissioner, the principal objective of the European Union, an objective which appears in the Treaty of Lisbon, is the development of a social market economy oriented towards full employment and social progress."
"It therefore contains a horizontal social clause which states that the promotion of a high level of employment, adequate social protection and the fight against exclusion must guide the definition and implementation of all EU policies."
"The recognition of social rights and, in particular, of the right to access services of general interest, is made binding in the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The charter contains rights and principles, such as the right to access social security payments, housing benefits and social services."
"On the eve of the Third Forum on Social Services of General Interest, initiated by Parliament, how can you claim that, in applying the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon, only the rules on competition and the internal market need apply to these social services of general interest, with no adaptation to their specific modes of organisation and financing?"
"Is it not true that the Services Directive, for example, calls into question the role of social services of general interest with a strong local base consisting of community members who are not aiming for financial gain?"
"When will you stop burying your head in the sand and when will you finally shoulder your responsibility as colegislator, in accordance with the provisions of the new Article 14 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union?"
"Mr President, I have to admit that the Treaty of Lisbon and its social commitments read well."
"However, we cannot ignore the fact that hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets in Brussels and other European capitals."
"They were protesting against a mistaken and unsocial policy towards the crisis."
"We have hardly begun to turn the corner from this, the worst of crises, yet we are already hearing from many governments that national debts need to be reined in."
"The emergency parachutes that are the rescue plans need to be folded away, they say, and investment programmes abolished."
"The Commission is calling for the Stability and Growth Pact to be tightened up."
"States in which reasonable wages and salaries are paid, in which the labour market still follows rules, or in which social security systems are too 'social' - which means too expensive - are to be penalised."
"The banksters are carrying on as if nothing had happened."
"Pensions and wages are to be cut, consumption taxes perhaps increased."
"Contributions to social health insurance are rising while services decline."
"In the light of the judgments of the European Court of Justice in the Viking, Laval and Rueffert cases, it is not only the trade unions that fear that the social balance of the European Union is in a precarious position."
"The call of the trade unions for a social protection clause deserves our full support."
"Employee rights, trade union rights and social protection need to be given at least the same significance as - and, indeed, precedence over - the internal market and freedom to provide services."
"This needs to be clearly laid down in primary law."
"I am pointing out these facts because the relevant paragraphs merely look good - in reality, they change nothing."
"Human dignity cannot be ensured without minimum social standards."
"A social progress clause would improve the badly damaged reputation of the European Union amongst the populace and help to stem social fears."
"(DE) Mr President, we are witnessing within the European Union what I believe to be a worrying development whereby more and more people are being pushed into temporary agency work, false self-employment and McJobs, and whereby the social rights of employees seem to be being pushed into the background."
"Not only does the European Court of Human Rights seem to be paring back worker protection standards in its jurisprudence, but it also rules out giving preferential treatment to socially engaged entrepreneurs when awarding public contracts."
"The Treaty of Lisbon was going to make everything better, we were told, but, personally, I have not seen much of any social turnaround."
"Attempts are being made, for instance, to reduce economic and social differences between the Member States using the European Social Fund."
"Yet, if the bringing to account and execution of projects leads to problems in many regions, the fund is failing in its mission."
"The freedoms of the internal market, I might point out in passing, all too often only involve the freedoms of the multinational conglomerates, which are squeezing out the local employers, which is to say the small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I believe that this needs to change as soon as possible."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, the Treaty of Lisbon unquestionably provides Europe with new social objectives."
"Sustainable development in Europe is based on the high competitiveness of the social market economy, which means full employment and social progress, the fight against social exclusion and discrimination, the promotion of justice and the eradication of poverty."
"The Treaty of Lisbon confirms the role of the social partners and promotes social dialogue between the trade unions and the representatives of employers' organisations at European level."
"On these various points, the actual situation is certainly not the one described by some speakers here."
"Today, we can dramatise the situation; it is true that there are worrying situations, that the crisis is not yet over, and that it has consequences."
"However, Europe is taking measures in this area - which we must explain to our citizens - to create some order in the financial sector, in particular, and in this regard, it is one of the first to be making efforts to organise that sector, on the basis of our work."
"Allow me to make a few short remarks."
"On services of general interest in particular, I will say clearly that we should take specific national circumstances into account, because it is true that some of our fellow citizens are a little alarmed - I am thinking, for example, of the French - when they feel, wrongly, that Europe is endangering the public services which are a French tradition."
"Likewise, in relation to public contracts, we should take account of individual circumstances, and especially of those which allow for collaboration between several public authorities."
"Nevertheless, social policy is dependent on the health of the economy and on economic growth."
"That is the primary objective of a social market economy."
"Mr President, unlike some of the other speakers, I do not believe that the Lisbon Treaty changes as much in the social policy field as in some other areas."
"We have had codecision in the employment field for many years now but, under the Title II provisions having general application, in Article 9 there is a reference to, among other things, the protection of human health."
"One directive that affects that is the Electromagnetic Fields Directive and I know the Commission has been looking at this."
"When we take the Electromagnetic Fields Directive through the whole procedure with the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we must ensure, and I hope Member States agree, that state-of-the-art MRI scanners can be used."
"Article 10 under Title II covers anti-discrimination."
"As several other speakers have said, it is most important that we make sure that the horizontal directive on access to goods and services is unblocked from the Council and make sure that those Member States that are blocking it lift their objections so we can have a true anti-discrimination directive on access to goods and services."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, it has to be said that what prevails in the application of the Maastricht Treaty is not at all what you describe: it is neither Article 9 nor Article 14 for protecting public services."
"Rather, it is the principles of competition, unrestricted free-tradeism, the weakening of social protection, the smashing of pensions and wages, and the rejection of fair fiscal harmonisation."
"For example, this year has been declared the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion."
"Let us note exactly what you have done which conflicts with that, Members of the Commission and of the Council."
"The decisions taken in these last few days pushing us towards super austerity, and the Commission setting itself up as a veritable tribunal to put it into effect, are in conflict with every single social project."
"Instead of believing that austerity and social regression will get the European Union out of the crisis, I think that we must use quite different reasoning; in fact, the opposite reasoning."
"Social progress is a lever for ending the crisis."
"I would therefore like to make a proposal to you, which I submit to the debate for further consideration."
"The proposal would involve creating a new system which would allow the European Central Bank to buy - including via the creation of money, as all banks in the world do now - all or part of the debt of the Member States if necessary, and, at the same time, to set up a European fund for human, social and ecological development."
"Backed up by the European Central Bank and the European Investment Bank, this fund should allow public services - or community services of general interest, if you like - to be expanded, and should provide aid for industry, research and training."
"(PT) The pressure being exerted by the Commission and the great powers of Europe on the countries with more fragile economies and higher levels of poverty flies in the face of all the principles of economic and social cohesion that the Belgian Presidency has spoken about here in the name of the so-called 'social clause' of the Treaty of Lisbon - Article 9."
"The truth is that it has only been possible to move outside the irrational criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact when it was necessary for the Member States to support the banks as a result of the problems they were experiencing because of the toxic waste that they had created."
"Now that the banks have soaked up billions of euros in public aid and the public debts of the countries with the greatest difficulties have rocketed, the pressure to reduce debts and deficits has returned with no thought for employment, social inclusion or the universal rights to public education and health care, housing, or living wages and pensions."
"In the name of the sustainability of public finances, the austerity measures being imposed in some countries, such as Greece and Portugal, are multiplying, social injustices are on the increase, and growing unemployment, poverty and social exclusion are threatening 120 million people in the European Union."
"Portugal will slip back into depression if the new austerity programme that the Portuguese Government has just announced goes ahead, which raises a few questions."
"What sort of social Europe is that?"
"In the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, where are the guarantees of minimum incomes with which to confront poverty?"
"Where does the integration of social and social sustainability objectives with macro-economic policy stop?"
"Where is the defence and promotion of public services?"
"When will there be a cross-cutting social guideline and an effective assessment of the social impact, of the policies of the Stability and Growth Pact, of competition policy, of the internal market, of budgetary and fiscal policy, and of monetary policy?"
"That is the aim of the workers' struggles that are multiplying across Europe."
"(DE) Mr President, the political goals are clear."
"We want a Europe with a sustainable social market economy, fundamental rights, no discrimination, full employment, an integrated social clause, social cohesion and services of general interest, which are to be defined through subsidiarity."
"That is our goal."
"However, we have too few instruments at the European level to achieve this goal."
"Most of the instruments are to be found at the Member State level."
"We need a balance between the economic, the competition policy and the social instruments if we are to be able to realise these goals across Europe."
"We should therefore broaden out monetary union into an economic and social union."
"We also need to clearly come out and say that we need more acts of solidarity and that training, getting people qualified, growth and employment are not elements to be played off against the social side of Europe; they are, in fact, a prerequisite if we are to combat poverty and exclusion and end the plight of the working poor."
"(FR) Mr President, I have just come out of a meeting of the Public Services Intergroup."
"I sometimes wonder if we speak to the same people."
"For you, everything is fine."
"The majority of the parties involved, at best, do not understand anything about European legislation, or they understand it only too well."
"You are talking about measuring the social impact of the European Union's policies."
"So I would say to you: there is a good area for you to work on - go on, I dare you!"
"If, as you claim, there is no problem with public services, and, in particular, with local public services, then commit yourself to undertaking a proper, exhaustive review of the liberalisation of public services across the European Union."
"Free and fair competition was supposed to lower prices."
"I am French."
"I will just give you some examples which perhaps explain why the French are a little wary about Europe on this subject: the prices of postal services, rail transport, air transport and water transport, which have been given over to private companies, have increased exponentially."
"The notion of universal service was supposed to guarantee that the most basic services were accessible to everyone."
"In reality, for the poorest people, it is barely enough, and instances of discrimination are increasing."
"What happened to your great redistribution of wealth, when we know that inequalities between the richest and the poorest continue to increase everywhere in Europe?"
"So yes, Commissioner, as many Members have already asked you, when will the Commission decide to take into account the consequences of Articles 9 and 14 of the treaties, as well as the protocol on social services of general interest; in other words, when will it respect the rights of Parliament?"
"Please, what are you afraid of?"
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission as a whole, as do I, believes that our objective is to develop a social market economy."
"I can say, for me personally and for my portfolio, that in this expression, the 'social' is more important than the 'market'."
"Of course, at the end of the day, the Commission has to put forward, represent and implement a very balanced approach."
"However, I have always represented the social objectives and we have taken this very seriously."
"I also noted in the discussion that the forthcoming Single Market Act would be received with disappointment by Parliament if it were not to include a very strong social dimension."
"That is what we have been working on: ensuring that this very important document will be strong on social issues."
"I have participated in the relevant group of commissioners and have ensured the inclusion of items concerning pensions and other issues that are very important in terms of strengthening the social dimension of the European economy."
"However, there are many other issues."
"I would certainly object to an approach of having only one particular type of solution, i.e. establishing another high-level body in order to ensure that we deliver on social issues."
"There was nothing in my answer that suggests an objection to having a dynamic process on SSGI."
"In fact, we find ourselves in a dynamic process on SSGI in the run-up to the October conference of the Belgian Presidency."
"I will attend both the opening and the conclusions of that conference, and I am very hopeful that it will bring up a number of issues related to SSGI to guide us forward."
"SSGI is treated very seriously in the upcoming European Platform against Poverty which will be published at the end of the year."
"Mr Courard, the Secretary of State for Social Integration and the Fight Against Poverty, also referred to this in his introduction."
"I am open to taking further steps."
"However, I would first like to see what these events and documents will bring from the wider range of European stakeholders."
"I would like to stress that, although officially there is some recovery, we are in a very difficult phase of the economic crisis and that there is still a lot of pain inflicted not simply by the crisis itself but also by the measures to exit the crisis."
"The Commission has consistently been calling for the interests of social services and vulnerable groups to be taken into account."
"In recent weeks, I have made many speeches and I have called for caution in terms of the macro-economic policies of Member States."
"Fiscal consolidation is inevitable because countries accumulated high debts."
"However, austerity - especially mindless austerity - and single-minded expenditure cuts are not inevitable."
"All Member States, even those that are under pressure from the markets, have room to consider how to deliver a measured fiscal consolidation."
"Everyone has the capacity to balance the various options - expenditure cuts or revenue increases, and they can apply fairness; they can take into account the interests of vulnerable groups."
"The Commission has been calling for that."
"Even in these difficult times, we are calling for social awareness."
"That is where the European Year has been helping us a lot."
"This has been an awareness-raising campaign and, to that extent, it has been a success because it helped to deliver the two very important targets of Europe 2020."
"Without this campaign we would not have been successful in delivering the very ambitious targets on raising employment and reducing poverty in Europe."
"Of course, nobody believes that this can be delivered overnight."
"We have to improve our instruments."
"I accept what the honourable Member said about the European Social Fund (ESF)."
"It has not been functioning perfectly, but we are in the process of exploring where the ESF should be improved in terms of innovation, what the ESF should be dealing with, and how it should be used."
"This is all part of a process."
"There are series of conferences to discuss that, especially in the context of how to handle the situation of the Roma population, among other issues."
"The Belgian Presidency is holding a conference specifically on how the ESF could be more useful in reducing poverty."
"I would be doubtful about establishing a new fund."
"I think we first have to explore how the social fund could be used, with the available instruments, to improve social conditions."
"Here, I would underline the role of the European Investment Bank in terms of developing the infrastructure and services in Europe."
"Nobody is calling for the privatisation of social services."
"These are predominantly Member State competences."
"However, if the EU rules concerning public procurement or State aid, for example, are applied correctly, taking all important parameters into account, they will guarantee quality, cost effectiveness and transparency."
"These are very important objectives and we should not undermine these important objectives, particularly transparency, when we try to pursue other objectives, however important or relevant those might be."
"I hope these points are convincing and that the upcoming events, especially the next conference on SSGI and poverty, will provide ample opportunities to discuss how to proceed."
"I can assure you that reducing poverty and improving social standards in Europe are very much in the focus of the Commission's work and very much in the focus of my personal agenda."
"Mr President, I would like to thank all the Members for the quality of their speeches."
"The Council has asked the Commission to develop a platform which is not limited to poverty, but which genuinely introduces a broader dynamic for dealing with the fight against exclusion and the role of social welfare."
"I would also like to say that, in the austerity measures, which the Commissioner has just spoken about, it was obviously important to consider the measures to be taken in order to ensure that austerity does not make people even poorer."
"The fight against poverty really must not be forgotten today."
"I would also thank the Commission for its efforts in trying to establish greater legal certainty for social services of general interest (SSGIs), and particularly in respect of their specific characteristics."
"It is genuinely our wish to pursue discussions, in particular within the Social Protection Committee, as well as to improve dialogue with the various stakeholders, both institutional and non-institutional."
"As Mr De Rossa stressed, it is clear that, in the debate on SSGIs, the involvement of the European Parliament is, and must remain, extensive."
"Article 14 is also an important element which we must use in the discussions on SSGIs."
"Indeed, it will be one of the important subjects to be discussed during the third forum on 26 and 27 October."
"Finally, discussions on social affairs are difficult within the Council because of budgetary restrictions, as you know."
"Nevertheless, social services fulfil necessary tasks - indispensable ones - which therefore require very specific attention, and, although their specific characteristics are recognised, this means that we must provide a specific way of dealing with them."
"I will finish by thanking Commissioner Andor for his dynamism and his desire to make progress in everything relating to social affairs."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The financial crisis has been contributing to a severe worsening of the European public's social situation."
"The recovery has been taking its time to be felt, with high rates of unemployment and weak economic growth."
"The Europe 2020 strategy (EU 2020) aims to set out a plan to facilitate the creation of economic growth that can offer higher employment and greater competitiveness within the Union."
"Its defining initiatives constitute a path for us to follow towards making Europe more inclusive for Europeans."
"The Treaty of Lisbon reinforces Europe's social policy dimension."
"Europe belongs to the European public and part of its mission is to contribute to promoting employment, and to improving living and working conditions."
"I would stress the crucial nature of dialogue between social partners, and the role of small and medium-sized enterprises as a driving force for the economy."
"We must realise the Treaty of Lisbon's objectives regarding social issues through the specific proposals included in EU 2020, for example, defining initiatives such as 'an industrial policy for the globalisation era' or 'an agenda for new skills and jobs'."
"Europe must be more competitive and able to face up to the challenges of globalisation without, however, refraining from being inclusive and aiming for development that is sustainable and which guarantees social integration."
"The Treaty of Lisbon reconfirms Member States' commitment to the basic social rights set out in the European Social Charter (in 1961) and in the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers (in 1989)."
"The Treaty of Lisbon reaffirms that the European Union is working for Europe's sustainable development."
"The EU economy is a social market economy, promoting a large degree of competitiveness."
"Its objectives include full employment, social progress and a high level of protection for and improvement in the quality of the environment."
"The EU combats social exclusion and discrimination, and promotes justice and social protection, gender equality, solidarity between generations and the protection of children's rights."
"In August, the unemployment rate across the EU-27 was 9.6%, with a rate of youth unemployment of 20%."
"The economic and financial crisis has had a dramatic impact on the social environment, with the main concern for European citizens nowadays being jobs and quality of life."
"The European Union is primarily about its 500 million citizens, which is why Europe must have a social aspect."
"Social Europe must offer European citizens jobs and a decent living, its young people high quality education and the prospect of integration into the labour market, and its pensioners a decent living and high quality healthcare services."
"Third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of Member States (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Fajon, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement - C7-0134/2010 -."
"Mr President, representatives of the European Commission, Commissioner Malmström, representatives of the Council, of course, ladies and gentlemen, I will try to use four minutes now and, if necessary, two more at the end."
"Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina have met all the conditions and stand ready for visa liberalisation."
"The European Commission has confirmed this, as indeed did we last week, in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, without a single vote against."
"The expectations of the Albanian and Bosnian and Herzegovinian public, that tomorrow in this House, we will be giving the green light, are legitimate, and these people deserve that."
"I would like to welcome Mr Sven Alkalaj, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Mrs Jozefina Topalli, the Speaker of the Albanian Parliament, who are seated in the gallery and who are closely following this debate."
"It is time we sent out a message to these two countries: we are ready for you, you have met the conditions."
"We will knock down the visa walls that have divided the countries of the Western Balkans for far too long."
"We have long struggled to achieve this common goal of ours and I would like to thank everyone who participated in this process, especially the European Commission and the Council."
"I am pleased that my own country, Slovenia, has played a very important role here."
"To the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania, the European Union sometimes seems a lot further away than it really is."
"With visa liberalisation, we will be taking a major step forward towards building confidence among the people and continuing with the urgent reforms still needed to bring them to fully-fledged membership."
"Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina have made their borders secure, they have ensured the security of biometric passports, and they have made significant steps in the fight against corruption and organised crime."
"Last year, the European Union liberalised the visa regime for the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro and their joy was indescribable."
"That makes sense because, some twenty years prior to that, the citizens of the Western Balkans used to travel west without any visas."
"It seems to me that this is not merely a diplomatic gift."
"It is now our duty, the duty of the European Union, to fulfil our promise."
"What is at stake here is our credibility and the credibility of the European Union."
"Might I remind you that, last November, it was Parliament itself, together with the European Council, that undertook to deal with the visa liberalisation for Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina, under an expedited procedure, as soon as these countries met the conditions."
"I therefore call on you to support my report, so that we can send a truly positive message to both of these countries."
"Their people deserve it more than ever before and."
"I believe that we will very soon be followed by our European governments."
"Ladies and gentlemen, representatives of the Commission and the Council, let us make an effort and perhaps take one more step to make it possible for the citizens of Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina to travel freely before the Catholic Christmas, thus, before the end of this year, so that they can visit their relatives and friends during the holiday season."
"We did that last year in the case of the FYROM, Serbia and Montenegro and I believe that, with the amount of will that we have, we will also be able to do it this year."
"One final thing I would like to add is that our 'yes' in Parliament tomorrow will be recognition of the very hard work done by both countries, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania."
"They have met all the conditions, which is the key criterion for us, and I think that that recognition will be a very good incentive to all the countries of the Western Balkans, because it would show that hard work really does pay."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Fajon, for her very committed, enthusiastic and hard work on this dossier."
"It has been a great pleasure working with you - and the shadow rapporteurs as well - in our joint efforts to grant a visa-free regime to the citizens of Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"The proposal we discussed today confirms the European Union's political will and our commitment on the liberalisation of short-term visa requirements for the citizens of all Western Balkan countries."
"This is part of the Thessaloniki Agenda and a cornerstone of our integration policy for the Western Balkans."
"By supporting the free regime, we are not only sending a political message."
"That message is important, but we are also concretely facilitating people-to-people contact, enhancing business opportunities and cultural exchanges, and giving people the opportunity to get to know each other - giving the people of Bosnia and Albania the opportunity to get to know the European Union and vice versa."
"We stand here today as a result of the hard work of the authorities and the people of these two countries, and I would like to pay tribute to that work."
"I congratulate them for the efforts made and the important results achieved."
"The result-oriented visa liberalisation dialogues between the two countries and the European Commission acted as a very strong initiative and incentive, accelerating reforms towards reaching EU standards in the core areas of justice, liberty and security."
"The two countries have made important progress in improving passport security, strengthening border control, reinforcing the institutional framework to fight organised crime and corruption, as well as in external relations and fundamental rights."
"The Commission has thoroughly monitored the steps taken."
"In our proposal of May this year, the Commission identified a limited number of remaining open benchmarks for both Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina, which required further monitoring."
"This approach followed exactly that which was taken in 2009 for Montenegro and Serbia."
"In the case of Albania, the open benchmark related to the development of a policy to support the reintegration of Albanian returnees, the strengthening of capacities in the fight against organised crime and corruption and, finally, effective implementation of the confiscation of organised crime assets."
"Regarding Bosnia and Herzegovina, the open requirements were the strengthening of the capacities of the fight against organised crime and corruption, steps towards improved electronic police data exchange, and harmonisation of the criminal code between state and entity levels."
"On the basis of detailed information provided by the two countries, expert missions with valuable participation of Member States' experts during this summer and, later, with other information available, the Commission was able to present, on 14 September, our assessment of the fulfilment of the remaining open benchmarks."
"It showed that both countries had undertaken all necessary measures to fulfil all open benchmarks listed in the proposal of May this year."
"Consequently, the Commission considers that all the preconditions listed in the road map are met, and on this basis we propose to grant the visa-free regime."
"Let me underline that the visa-free regime of the two countries also comes with responsibilities."
"In order to prevent abuse, it is essential that Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina take all necessary measures to limit influxes of persons making unfounded asylum applications."
"This aspect has been very strongly highlighted through the contacts between the Commission and the two countries, and I know that efforts have already been made by the two countries in this respect."
"It is important that you continue the information campaigns, with the aim of properly informing and explaining to your citizens the meaning of short-term visa travel and what it entails, in particular, warning against misuse for purposes incompatible with visa travel."
"Now we are here - and this is a very important step - I hope that the Council will be able to finalise the examination of this proposal during the coming weeks and that we can have a formal adoption that will be confirmed for November."
"rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. - Mr President, I would like to join with Commissioner Malmström in sincerely thanking Tanja Fajon for her committed and patient hard work."
"I have been a modest member of her team, under her leadership over the last eighteen months, in what I know she has and I have regarded as an extremely important exercise."
"It is reported - and I am quoting from an English translation of the report - that the French European Affairs Minister, Pierre Lellouche, has called visa policy a matter of security."
"He apparently said in the Assemblée Nationale the other day that 'my position and that of the government is that the visa issue is a matter of security."
"It is not only a diplomatic present which we offer along the way'."
"As I say, I am quoting from an English translation."
"Yes, we agree, but I will come back to the issue of security shortly."
"Of course - and Tanja Fajon dealt with that - it is not a diplomatic present."
"But he went on apparently to say that France would request security guarantees from the two countries."
"But that is exactly what the Commission has done, under the usual, carefully prepared road map which has had the full support of the Council of Ministers as well as of Parliament."
"So all the points that Commissioner Malmström made were absolutely pertinent and she is also right to add that it must be made plain, and will, I am sure, be made plain to their citizens by the national authorities of those two countries, that it is a right that must not be abused; that it is a right for short-term travel, for tourism, for exchanges, for business and so on, and it is not for other purposes, including work."
"But just to come back to that point about security in the broadest sense."
"The European Union is about security in the broadest sense and this is part of the whole exercise of opening up minds, of fighting nationalism, of fighting ethnic conflict, of building a continent on peace and prosperity, and that is what we want to open up the eyes of the citizens of those countries to."
"We are all in this together and we hope to prepare them to become members of the European Union because the European Union is a security project."
"We made this deal."
"We said, if you jump through these hoops, you will get visa-free travel."
"If France or any other Member State had doubts about this journey, they should never have given support to the visa liberalisation road map."
"They must not now fail this promise."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, I am glad that tonight we can finally say to the people of Albania and Bosnia: 'You have not been forgotten'."
"I hope that the vote in plenary tomorrow will show a strong commitment by this Parliament to visa liberalisation for Albania and Bosnia."
"The EPP urges the Council to respect their undertaking in the joint declaration adopted by the Swedish Presidency to grant a visa-free regime as soon as possible."
"Now that the benchmarks have been met - according to the European Commission - the people of Albania and Bosnia should see the light at the end of the tunnel and get visa-free travel to EU-Schengen by Christmas."
"The EPP has been fully committed to accelerating the process of visa liberalisation, treating all the countries of the Western Balkans equally."
"We have pursued a consistent, realistic and credible line all the way through, supporting the authorities and taking the responsibility for the reform process while respecting the legitimate security concerns of European citizens."
"I sincerely regret that false expectations were raised with unrealistic timetables, and I am pleased that the other part of this House has finally joined our realistic path, accepting that, unfortunately, there were no possible shortcuts."
"We were ready when they were ready."
"Now they are ready, and we congratulate the authorities of Bosnia and Albania for their achievements in pursing the reforms."
"Strengthening the rule of law, combating crime and corruption are important for the people of the region and help close the gap with the European Union."
"People-to-people contact, as Commissioner Malmström said, and breaking the sense of isolation, are important to promote stability in the region in a European perspective."
"I experienced the siege of Sarajevo and was in the war in Bosnia for years."
"The plea of the people who felt locked in and left behind is really close to my heart and has been at the basis of my commitment since I entered this House in the summer of 2009."
"I would first like to thank my colleague, Tanja Fajon, for this report."
"It cannot be denied that a so-called visa wall has gone up over the past two decades between the European Union and certain western Balkan countries."
"Fortunately, a section of this wall was knocked down last year, when we removed the visa requirement for citizens of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia."
"This work must continue, however, and the advantages of visa-free movement around the European must also be granted to the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Albania and, in the future, perhaps Kosovo as well."
"In the first place, it has to be said that the governments of these countries have made enormous strides over the past year, fulfilling almost all of the Commission's demands."
"Secondly, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot be so naive as to imagine that the current regime prevents criminals from crossing the border."
"They always know how to find a way."
"We are not talking today about criminals, or even about politicians, businessmen or entrepreneurs."
"We are talking about ordinary people from the Balkans."
"We are not talking about safeguarding jobs or the right of residence."
"We are discussing today the fundamental right of future citizens of the European Union to travel freely around the Union and to forge social and professional links with partners from the EU Member States."
"Thirdly, liberalisation of the visa regime will help to stabilise the western Balkans and strengthen political and economic cooperation, to boost the inhabitants' support for the EU and the prospects for European integration, expand people's horizons and put a stop to the forces of anti-European extremism."
"The only reservation I have over the report concerns Kosovo."
"I agree with Mrs Fajon that ordinary people from this area should not be hostages to the current political situation but, at the same time, it is necessary to formulate the decision on free movement for Kosovars clearly in such a way that their leaders do not begin to interpret it erroneously as a de facto recognition of their declaration of statehood."
"We must make all efforts now for the visa-free regime to be introduced as soon as possible for citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania."
"Bosnia and Herzegovina has made dramatic progress in recent months, after the EU ruled in July last year that these countries did not fulfil the conditions for liberalising the visa regime."
"As long as these advantages are granted only to certain nations, there will always be a risk of destabilising the region, as well as a danger that the political and ethnic mosaic will shatter into even smaller pieces."
"The governments of these countries have worked hard over recent months to eliminate their shortcomings, make up for lost time, and provide quality levels equal to those of neighbouring countries."
"The knowledge that the European Union will soon allow both countries - and particularly Bosnia and Herzegovina - visa-free travel, will reduce the risk of even greater ethnic and political instability, strengthen political and economic cooperation, boost the inhabitants' support for the EU and the prospects for European integration, expand people's horizons and put a stop to the forces of anti-European extremism."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I, too, would like to congratulate our fellow Member, Mrs Fajon, on her excellent report, and also to say that, although we are talking about a very important first step or phase, the visa exemption proposed in this report is nevertheless the cornerstone of progress on the road to integration."
"As you have said, Mrs Fajon, this is, in fact, a big moment for all the citizens concerned, and especially young people, for whom freedom of movement is a very important factor in their ability to become citizens who are open to the rest of the world."
"I completely share your desire to see this report adopted very quickly so that things can move forward by Christmas."
"However, I would not want us to stop there, and I would like the process to allow us to go further."
"We cannot let the citizens of Kosovo be the only citizens in the Balkans who cannot travel freely, and I hope that the Commission will look into this issue without delay."
"Thus, while retaining our European requirements - and, as a French person, I fully support Baroness Ludford in saying that the government position is not the only view in France - I suggest that we should proceed without fear along this path of liberalisation."
"Mr President, I have every confidence that, tomorrow, a large majority of this House will vote in favour of visa-free travel for Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania."
"And rightly so."
"Despite all kinds of political troubles, they have worked very hard to comply with these criteria."
"In fact, they have progressed further in that respect than Serbia and FYROM had at the time when they were granted visa waivers."
"Therefore, I have no worries on our Parliament's score."
"We have said that criteria are criteria and, as soon as a country complies with them, we will grant its citizens visa-free travel."
"That is important for young people, for business people and for everyone."
"What I am worried about, however, is the Council of Ministers."
"There are rumours that some countries are having doubts."
"I hope that these rumours are unfounded."
"If the Council fails to allow visa-free travel soon, that would send out the wrong message."
"We would be seen to be applying double standards."
"The perception would be that criteria do not really count for anything, because everything really depends on political games."
"That the Council does not trust the Commission's opinion."
"Where will that leave us then?"
"The matter is quite simple, in fact."
"The Commission has indicated that Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania have complied with the criteria and, therefore, the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers must recognise that, as soon as possible."
"They might have their own opinion about the Commission and politicians in these countries, but this is about the people who live there."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, visa liberalisation is an important step for any country seeking a closer relationship with the European Union."
"Making it easier for bona fide citizens of third countries to visit the EU, for business and tourism, is an important part of integrating these countries with our own Union."
"The positive experience of extending visa liberalisation to Montenegro - for which I had the privilege of being the rapporteur of this Parliament - to Serbia, and to Macedonia, has given extra momentum to these countries' aspirations for EU membership."
"However, we must eventually give all countries in the western Balkans an equal opportunity to achieve this status if they qualify for it."
"After all, this is nothing more than what they used to enjoy in the days of the former Yugoslavia."
"Extending visa liberalisation now to Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina is therefore a natural progression of a long-standing strategic policy which I welcome on behalf of my group."
"But we should be insistent on all of these countries reaching and maintaining high standards of passport biometric security."
"Visa liberalisation is a privilege and not an automatic right which can be taken for granted."
"As for Kosovo, concerns still remain about the quality of passport security and organised crime."
"Until these questions are fully answered, Kosovo must necessarily remain outside the scope of our policies."
"But I, for one, am not opposed in principle to Kosovo eventually achieving visa liberalisation."
"Even though five EU countries do not recognise it, this alone should not be a reason not to grant Kosovo as a territory the right to freedom of travel to the European Union."
"No EU Member State recognises Taiwan, a territory for which I happen to be the President of the Friendship Group of this Parliament, but nevertheless, our Union is shortly expected - and rightly so - to grant visa-free privileges to Taiwanese nationals."
"So Kosovo, a bit like Taiwan, should enjoy the same privileges eventually when the time is right."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to offer my thanks to Mrs Fajon for her excellent report, which has really moved us forward on this issue."
"The Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left is very clear in its support for visa liberalisation throughout the Western Balkans, and in this case we are, of course, also in favour of the removal of the visa requirement for Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania, specifically so that the opening up of these countries actually gets under way and because it will provide better opportunities for their overall development."
"We hope that such opportunities will really be exploited."
"Personally, I would also like to see this kind of arrangement in place for Kosovo very soon - or at least for initial talks to take place."
"There is an urgent need for this, as Kosovo is otherwise a small island in the Western Balkans that is actually cut off."
"What worries me, however - and I want to make this point - is that we are compelling the introduction, at the same time, of biometric data."
"I want to be very clear on this: the use of biometric data is as controversial as ever and, above all, the use of such data is not secure."
"I say this on the back of news in Germany a few days ago that the PIN codes can be, and have been, cracked."
"There needs to be an acknowledgement that this kind of thing can happen."
"Let us do everything we can to ensure not only that these countries have their visa requirement lifted, but that social and economic development is set in train there."
"There is an urgent need for this in both countries, and the people have earned it."
"We in the EU should also work towards this goal."
"Mr President, we will vote against this report not least because the rapporteur proposes exerting pressure on the Commission and the Council to speed up the process of visa liberalisation for Kosovo."
"Do we realise what we are discussing?"
"Do we realise that Kosovo is finding it difficult to reintegrate the thousands of Roma who sought asylum in Germany?"
"This is an extremely sensitive situation for the entire European Union."
"Do we realise that visa liberalisation - which I have heard said will be used only by students and respectable people, even though I personally do not agree at all with that optimistic statement - will simply mean that Europe becomes a hotbed of Roma?"
"We really do not need this, considering the serious problems we are facing with integration and resolving the extremely severe problem of the Roma."
"As far as Albania is concerned, I would like to point out that the Commission again proposed in May that Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina should be able to allow their citizens to circulate within the Schengen area with electronic passports."
"The proposal was not, however, taken forward due to Albania's shortcomings with regard to reintegrating repatriated Albanians."
"I believe that security and control issues exist that weigh on visa liberalisation like boulders."
"We need to think about this very carefully: visas are necessary, and how!"
"(NL) Mr President, the delegation of the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) is against the visa waivers for Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania, two countries which are affiliated, as a member and an observer, respectively, with the Organisation of the Islamic conference."
"This is an organisation which upholds sharia as the basis of human rights and which is holding the United Nations hostage with its undisguised anti-Semitism."
"How on earth can you hand out symbolic gifts to countries that claim that sharia law is the basis of human rights?"
"Sharia is a law which governs every aspect of life in an Islamic society, from civil and family law to criminal law."
"It stipulates how you must eat, dress and, even, how you must use the toilet."
"Oppression of women is good, drinking alcohol is bad."
"This is beyond me."
"Can somebody explain to me how this law can exist side by side with the fundamental and human rights so cherished by this European Union?"
"These two countries could almost be considered the most corrupt countries in Europe and, yet, Parliament finds it necessary to reward them with a visa waiver, merely because they have been less corrupt than Zimbabwe."
"This is being concealed behind statements such as 'Well, it will allow them to visit their families or to complete a course of study abroad'."
"That, of course, is absolute nonsense, because that possibility already exists."
"Only they first have to obtain a piece of paper giving them permission for that."
"It is absolute nonsense to waive their visa requirement on the grounds that they would otherwise be trapped in their pitiful little countries."
"What a load of nonsense!"
"Dutch cities have already been swamped by hordes of Poles, Romanians and Bulgarians."
"It is enough to drive you round the bend."
"This visa waiver will only make things worse."
"How profoundly sad!"
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(NL) Mr President, I would like to put a question to Mr van der Stoep."
"You said that these are countries which use sharia as the basis for human rights."
"Could you please tell us what specific proposals the parliaments of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania have debated with a view to introducing sharia and on what dates these debates took place?"
"You are making an assumption that you cannot substantiate are you not?"
"I hope that you will be able to do so, but do let us know."
"(NL) Mr President, Mrs Bozkurt is, of course, well aware that I am not familiar with the exact details of everything that is happening in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania, nor is it of any interest to me, to be honest."
"Could I remind her of the fact that the Cairo Declaration explicitly states that sharia is the basis of human rights and that Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania are signed up to that declaration."
"Could you explain to me how you cannot see anything wrong with that?"
"If you have sharia as the basis for human rights, well, you must be out of your mind then mustn't you?"
"That is all I can say on that score."
"(ES) Mr President, I would first of all like to congratulate Mrs Fajon on producing a report that involved so much commitment in such a determined way."
"I would also like to congratulate my colleague and friend, Mrs Corazza Bildt, for her determination and passion in taking on the commitment of visa exemptions for Bosnia and Herzegovina and for Albania, two countries that desperately need them."
"Like you, I, too, was in Sarajevo and Mostar during the war, and I too witnessed Milosevic's mass population displacements and the solidarity of the Albanians."
"That is why I am expressing my joy here today, Mr President, because, happily, justice is being done."
"Since the Salonica Summit in June 2003, when the European Union at last took the welcome step of committing to exempt the Western Balkans from visas, following the first stage when the two countries did not fulfil the requirements, we can now reaffirm and welcome the commitment that finally, Albanians and Bosnians are going to be able to travel to EU territory."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the need to bring stability to the Balkans, especially to countries that will certainly join the Union in the future, and to facilitate the mobility of a population that is currently isolated, must, in my view, be one of Parliament's political obligations."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Tanja Fajon."
"In Bosnia and Herzegovina, people feel as though they are trapped in a cage after the war in the 1990s."
"Now, finally, the door will open for them to get out."
"Tomorrow is the day when the European Parliament can give a clear sign that the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania are welcome visitors in Europe."
"The European Commission concluded that both countries have fulfilled the benchmarks for visa liberalisation."
"The reforms are important for those countries but also for the EU."
"Significant progress has been made in securing the borders and improving cooperation in combating cross-border crime - like human trafficking and drug trafficking - and it will be possible to return persons who are illegally staying on European soil."
"The experience of visa liberalisation showed that leaders in Bosnia and Herzegovina were willing and able to agree to process the required reforms quickly."
"The cooperation and effectiveness of these reforms will, hopefully, serve as an example for further reforms needed for EU integration, but it is also of huge importance for people who will finally be able to visit their families, especially with regard to the wide diaspora that Bosnia and Herzegovina has in Europe."
"It is also essential for young people and students to envisage their European future."
"They will have the chance to look over the walls of their own country."
"Hopefully, they will tell their new leaders that EU integration should be high on the agenda."
"The last thing we want is a black hole in Europe."
"The European Commission - and we in Parliament - want to lift this isolation."
"We promised the countries visa liberalisation when they fulfilled the criteria."
"With the Commission's and the European Parliament's consent, two thirds of the European institutions will recognise their effort and progress."
"I want to see the Council also fulfilling its promise so that, finally, Bosnian and Albanian people will see that there is light at the end of the long tunnel."
"(SL) Congratulations Tanja."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let us be clear about why Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina failed to secure visa liberalisation for their citizens last year."
"It is because they failed to do a piece of political homework that would have demonstrated their responsibility towards their citizens."
"This year, however, the parliaments and governments of these countries have successfully passed their resits."
"Yet, they did so only at the last moment because there are still doubts in the minds of some people over there."
"We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe are looking forward to the visa liberalisation and we would like to say to the citizens of Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina that they are our friends, our partners and our dear neighbours."
"They will be welcome when they come to visit us and their relatives, who are, with their hard work and together with us, building a united, better, richer and larger European Union."
"The decision to liberalise visas which is to be taken in the European Parliament is our common achievement, an important political, and a sincere human, message."
"Visa liberalisation is intended to benefit the people of these countries, not to reward their politicians."
"However, the governments of both countries must persevere in their efforts to persuade the ministers for the interior of EU Member States that they are fully committed to the implementation and consistent observance of the rules and obligations they have taken on."
"(DE) Mr President, I, too, would like to thank Mrs Fajon, on behalf of my group, for her excellent work, and also to offer thanks to Commissioner Malmström, as I believe that they both played valuable roles and have taken the right steps."
"The vote in Parliament tomorrow will make the promise of a European future more tangible for the citizens of Albania and of Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"It will be possible to finally secure for them what the people of Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia have had since last year."
"This broad consensus in the European Parliament tomorrow will also set a clear challenge to the Council to make clear at its next meeting in November that it, too, will give the green light for this to go ahead, just as the Commission has already done and Parliament will be doing tomorrow."
"As has already been said, we cannot allow a few Member States to now start wavering and advancing new arguments, such as the need for new security guarantees, when we know perfectly well that the only reason for this is their internal political debates - there is no basis in the reality of the criteria, which Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina have already met."
"In other words, tomorrow, we will be challenging the Council to give the green light, as the Commission and Parliament will already have done."
"As the rapporteur for Kosovo, I also have to say, however - and this point is partly addressed to Mrs Flašíková Beňová, who, I think, is unfortunately no longer in the Chamber - that Kosovo is an independent State."
"This is true despite the five EU Member States that have not yet recognised it, that do not want to see the reality."
"It is a fact; it is the reality."
"As rapporteur for Kosovo, I also call on the Commission to finally give the government in Kosovo a road map so that a start can be made on the work, and so that freedom from visas, freedom to travel, can finally be on the horizon for the citizens of Kosovo as well."
"(SK) The submitted proposal - a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council - will enable citizens of Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina to travel without a visa to all countries of the European Union."
"At a time when a number of Islamic organisations are threatening Europe with terrorist attacks, it is, in my opinion, a surprising and positive gesture, intended perhaps for the entire Islamic world."
"However, outside the framework of the regulation, there is the reference to Kosovo which has appeared in the explanatory memorandum."
"According to almost two thirds of the Member States of the United Nations, under the terms of UN Security Council Resolution No 1244 and UN Charter Chapter 1 Article 2.7, Kosovo is formally a legitimate part of the Serbian Republic, even if under a kind of special protectorate today."
"I therefore think, Commissioner, that we must scrupulously respect international law in the case of Kosovo, and not divide up the citizens of Serbia according to place of residence or ethnic criteria, but allow inhabitants of the Serbian province of Kosovo to travel around all the countries of the European Union with a Serbian passport in the same way as other citizens of Serbia."
"(NL) Mr President, it is a particularly unwise idea to liberalise visas for countries such as Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania."
"In her explanatory statement, Ms Fajon said, in precisely these words, that this is mainly about students and young people coming to visit their friends and family."
"Is this real naivety or are you just feigning naivety, in an attempt, as it were, to actively deny reality?"
"For instance, you argue in your report that scrapping the visa requirement will contribute to the elimination of ethnic and political instability."
"Let us face it; the only thing we will be doing is simply importing much of that instability into the European Union."
"Allow me to read you a quotation from a report by Europol, Eurojust and Frontex on the state of internal security in the EU."
"This is a document from 7 May 2010. 'Albania, Kosovo, Serbia, Montenegro and FYROM are transit countries to the EU for illegal migrants and victims of human trafficking for sexual exploitation, cannabis products, heroin, cocaine, cigarettes, synthetic drugs and precursors, counterfeit Euros and firearms."
"Albanian-speaking organised crime groups are prominent, particularly in trafficking heroin and women for sexual exploitation'."
"Unquote."
"Therefore, instead of tightening checks, we are now going to abolish visas, open our doors wide and make the problem of imported crime even worse."
"(BG) I welcome Mrs Fajon's report and the Commission proposal to remove the visa regime for Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"Practice has shown that, unfortunately, visas are not always the most effective method of stopping illegal immigration and organised crime."
"Those who suffer most from travel restrictions are ordinary people, and particularly the young."
"They prevent the future citizens of the European Union from seeing and appreciating everything that we have achieved in Europe together, and from meeting and befriending other Europeans of their age group."
"I should like to point out to some of those who have just raised voices of criticism that the visa-free regime with Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia has not had any negative consequences."
"The European Union has undertaken a commitment to give the Western Balkans a clear European perspective, so let us do our bit and give these countries a visa-free regime."
"Of course, we cannot compromise on measures to fight organised crime, money laundering, human trafficking and drug smuggling."
"Intensifying legal and administrative reforms and improving the rule of law in these countries is also important."
"Nobody in Europe should feel isolated and excluded without an opportunity to travel."
"The European Union is founded on values we share with our neighbours and with the countries which have set out on the road of European integration."
"I am glad that we are opening the doors to the Albanians and Bosnians as one day we expect them to be European Union citizens too."
"Lifting the visa regime in the Western Balkans will benefit security, the freedom of the citizens of those countries and the entire European Union."
"Kosovo also needs to be included in the visa liberalisation regime."
"After the lifting of restrictions on Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina, the citizens of Kosovo will be the only people left in the Balkans who will require a visa to travel to Europe."
"Regardless of our differences with regard to Kosovo, it needs to be given a road map towards a visa-free regime by European leaders."
"I believe that this will provide an opportunity to reduce ethnic tension in the Balkans, and they will no longer be the historical powder keg of Europe but become a model of law abidance, civic freedoms and a guarantee of prosperity."
"(RO) I would like to begin by congratulating Tanja Fajon for her report."
"As part of the Thessaloniki Agenda, the visa liberalisation process with Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina takes into account the progress made during the dialogues held over the last seven months."
"A thorough assessment has been carried out on a case-by-case basis to produce a set of criteria relating to illegal emigration, public order and safety, as well as the European Union's external relations with third countries."
"In this context, special attention must obviously be focused as well on the security of the travel documents issued by the third countries in question."
"The visa waiver has been based on road maps adapted for each country."
"There is a need for a reminder here about the European destiny of both countries and that they have already lifted visa requirements for all European Union citizens."
"Finally, I want to point out that this visa waiver should be applied only to holders of biometric passports issued by each of the two countries in question."
"(HU) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we welcome the fact that at last, nearly a year after adopting our position on Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia, we can now adopt a position in the matter of the visa-free regime for Bosnia and Herzegovina as well."
"Special recognition is due to the rapporteur, Tanja Fajon, and my colleague, Anna Maria Corazza Bildt, for their dedicated work."
"The issue of visa-free travel in Europe cannot be considered either a privilege or a diplomatic gesture."
"It is based on reciprocal commitments, which means that security concerns cannot jeopardise our political goals."
"I would therefore like to thank the Commission emphatically, and Commissioner Malmström personally, for the work they have done to ensure the sustainability of the timetable undertaken for the liberalisation of the visa-free regime for the Western Balkans."
"The fact that we are only a few days after the elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina makes this issue particularly relevant."
"The results of the election also show that the deep divisions along ethnic lines cannot be abolished in one fell swoop."
"It is the visa-free regime that offers the next generations, the young people, access to a European perspective, and this European perspective can help achieve reconciliation."
"It is for this reason as well that a visa-free regime is needed in this region."
"The road to the creation of the conditions required for peaceful coexistence leads through the European Union, and by supporting the visa-free regime, we are making our own contribution to this goal."
"This is why we should not forget about Kosovo either, and we need to draw up a timetable for that region as well, as soon as possible."
"Mr President, I think that we should support the visa-free regime for Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina and I welcome very much the report of Tanja Fajon, but with regard to Albania, we must make sure that we send the message that a positive vote in the European Parliament does not in any way mean a reward for the Albanian Government."
"It is instead only a relief for the citizens of Albania, who, for over a year, have had to bear the consequences of a never-ending political crisis."
"It is anyway clear that the positive outcome in Parliament would only be half of the way for Albania, since unless they make concrete progress, some members of the Council will end up with reservations."
"Until now, the Albanian Government seems not to have made any progress or shown any effort to solve the political crisis, despite the resolution adopted by the European Parliament in June."
"The only field in which there has been visible progress was corruption, but unfortunately, in the opposite direction to what we expected, with cases of high-ranking members of the Albanian Government being daily brought to public attention in recent months, at least."
"This is not the right way to act towards the EU and Albania should listen to the warning before it is too late."
"(EL) Mr President, the abolition of visa requirements for citizens from all the countries of the Western Balkans is real proof of the European prospects of their people."
"It is very important that Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina now meet the terms and conditions and indicators required for exemption from the visa regime."
"However, I should like to add a few points to what has already been said and to draw our attention to the following three comments: firstly, we will need, from now on, to be particularly careful and strict in terms of compliance with obligations in the illegal immigration sector."
"More importantly, I would remind the House that, in 2009, the land border between Greece and Albania and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia accounted for the largest percentage, namely 34%, of illegal immigrants apprehended throughout the European Union."
"Secondly, we must not ignore concerns about a possible increase in the number of economic migrants from these countries to the countries in the rest of the European Union for one additional reason: experience here in Brussels about a year ago from the increase in the number of applications for political asylum from the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro is still fresh."
"At that time, as we have been reminded, special action was needed by the Belgian Government immediately after visa requirements were lifted."
"Finally, the questions raised here by certain Member States need answers and the Presidency needs to keep its promise and organise a meeting of experts to examine the points which some Members feel are still outstanding."
"These are outstanding issues which need to be sorted out if the procedure is to progress smoothly."
"(PT) I will begin by congratulating Mrs Fajon on her excellent report and my colleague, Mrs Bildt, who was shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), on the work she did on it."
"It has already been recalled that when, in November 2009, we adopted the visa exemption for Serbia, Montenegro and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, we were only unable to do so for Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina, too, for the simple reason that they did not fulfil the criteria."
"In fact, the liberalisation of the obligation for visas for access to the Schengen area is subject to a rigorous, case-by-case assessment."
"This assessment is based on criteria relating to strengthening the rule of law, public order and security, in particular, the fight against organised crime, corruption and illegal immigration; and to the external relations of the European Union with third countries."
"The assessment also takes into account the implications for regional coherence and reciprocity."
"The proposal tabled by the Commission makes it possible to conclude, on the basis of the assessment reports, that these two countries currently fulfil the majority of the criteria for transferral from Annex I (the so-called 'negative list') to Annex II (the so-called 'positive list')."
"There are only a very limited number of criteria that are still being fulfilled and whose implementation is being monitored by the Commission."
"It is hoped that this process will be completed very soon."
"The European Parliament and the Council have committed to making a decision as quickly as possible, as soon as these criteria are all confirmed to have been fulfilled."
"We are now honouring this commitment and we hope that the Council will also do so."
"As my colleague, Mrs Bildt, has said, it is time to send out a signal and to bring an end to isolation."
"Let us hope that these two countries will even be able to benefit from this exemption over the Christmas period."
"It would strengthen political and economic cooperation with this region and would serve as a way to bring an end to its peoples' sense of isolation."
"(PL) Madam President, the lifting of barriers and demolition of the walls which are presented by visa restrictions will be a very joyful moment, not only for the residents of Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina, but also for us, the residents of the European Union, because this will confirm that we are true to our values of openness towards our neighbours."
"This will also guarantee us a safer neighbourhood."
"While welcoming the fact that pains have been taken to deliver visa-free travel and demolish those walls for parts of the Western Balkans, a huge request and an appeal should, nevertheless, be addressed to the European Commission and to the Commissioner, and also to our fellow Members: let us remember the countries of the Eastern Partnership, let us remember, at this time, Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia."
"Further challenges await us."
"As we have now reached one stage, let us think right away about the next."
"These countries - Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia - have not even officially received road maps, which is something we have already appealed for during the present term of office of the European Parliament."
"The European Union felt an obligation towards the Western Balkan states, and it should also have the same feeling about its - and our - eastern neighbours."
"The situation in both cases is similar - we are talking about neighbours who, not so long ago, were able to travel freely in some of the countries of the European Union."
"Now, unfortunately, they are the victims of restrictions, and they are mostly young people and students, because the elite can manage and are going to travel anyway."
"However, we are talking about the future of Europe, about students and young working people."
"It is not only the lives of these people which could be affected by visa liberalisation, but also the quality of democracy in the countries concerned, and this would result in a strengthening of our direct neighbours and, hence, a strengthening of the European Union."
"Therefore, I reiterate the appeal to the European Commission and the Commissioner to take up these further challenges and present a road map for the countries of the Eastern Partnership."
"Madam President, I would like to congratulate Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania for fulfilling all the benchmarks for a visa-free regime."
"I would also like to congratulate my distinguished colleague, Tanja Fajon, for her admirable, dedicated and enthusiastic work."
"Freedom of movement is one of the most important freedoms on which the European Union is based."
"I am glad that we are broadening this principle to include the neighbouring countries of South-East Europe."
"This is an important step and a positive development on their way towards European integration."
"I have personally seen the positive impact that visa-free travel has had on the citizens of Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia since last year."
"Having a chance to freely travel to the EU is not only a practical advantage, but it has also, in many cases, taken away psychological barriers and reconnected people."
"This has also proved that the principle of conditionality used by the European Union for visa liberalisation has worked well and brought positive results."
"Yet the EU also needs to keep up its credibility and commitment."
"It is important to ensure that the implementation of the visa liberalisation regime for Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina is not delayed any longer."
"Not only will this bring good things for the people of these countries, but it will also strengthen the credibility of the European Union."
"Finally, in order to bring more stability to the region, the policy of opening the EU to the Western Balkans should not stop here."
"I would therefore welcome, in the near future, a strategy and solution for a visa-free regime that could be proposed to Kosovo."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, thank you very much for this debate."
"I feel a very powerful support for the Commission proposal to grant visa freedom to the citizens of Bosnia and Albania and I think that is a very good thing."
"Hopefully, there will be a big majority tomorrow in the plenary and that will send a signal to the people of these two countries that the elected Members of the European Parliament strongly support their wish to travel more freely in the European Union."
"I can reassure you once again that the benchmarks have been met."
"We have been monitoring very closely."
"We will, of course, remain in contact and monitor this, but they have been fulfilled."
"All countries must be treated equally."
"The benchmarks are clear and are very transparent."
"The process has been as transparent as possible."
"A few words on Kosovo before I end."
"Kosovo is not forgotten."
"Kosovo is, of course, also a very important partner in this."
"They have made a lot of progress but still, in order to be credible, the Commission has to watch over all the benchmarks and all the conditions if we want to have credibility and legitimacy for this process."
"Kosovo is not ready."
"We are working with them."
"I know that they are making great efforts on the government side on readmission and on the reintegration of forced returnees."
"They need to do more."
"Once these conditions are met, we are, of course, ready to enter into a more formal visa dialogue with them."
"In the meantime, we can only encourage Member States to use all the facilities provided by the revised visa code when they are addressing the visa applications submitted by Kosovo citizens."
"So, rapporteur, thank you for this very fruitful and very encouraging debate and I look forward to a very strong vote tomorrow in plenary."
"I am very pleased to see that, with the rare exceptions who have admitted their obvious ignorance of the situation in the Balkan countries, the vast majority of this House agrees that it is time we supported the tearing down of visa walls in the Western Balkans."
"It is true, as has been said several times, that criminals, those who have money, have already found ways to travel, but tomorrow in the European Parliament, we will be deciding the fate of ordinary people and their mobility, especially that of young people and students."
"There is an entire generation that has grown up behind visa walls and, as we have said, Kosovo will remain a serious problem."
"We have to find a solution for these people as soon as possible because their isolation and frustration will understandably increase."
"Commissioner, we need clear guidelines in order to set the authorities in Kosovo to work."
"Another thing is that, today, people in Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina know a lot more than they used to thanks to our extensive information campaign."
"They know what visa liberalisation means, they know that, by abolishing their visas in the European Union, we will not be giving away jobs or rights to asylum or citizenship or suchlike."
"What we are offering them, however, is the fundamental right of every European citizen, the right to travel freely."
"For the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania, and for the people of the Western Balkans generally, this will be a major and important step on the road to the European Union."
"To conclude, I would like to say that what we will be doing tomorrow and what we did last November will be important for all of us, for the strengthening of economic and political cooperation, not only in the region, but in the European Union as well."
"In particular, however, this will be important as regards relations between the peoples who are living, I might say, only a few kilometres from us."
"The message we will be sending out is that we are serious and that they have a clear European future."
"The people of Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina are expecting that from us."
"I think that is the message they will be waiting to hear tomorrow."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow as planned."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - (RO) I support the EU visa liberalisation initiative for Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania."
"I would like to take this opportunity to raise the subject of visa liberalisation for the Republic of Moldova, a country which has made noticeable progress within the Eastern Partnership."
"Just as in the case of Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Moldova has made extraordinary efforts during the last year in order to achieve a visa-free regime."
"The government has already started to implement the measures requested by the EU of the Western Balkan countries as part of the road maps, promoting a 'preliminary implementation' policy."
"The first measures towards this have entailed the approval of the Aliens Act and initial work on devising the concept of Integrated Border Management."
"The decision was also made to issue only biometric passports and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court was ratified."
"The visa 'barrier' tarnishes the EU's image in the Republic of Moldova significantly."
"The first step the European Union should take to remedy this is to draw up, as soon as possible, a road map for a visa-free regime."
"In the context of the forthcoming elections, this measure would send a powerful message of support to the pro-European forces in this country."
"I support the rapporteur's position when she says that the process of reuniting Europe as a continent will only be complete when all Europeans can travel freely to the European Union."
"It touches more of a raw nerve with me personally when we debate the subject of the Western Balkans and, in particular, the problems of Albania and the progress which allows the European Union to waive visa requirements for citizens travelling within the EU."
"Part of my family originates from Albania."
"I welcomed a year ago the same measure which was adopted, aimed then at Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia."
"I will vote with complete conviction for the real right to free movement for European citizens from Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"We are all aware how cruel the wars were which resulted in the break-up of Yugoslavia and divided this region."
"We also know that young people in these regions find it most difficult to put up with isolation from a prosperous EU."
"Our role is to encourage them."
"The right to visa-free movement will help achieve this."
"The European Parliament can once again demonstrate its support for the catching up process and EU accession of Western Balkan countries."
"I consider it highly significant that the liberalisation of the visa regime for citizens of Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina will mean that almost all residents of the former Yugoslavia can enjoy visa-free travel in the European Union."
"Neither the granting of visa-free travel nor accession can have any requirements other than the fulfilment of the criteria."
"Both countries complied with the stringent requirements imposed on their internal and justice institutions, and have demonstrated that they are ready and able to fulfil the various expectations made of them."
"EU experts who have conducted on-site inspections have also ascertained that security risks can be eliminated."
"It is unacceptable for governments to allow their actions to be influenced by internal policy considerations rather than an impartial assessment of the fulfilment of eligibility criteria."
"Granting visa-free travel also conveys to the countries concerned the message that they can overcome obstacles successfully if their preparations are supported by political agreement."
"I was pleased to learn that the political powers in Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina have joined forces in order to achieve this goal."
"I sincerely hope that the possibility of joining the EU, as demonstrated by tangible results such as those achieved today, will speed up their process of catching up and help overcome the divisive, nationalistic efforts that can only hinder the process."
"We have already seen from last year's visa liberalisation that many people equated visa-free travel with being given carte blanche."
"Countless people have used the more liberal visa conditions to travel into the European Union."
"How many of those people actually went back to their home countries once the period of time granted for their stay had expired, nobody knows."
"For us, it is obvious that visa liberalisation has nothing to do with jobs and the right of abode, but this does not seem to be clear to the people in question."
"Kosovo, in particular, represents a major problem for us in this regard."
"The EU has never been able to decide what it thinks more important or what it thinks is correct and proper - territorial integrity or the right of self-determination for peoples - and because we have ignored the problem of multinational states for too long, what we have now is a divided Balkan state."
"The maths of stemming illegal entry into the EU through a readmission agreement cannot stack up while visa liberalisation continues to be abused."
"This idea needs to be put paid to."
"The importance of visa rules is also shown by the fact that Ankara seems ready to finally sign the readmission agreement in return for visa liberalisation for Turkish businesspeople."
"Such agreements are required for EU candidate countries."
"Together with the unfulfilled customs union agreement, this shows just how unready for accession Turkey is and is another slap in the face of the European Union."
"A stop must be put to the negotiations at long last."
"The aim should instead be to establish a privileged partnership."
"A visa-free regime has a great importance in people's lives as it strengthens people's contacts and helps to realise the idea of free movement, which is one of the fundamental rights in Europe."
"Already, in the context of the Thessaloniki action plan, the European Union has expressed the political desire to abolish the requirement for citizens of all the Western Balkan countries to obtain short-term visas."
"The definite fact that the European Union will, in the near future, give Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania, as well as the citizens of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia, the opportunity of visa-free travel will reduce the risk of an increase in ethnic and political instability, strengthen political and economic cooperation in the region, increase people's support for the European Union, and improve the prospects for European integration."
"At the same time, it will broaden people's horizons and hinder anti-European and extremist forces."
"However, I am unhappy about one fact, namely, that Kosovo is the only country which, because of private differences, the Member States have excluded from the abolition of visa requirements on citizens of Western Balkan countries."
"We do not want to punish Kosovo for private differences between inhabitants of the Member States, but the European Commission and the Council should quickly take steps to include Kosovo in the process of abolishing visa requirements, which would encourage Kosovo's state and government bodies and politicians to make the necessary structural reforms, and would strengthen political and economic cooperation with the European Union."
"Basel II and revision of the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD 4) (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Karas, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on Basel II and revision of the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD 4)."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with this report on Basel III, the European Parliament has a clear position on the deliberations of the Basel Committee."
"We would like to draw attention to the unresolved questions and problems that Europe faces, and we are putting before the Commission a collection of demands for the drawing up of the draft directive."
"Although - and I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs in this regard - this report was adopted by 38 votes to 0 in the committee, I nevertheless feel a need, as rapporteur, to table six additional amendments, three of which relate to developments occurring in the meetings of the Basel Committee, in order to bring the report up-to-date, and three of which relate to the leverage ratio and to the liquidity standards."
"We believe that it is not propitious to automatically incorporate the leverage ratio into Pillar 1 from 2018 but that there should instead be an evaluation process first."
"Secondly, there are a few unresolved issues in Basel in relation to the liquidity standards that need to be addressed to keep us up-to-date."
"I am a little bit amazed by the nine EU Member States in the Basel Committee, as they have allowed the process to be deemed completed despite the fact that we fail to see how there is a level playing field between the economic structure of the United States and the European economic and banking structure, and between classical retail and investment banking."
"Furthermore, we still do not have a definition of liquidity."
"The economic crisis, of course, demonstrated that we need a change of framework."
"It is therefore right to get to grips with this issue and to bring forward proposals."
"However, the crisis also clearly demonstrated that what we had was primarily a crisis of liquidity and not one primarily of capital resources, although we do need increased capital resources - one only needs to think of Lehman Brothers, where only 11% capital was held, to see that."
"From our point of view, there are five unresolved issues."
"The first is that there is no study into the impact of the figures that have now been agreed for growth and employment in the European Union."
"I would ask that the Commission produce and submit such a study as a matter of some urgency."
"Secondly, we have not examined in detail the cumulative effects of all the regulations that we are currently considering."
"Key examples here would be Basel III, deposit protection, the bank levy and the transaction tax, amongst others."
"Thirdly, there is no level playing field between the EU and the United States, for example, when it comes to accounting regulations, and there is still no agreement with regard to the time frame for implementation."
"Fourthly, there is no level playing field between retail banks and investment banks in the definition of capital."
"Fifthly, there are unresolved issues such as those of the leverage ratio, the definition of liquidity and the role of rating agencies in the light of the decisions the United States has made."
"These issues need to be resolved before the Commission brings forward a draft directive and they should not be concluded by the G20, but clarified, before being finalised by the Basel Committee."
"We will stay on the ball."
"Madam President, Mr Karas, ladies and gentlemen, just a few days after the agreement reached in the Basel Committee, I think that it is very important that Parliament is demonstrating its commitment to banking reform and clearly showing that Europe behaves and must behave in a way appropriate to its global standing."
"I would like to thank Mr Karas and the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for their commitment and for this excellent report."
"Mr Karas, you raise a number of critical points which will be studied very carefully before the adoption of our proposal for revision of the Capital Requirements Directive next spring."
"I first want to say that I share your view, Mr Karas, on the importance of problems which are specifically European - our banking economy in Europe does not resemble those of the other regions of the world in all areas - the necessity, Mr Karas, of an in-depth impact assessment and the need to maintain a level playing field at international level."
"We must, of course, stress that increased capitalisation of the banks is a necessary precondition for making the financial sector more stable and strong, but it will not be enough."
"As you know, ladies and gentlemen, since you are working on it, we must also have stricter supervision, stronger corporate governance, supervision of speculative financial activities and a framework for crisis management and for resolving banking crises."
"That is our road map."
"Thanks to you in particular, much progress has already been made in this direction."
"I am thinking of the supervision agreement and the Green Paper on the governance of financial institutions."
"The Commission, for its part, is doing its job, and it will do it in such a way that by the end of next spring, we will have submitted to you and to the Council all the texts that are expected of us for implementing the recommendations of the G20."
"It is in this spirit that, a few days ago, I presented the draft regulations on derivatives and on short selling."
"In a few days, we will put forward a new document on the bank resolution and crisis management tools."
"Returning to today's debate, however, I would like to discuss three issues, with regard to which I share Mr Karas's concerns."
"The first is the recognition of capital instruments issued by cooperative banks, or mutuals, under the definition 'tier one capital'."
"The agreement reached in Basel will allow us to take account of the specific circumstances of these unlisted banks, which play an essential role in financing European businesses."
"My services are now working with experts from the Member States on defining the technical arrangements for properly implementing these new principles in European legislation."
"Second, as regards the rules on liquidity and the definition of 'liquidity buffer', the Commission is fully aware of the problem raised in particular for Denmark and Austria."
"Indeed, the very serious concerns expressed by the Commission in this context are the very reason why an agreement has not yet been reached on this issue."
"We had some reservations, and my services will continue to work with our partners in Basel to find a solution, particularly as regards the recognition of covered bonds."
"The third point concerns the leverage ratio."
"We cannot go back on our commitments made at the G20 on this point."
"We are, however, satisfied with the agreement reached in Basel, which makes the leverage ratio part of Pillar 2 during a reporting period, as Mr Karas said a moment ago, the aim being to transfer it under Pillar 1."
"This transfer will not be automatic, and we will integrate a revision clause on this subject into our draft proposal for CRD 4."
"I would now like to say a few words on the implementation of the Basel Agreement in the European Union."
"This financial crisis has shaken the world."
"It has taught us some lessons, which we must take on board."
"The global prudential rules were not suited to real-life conditions."
"In addition to the reforms which have already been implemented in order to strengthen the existing rules, we now have the agreement recently drawn up in Basel by the group of governors of the central banks and those responsible for banking supervision."
"In my view, this agreement is good news."
"It is an important step in strengthening the rules and global financial stability, and this new Basel Agreement will help to establish common rules for the banking sector internationally, which is extremely important."
"This agreement also paves the way for a balanced solution: businesses benefit from an adaptation period providing sufficient time to meet these new requirements, which will allow for the health of the banking system to be gradually improved without, we think, compromising economic growth."
"Ladies and gentlemen, my services, my colleagues - whom I want to thank - have done a great deal of work in Basel to find common ground with our non-European partners."
"I hope that the Heads of State or Government of the G20 will approve this new Basel Agreement during the forthcoming Seoul Summit in November."
"However, we will not stop there."
"The next step will be to reform the basis of the banking system at Union level."
"We always take the specific circumstances of our Union into account when implementing international rules, and, ladies and gentlemen, the CRD 4 Directive will be no exception; here, too, we will take the specific circumstances of the European Union into account."
"Furthermore, in this context, we will specifically carry out the macro-economic and micro-economic analysis which forms part of this Basel Agreement, and you and your colleagues will naturally be informed about it, Mr Karas."
"Our aim is to adopt the proposal for a directive during the first quarter of 2011."
"This means that the Member States need to transpose it before 1 January 2013."
"That will give them enough time to conform to these new provisions."
"We must nevertheless remain realistic."
"This agreement reached in Basel constitutes very significant progress, but I repeat: there is still much to be done."
"We will work together with you and with the Member States in the coming months to implement one of the essential reforms of the post-crisis period."
"I would like to be very clear on this point too: we will be very attentive and very vigilant when it comes to ensuring that our main global partners - above all, the Americans, but not only them - also implement this essential reform correctly and in due time."
"This is an issue which I shall raise during my second and very imminent visit to the United States, at the end of this month."
"Finally, I agree with you, Mr Karas, that it is essential for the European Parliament to play an even greater role in this process."
"That is why, in conclusion, I pledge to keep you - your committee and the plenary session - regularly informed of all future developments within this Basel Committee."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to start by briefly praising Mr Karas' excellent work."
"I was one of the people who were in favour of an own-initiative report being produced before the Commission makes its proposals on the framework for transposing the Basel Agreement, and I am delighted that the work done by Mr Karas with the help of the various shadow rapporteurs has highlighted the main points for consideration."
"I will not repeat them here, Commissioner, and of course I welcome the points you make and your determination to ensure that this regulatory framework is effective and workable and above all that it creates no distortion of competition at international level."
"To move on to a different subject, I cannot help noticing that there is often a big difference between the statements that are made publicly and the commitment to these in practice."
"I also note that countries outside the European Union, and I am thinking of the United States in particular, have an irritating tendency to make value judgments about how we operate, whilst they themselves are not putting the systems into practice as they ought."
"As regards Basel, it is vital that European companies are dealt with on an equal footing and are not penalised more than US companies."
"In the United States, few banks are taking notice of these directives or of the Basel Committee and, at present, nothing is actually being put into practice."
"I would hate to see the provisions adopted in June to regulate US finance - the statements made about these exaggerate their real impact - being used as a legal basis for not applying the provisions which might be introduced by bodies outside the United States."
"Commissioner, I trust in what I know to be your total determination and vigilance to ensure that this does not lead to a distortion of competition for the French banks, the European banks, and for those who finance the economy in general."
"It is right that we should be steering the banks back towards their primary role of financing economic development, but we must make sure that they are not penalised disproportionately."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me just point one thing out before I start."
"The Basel Committee is a group of more or less intelligent central bankers and overseers, but it is certainly no infallible council of wise men and it is definitely not the law."
"This House is the legislative body - Commissioner, you know that, and we know that you do - and this legislative body will pay close attention to what is put on the table and, where it makes sense, to what is put on the table here, too."
"Clearly, we do want the rules on capital requirements to be tightened up."
"How could we not want that, in the wake of the economic crisis in which we still find ourselves? 20 to 30% of the gross national product of our national economies are in pawn as the rescue package for the banks."
"The people expect us, of course, to make respectable banking rules so that we do not find ourselves in a crisis like this one again."
"Clearly, we want there to be counter-cyclical elements in this banking safeguard like those, for example, that have already been proving their worth in Spain for years."
"Although there, too, they had to be implemented in the face of opposition, they are paying off today because they were implemented at an appropriately early point and they did not make the banking system worse; they made it more robust."
"There are key issues, though, and I am truly grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Karas, for having put these key issues at the heart of his own-initiative report, which we find ourselves absolutely and totally able to support."
"The first of these is that, yes, indeed, we do need an impact study, specifically a complex impact study that makes it clear what the impact is, for one thing, on the financial sector in all its parts but also, of course, in particular, what the impact is on the real economy."
"What is the impact on the issue of what the future actually holds for loan financing conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises?"
"The second issue is that we need the certainty that this time, unlike in the past, the agreements will also be implemented in other territories."
"We need to know that before we legislate, as otherwise there will be a new asymmetry for which we cannot be responsible."
"The third issue is that there can be no discrimination in terms of legal forms."
"Those forms among the diversity of the European banking system that particularly proved themselves during the financial crisis - and that means those banks that looked after the small and medium-sized business sector and those banks that were focusing on private customers and thus did not elicit cross-border risks - must not be penalised for the solidarity of their establishment."
"The proposal on the table at the moment does not do enough to ensure this."
"We therefore believe that the proposals need to now be improved and that we need to consider how we can tackle this issue in practical terms."
"Public banking overall is of major value, provided it can be run on a sensible basis."
"We do also need to ask - and I am thinking here about silent partnership reserves - how this will actually be effected in future, if we buy the regulations as they are envisaged in Basel."
"This cannot be the last word, nor is it the final version that we will accept."
"The capital instruments need to be measured in order to see the extent to which they ensure consistent quality without false provisos, are available to absorb losses, are durable and flexible in terms of payment, as the rapporteur also argues in his report."
"It is a reasonable starting position for us to take."
"We want the leverage effects to be limited and reasonable allowance to be made for the different risk profiles."
"We will examine your proposal, therefore, Commissioner, and we hope for the best of cooperation with Parliament."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, can I say to the Commissioner that when we voted on supervision, I said our legislation was like Swiss cheese, full of holes, places where the common rule book would not reach."
"Then, last week, bankers from around the EU assembled for Eurofi, discussing Basel III."
"The word on everyone's lips was 'national': national flexibility, national rules, national rules, national exemptions; the beast of perverse incentive was rampant."
"As soon as a framework is agreed for harmonisation and stability, the wriggling and the wheedling to make holes starts, and frankly, it is no better here."
"I am fed up of it."
"Why does Europe have to be the cry-baby of Basel?"
"This is not what we intended with the supervisory architecture."
"It is not what is intended by Basel III."
"The facts are clear."
"G20 was clear."
"Banks must be able to withstand the type of crisis that we have just had and capital is crucial to that."
"I am not blind to the problems of the real economy and the need for banks to lend and, like others, I look forward to the macro-economic and cumulative impact assessments, not just of Basel, but of the whole post-crisis financial regulation that you, Commissioner, and Commissioner Rehn both promised me in your competency hearings."
"To the banks, I say: we cannot give weight to your protestations while your aggregates are cloaked in secrecy and you stamp 'Confidential' on everything."
"So as far as I am concerned, the extended timetable of Basel is enough slippage: no more."
"Now, Commissioner, liquidity measures - as others have said - are not fully resolved, and I do fear more perverse incentives around the growing concentration on sovereign debt and short-term instruments."
"We must be very careful here; we must think and not replicate the same measures in every piece of the prudential regulation where they may not be appropriate and would destroy investments in equities and the real economy."
"Madam President, Basel III is supposed to be a starting point and under no circumstances must it be the furthest that the European Union is willing to go."
"To those who say that if we go further than Basel, we might jeopardise the competitiveness of our banks on the international scene, I say that our primary concern is, and should be, the viability of our economy."
"And if that means more stringent rules, then so be it."
"I would also add that we hear so much about a level playing field, and yet the United States does not hesitate to go it alone whenever it can and when it suits it to do so."
"Therefore, I do not want to see Europe simply waiting for some kind of consensus that will never materialise."
"Secondly, any transition period must necessarily be time-limited, and I can tell you that the eight years we are envisaging for ourselves is too long."
"What is more, and this is not something that has been factored in, during this transition period, strict conditions must be introduced regarding the payment of dividends and bonuses."
"We would find it indecent and unacceptable if, whilst the banks are claiming that it is difficult to build up the capital reserves imposed under the new rules, their shareholders and managers continue to help themselves from the kitty."
"My final message is directly for the banks."
"To those banks that complain that they will no longer be able to make the same profits they made during the golden years, I say that all businesses working in industry or retail in the real economy are having to make do with net yearly profits of between two and five per cent - and that is nothing to be ashamed of."
"It is time to realise, therefore, that the party is over."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, I am very aware that the economic crisis is far from over and that we do need lending in the wider economy."
"However, last week, we saw in Ireland that banks are still coming to the taxpayer for their bailouts."
"We cannot continue to have the taxpayer bailing out banks."
"We need banks that are prepared to take risks, but they need the capital and liquidity to live within their means when those risks go wrong."
"This is a complicated piece of work, and one for which I would like to thank Mr Karas, but it is only part of the work, and we need the right resolution mechanisms too."
"It is very clear from the number of amendments across the floor that MEPs want to look at the detail and at the impact."
"We must make sure a similar approach is taken to the collateral in the derivatives language."
"First of all, there is an impact assessment - it was done for Basel - but it is so cloaked in confidentiality that we cannot see it."
"Let us release it and use it."
"When we make an international agreement, we need to make sure that it is implemented globally - not just here and in Wall Street, but globally."
"There are a number of places in this text where there is wriggle-room - paragraph 24, on minority interests and deferred taxes, paragraph 40 with its description of Pfandbriefe, and the new paragraph 43A."
"Yes, Basel should look at networks of small banks supporting each other."
"They are doing that."
"However, my interpretation of the English is that we could, in some way, be seen to be pre-empting their conclusion."
"Furthermore, it has been agreed that there will be a migration towards a full and binding leverage ratio."
"Let us not move away from that."
"I agree that, where we have good local practices, we should allow them to continue, but let us examine those in public and not bring in exemptions through the back door."
"The market will just assume that back door to be a way of promoting bad practices, rather than promoting good practices."
"(FR) Madam President, I would like to start by thanking our rapporteur, Mr Karas, for his excellent work, and I fully support him in his approach to this complex matter."
"However, I feel it is important to use my two minutes to emphasise an issue which was mentioned in the report but which deserves a closer look."
"I refer to the matter of mortgage bonds, or Pfandbriefe in German, in the context of liquidity standards."
"The new European liquidity standards that we are working towards redefining should give greater recognition to their special economic, legal and operational nature."
"Mortgage bonds are used for long-term financing and investment in the wider economy."
"However, the Basel Committee's current proposal regarding these bonds would have a negative and disproportionate impact on Europe's economy compared with other major economic zones, such as the United States."
"I certainly welcome the fact that the agreement reached by the Basel Committee on 26 July 2010 recognises mortgage bonds as highly liquid assets in the context of calculating the liquidity coverage ratio."
"However, I call upon the Basel Committee and on the Commission, Mr Barnier, to give greater recognition to this financial instrument, with a view to promoting sufficient diversification of the eligible liquidity buffer assets and avoiding any distortion in the markets."
"This low-risk financial instrument must be given an environment in which it can thrive."
"(EL) Madam President, we all know that today's debate on the agreement reached by the Basel Committee is yet another step dictated by the recent crisis, a crisis which dramatically highlighted the shortcomings and weaknesses in the regulation and supervision of the financial system, reversed what had, until then, been the prevailing doctrine of deregulation of the markets, and highlighted the need for stricter rules, both on capital adequacy and on the supervision of financial institutions."
"Against this background, the Basel Committee has reached an agreement which includes certain basic principles and changes which need to be made to capital adequacy rules in order to improve the safeguards to the banking system."
"As far as the implementation of this agreement in Europe is concerned, Mr Karas's report highlights numerous important aspects which need to be taken into serious account, such as the peculiarity of the European market, on which 80% of lending is based on bank credits, the need to democratise the Basel process with more active participation by the European Parliament, among other things, and, of course, the proposal to include all euro area sovereign debt as high quality liquid assets, regardless of their credit rating, so as to reduce the impact of rating agencies."
"However, I wish to repeat that the new capital adequacy measures are a minimum review and still need more general reform over a longer time frame."
"Europe, as the Commissioner said, has already taken an important step in adopting the new European system of supervision."
"We are changing tack and promoting enhanced coordination as a basic preventive tool."
"However, we must not stop there."
"We need to take further steps by introducing a supervisory and regulatory framework for agencies which have hitherto been operating without controls, such as credit rating agencies and alternative funds."
"We need, at the heart of the proposals which you recently presented, Commissioner, to adopt rules to regulate transactions which are highly obscure and, as such, subject to increased systemic risk, such as the market in over-the-counter derivatives and naked options."
"Finally, Commissioner, as you referred to the G20 summit in Seoul, we need to lead efforts to introduce a tax on financial transactions, not, of course, to take revenge on or punish the banks, but to limit speculation and send a strong message to the citizens of the EU who are currently paying the price of the crisis, that we expect a fairer distribution of the burden."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, if banks have to hold more capital for loans and financial instruments, that increases their ability to bear losses."
"The most recent proposals from the Basel Committee take this stability-based approach as their basis."
"Unfortunately, the Basel Committee has not, as yet, satisfactorily addressed the problem of system-relevant banks."
"I therefore welcome Mr Karas's call for the requirements for the liquidity standards to be made independent of system-relevance."
"In other words, appropriately tougher requirements need to apply to banks that, due to their size or interconnectedness with the global financial system, need to be bailed out using taxpayers' money in crisis situations."
"We should take a more differentiated approach to the factor of debt leverage."
"Only when it is empirically proven that this instrument does not lead to arbitrage and distortions of competition and actually counters the overheated granting of loans should we consider permanently incorporating it into the first pillar."
"There is a need, in any case, for these proposals to be implemented at the global level."
"We cannot allow the US authorities to have a decisive influence on the Basel proposals only to not then implement them."
"The G20 summit in Seoul next month will show whether, and to what extent, we can achieve this objective."
"(PL) Madam President, firstly, I would like to say I am very pleased that the European Parliament has taken up this matter, especially because this report arose at Parliament's initiative."
"I would like to congratulate Mr Karas very warmly."
"In the last decade, we have seen unprecedented development in the different types of financial innovation and new instrument available."
"It is often these instruments, in fact, which determine the nature of the market today."
"I think that an essential condition for effective supervision is, in this situation, to be in possession of truly reliable knowledge about what is happening in these markets."
"Meanwhile, the financial instruments which have become so popular have reached a degree of complication which significantly hinders supervisors in making an appropriate evaluation of the risk associated with them."
"Besides these new instruments, we have to be aware that the market is changing and is globalising very rapidly, and that in the confrontation between the globalised, evolving market and national supervisors, these instruments are completely inappropriate and the supervision unsuccessful."
"The growth of financial institutions is also causing, in a certain sense, a lack of monitoring where the supervision takes place, and the supervision, therefore, is also hampered."
"By all this, I would like to say that there is a lack, in fact, of an overall view of the sector, both concerning the geographical aspect and concerning the sector's activity itself."
"Understanding the relations between the parties which are active in the sector, as well as the evolving nature of the activity itself, are, I think, crucial for the security of the financial system on a global scale."
"It seems to me that this has been lacking hitherto."
"The current Basel regulations concern, in fact, capital, and I am glad that the new measures are implementing the requirements associated with aspects of liquidity, as well as mechanisms of counter-cyclical policy."
"The measures proposed in this area should be welcomed."
"In the context of the low effectiveness of capital indicators as an advance diagnostic measure, stability of the system and the attempt at standardisation of liquidity coverage ratios should be assessed positively in both the short-term and long-term perspective, because it was, after all, liquidity problems which necessitated the measures to save the banks, to which we were witnesses."
"(SV) Madam President, it is, in many respects, a positive sign that work on the new capital adequacy rules is progressing."
"The fact that the Basel III process is being brought to a successful conclusion is a prerequisite for being able to restore stability to the financial sector."
"The report that we are to vote on now is both balanced and well-worded, but I would nevertheless like to highlight three points on which it could have been clearer."
"Firstly, it is important in itself not to place too much pressure on the banks by giving them far too short an implementation period, but at the same time, it is at least as important that the implementation does not go too slowly."
"The aim should be for the banks to have sufficient stability to be able to cope with the next recession."
"With the target as far away as 2017/2018, there is a risk that many banks will not manage this."
"Secondly, we must ensure that the implementation is carried out with close and positive cooperation with the United States and other players."
"The clear aim must be for the whole of the international banking sector to be stabilised, not just parts of it."
"Areas with weaker regulations or a slower rate of implementation could expose the whole of the global system to risks."
"Thirdly, regular stress tests are an excellent way to continually ensure that the banking system is stable."
"This is therefore something that we should use as an effective tool to complement the capital rules."
"Both the frequency and the requirement level of these tests could well be increased."
"The crisis has demonstrated that some things can happen extremely quickly."
"In the financial sector, it is therefore important for developments to be monitored very closely at all times."
"(SV) Madam President, Commissioner, the new Basel rules will establish the prerequisites for stability and sustainable growth."
"The crisis has taught us that the banks need to have more and better capital, and the regulations must promote sound banking and sound risk-taking."
"The rules concerning the leverage ratio must be formulated in such a way that banks that lend low-risk capital are not penalised."
"There is a risk that the rules will affect banks in the Nordic countries particularly badly, as these banks have large low-risk home loan portfolios."
"This gives cause for concern."
"All directives and new rules must be well thought-out, but, overall, we risk having too many rules, which, in turn, could damage growth."
"I agree with Mrs Bowles that the Commission must produce an analysis of the effects of all these new banking rules on growth in Europe."
"Rules and new laws are not always the answer."
"Let us not settle for good if we can achieve the best."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to thank Mr Karas for his excellent work."
"I believe that we have stood by and watched this severe global economic and financial meltdown impotently over the past two years, even though some claim that things could have been even worse."
"Today, the European Union is at the sharp end, and you, Commissioner, are conducting a revolution, aimed at stability, to provide us with the guarantees we need."
"During the last plenary session, we gave economic power a positive shake-up to safeguard Europe itself."
"As you stated not long ago, proposals have already been prepared on derivative products and short selling, and we are also discussing taxation on banks and the levy on financial transactions while awaiting the Commission's final proposed revision."
"Commissioner, we need to take great care that, as often happens, we do not go from one extreme to the other, with rules and laws that could hinder or slow down economic development and recovery."
"I believe that rigidity and bureaucracy are always lying in wait."
"It is true that at the moment, we need stability, but it is even more true that we very much need growth, growth and more growth - as President Barroso stated in this Chamber."
"Basel III marks the start of a process that requires all of us to be responsible, but we must also safeguard competitiveness and equal conditions and pay attention to SMEs, on the one hand, and savings and cooperative banks, on the other, which are close to the grass roots."
"Madam President, I think everybody agrees that we need to strengthen the resilience of the banking system."
"Thanks to Mr Karas, we are aware that under the Basel proposals, we do not have a level playing field, and if you do not have a level playing field, you cannot compete."
"In fact, there is a great danger that you will score many own goals."
"The point has been made, but needs to be made precise, that the US and Europe are totally different."
"The US economy is mainly financed through the capital markets."
"Europe relies mainly on the lending capacity of the banking sector and we know that more than anywhere in Ireland."
"Our banks simply cannot give credit to SMEs, and otherwise viable SMEs are going to the wall every day simply because they are starved of credit."
"And, as Vicky pointed out, the taxpayer is bailing out these bankers and also funding the redundancy packages and the pension funds and the golden handshakes of dormant regulators, etc."
"So there is a lot of work to be done to get the balance right and I think that is the key here."
"I am encouraged by the Commissioner's response, and he did say he would work with us and would try and get the balance right and establish a level playing field."
"Then we would be scoring goals and not conceding own goals."
"Thank you, Madam President, and thank you to everyone for your proposals, your encouragement, your suggestions and your requests, which I and my team have noted carefully."
"Mr Gauzès was the first to mention the issue of striking the right balance, and this was reiterated by Mr Schmidt, Mr Klinz, Mr Ludvigsson, and just now Mr Kelly."
"Yes, we will be aiming to ensure that we strike the right balance; in fact, the balance needs to be struck in three particular areas to which I will be paying very close attention:"
"Striking an intelligent balance in the Basel measures themselves and the way in which we transpose them into our legislation."
"I will be making the best possible use of the transition periods and of the room for manoeuvre that the Basel Agreement gives us, plus you will be making your own contribution."
"The second area in which a balance must be struck is between the Basel measures and all the other measures that we are introducing in the context of the G20 crisis prevention and management agenda, and I will come back to these in a moment."
"The third area, which Mr Kelly has just mentioned, concerns the United States."
"Mr Kelly, I realise that Europe's banking sector is much more involved in financing the economy than is the case in the United States, and we will be taking this difference into account."
"This is the transatlantic balance."
"We need to see to this - I am addressing Mr Lamberts in particular - without waiting for the United States."
"I will be going back to the United States to see Tim Geithner and the other supervisors and I am not going there to drag my heels, but to make sure that we are all moving in the same direction on Basel II, Basel II and a half, Basel III, Basel IV - I beg your pardon, Basel III and CRD 4 - and on another extremely sensitive subject, which could become a point of divergence between the Americans and Europeans, and that is the matter of accounting standards."
"We are not naive, therefore, in our relationship with the United States, but nor do we want to pre-judge its intentions."
"I can therefore reassure Mr Gauzès and all the other honourable Members that we will be paying close attention to this three-way balance."
"Mr Cancian has also quite rightly mentioned financial instability, which is indeed the worst enemy of growth."
"This is why we need to establish conditions that will promote greater financial stability and, in view of the debate we are having with China at the moment, I would add monetary stability also."
"I have taken careful note of Mr Bullmann's comments urging us to conduct thorough micro-economic and macro-economic studies."
"We will also make productive use of the transition periods, which are not indefinite, and you are quite right, Mr Bullmann, in saying that it is here and in the Council that Europe's laws are made, not elsewhere, not in Basel."
"This is where the European legislator is and this is precisely why we are going to produce a proposal for CRD 4, which will be a legislative proposal on which we will be seeking your approval, even before the debate and motion stages."
"Mrs Bowles, you are absolutely right in questioning us and in saying that it cannot be business as usual."
"I also hear certain bankers here and there, who have short memories, telling us that the economic crisis is over and that we can return to business as usual."
"We cannot allow ourselves to have short memories, and it will not be business as usual."
"We are perfectly serious about making reforms."
"I would also add, Madam President, that the improved capitalisation we are talking about in Basel and CRD 4 is not the only tool, or the only solution."
"There are many other solutions to crisis management, which I mentioned earlier on in my first speech: there is everything that we are doing to regulate hedge funds of course, which I hope we will be completing in the next few days; then there is our action on private equities, derivatives and short selling."
"There are other tools which are also important."
"A few moments ago, Mr Ludvigsson spoke about stress tests."
"These need to be carried out regularly."
"So this is our approach at the moment."
"Mr Lamberts, I will just mention another important point that you brought up: the payment of dividends by banks that do not put the minimum capitalisation requirements into practice."
"This problem has been clearly accounted for through one of the so-called buffers, in this case, the capital conservation buffer, which stipulates that a bank cannot pay out dividends if it has not fulfilled the minimum capitalisation requirements."
"This is one of the provisions which we will, of course, be incorporating in our legislative proposal."
"Mrs Ford, we do indeed need to protect taxpayers."
"I am sure you will be watching closely for the proposals we will be making in a few days' time on crisis management and prevention, and on the creation of a resolution fund in every Member State, we hope, which will ensure that the banks pay for the banks, not the taxpayers."
"Mrs Lulling asked a very specific question."
"Yes, in the Basel talks, my colleagues and I were very attentive to this point and we obtained an agreement that 40% of the liquidity buffer may be made up by the Pfandbriefe, or mortgage bonds, that you asked about."
"I feel this is a positive result, and we are totally in favour of diversification of liquid assets."
"Mr Klinz raised the issue of 'too big to fail'."
"Here again, when this concern was raised in the United States, I replied that it was impossible to make comparisons, because the US and European banking systems are not the same, either in terms of their contribution to the economy or in their structure."
"However, Mr Klinz, it is an issue that is not yet settled at international level, both in the context of the G20 and that of the Financial Stability Board."
"We are watching the situation closely, to make sure that taxpayers are not and cannot be called upon."
"Mr Nitras, as regards complex financial instruments, we need stronger supervision."
"That is why the new European authority, the ESMA, will be playing a key role, thanks largely to this Parliament, in looking into the possibility of banning certain toxic products, and you will see that we will be further reinforcing ESMA's role in the near future."
"Lastly, I would like to let Mrs Podimata know that regarding the rating agencies, here again, there will be a third round of actions."
"What we have done so far with yourselves is not enough, and I am currently working on this third round of actions to regulate rating agencies and diversify the rating agency market, which, to put it mildly, is concentrated in too few hands."
"We questioned the ministers at ECOFIN last Friday, and your committee Chair, Mrs Bowles, was present."
"I am going to prepare a consultation aimed at strengthening this regulation."
"Mr Schmidt also raised the issue of a cumulative effect; however, I have answered this question in my point about the three-way balance, which is something we are going to be watching very closely."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, The debate was lucid, clear, competent and responsible."
"We put out a very good image of ourselves as both cohesive and determined."
"Commissioner, I would also like to thank everyone who participated, you included."
"We are not putting the process in doubt, but it is not concluded."
"We have also brought up a painful subject."
"The sore point in question consists, above all, of the differences in banking and economic structures between Europe and the United States."
"We need to say one thing clearly at this point, and that is that, while the legislative process has not started yet, the Basel process does prejudice and limit our freedom to manoeuvre in political decision making."
"What would have happened if we had not produced an own-initiative report off our own bats?"
"There would not have been a debate today."
"We therefore need to bring democracy and parliamentarianism into the Basel process, the G20 process, the new global institutions that are being created, and, at the same time, we need to be involved in the process so as not to always be presented with faits accomplis."
"Basel III and deposit protection need to be connected, as there is a connection between the two."
"We need a link between our decision making and global implementation, particularly in the United States."
"We need the definition of liquidity before we get the draft directive."
"Meanwhile, the Dodd-Frank Act in the United States presents us with another problem."
"Because the Americans are going to have problems implementing the liquidity standard, they are now attempting, once again, to introduce additional criteria alongside the external ratings."
"Our maxim must be that either external ratings or alternative criteria such as price stability should act as the basis of evaluation."
"Yet we absolutely should not have both for Europe and only one for the United States."
"We need to be vigilant and let us also together ensure, Commissioner, that the national finance and economic ministers pass on to their national parliaments what the Commission is now reporting in its impact study."
"There is less awareness in the national parliaments about what we are doing here and what the impact and causes are in the Member States than there is in this House."
"We also need to begin an offensive here."
"Let us involve the national parliaments in this communication process."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"I believe that the recent economic and financial crisis, or the biggest recession since the days of the great depression, has highlighted the need for a radical review of the current Basel II regulatory framework."
"I would like to remind you here in Parliament that the Basel II agreement defines the criteria for accessibility to credit by forcing banks to objectively assess the credit status of a company, taking account of risks connected with its possible state of insolvency, of guarantees, and of exposure in the event of bankruptcy."
"Although the aim of these criteria is to improve the competitiveness of companies and strengthen the financial system, they are excessively punitive to the small and medium-sized enterprises that drive the Union's economy."
"In concrete terms, because European enterprises are not on such a firm financial footing, application of the agreement often means less access to credit and higher interest rates."
"Although I find the efforts of the Basel Committee to update the general regulatory framework to be encouraging, I am extremely concerned about the shortcomings that emerged during the course of the negotiating process."
"For this reason, I agree that it is advisable for Parliament to be more involved in the negotiations with the aim of making the changes needed to ensure that European industry and the European economy are not at a disadvantage."
"A new stability pact for Europe is bound to involve the banking system, which represents the other end of the process in which the own resources that are the beating heart of the European economy are used."
"In other words, the debt that the Member States of the European Union accumulate over time to produce national wealth and distribute it to their citizens is funded and managed by the banks, which should be able to make it produce profit."
"While it is true that the Member States will still need a great deal of time to adjust to the standardisation of their financial laws and also to achieve an appropriate level of uniformity within their tax systems, establish decent margins of liquidity, and request reliable leverage effects to guarantee savings and their long-term trends, we must ensure that we can manage to find the right response to the crisis even in the short term."
"The own funds that the European Union will have increasing access to will ensure that the aim of EU resources management will be increasingly less to shore up systemic risks and increasingly more to create a set of stimuli to benefit national economies, not only jealously guarded within national borders, but integrated to optimise the use of the respective comparative advantages."
"Financial institutions that are strong and stable are crucial to the sustainability of the capital market, to access to credit, to competitiveness, and to economic and financial stability."
"I therefore welcome the adoption of this report, particularly because it includes crucial measures that I tabled dealing with the situation of national financial institutions."
"I am referring, in particular, to: the need for the Basel Committee and the Commission to clarify the treatment of reciprocal financial cross-holding agreements; the importance of defining the criteria for high quality liquid assets taking into account the definition of European Central Bank eligible assets for monetary policy operations (repo facility); and the inclusion of all euro area sovereign debt as high quality liquid assets, regardless of its specific rating, thus reducing the disproportional impact of rating agency actions."
"The submitted report is drafted in relatively precise terms."
"It analyses clearly the issue of the new proposed banking regulation that is under review (Basel II), and gives a detailed analysis of its main points, which, at present, are being discussed at the practical and academic levels."
"In concrete terms, it involves introducing measures which should contribute to the greater financial stability of the banking sector, and to reducing the probability of another crisis, focusing on the following five areas: the quality of capital (increasing the quality of bank capital is undoubtedly desirable), stricter liquidity standards (the liquidity risk was shown to be significant during the crisis), countercyclical measures (the creation of additional banking capital in good times should limit excessive credit growth and consequent creation of price bubbles, such as, for example, in Spain), the introduction of a leverage ratio (this new indicator should contribute to the greater stability of banks, but it should include not only financial items contained in the bank's balance sheet, but also off-balance sheet items, such as derivatives and the contingent liabilities of the bank) and, last but not least, the creation of a central counterparty for the settlement of OTC transactions, particularly in relation to greater transparency in derivatives."
"Based on the above, I believe that the submitted report contains a detailed analysis as well as relevant recommendations in the area of the proposed bank regulation, and I therefore recommend that the proposed text be approved."
"I believe that having dynamic, clearly defined financial markets, capable of financing huge investments, is an absolute prerequisite for the European economy's recovery."
"I strongly support the commitment made during the G20 meeting to generate a greater volume of capital and draw up liquidity management standards."
"These good quality liquidity standards are a key element in the response to the crisis."
"I also think that a greater degree of flexibility from the eligible assets available in the European Union, which can be achieved by identifying secure financing sources and their specific features, will create financial stability when faced with crisis situations, both in the short and long term."
"The financial and economic crisis of recent years has dispelled illusions that the banks know their own risk best and are able to determine security requirements on their own."
"The profound ignorance of some of the people in charge of banks, the paramount importance given to sales plans and the ignoring of risk factors, accompanied by the passivity of the system of financial supervision, are the fundamental sins of the banking sector which were the direct catalyst of the world recession."
"Basel II has not proved very effective as a crisis prevention mechanism."
"In these circumstances, it is essential, as quickly as possible, to create a new code of standards - Basel III - which will no longer include the optimistic assumption of the ability of banks to regulate themselves."
"Raising capital requirements will certainly contribute to an increase in the security of the banking sector by a growth in liquidity."
"However, such measures also carry the risk of transferring costs to the clients of banks - a growth in credit prices and other financial services - to the detriment of the economy."
"It is necessary, therefore, to guarantee suitable protective frameworks which would prevent us from being affected by this unwelcome effect, or at least keep it to a minimum."
"On the other hand, however, we must be aware that financial security also costs."
"The question is, how much are we willing to pay for it?"
"The crisis has clearly shown that even bank capital has been insufficient regarding solvability and solvency."
"The existing regulatory framework therefore requires an in-depth revision and thus, the efforts of the Basel Committee to upgrade the framework in general are to be welcomed, in particular, with uniform, clear and transparent regulations."
"However, there are some shortcomings here and, in its current form, the framework would put the European economy at a competitive disadvantage."
"European companies rely on credit from the banks."
"Eighty per cent of investment and lending in Europe is based on bank credits."
"In this regard, it is particularly important to secure financing for SMEs."
"Differences must be taken into account without penalising certain business models."
"Otherwise, there is a risk of harming the European economy."
"Commission fines in antitrust cases (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on Commission fines in antitrust cases."
"Madam President, it is, as ever, a great pleasure to be here with you day and night, and I speak on behalf of my colleague and friend, Mr Almunia, who has been held up as we speak at the working dinner between China and the European Union."
"Your House has asked the Commission to voice its policy on fines in the fight against anti-competitive practices."
"On its behalf, therefore, I am delighted to make this presentation."
"As you know, the Commission is duty bound to fight anti-competitive practices and to penalise them when they are detrimental to companies and consumers in the internal market."
"The primary tool that we have at our disposal is our power to impose fines on companies involved in these cartels, which adopt restrictive business practices or abuse their dominant position."
"These fines are fixed in accordance with our guidelines on the method of setting fines."
"The version currently in force was adopted just four years ago."
"We also offer reduced fines for companies willing to cooperate in our investigations, for example, when they draw our attention to the existence of a cartel, and also for companies agreeing to reach a settlement with the Commission."
"This saves a great deal of time and resources for all parties."
"In any event, companies cannot be forced to shell out more than 10% of their total annual turnover, which is the ceiling for the level of fines that can be imposed."
"Fines, therefore, honourable Members, are our primary tool."
"However, the introduction of sanctions for individuals should not be ruled out in the future, in particular, administrative sanctions."
"A number of Member States actually authorise such sanctions."
"We want to look closely at the legal and political implications of this kind of development."
"Is there a need for a formal legal framework?"
"Article 23 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 provides the legal basis for fines imposed by the Commission but not the guidelines on the method of setting fines."
"Article 23 sets out the basic principles, including the turnover ceiling, which I have just mentioned, whereas the guidelines give details of how they are applied."
"It is relatively standard practice in many European legal systems to have a wide range of possible sanctions laid down by law as well as administrative guidelines on the method of setting the definitive penalty."
"This is true of Germany, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands when it comes to the application of competition rules."
"Based on this situation, we see no reason to propose new legislation on the fines imposed by the European Union in competition cases."
"The second question is whether the guidelines need to be revised before looking at the level of fines imposed."
"I would like to give you an idea of what cartels cost the European economy."
"According to our estimates, the damage caused by the 18 cartels dismantled between 2005 and 2007 ran to almost EUR 8 billion."
"Studies have also shown that cartels led to a 10 to 30% increase in prices, a tempting prospect which would be hard to resist were it not for vigorous implementation of competition legislation, which is our job."
"Our fines are set at a level that fairly punishes past unlawful behaviour."
"They are high but they reflect the damage caused and the unlawful gains achieved by members of the cartel."
"Our fines must also effectively deter companies from engaging in such anti-competitive practices in the future."
"That is why, I repeat, we see no reason to amend the 2006 guidelines on the method of setting fines."
"The third and final question is whether fines should be reduced during the crisis."
"Rest assured that we look very closely at the financial situation of companies which, in some cases, claim their inability to pay and that we have significantly reduced our fines for a number of them."
"For example, during recent decisions on sanitary ware for bathrooms, or high-tensile steel, we have applied reductions ranging from 25 to 75%."
"It is not in our interest, honourable Members, to exclude companies from the market."
"In fact, it is quite the opposite."
"Competition rules are often applied so as to enable new companies to break into the market and go about their normal business on a level playing field."
"Madam President, Commissioner, first of all, I would like to thank the Commission for the flexibility it has just shown."
"Commissioner Barnier made reference to the fact that, in certain industries, in the construction industry, given the fact that there has been a substantial economic slump in the sector, there has been considerable movement when laying down penalties and granting - you cannot say 'allowances' - deferred payment options."
"I believe that to be a reasonable reaction on the Commission's part, given the special economic situation in which many companies find themselves."
"Irrespective of this welcome flexibility on the Commission's part, however, there is nonetheless clearly a need to ask the fundamental question of whether the system of determining penalties that we are currently looking at still, in any way, corresponds to the principles of the rule of law."
"Dare I say, there may be some doubt about this."
"The reason is that, in laying down such a broad determination framework without specific criteria being laid down in the legislative instrument itself, Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 clearly does give the Commission such a free hand that you could almost suspect that the decisions behind it are not necessarily based on law making, but could instead very much involve certain elements of randomness."
"Unfortunately, the European General Court has so far gone along with this practice and this method of determination and has not been critical of it."
"I could imagine, however - and we do face a changed situation, as we will now very soon accede to the European Convention on Human Rights and the Treaty of Lisbon has now made the Charter of Fundamental Rights binding - that, potentially, the case-law could change in light of this."
"I therefore think that consideration really should be given to this and I welcome the fact that the Commission is thinking about amending the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 in this area with regard to criteria and other types of sanctions, making the provisions more specific and laying down tougher criteria including in relation to the penalty measures to be laid down."
"Personally, I believe this to be necessary in order to counter the deficits in the rule of law that many experts see in Europe."
"Madam President, Commissioner, the subject of fines is a very important one."
"It is about responding to anti-competitive conduct, and that response must be effective and firm."
"A weak, inadequate response will be an incentive and stimulus for infringements."
"Therefore, fines must deter those who infringe the rules but also act as a general deterrent for all operators."
"It must be clear that illegal competition is not going to provide any advantages or benefits for those who do it."
"It is true that the Commission has a broad margin of discretion in the application of fines."
"However, discretion does not mean acting arbitrarily, because there are rules, limits and criteria, there is a procedure with guarantees and, in any case, there is judicial control."
"The treaty, Regulation (EC) No 1/2003, the 2006 guidelines and the Communication on the leniency programme - also from 2006 - all constitute a framework that is working reasonably well."
"The system could, however, be improved."
"Experience of applying the system, recommendations from experts and the concerns legitimately expressed by institutions and some operators advise us to tackle certain issues."
"Transparency and predictability could be improved and its impact on small and medium-sized businesses, employment and the sustainability of businesses could also be discussed."
"Flexibility regarding the amount and payments should also be considered, along with the connection with leniency programmes, and even how to overcome the differences between the systems in the various Member States."
"Moreover, the system would be complete if other relevant tools were added: for example, stressing individual liability, considering other types of remedy - not only in order to put an end to anti-competitive conduct, but also to prevent it from re-occurring - and launching private actions for compensation for both individuals and groups."
"All these issues must be tackled rigorously, systematically and positively, without raising doubts about the way that competition policy works."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, I agree with much of what has been said by the previous speakers."
"I welcome the Commissioner's statement because, if I listen carefully, the Commission is actually open to the Parliament's request, which was included in last year's report on competition policy, for a more sophisticated toolkit with regard to antitrust policies."
"The focus has been very much on fines and the size of the fines, but we should be careful that this does not turn into an ideological debate."
"This is very much about having a toolkit which is an effective deterrent to anti-competitive practices."
"As you rightly pointed out, the damage to our economy and also to consumers is considerable."
"I think that fines should be reasonable but, if companies are complaining about fines, then the one thing they should not do is engage in cartels."
"That is the best guarantee that they will not face excessive fines."
"Last year, we asked for proposals by the Commission for more sophisticated instruments."
"We asked you to come forward with proposals that would cover issues like individual responsibility (which you mentioned), transparency and accountability of firms, shorter procedures, the right to defence and due process, and mechanisms to ensure the effective operation of leniency applications, but also corporate compliance programmes and the development of European standards."
"I would like to know if the Commission intends to come forward with such proposals."
"We realise that this is very complicated, as we are looking at national competences and EU competences."
"But I think we share the common objective of making the market function properly."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, I recall a few years ago asking the then Competition Commissioner whether she was aware of any evaluation being carried out on the effectiveness for consumers of fines set, and on this matter, the then Commissioner indicated at the beginning of our committee meeting that she had managed to claw back so many million euro in fines."
"And so the answer was that it had not been considered."
"It would appear that since then, you have carried out studies to find out what damages were actually incurred."
"However, I would like to draw your attention to two matters."
"The first being that prices are fixed on the basis of a group's turnover."
"However, the company that may have violated competition rules, and I am not condoning it, may be a relatively small company within the group."
"That is what bothers me, especially when there are separate legal entities involved."
"Secondly, Commissioner, and it is you who said so and not your colleague, you often talk about the need for prevention, saying that prevention is better than repression and, in any case, more effective."
"So the question I ask is whether these huge fines, which always make the front page of the newspapers in which they are delivered, really have any role in terms of prevention."
"And I wonder whether it might not be more effective in terms of prevention to focus more on the number of checks rather than on the level of fines."
"As has recently been the case in France, sentences can clearly be passed for sums of money requiring 4 or 5 000 years to be paid off."
"I think that we should not become fixated on these figures."
"We need to look specifically at the repercussions for the company, at a time of uncertain economic circumstances."
"Skewing the rules of competition is not right."
"It is quite right that a penalty is applied but this penalty needs to be truly proportional, which is why we wanted to know whether or not the Commission would amend its rules."
"I think you said that this would not be the case, which is a shame."
"Madam President, I do not know about companies having 400 years to pay off fines, but that does sound rather draconian."
"Nonetheless, Commissioner, I realise that you are not necessarily in a position tonight to make policy on the hoof either."
"To that effect, I will be submitting some questions to Commissioner Almunia on the issues that we are talking about tonight."
"I would like to make two brief points."
"Firstly, I would request that the Commission deliver on the impact assessments for the 2006 guidelines."
"I understand Mr Almunia's staff have already indicated that this can be done."
"I am looking forward to seeing them."
"Perhaps I just need to be up-to-date on that, but I would be reassured if that was the case."
"Secondly, we have heard tonight that all the focus is on fines - and fines that are imposed on companies which violate the terms of competition."
"There may be a graduation of fines, but these do not seem to deter them."
"They still do it."
"We may have to be inventive about what we do."
"In the case of price fixing, for example, quite often, small enterprises further downstream may be affected by the consequences of companies having done this and, through no fault of their own, fall foul of these particular fines."
"What if the Commission was to think about the social impact for a minute?"
"What if the Commission was to think about adopting different approaches?"
"In the UK, for example, the arrangements allow for the disqualification of directors, instead of imposing the fines, which actually deals with the culprits involved and allows the workforce and the companies to survive - an intelligent philosophy perhaps, and one we might borrow from as a model of what we could do, or even just as a pilot."
"There are other examples - as we have heard from around the floor, from other countries - where I am sure we could do the same."
"If we apply some intelligence to this, we can do a lot to secure that workforces for the companies out there are not equally affected by the bad practices of the directors who adopt this cartel philosophy."
"Madam President, I will be brief."
"I want to welcome what colleagues have said this evening."
"The power that we have in terms of fines in antitrust cases is a real power to break cartels, to prevent anti-competitive practices, and to put the consumer first."
"There are three questions I want to ask the Commission, like Mr Gauzès and others."
"Firstly, what can we do better in terms of prevention?"
"Secondly, are we looking - as Mr Skinner said - at best practice in the different Member States?"
"Mr Skinner's suggestion concerning board complicity, and what we can do about directors, is essential."
"Thirdly, can we have a timescale for the prospective proposals?"
"Madam President, Articles 81, 101 and 102 all deal with these issues, under cartels, price fixing, predatory pricing, etc. Certainly it is something that we should be concerned about, but often, it is difficult to prove that they actually exist."
"For instance, I have here a headline which says 'Antitrust: car prices fell only slightly in 2009', whereas prices for repairs and maintenance continue to rise despite the crisis, despite a reduction in wages and despite deflation, rather than inflation."
"Is that a cartel?"
"In my own country, if there is a shower of rain, the price of cattle drops automatically."
"I think there is certainly a need to look at the guidelines, both in terms of establishing trends over a long period of time and also in the actual punishments you are going to apply."
"I think Mr Skinner made a very interesting suggestion when he said 'make the directors pay'."
"I would say that we should also have a fine: do both."
"There is a certainly a lot of work to be done, but we are going the right way."
"Madam President, I have now heard all the arguments and requests and I will report them carefully to my colleague, Mr Almunia, who has told you, through me, that he sees no reason now to propose brand new legislation on fines, since the current Regulation (EC) No 1/2003, which I have already mentioned, may be of great use to us in the foreseeable future."
"As for the guidelines, the Commission constantly monitors their application and it is open to any suggestions for improvement and, from this point of view, what has been said by some would be extremely helpful."
"Mr Lehne, Mr Gauzès, Mr Skinner, we have nothing against a certain degree of flexibility in our practices controlling the application of regulations, within the limits set by the guidelines of case-law, in order to take into account an economic situation that is still challenging."
"However, for the time being, I repeat, Mr Almunia sees no need to revise the 2006 guidelines."
"He is satisfied with the way that these guidelines are working."
"They have proved adequately flexible during the current crisis, enabling us to take into account the difficult financial situation faced by some companies, as mentioned by some of you."
"The Commission is bound by these guidelines on the method of setting fines."
"This means that they provide companies with legal certainty as the Commission cannot depart from them without good grounds."
"If the Commission does depart from the guidelines, it runs the risk of having the courts annul its decisions."
"Mrs in 't Veld, regarding different sanctions other than fines, we should assess to what extent it would be possible, if necessary, to integrate them into our current legal framework."
"Although alternative sanctions are in place in Member States, they only seem to be used in a minority of cases and fines remain the primary form of sanction."
"This debate should be steered by two principles."
"Firstly, individual sanctions must not call into question our current system for controlling infringements, in particular, the leniency programme."
"Secondly, the fact that directors or employees of a company have been individually penalised, which is therefore possible, does not in any way diminish the company's responsibility where it has broken the rules of competition."
"Lastly, the Commission believes that the current level of fines and uniform application of the European Union's competition law are a good deterrent against anti-competitive behaviour within the internal market."
"One point, Mr Lehne."
"We have an administrative system for ensuring the proper implementation of competition rules."
"What is more, this system has many advantages."
"We also have the case-law of the Court which supports this system."
"Mr Sánchez Presedo mentioned transparency, and this does not surprise me considering the other debates with him regarding supervision."
"There are possible improvements."
"We have flexible guidelines, as I have just mentioned, and, in particular, this year has seen the introduction of best practices."
"Lastly, Mrs in 't Veld and Mrs Stihler brought up the issue of more sophisticated programmes and more sophisticated instruments."
"We can raise this issue through the compliance programmes."
"They are very welcome."
"I am well aware, in our view, that companies take these compliance programmes seriously and that can help prevention which, in fact, Mr Gauzès, is still cheaper than compensation or punishment."
"Finally, Mr Skinner and Mr Kelly talked about the companies that sometimes suffer as a result of these punishments and the social problems that that can cause."
"It is with keen interest that we follow developments in Member States, in particular, in small and medium-sized enterprises."
"That is why we are keen to propose, as indicated in our White Paper, that we will act on damages actions to check how effective they are and to assess their impact."
"For this reason, the Commission will soon be launching a public consultation on this matter."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The European Commission is imposing increasingly more frequent and higher fines on the cartels and companies which abuse their position on the market."
"The amount of fines imposed by the Commission passed the EUR 2 billion mark in 2009."
"I welcome the swift response from the European executive."
"At the same time, we must ask ourselves whether the current system of sanctions is sufficiently comprehensive."
"The Commission plays the dual role of prosecutor and judge."
"Furthermore, the adverse effects of the fines imposed also entail employees at the companies which have been penalised losing their jobs."
"This means that people who have not broken the law become collateral victims."
"Consequently, I believe that a set of more sophisticated measures needs to be drawn up for antitrust cases, aimed at both promoting more transparent procedures, through appointing an independent judiciary, and introducing the option to punish on an individual basis directors responsible for companies' illegal behaviour."
"One-minute speeches on matters of political importance"
"The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"(PL) Madam President, I would like to refer to the problems encountered at European airports by mothers with young children and by the elderly."
"On the grounds of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2006, these two groups should be provided with assistance by the airport."
"Unfortunately, in most cases, the provisions of the regulation are not being respected."
"Even in a television commercial, which was made with great flourish this year on the orders of the European Commission, there is not a word about mothers or fathers travelling on their own with young children."
"The solution to the problem is simple - effective action should be taken to inform the citizens of their rights."
"Firstly, the title of the regulation should be changed, by adding information to show that it also concerns mothers or fathers who travel on their own with young children."
"Secondly, a new pictogram should be proposed for this group of travellers, which would be obligatory at all airports in Member States of the European Union."
"(ES) Madam President, as a member of the Committee on Human Rights, as a Spanish and European citizen, and as a victim of terrorism since the terrorist organisation ETA murdered my brother and his wife in Seville, I am speaking here today to condemn the fact that the Venezuelan Government and its President has allowed ETA terrorists to train on Venezuelan soil on the orders of the alleged terrorist, Arturo Cubillas, who works for Hugo Chávez's government despite the fact that there is an international warrant out for his arrest; this is a serious violation of the fundamental right to all European citizens' right to security."
"I demand firm action from the Spanish Government in response to this serious humiliation of all the Spanish people."
"Mr Zapatero cannot continue to keep quiet while the Venezuelan Ambassador describes the members of our Civil Guard, who have been, and will continue to be, models of bravery in the fight against ETA, as torturers."
"Nor can he look the other way as cooperation on Venezuelan soil between ETA and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia grows, which has already been condemned by the Judge Eloy Velasco."
"Mr Zapatero cannot shake the hand of a leader such as Mr Chávez, who is turning Venezuela into a haven for terrorists."
"The Prime Minister of a country such as Spain, where terrorism has caused so much pain, cannot continue to ignore this problem and should give the response that such a situation deserves, which is what any ordinary citizen would do if they had the opportunity."
"Madam President, the matter I was wanting to raise today is that, on 18 September, 36 Members of this House, including myself, were honoured by the European Lung Foundation for our anti-tobacco work."
"This is actually the European Year of the Lung, and the petition can still be signed by colleagues who are interested in our work against the tobacco industry and on tobacco control."
"At the moment, only 10 out of the 27 Member States have a comprehensive ban on smoking in public places, to make these places smoke-free."
"I am proud that Scotland was one of the first countries to introduce a smoking ban in public places."
"The recent evidence suggests that there has been an 18% drop in the number of children coming into hospitals with asthma because of this ban on smoking in public places."
"This is something we have to see replicated across the European Union."
"I would ask the House to congratulate the 36 colleagues who were presented with this award by the European Lung Foundation on 18 September."
"Madam President, I would like to welcome last week's vote by the Committee on Budgets to freeze the salaries and allowances of European Commissioners unless changes are made to their Code of Conduct."
"That vote shows that Parliament will not tolerate any repeat of a case like that of Charlie McCreevy, the former internal market Commissioner, whose new directorship is being investigated by the Commission over concerns of a possible conflict of interest."
"201 requests have been made by Commission figures seeking permission to take up jobs following their time in the Commission."
"Only one has been barred."
"The Code must be reviewed and should not merely be a set of guidelines, loosely interpreted."
"(SK) The current Slovak Government has put forward a number of bills which undermine the constitutionally guaranteed independence of the courts and of judges."
"A constitutional amendment bill which aims to limit the immunity of judges is being put before Parliament without inviting prior comments and without having a specialist debate."
"Slovakia's drift towards a deformation of democracy and the legal state is also evidenced by the fact that the President of the Supreme Court and the President of the Judicial Council have twice been prevented from speaking in a plenary of the National Council during debates on laws concerning the judiciary, including a law on the Judicial Council."
"The amendment of the Act on the Judicial Council has the aim of changing the composition of the Council even before the end of its proper term of office."
"The amendment of the Act on judges will increase the number of political nominees in selection committees for selecting and advancing the careers of judges from one to three."
"This is only part of a story which clearly shows how the current executive and government power in Slovakia is attempting to interfere with the power of the courts."
"(HU) This day, 6 October, is an important date in Hungary's history."
"More than 150 years ago, Hungarian revolutionaries took up arms against Europe's two most powerful armies in the name of the fundamental values of liberty, equality and fraternity emerging throughout Europe at the time."
"The thirteen generals of the defeated freedom fight were executed on this day in the town of Arad, now located in Romania."
"However, the desire of the Hungarian people for freedom was manifested just as powerfully against communism, the twentieth century's oppressive regime, as the events of 1956 amply demonstrated."
"Only four of the thirteen martyrs executed in Arad in 1848 were Hungarian, standing as proof that universal values transcend national differences."
"For us Hungarians, this symbolises the eternal desire for freedom and the unity of the Hungarian nation, as well as reconciliation and solidarity among nations."
"(ES) Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity to condemn the degrading and anti-democratic treatment by Hugo Chávez's government of those who defend freedom and human rights."
"The detention of my colleague, Mr Iturgaiz, at Caracas airport cannot be overlooked."
"It is not the first time that the regime has launched an attack on members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)."
"Our mission as Members of this House is not limited to within the EU."
"It also involves promoting the values on which the Union is based such as freedom, democracy and respect for human rights."
"It is evident that this task is not well received by those that seek to impose totalitarian ideas on their citizens."
"The result of the parliamentary elections held on 27 September leaves room for hope, although we should all be concerned about the reaction to the progress made by the Venezuelan opposition."
"What can we expect from a government that harbours terrorists from the Oker terrorist cell, of an executive body that includes an alleged ETA murderer as the head of security of the Venezuelan National Land Institute, or of a government that ignores extradition requests for numerous terrorists who have fled justice?"
"Obviously, we can expect nothing."
"Madam President, such contemptible attitudes deserve a strong reaction and the firmest possible rejection by Parliament."
"(HU) A Germany divided in two was the most tangible symbol of the absurdity and inhumanity of a bipolar world."
"Without the reunification of Germany, the reunification of Europe and the enlargement of 2004 and 2007 would not have taken place either."
"No other people in Europe empathised more with Germany's artificial and absurd division than the people of Hungary."
"Europe's reunification started with the reunification of the German nation."
"The fall of the Berlin wall also brought down the wall separating a Europe divided by the Cold War."
"As a Hungarian, I am particularly proud that my country's leaders at the time took the brave and daring decision to allow the several tens of thousands of citizens of the German Democratic Republic who fled to Hungary to cross the iron curtain into Austria."
"They cancelled the treaty between Hungary and the GDR, thereby knocking the first brick out of the Berlin Wall."
"Gyula Horn, the then Foreign Minister of Hungary, and Prime Minister, Miklós Németh, performed an historic act, which could not have taken place without the reformist efforts of Mikhail Gorbachev."
"Madam President, I have just returned from Iceland after attending the first meeting of the EU-Iceland Joint Parliamentary Committee."
"Over the course of the two-day visit, our delegation held an extremely informative exchange of views with members of the Icelandic Government and of the Icelandic Parliament in relation to their application for membership."
"When the delegation met with the Icelandic Minister for Fisheries, I took the opportunity to raise the issue of the substantial increase in the total allowable catch of mackerel."
"We all have a responsibility to sustain this fishery, and indeed all fisheries, but I referred to this one in particular."
"I am please to note that on 12 October in London, Iceland will enter into negotiations with the coastal states, and I am hopeful that a satisfactory solution can be reached."
"The fall-out from the financial crisis is still very much evident in Iceland."
"That is why the Icesave dispute must remain a bilateral issue between Iceland, the UK and the Netherlands."
"It is vitally important that the parties involved continue negotiations with a view to reaching a satisfactory outcome."
"(EL) Madam President, I am especially pleased that Commissioner Barnier is here today, because I know that the matter which I intend to raise is of particular interest to him."
"Natural disasters have an incalculable cost in terms of human lives and economic infrastructures."
"Dealing with them is a joint challenge and requires joint action."
"The European Union therefore urgently needs to be able to respond efficiently in such emergencies."
"In order to do so, Europe needs to make better use of its potential and to galvanise European citizens into action."
"The long European tradition of voluntary work and the principle of solidarity provide a solid basis for achieving this."
"The time has come, therefore, to create a European volunteer corps, precisely as provided for in Article 214(5) of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I would remind you that 2011 will be the European Year of the Volunteer."
"A European volunteer corps would strengthen the role and image of Europe and win the hearts and minds of European citizens and citizens throughout the world."
"The European Parliament has a duty to take urgent action to create a European volunteer corps."
"(PL) Madam President, specific limits on CO2 emissions will be in force in the European Union from 2013."
"The recent plans of the European Union to bring in a limit at a lower ceiling than previously planned, namely, at a level of 0.688 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of manufactured product, may lead to a disastrous situation for cement producers in many European countries, including Poland."
"As has been reported by some media, for example, the daily newspaper Gazeta Prawna, it has been calculated that cement prices will rise by at least 30%, which will, on the one hand, hit the retail customer who wants to build a house or flat, but will also slow down economic development wherever cement is a fundamental resource for production."
"This situation is particularly dangerous for the new EU Member States because they have a long distance to catch up with the wealthy countries, such as France or Germany, for example, which built most of their infrastructure, such as motorways, a long time ago, when no limits were in force in this area."
"This situation also has a detrimental effect in that part of production will be moved across our eastern border and the CO2 will be produced anyway, and our economy will be the loser."
"(EL) Madam President, the anti-democratic resolution approved by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe yesterday, 5 October, equates the working-class and grassroots fight with extremism and, in the name of combating extremism, proposes restricting and abolishing basic democratic rights, such as the right of free expression, the right of assembly and association and even a ban on action by political parties."
"This despicable resolution reserves special comment for Greece and the major working-class and grassroots fight which developed recently against the barbaric, anti-grassroots policy of the European Union and of the government of our country and the governments of the other Member States of the European Union."
"The class struggle will not be stopped by reactionary resolutions and laws."
"It is an historic lever, the inevitable product of the system, born of barbarity and of the exploitation of man by man."
"The working-class struggle, the reconstruction of and counter-attack by the working-class and grassroots movement throughout Europe can consign these resolutions where they belong: to the dustbin of history."
"The Greek Communist Party calls on the working and grassroots classes to condemn this reactionary resolution in practical ways, by stepping up their fight against the anti-grassroots attack by capital in the European Union and the bourgeois governments, thereby supporting efforts to build a socio-political alliance of the working classes and self-employed which will claim changes for the benefit of the people."
"(LT) The EU-China summit is taking place today in Brussels."
"Alongside climate change and trade, topics for discussion include the situation of human rights defenders in China, the death penalty and the Laogai forced labour camps."
"These subjects are, without doubt, very important, but I would like to remind you of another acute Chinese problem - Tibet."
"It is regrettable that the dialogue between the Dalai Lama's representatives and representatives of the government of the People's Republic of China, which offered some hope, is moving at a very slow pace."
"The ninth round of dialogue took place last November."
"Meetings take place on an irregular basis and are dominated by an atmosphere of distrust. This is despite that fact that the Dalai Lama has long since given up the objective not just of Tibetan independence, but also Tibetan sovereignty."
"Once again, I would like to call on the leaders of China to resolve the issue of Tibet by means of dialogue, without the use of force and without ignoring the Dalai Lama."
"The European Union would undoubtedly welcome such a dialogue and is ready to contribute, to mediate and assist in any way possible."
"(RO) Unfortunately, a system of draconian censorship operates in Romania, the like of which does not exist in any of the European Union's Member States."
"I am referring to an absurd institution called the National Audiovisual Council."
"This is a Stalinist monstrosity which, flying in the face of all reason, would even ban such great writers as Cervantes, Goethe, Byron, Balzac, Cesar Pavese and Adam Mickiewicz, if they were still alive today."
"This rabble effectively terrorises independent television stations."
"I would compare this council to an elephants' graveyard from which a few 'zombies' emerge, under the remote political control of a declining dictatorship which imposes crippling financial penalties on those programmes that allow opposition parties to voice certain truths."
"Help us get rid of the despotic mandarins from the National Audiovisual Council and restore to Romania the biggest victory it won in the year of revolution in 1989: freedom of the press."
"Madam President, earlier this evening, we debated the social provisions and the Lisbon Treaty, which obliges the Union to consider the social consequences of a decision when making its policies."
"Is the EU - or should I say the Commission - considering the social, and indeed economic, consequences of insisting that Ireland comply with the Stability and Growth Pact by 2014?"
"Of course, fiscal consolidation is very important, but there is a real sense that it is all that matters."
"'Get within the 3% by 2014 or else': that is the very strong message coming from the EU."
"Earlier this evening, the Belgian Presidency said that mindless austerity is not inevitable, and yet that is what we are facing: mindless austerity, fiscal correction at whatever cost."
"How about the need to rebuild our economy?"
"Yes, we need to get back to the 3% level, but we need a longer time frame."
"I fully accept that many of the difficulties are self-inflicted and I am not looking for sympathy, but I am saying that mindless austerity will destroy our small, open economy that, two years into the crisis, still has four businesses closing every day."
"(PL) Madam President, the last few days have been full of reports about the lethal effects of using psychoactive substances, or what are known as 'designer drugs'."
"This problem, because of the growing wave of intoxications and even fatalities, particularly among young people, is also highly visible in Poland."
"The ingenuity of the producers and retailers of designer drugs is winning out against the legislation of the Member States."
"They put lethal drugs on the market much earlier than the Member States manage to ban their sale under national law, and among the people who buy them, the conviction arises that designer drugs, because they have not been banned, are not harmful either."
"Nothing could be further from the truth."
"Designer drugs are as harmful as illegal drugs and are even, in fact, more dangerous, because they more quickly lead to dependence."
"In view of the very serious social problem of designer drugs, which is growing with every passing day, we must take resolute and effective action as quickly as possible."
"The European Commission, out of concern for the health of thousands of young people, should urgently undertake a broad range of activities to inform people about the harmfulness of designer drugs and the dangers associated with their use, and should also prepare new legal measures."
"Madam President, as reported in the Financial Times of 6 October, the research Commissioner, Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn, has warned of an innovation emergency in Europe."
"We need to stimulate private sector research funding through a variety of measures, such as venture capital financing initiatives."
"However, the European Union proposals, intended to prevent a repeat of the financial economic crisis, lump venture capital - key to driving small innovative start-ups in the EU - together with speculators such as hedge funds."
"Venture capital is the honeybee of alternative funds owing to its ability to pollinate emerging businesses and drive growth in the global economy, as exemplified by Google, Facebook and Skype."
"Venture funds provide access to capital, business expertise and often the market place itself for innovative private start-ups and SMEs."
"They provide stable support and investment for a period of between three and seven years on average."
"We also need to bridge the gap between ourselves, the US and Japan."
"I think we should heed the words of the Research Commissioner, Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn."
"(IT) Madam President, I would like to report to Parliament that last Sunday, during the Pope's visit to Palermo, the Italian Constitution and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union were suspended."
"Freedom of expression and of thought and the inviolability of private homes were trampled over."
"On this occasion, the Italian police insisted on the removal of a banner bearing a phrase from the Gospel: 'My house shall be called a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of thieves', while the same police force put up posters that were homophobic and against common-law couples."
"Inside the bookshop Altro quando, the owner had put up a banner bearing the phrase 'I love Milingo'."
"The police entered the private premises and seized the banner without any court warrant and using methods that were unedifying even by their own standards."
"It is paradoxical that in a lay and democratic State, as Italy is supposed to be, public freedom of expression is suppressed by the authorities in order not to offend the papal sensibilities, while Prime Minister Berlusconi is able to swear in public without this representing a problem for the Church."
"On this occasion, all the lay and religious institutions yet again rode roughshod over democracy in Italy, increasing the unbridgeable gap that has now emerged between institutions and the public."
"(RO) In spite of the recovery measures adopted by governments in European countries, the recent demonstrations and strikes highlight that the situation is still far from improving."
"Unfortunately, it is precisely these recovery measures that governments are aiming to use to plug the budgetary gaps and pay off the expensive loans taken out with banks, which are causing a new crisis, reflected in the immediate drop in incomes and the decline in European citizens' quality of life."
"The time may have come for governments in the European Union's Member States to change their attitude by putting the interests of citizens with increasingly empty pockets above those of the banks, which are still managing, by some miracle, to earn large profits."
"Basically, if anyone needs to lose in this game, it should not always be the man in the street."
"(ES) Madam President, I am also going to talk about Venezuela, because there are some people who do not understand that democracy is not just about casting votes."
"Democracy is being able to do so with security, freedom and equality, and in a democracy and under a system of freedoms, private property must also be respected."
"Unfortunately, at present in Venezuela, the public and their businesses are under threat."
"In this respect, I would like to mention one business, Agroisleña, which was founded by people from the Canary Islands and on which more than 1 000 families depend."
"It has been unfairly expropriated, and like so many other businesses, after many years of hard work, it is failing, following capricious decisions by those who think that anything goes."
"First, land was confiscated, now businesses are being confiscated, so who knows what will be next?"
"It is time for the people of Venezuela to feel free and for businesspeople to no longer feel defenceless and permanently under threat."
"As has already been said, it is time for Venezuela to be a genuine democracy where there is no doubt that terrorists will not find refuge."
"(DE) Madam President, I would like to draw attention to the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF)'s action week, which will be manifesting itself in Istanbul this weekend."
"The reason for the international day of solidarity is the aggressive behaviour of a global package delivery company against its own employees, who want to form a trade union."
"Unfortunately, Turkish labour law is not yet up to European standards, and this fact is often exploited to the full by employers."
"Under Turkey's Labour Act, a trade union can only be active in a company once it has achieved a rate of unionisation of over 50%."
"Let me say that again: over 50%."
"UPS, the US-based package delivery company, has acted in a crude manner to put a stop to the campaign to unionise."
"The company fired 157 employees without notice after they had organised themselves into the competent transport workers' union TÜMTIS and were working towards recognition as a union by UPS."
"Thousands of UPS employees have now been battling since May to have their colleagues re-instated and for better working conditions."
"This pro-company labour law and its brutal methods mean that Turkey is a trade union-free zone."
"(ES) Madam President, on 18 October, a trial will begin in the Turkish city of Diyarbakir of 28 leaders of the Democratic Turkey Party (DTP)."
"They include 14 representatives elected by the public: 12 mayors and two municipal councillors."
"Their crime is peacefully defending their political positions, which could cost them between 15 years and life in prison."
"The banning of the DTP and the arrests that I have mentioned are one more example of the persecution being suffered by the Kurdish minority in Turkey."
"These events were expressly condemned in the resolution that we adopted on 10 February analysing the progress made by Turkey in 2009 in moving closer to the Union, but we do not think that sufficient progress has been made."
"If we are consistent and we wish to help the victims and help Turkey to move forward in the right way, we can do so."
"During this period, let us support the movement of solidarity with the Kurdish cause."
"I would therefore like to urge the Commission and Parliament to send an official representative to the trial in Diyarbakir."
"(RO) The worst thing that can happen during an economic crisis is for a political crisis to come on top of it."
"This is what is happening in Romania, experiencing the sharpest economic decline in Europe which is emerging from the crisis."
"Austerity measures of unprecedented severity are being implemented by a government which is indifferent to the hardships endured by millions of Romanians, virtually doomed to suffer from cold and hunger and being unable to buy medicines."
"The social protests which we have been seeing recently reflect the mood of citizens in despair at the prospect of being forced to face the harsh winter conditions with dramatically reduced incomes."
"At the same time, shocking violations are taking place of the right to free expression, as has already been mentioned this evening during the plenary debate in this House."
"The fraudulent enforcement of a pensions law targeted at the poorest section of the population forces me to ask Europe's institutions to focus the attention required on the absolute crisis which Romania is engulfed in and to rebuff the anti-democratic abuses in this country."
"(PT) I would like to highlight here an event that took place in Portugal yesterday and which is of the greatest importance for the country, for Europe and for the future of humanity."
"The Champalimaud Foundation inaugurated a centre for research into cancer and the neurosciences."
"Mr Champalimaud was an entrepreneur who left one third of his personal fortune - EUR 500 million - to scientific research in these areas."
"I salute the President of the Champalimaud Foundation, Dr Leonor Beleza, who has established stringent criteria for marrying excellence in scientific research with clinical practice."
"I am sure that the goal of putting Portugal and Europe at the forefront of excellence in this area of scientific research will be fully achieved."
"The Champalimaud Foundation will attract world-renowned scientists to Portugal and Europe."
"From the Tagus estuary, it will start a new chapter in Portuguese and European scientific research, letting the world know about new worlds."
"(SK) At the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe tomorrow, there will be a vote on the report by the British socialist, Christine McCafferty, entitled 'Women's Access to Lawful Medical Care: the Problem of Unregulated Conscientious Objection'."
"We must completely condemn this report, which amounts to an unprecedented and serious interference in, and threat to, the sovereignty of Member States, the principle of subsidiarity and the fundamental right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion."
"The report focuses particularly on the area of so-called reproductive healthcare for women, and abortions, sterilisation and also, if I may quote, 'pain-relief by life-shortening means for terminally ill patients', which means active euthanasia."
"This Council of Europe document even demands that Member States oblige healthcare providers to provide a requested treatment to which a patient is legally entitled regardless of their conscientious objections."
"Moreover, it calls for the creation of some kind of register of people who exercise an objection, and then proposes that they be somehow persecuted."
"It is unacceptable to give in to this trend for regulating conscientious objection in Europe."
"(ES) Madam President, it is irresponsible to question the firmness of Spanish foreign policy in terms of the fight against terrorism, and it is wrong to accuse the Venezuelan Government of colluding with the training of ETA terrorists on its territory, because there is no evidence of such collusion."
"There is international dialogue and cooperation in Spain's brave fight against terrorism within its borders and outside them, and there is dialogue and cooperation with Venezuela, which has been asked to take specific action in this case."
"Instead of demanding the breaking of ties and confrontations, let us leave the police, judicial and diplomatic authorities do their work, which has resulted in unprecedented success and results in the fight against terrorism in Spain."
"This item is now closed."
"Health care systems in Sub-Saharan Africa and Global Health (short presentation)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs De Keyser, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on health care systems in sub-Saharan Africa and global health."
"Madam President, Commissioner, thank you for having stayed this far."
"This report actually responds to a communication from the Commission on global health, but we wanted to adopt an angle that was rather exceptional and concentrate a good deal more on the mutual schemes that are currently thriving in Africa."
"Allow me to digress a little."
"The state of health in Africa is actually quite dreadful, despite all the international aid, and this is due to a large number of factors, whether they be climate change, the financial crisis, war, bad governance in certain countries, or the greed that is provoked by the very riches found in Africa."
"Add to this the major pandemics such as Aids, malaria, tuberculosis, and so on, and this set of factors means that we find ourselves facing a genuine disaster."
"So I must first of all pay tribute to the work of the NGOs and of certain churches too, which are doing a truly remarkable job in emergency conditions, in conflict zones, but this cannot represent a long-term response, it is not a sustainable response."
"There are what are called vertical funds, which have been mentioned and which are used to fight major diseases, such as Aids, malaria and tuberculosis, for example."
"They attract a lot of money and are quite attractive to private aid efforts, since people feel they are giving to a cause that is being kept well under control."
"In reality, however, these funds too, while certainly achieving their objective, cover only a small part of the problem, because, unfortunately, more deaths are still caused in Africa today by the lack of sanitary infrastructure, the lack of drinking water - children die of dysentery - or the lack of a local dispensary, than, alas, by Aids or malaria."
"Hence, the attention that has been drawn to a movement that has been emerging since the 1990s, represented by initiatives consisting of insurance schemes but, above all, of mutual schemes, which have sprung up just about everywhere in different African countries."
"The objective of these mutual schemes is, of course, to involve people in the management of their own health."
"Let us not close our eyes: they will not be self-sufficient, they will not succeed in providing all the financing for care or for access to medicines, but in combination with other funds, with other subsidies, they do nonetheless ensure the provision of health care and medication, and on top of that participation, a kind of social dynamic that has taken root."
"There are hundreds of them; they exist in various countries and in various sectors."
"There are women's mutuals, café owner's mutuals and so on."
"The challenge for us, then, is to support this social dynamic, to finance it, and to coordinate it, while at the same time telling ourselves that perhaps one day, it will become self-sufficient, but not yet today."
"Therefore, although these mutuals can exist, they can do so only if, of course, there exist alongside them what are called horizontal systems."
"That is to say, why insure yourself or pay for any episode of ill health, for surgical intervention, if there is no hospital, if there is no doctor, if there is no medication?"
"Therefore, as a corollary, we believe that the European Union should not only support, coordinate and sustain these mutuals, but also lay great stress on horizontal systems, on basic health care, even if it means calling on vertical funds partially to finance this 'horizontal' care, this element of basic care that is necessary, that provides the balance that enables the mutuals to exist."
"It is that set of problems to which the report refers."
"I have run out of time but I shall perhaps reply to Members who have some concerns about reproductive health, which is mentioned in this report and is an issue I set great store by."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs De Keyser has already said nearly all there is to say."
"I would like to dedicate this minute to a baby boy who I met on 1 December 2009 in Luanda, when we were in Angola for the ACP-EU Parliamentary Assembly."
"The baby boy was at the end of his life, he was dying due to malnutrition in his mother's arms in the Divine Providence Hospital in the centre of Luanda, near the place where we were doing our work and near the stadium that was being built for the African Cup; in other words, he was surrounded by plenty."
"Yet this was not an isolated case: every day in Luanda, children are still dying of hunger, due to malnutrition, in the arms of their young mothers who have not been taught anything about nutrition and who are often left to their own devices."
"For a Christian, sights like this constitute a sin - a great sin; for a politician, they are a sign of the failure of our policies; and for the ruling class of that country, Angola, they are also a sign of greed and the unfair distribution of wealth."
"I believe the reasons why that child had such a fleeting existence on the earth give us much food for thought and I hope my testimony will contribute to this reflection."
"(SK) Despite certain reservations which I have against this report, I would first like to congratulate Mrs De Keyser."
"She has demonstrated, as so many times before, her grasp of development policy and how she cares about living conditions in various parts of the world."
"The level of health care in sub-Saharan Africa is deplorable."
"However, I am concerned that Mrs De Keyser has failed to accept at least some of my amendment proposals."
"It cannot be right for us to talk positively about the final documents from Cairo and Beijing, and yet when I refer to them, they are not accepted."
"This is only because, according to some Members, certain paragraphs perhaps do not align with the European policy on reproductive health."
"It is regrettable that we are unwilling to respect the importance of national and regional particularities and the historical, cultural and religious diversity of states in sub-Saharan Africa."
"The health of the local inhabitants can only suffer as a result."
"(SK) The general declaration of human rights recognises health as one of the fundamental human rights."
"I personally believe that this right must be viewed in close connection with the actual right to life."
"In Sub-Saharan Africa, these rights have a very specific and precarious context, and I would therefore like to emphasise the need for the European Union to take a responsible and humane approach in the area of health care."
"Firstly, I would like to mention that the European Union should not promote the termination of pregnancy as a right, since this so-called right is not recognised in any international documents as a so-called fundamental human right."
"On the contrary, the Union, as a defender of human rights worldwide, should act progressively in support of programmes to protect mothers with children in its development policies, and promote outcomes that are also compatible with the right to life and protection of the unborn child."
"Secondly, I would like to emphasise again that the EU and the Member States should not incorporate into trade agreements provisions on intellectual property rights which prevent poverty-stricken people in developing countries from having access to basic medicines and which contribute to the high mortality rates in these regions."
"Madam President, my colleague, Mr Piebalgs, could not be here in person, and it is on his behalf that I shall make a number of comments and remarks."
"To speak quite truthfully, once again, the Commission is always at the disposal of Parliament, and I am very pleased to have heard Mrs De Keyser and the other speakers on a subject that has been a personal interest of mine for a long time."
"Besides, Mrs De Keyser, in my office as Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, it is not by chance that, in addition to the visits that I now make every week to each of the capitals of the Union and after the first visit that I had to make to the United States, since almost all of our transactions are transatlantic ones, I was anxious to make my second visit outside the Union to Addis Ababa, at the end of July, to meet the leaders of the African Union."
"This is because our fates are bound up one with the other, and for many years now, I have been arguing for a new policy of partnership between our two great continents."
"With respect to many subjects linked to the crisis, which in any case concern or relate to our own preoccupations - for example, cooperation between our markets, the fight against money laundering, financial regulation, the fight I want to wage remorselessly against excessive speculation in agricultural commodities, notably in Africa where many countries depend on imports for their food - I and my colleagues decided, following that visit, to take up and intensify our cooperation."
"While I congratulate you on behalf of Mr Piebalgs and for my own part on the quality of your report, in which you describe the health care situation in developing countries, I should add that we are not talking about Africa alone."
"A few weeks ago, I was in Haiti to follow up the visits made by my colleagues Baroness Ashton, Mrs Georgieva and Mr Piebalgs, and it was clear that, even outside Africa, there are challenges to be overcome in disease prevention and public health in the poorest countries."
"As Mr Rinaldi said, there is the fact that nearly 30 million people die prematurely every year in developing countries from causes that could be treated with the amount of money devoted in the European Union or the United States to pet food alone, or, if we are looking for another comparison, with about 2% of global military spending."
"I find that situation quite simply unacceptable."
"Viable social policies, including for health, should be at the heart of a state's basic functions, within a framework of sustainable and inclusive growth."
"Health is not only a universal right, but also a part of economic development."
"Health systems based on per capita expenditure of less than EUR 30 per year, which is 50 times less than the EU average, will never be sufficient to keep health professionals in post, ensure the availability of essential medicines or offer people equal access to care."
"On this point, I should like to tell you, on behalf of Mr Piebalgs, that we shall continue to insist that the European Union honour its commitments in terms of the level and quality of public development aid to those third countries that most need it."
"As far as the Commission is concerned, support for health systems remains a priority commitment of our foreign policy and a strong component of our political dialogue with third countries."
"Echoing Mrs Záborská's concern, third countries are not, in fact, all in the same boat."
"There is a great difference, as you said, between the developing countries and the less-developed countries in Africa, for example."
"Moreover, we are trying to promote this concept through the Commission's active participation in global initiatives such as the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria, as well as by interacting with other public and private players active in this field."
"Mrs De Keyser, you have rightly paid tribute to the work of the NGOs, which I consider to be exemplary."
"Again, a few days ago in Haiti, I saw that they play a remarkable as well as a decisive role in the administrative or public aspects of the various actions undertaken by the Union, fund sponsors or the World Bank."
"Adequate social and health policies are essential in order to achieve concrete results in Europe as much as in developing countries."
"Merely ensuring that a substantial amount of resources are dedicated to supporting our European partners cannot be enough."
"We must also make sure that our internal policies are consistent, for instance, the policy on migration of health professionals or on the trade in medicines, in such a way that the global impact of internal policies can also be of benefit, or at least cause no harm, to those most in need of them in the world."
"In my own sphere of competence, I should like to make two points that may be of interest to you, Mrs De Keyser."
"Firstly, in the draft Single Market Act, which we are getting ready for 27 October, I intend to give priority to the major sector of social business and to work towards a statute for the European Foundation."
"In amongst all that, there is encouragement that we should be giving, here at home in Europe, to structures, to NGOs, to social enterprises, which could be supported in their work to help the poorest countries or developing countries, notably in this sphere of health."
"Next, there is a second area that concerns me just now, in fact, and that is counterfeiting."
"In the plan that I shall be presenting to you in the autumn, on fighting piracy and counterfeiting, I have provided for several sections that we shall be financing and supporting; on technology for detecting counterfeit goods, on communicating with the European public, and on training personnel in customs or at the external frontiers of the Union."
"However, I should also like to have a section - and I have asked my colleagues for this - on cooperation with the countries where these counterfeit goods originate and where they could cause considerable harm to health, particularly if they are counterfeit medicines."
"We shall be returning to this subject in due course."
"On the basis of the analysis that I have quickly outlined for you, the Union has adopted the conclusions on the Union's role in global health."
"They are our reference point when intervening in matters of health."
"As I said, the resources for official development aid are not sufficient, and there is one point on which the analysis in your report proves just how pertinent it is."
"In Europe, we have numerous ways of financing health services, and each one has its strengths and weaknesses."
"There is no single, perfect solution to fit all local circumstances."
"It is clear that a purely voluntary insurance scheme, based on private finance mechanisms, would not be sufficient to provide equal and universal access to health care, either."
"Hence, the essential role that public authorities must play in regulating and financing health services in order to establish or ensure principles of fairness and inclusion."
"We are very much relying on Parliament's contribution to this effort in order to strengthen and enhance the solidarity of the people of the European Union and of the other Union players in this area, notably the NGOs."
"I believe that our Union has much to learn, but also much to share with the rest of the world, and that we can provide added value in this area."
"We must clearly translate all this into the approach that we take to health policy in developing countries, and I, for my part, am pleased to be able to reply to you and to take advantage of this opportunity to express my personal commitment to these issues."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The inability of African countries - which are often weak countries that have recently emerged from conflict situations, or that lack sufficiently robust institutions or adequate resources - to apply effective public health policies and, in particular, to guarantee access to adequate health care services, constitutes a major challenge and a global responsibility."
"It is essential for there to be a worldwide EU vision on health with guiding principles that must be applied to all relevant strategic sectors."
"Investment in education and capacity building will produce positive effects on health worldwide, and I call on the European Union to actively support the training of qualified health care professionals."
"It is essential for EU Member States to ensure that their migration policies do not prevent health care professionals from being available in third countries."
"I call for the commitments made under the EU strategy for action on the crisis in human resources for health in developing countries to be made good."
"The EU must facilitate circular migration as a means of reducing the brain drain from countries that are in difficulties."
"The state of health of the population in sub-Saharan Africa poses one of the toughest challenges for the EU's humanitarian and development policy."
"I believe that the tragedy of the situation is best encapsulated by the fact that the inhabitants of this region have a life expectancy which is approximately half that of a European citizen."
"The report spells out very clearly the causes of this and emphasises the remedies required, as well as our share in the responsibility for this."
"The international funds allocated to health care are half the amount allocated to education."
"Without devaluing education in the least, I believe that this disproportion reflects an oversight which must be corrected in future."
"Furthermore, the developed countries' encouragement of the exodus of doctors and nurses from African states allows the current disaster to continue."
"I think that greater discernment, especially from EU countries, when it comes to recruiting specialists in similar key areas, would promote significant progress in improving Africa's health care system."
"Unfortunately, the universal right to health care is still very far from being a reality."
"Millions of people are still without access to basic health care, life expectancy in many countries is still scandalously low, and millions of children still die from diseases that can be prevented and cured."
"This situation is all the more serious because whether it continues or is brought to an end depends on political decisions."
"The predominant force in these decisions has been the interests of large economic and financial groups."
"The pharmaceutical multinationals continue to prevent the cheaper production of medicines that would enable the lives of millions of people to be saved."
"International financial institutions continue to impose so-called 'structural adjustments' by maintaining the odious foreign debt of countries in the developing world, and imposing cuts and privatisations on the health sector when shortages are already enormous."
"A real contribution to improving the health care systems of these countries would require, firstly, the immediate rejection of the so-called 'economic partnership agreements', the implementation of which, in the manner that the EU is seeking to impose, will worsen dependence relationships and have an even greater impact on these countries' priorities; and also an end to their foreign debt and a proper development aid and cooperation policy."

"EU cohesion and regional policy after 2013 - Future of the European Social Fund (debate)"
"We apologise for the slight delay caused by the traffic."
"I would recommend that everyone walk to Parliament for three reasons."
"The first reason is to arrive on time."
"The second is because it is healthy."
"The third is that it causes less pollution."
"So, let us all walk to Parliament!"
"The next item is the joint debate on the oral question to the Commission, by Danuta Maria Hübner, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on EU cohesion and regional policy after 2013 - B7-0466/2010);"
"and the Commission statement on the future of the European Social Fund."
"author. - Mr President, in the years to come, growth in Europe will be supply-driven."
"Sustainable and competitive investment patterns will be crucial."
"Cohesion policy is a major source of European public investment and must work as a catalyst for structural change by investing in research and innovation, resource efficiency, new and sustainable jobs and infrastructure."
"It must not merely be a financial tool for investment."
"It is a policy that generates new resources, adding to growth potential."
"It will require an adequate macro-economic and financial framework to achieve its full impact."
"The key issue for post-2013 reform of cohesion policy is how to make it more effective in generating growth, jobs and competitiveness for the European economy in a sustainable way."
"Social, economic and territorial cohesion is, according to the treaty, a basic principle of European integration."
"It must therefore be a policy applicable to all Europe's citizens, and not one restricted to the poorest regions."
"This is because it is not a subsidy policy based on the principle of compensation for the past, working as a supplement to national objectives, but rather a European policy for the future."
"It must take into account the post-crisis territorial reality at regional level, looking for the most effective solutions to the challenges and opportunities of different European territories."
"It must be made an integral part of the implementation of the EU 2020 strategy and its flagship initiatives."
"We are intensely aware of the necessity to ensure that cohesion policy and its cumulative effect over the whole territory of the Union is one of the key instruments which will enable the Union and its Member States to achieve the ambitions of EU 2020."
"Cohesion policy must contribute not only to reducing productivity gaps generated by the crisis, but also to putting productivity gains on track."
"It must invest in better links between leading regions and those that are catching up."
"It must better exploit territorial cooperation potential."
"The Regional Development Committee of the European Parliament has reached a position as to how it sees cohesion policy post-2013."
"Over the years, many parliamentary resolutions have stressed the necessity of maintaining a strong, comprehensive cohesion policy, well equipped with sufficient budgetary means to permit regions and cities to expand their development potential."
"In these exceptional times, we are convinced that they must all be encouraged and assisted to invest in ground-breaking ideas, in new technologies and in innovation."
"Regions and cities carry the key to re-energising Europe in order to overcome its extraordinary difficulties and to successfully achieving the transformation of our economy."
"We hope and believe that the European Commission shares our resolve to ensure that cohesion policy remains the Union's major all-inclusive tool."
"It is therefore to afford the Commission the possibility of explaining its view of the future that we have tabled this question."
"Mr President, Commissioner Andor, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking Parliament for giving this topic such a prominent place on the agenda at a time when Brussels is having the last of its 'open days', with over 6 000 stakeholders in the city and more than 130 events and seminars intensively working on the issue of the relevance and the future shape of regional policy."
"As has been said more than once, regional policy and cohesion policy need to be very intensively linked to the Europe 2020 strategy in future, including in the next funding period, so that we really do achieve the European added value that we talk about again and again and that now needs to be realised."
"It is important, in this context, that we coordinate Union policies better in order to truly deliver a common offering, an integrated approach, including towards the Member States."
"The keywords must be focus and flexibility."
"We must focus on a few priorities from the Europe 2020 strategy that are important to us and we need flexibility in the tailor-made solutions in the implementation in the regions and in the Member States."
"I think it is also important that we develop a system of incentives that operate on the basis of clear agreements on objectives with the regions and the Member States so that, alongside proper financial management, which has been very important, and will continue to be so in future, the elements involved in focusing on results, too, are actually brought more strongly to bear."
"This is because it is absolutely crucial that, right at the beginning of a period, we also agree with the regions and the Member States what our objectives are and that we also agree on and lay down measurable targets and then strive to implement these accordingly through the projects."
"Ultimately, one thing that can and should bring about good cohesion policy, with its varied elements, is being the engine of growth in the European Union."
"We have a Stability and Growth Pact."
"It is a cleverly put-together cohesion policy for all the regions, which ultimately bear the responsibility for ensuring that the growth element of the Stability and Growth Pact takes effect, so that Europe, and its national economies as a whole, remain competitive globally and are able to further improve their position in the international context."
"It will therefore also be necessary to adapt and develop the framework of support accordingly."
"What is required, in other words, is an increase both on the product side and also of the volume of finance involved that enters the realm of financial engineering, in the knowledge - and against the backdrop of the overstretched budgets of the Member States - that, in this regard, we need to do more to develop products for private individuals in order to co-invest in certain regional projects, in particular, those that also guarantee a source of revenue, so that we leave other funding available for projects that are just as necessary but that cannot guarantee any revenue in that sense, such as investments in the education and training sector, in modernising universities and laboratories and so on."
"Over the next few weeks, we will be presenting, together, the 5th cohesion report and its conclusions."
"The report will put forward much of what I have been able to say in these few minutes, and much else besides."
"Regional policy, cohesion policy, however, is a kind of policy that is capable, including under the auspices of shared management, of making European policy something that European citizens can see and grasp."
"Two million projects, as in the current period, can only be realised if we work together with the Member States and with the citizens in the regions."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the economic and social situation in Europe continues to pose enormous challenges."
"Unemployment has risen sharply, with the rate expected to reach 11% at the end of this year."
"Furthermore, poverty continues to be a daily reality for many Europeans including children."
"Whilst it is true that we are slowly emerging from the economic crisis, it is equally clear that our recovery needs to be based on solid foundations, and at this time, we cannot be entirely sure about these foundations."
"At the same time, we must not lose sight of the long-term challenges."
"Issues such as the ageing population, rapidly changing technologies, climate change and other environmental challenges all need to be addressed with urgency."
"The European Social Fund has been the main instrument at EU level for investment in human capital and social inclusion."
"For over half a century, it has been a concrete proof of solidarity between European citizens and it should continue to be so in the future."
"The ESF is one of the key tools at our disposal in reaching the Europe 2020 headline targets, particularly those on employment, education and poverty reduction."
"We need full alignment between the ESF and Europe 2020 as it will be a major instrument for implementing the integrated guidelines."
"Our new Europe 2020 strategy sets out common objectives for the entire Union."
"However, Member States will choose their own individual paths to follow in order to reach these objectives with the support of the ESF."
"For this to happen, the future scope of the ESF should be broad enough to ensure that all Member States, regions and local stakeholders can design operational programmes that address their particular needs."
"Nevertheless, a broad scope should not lead to a fragmentation of the instruments."
"The Commission and Member States should work together to establish core priorities, particularly on employment."
"We should work towards improving the visibility, effectiveness and delivery of the Social Fund."
"The forthcoming budget review will show how the Commission envisages the future architecture of the Union's budget in order to achieve the political objectives agreed in Europe 2020."
"In addition, it will launch the debate between Member States and the European Parliament."
"I look forward to the contribution of this House to that debate."
"The ESF should contribute to territorial as well as social and economic cohesion alongside other EU funds."
"This should be facilitated by establishing some common rules for all funds to make coordination between them easier."
"The Commission has already made a proposal for a new financial regulation laying down some common rules and we will put forward some specific proposals in the course of 2011."
"European citizens expect to see EU-level funds focused on results and achievements."
"We need to put in place systems to monitor the performance of the actions supported by the ESF and we need to think about moving to more results based delivery systems."
"Access to the funds should be simpler and also more user-friendly."
"The discussions on the future of the ESF are at a decisive stage now."
"The messages we have received from you are very clear and will make an important contribution to the work that lies ahead."
"The Commission will present its proposal for the new ESF together with the other structural funds by mid-2011."
"We have a clear mandate to support the Europe 2020 strategy, namely by using the ESF as its financial lever to help translate our policy objectives into reality on the ground."
"Mr President, Commissioner Hahn and Commissioner Andor, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to see you seated here together."
"That demonstrates your desire to work together towards the overall objective of social, economic and territorial cohesion."
"I have also read the letter you addressed to Mr Barroso concerning cohesion as part of a single integrated structure and I trust that you will stand by that position."
"That would enable you to be more effective than if you were to go with an opt-out and allow the various funds to operate separately."
"Thank you very much for that."
"These new, difficult, times call for a new policy."
"We can see evidence of that now in the Commission in connection with the Europe 2020 strategy."
"In that context, cohesion is at the very heart of the implementation process."
"The European added value, which is what we so ardently want the debate on our future to yield, is nothing more or less than a part of the implementation and is important for the 2014-2020 period."
"What does this come down to?"
"Do not give carte blanche when it comes to the European State aid map."
"Objective 2 must be retained, because it is very clear. Abandoning this objective would lead to a renationalisation of this segment of European cooperation and we do not want that."
"The Regional Development Fund and the Social Fund should continue to operate together."
"My second point is that the horizontal, integrated character of the funds is vital for the entire spectrum of Europe 2020."
"Sure enough, the 'earmarking' that Mrs Hübner introduced for the Lisbon Strategy did work at the time."
"The Lisbon Strategy has been successful, especially in regional and urban environments, in bringing Europe closer together."
"European cooperation within and between Member States brings balanced territorial development in Europe a step closer and creates opportunities for all regions."
"Finally, allow me to add that we must improve things."
"We must have greater synergy between the Rural Development Fund, the Social Fund, the Regional Fund and the Research and Development Funds."
"That is attainable and would lead to better results."
"I would like to put one final question to both Commissioners: do you want to introduce the Territorial Pact in the run-up to the Spring summit, as an opportunity for increasing the involvement of regions and towns?"
"The Committee of the Regions has made a proposal to that effect and I would recommend that you consider it, at the same time as you consider the wording of our resolution."
"Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, in the European Union, cohesion policy means that we aim to lend our support to the weaker regions."
"It is an expression of major European solidarity."
"Solidarity, however, is never a one-way street, and my group therefore backs the principle that all the regions of the European Union must be able to participate in our cohesion policy."
"For us, this also means that we will not support any measures of renationalisation and that we do not want to see cohesion policy fragmented into sector-based policy approaches."
"We do not need any extra transport or climate protection or energy efficiency funds, but we do need to work on how we reconcile the challenges we face with a sound cohesion policy."
"It is therefore clear to us that, alongside a strong Objective 1 area, we also need a strong Objective 2 area, and appropriate transitional rules."
"One thing is for certain, and that is that regions need our support at the European level."
"The European Union needs strong regions, too, and there is therefore a give and take in both directions."
"Of course, we need to review our priorities - clearly, we do need greater efficiency."
"My group is therefore four-square behind the proposal, in order, for example, to be able to coordinate rural development much better together under the umbrella of cohesion policy than in the past."
"Of course, we also back improving infrastructure, supporting businesses and supporting sustainable economic development."
"However, sustainable economic development is only possible if we bring the employed - the people - with us."
"In other words, we need employment policy approaches, we need education, we need training, we need people to integrate into the labour market."
"That, in turn, is only possible in collaboration with the European Social Fund, under the umbrella of cohesion policy."
"We support this, but with dedicated rules, which there did used to be in the past."
"We need to really make an effort to improve this and significantly strengthen the social side of cohesion policy."
"In the forthcoming discussions and negotiations, my group will be going in to bat for improving and simplifying the usability of the fund."
"We need a simplification of the application processes so that, first of all, fewer errors are made, and, secondly, so that access for those people who really want to work can be made easier through this European cohesion policy."
"We will strive to ensure that, in these negotiations, a stronger partnership principle really is implemented."
"I believe that Parliament's role has been strengthened now that the Treaty of Lisbon is in force."
"My group will be arguing the case for this partnership principle."
"Mr President, I think it is right and proper for us to be championing the cause of a coordinated cohesion and regional policy."
"This is extremely important in order to deliver efficiency and to be able to use the money well, despite the limited amounts in question."
"I must warn, however, that the plan is to achieve this efficiency by applying one and the same set of rules to everyone."
"The funds are very varied, have very different target groups and different contents."
"With that in mind, coordination is very important but the same rules are not."
"That is exactly what we are experiencing with the European Social Fund at the moment, which is to say that it would be extremely well received by just those little communities, municipalities, if - just as the speaker before me said - for these small bodies on the ground, in particular, such an enormous amount of time and effort did not have to be spent in order to actually be able to access and use this money."
"That is exactly what we need though, as unemployment, poverty and socially excluded people are to be found in every Member State of the European Union, not just in certain regions, but in every Member State."
"With that in mind, I find it particularly important that the European Social Fund, in particular, should truly continue to be available to minorities, which, to an extent, also includes young people, but also the elderly and often people from an immigrant background, in future and actually, that it should be more available, in order to give these people the chance to enter the labour market, as that is precisely what we are aiming to achieve."
"The Europe 2020 strategy represents our attempt to achieve greater inclusion in the labour market for the different groups."
"I hope that that will not remain simply a goal; instead, we now have to genuinely provide the measures and the instruments to achieve it."
"The European Social Fund is a very effective tool in this regard."
"We just need to optimise it and, above all, make it useable."
"Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased about this debate as it represents a first attempt for us to reach compromises on a very major project that will occupy us for the next few years."
"The most important thing in these compromise resolutions of the European Parliament is the discrete nature of the cohesion policy and a clear commitment to that."
"It will play its part in the Europe 2020 strategy, but it also has its own value, as it is cohesion policy that holds the EU together, at its core."
"No region in the European Union is shoved to one side."
"Social cohesion also means that no one, from the poorest of the poor, is pushed aside in the European Union, and instead, everyone is given a chance."
"However, prosperity does not just mean economic growth, as we have seen in the past how there can be a growth of GDP in many regions, but an intensification of social differences at the same time."
"I therefore consider it very important that, in this resolution, the impetus is given for us to develop other important criteria alongside the GDP that make it clear what prosperity means and what needs to be done in a region."
"We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance are very proud of our achievement in having this fixed in the resolution, even if only cautiously."
"We propose that the criterion is one which includes examining whether it is possible to support a region or not."
"That would result in a very different picture."
"Thus, the resolution comes out very clearly in favour of a 'GDP beyond' and we hope that the Commission takes up this stimulus."
"That also means that we will finally get away from one-sided development."
"A further Commission study - namely, the Commission's Regions 2020 study - shows that climate change has an alarming and detrimental impact on regional development."
"We therefore need to stop it."
"The study shows that a third of the population of the European Union would have to abandon their homes if we failed to stop climate change, as they would either be unable to find work or to live in their homes any longer."
"This makes it clear that there are three sides to regional development."
"All three of these sides must be given equal weight in the future reform of the structural funds and also taken into consideration in the support given."
"One key interest is economic, social and territorial cohesion."
"That means that ecological issues and criteria, too, represent a key element in the prosperity of regions."
"Allow me to briefly enunciate one more thought about what has been negotiated here between Members, namely, the wording about how the ESF is to be dealt with in the joint package."
"I believe that the oral amendment is well worded and allows us a great deal of free scope and I therefore ask you to support it."
"Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, in the discussion on future cohesion policy, we are all, first and foremost, defending our own interests."
"For this reason, it will be very difficult to find a meaningful and rational consensus that will win the support of as many Members as possible."
"In my view, the first key question is what financial resources we should allocate to the cohesion policy."
"Personally, I am convinced that existing resources are more or less sufficient."
"The cohesion policy should, however, become one of the main spending priorities of the European budget."
"As the European budget is constrained, and Member States have seriously ailing public finances and cannot allow more money to be sent to Brussels, it is also necessary to state clearly where cuts might be made."
"In my view, this includes, for example, direct payments to farmers, money for the globalisation fund or the administrative costs of European institutions."
"The second key question is what we should finance from the European funds."
"In the draft resolution on the European Social Fund, much is being said about the fight against poverty, support for the social model, etc. That is all very well, but in the first place, our economy must prosper, people must have work, and companies must produce and provide services."
"Therefore, European funds should be geared towards investment, and not consumption."
"The funds should make possible modernisation which, in line with the principle of subsidiarity, cannot be taken on by the state, the regions, communities or families."
"Reducing the economic disparities between regions and Member States must continue to be the main goal of the cohesion policy."
"Therefore, the only rational criterion is the level of GDP."
"On behalf of my group, I can say that we are interested in a cohesion policy that will be comprehensible, simple, flexible, unencumbered by excessive bureaucracy, and focused on investment and smart growth."
"Mr President, I would like to draw attention to a fundamental conflict which is already becoming apparent in relation to the European Social Fund (ESF)."
"The Treaty of Lisbon recommends that the ESF should focus primarily on active labour market policy."
"We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left believe that it is necessary for the ESF to be applied more broadly in future to general social policy and, most importantly, to be used much more effectively to combat poverty and social exclusion."
"In future, the European Social Fund should also play an effective role throughout the entire European Union and should not concentrate solely on specific regions."
"However, we think that there should be a greater focus on special problems in the regions, which could be accommodated more effectively via the cofinancing rates."
"Financing for the European Social Fund should at least stay at its current level."
"It should be a minimum of 1% of the gross budget of the European Union."
"We believe that to be absolutely essential."
"I would like to highlight one other problem."
"The proposed increased focus on the results naturally gives rise to the question with regard to the ESF of which indicators and benchmarks will form the basis for evaluating the results and what that ultimately means in terms of preparation for the project promoters in each case."
"These promoters do not have reserves which would allow them to make additional payments or repayments."
"If the ESF is to remain in existence and play an effective role, we need to have a clear overview of this issue in advance."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, it has been suggested that the Commission will withdraw regional development funding to all but the most economically weak areas of the Union post-2013 by removing Regional Competitiveness and Employment Objective funding."
"Although many areas of Wales benefit under the Convergence Objective, reflecting the country's economic shortcomings, as many as seven Welsh regions are now threatened with losing EU money."
"EU funding to Wales, currently worth GBP 280 million, could be withdrawn."
"Financial support to numerous projects created under the auspices of the Regional Competitiveness Programme could be stripped, threatening thousands of associated jobs."
"Has the Commission thought, at the very least, to draw up an impact assessment to judge the social and economic consequences of cutting funds?"
"What transitional measures are being proposed?"
"Spending on debt-ridden eurozone countries, including Greece, was pursued with little hesitation and amounts to a trillion euros over three years."
"Wales also suffers high unemployment levels and will be greatly affected by forthcoming UK Government civil service cuts."
"Another threat to Wales could be the proposed renationalisation of structural funding, which could see Britain undersold on entitlement to support."
"The UK, as a net contributor, would likely be expected to bear the heaviest fiscal burden."
"The EUR 55 billion spent on regional competitiveness and employment funding account for just 6% of the entire EU budget."
"The UK will continue to pour increasing amounts of money into Brussels, yet the one area where some of that money is recouped - albeit very little - is the area the Commission are looking to axe."
"It is, of course, my opinion that the people of Wales would be better off if the UK left the EU."
"That way, we could save billions and be the sole dictators of where much-needed financial provision is channelled."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, we have reached a pivotal moment in the debate on the future of the European Social Fund (ESF)."
"At a time when employment has become the number one preoccupation of all countries and all European regions, I am proud of the resolution Parliament has proposed today on the future of the ESF."
"This text is responsible, concrete and opens doors to the future."
"Now more than ever, our territories need a cohesion policy and thus, support from the European structural funds."
"The ESF has been in place since 1957 and was established by the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, the Treaty of Rome."
"Its legitimacy is not in doubt."
"My position on the future of the ESF is simple and clear and can be summarised in three points."
"First, a European Social Fund must remain focused on employment, combating poverty, of course, but by getting people into work and not by other means."
"Today, employment must have our full attention and must be our priority."
"I am convinced that a person who returns to employment is also a person who regains his human dignity."
"Second, an effective European Social Fund must have clear, pragmatic rules that do not discourage operators."
"That is why I support my political group, which is calling for greater visibility for the ESF, particularly to improve its uptake."
"Just imagine, budget allocations are sometimes returned unused to the European Union, while unemployment rates have never been so high."
"Third, and finally, we need a fund that is included in the broader framework of a strong European cohesion policy."
"Decisions must be taken on the ESF with partners that are as close to the ground as possible."
"Commissioners, can you assure us that the ESF will meet these expectations?"
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for this opportunity to debate before the Commission deliberates on these proposals."
"Employment, poverty, the economic, financial and social crisis in the European Union, and the subsequent austerity measures in the budgets of the Member States, force us, at European level, to fully address the issues of employment and social policies and to regard the European Social Fund (ESF) as a tool of EU economic policy and the EU budget for meeting not only the treaty objectives of economic, social and territorial cohesion but also the objectives of the strategy, the draft of which the Heads of State or Government have just accepted, which include increasing the employment rate and combating poverty."
"In this context, with the ESF now under review, I would like to send out some signals to Commissioner Andor."
"We think that the regions are the effective authorising bodies of European public expenditure."
"However, that does not mean that the instruments of economic policy must be reduced to the imperative of territorial cohesion."
"Cohesion also includes economic and social cohesion."
"It may be scheduled by the regions, but it must meet economic and social objectives that concern all parts of the European Union."
"Commissioner, when you review these rules, I urge you to take account of the experience gained in the implementation of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, where the capacity exists for individualisation and for adaptation to each of the workers concerned, which may also be useful for the European Social Fund."
"I also urge you to link in some of the objectives of our Europe 2020 strategy: employability, employment, the fight against poverty, and research and development."
"Research and development is certainly very important for Galileo and others."
"Commissioner, as regards social innovation, there is an immense wasteland, which I urge you to explore using the ESF with, no doubt, in this case, somewhat different cofinancing deals."
"I fully endorse what Mrs Zimmer said: employability cannot be the sole objective of the ESF."
"There is also the question of combating social exclusion and taking into account the most vulnerable sections of the population - the young, women, people with disabilities and the Roma population, to name but a few."
"Finally, Commissioner, I would like to say a word on the conditions of use of the ESF."
"We know everyone says: 'There is Kafka in the home, there is Kafka in Brussels.'"
"There are rules for the use of the ESF which are too difficult to implement."
"Therefore, let us think about a kind of geometry which varies depending on the quality of the use of public expenditure by the regions."
"Where regions are happily capable of being authorising bodies, let us relax control."
"Where there is a need for administrative support, let us invent new mechanisms."
"And, finally, as regards the return of the money that is not used in the budgets of the Member States, I urge you to imagine abolishing this rule, which is not the right way to use the European Social Funds to further employment and social inclusion."
"(RO) Social inclusion is a particularly important topic which is well integrated into regional policy."
"As we are all aware, it entails much more than simply job creation."
"The resolution on the European Social Fund emphasises the role it plays in achieving the EU 2020 strategy objectives."
"Without regional policy instruments, this strategy has no chance of being successfully implemented at national, regional or local level."
"As a result, as long as regional policy and social policy are interconnected policies which operate successfully together, I believe that we should not agree, under any circumstances, to the separation of the European Social Fund from the Structural Funds."
"Such a decision would pave the way for funds to be allocated on a sectoral basis, thereby creating an undesirable precedent for this."
"The European Social Fund must remain part of the Structural Funds, especially as it has proven its effectiveness in every region of Europe, given that it is actually a key weapon in the battle against the economic crisis, in addition to the European Regional Development Fund."
"We need a strong, well-funded EU regional policy in order to achieve social, economic and territorial cohesion."
"I therefore believe that the regional aspect must continue to enjoy its appropriate place as part of both the revised EU budget and the future budget."
"We must reject any attempt at renationalisation."
"The regional policy is not a charity policy, but an EU policy intended for all regions, which will generate economic growth, innovation and competitiveness, making it an instrument available to every Member State."
"If we want solutions which are appropriate to the needs and realities which we are going to face in the future as well, we must maintain the same framework. By that, I mean both the basic principles and the sums allocated."
"(FR) Mr President, I should like to draw your attention, ladies and gentlemen, to an aspect of this resolution, which is of central and not secondary importance to me, and which can give the policies of regional cohesion their full meaning."
"The challenge is to identify the best instrument to enable us to measure the state of development of the European regions as accurately as possible and to have at our disposal the best decision support instrument, especially for deciding on eligibility for European funds."
"It is about having a political compass to guide us towards this 'targeted approach to territorial development', to quote the proposed resolution, towards this integrated approach."
"What is this guide on which to base our regional cohesion policies?"
"Today, we have just a single indicator, gross domestic product, which is an excellent indicator and an excellent instrument for measuring economic growth and the production of wealth."
"However, regional development issues are not confined to increasing gross domestic product."
"People's well-being cannot simply be expressed as an index or a curve."
"If it could, we would be in danger of ending up with an indicator that gives nothing more than a distorted, partial and therefore one-sided view."
"To pursue regional cohesion policies that are relevant to the objective of the sustainable development of the regions - which, I would point out, is our shared objective - the gross domestic product index must be supplemented by other instruments of measurement, particularly in the social and environmental spheres."
"It must be possible to assess the level of unemployment, insecure employment, education, health, environmental quality, air and water quality, protection of resources, access to basic services, etc. In conclusion, therefore, we need to do our utmost to establish, alongside gross domestic product, a battery of social and environmental indicators to facilitate regional cohesion policies whose aim is sustainable development based on the three pillars of economic factors, social factors and the environment."
"(FR) (started off-microphone) ... has more than 250 regions in its 27 Member States."
"Not all of these regions are homogeneous."
"There are major differences between them in terms of wealth, development and standard of living."
"To reduce these differences and to make the regions more competitive, the European Union implemented a regional cohesion and convergence policy based on solidarity and endowed with the appropriate financial resources: the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the cohesion funds."
"Nevertheless, despite the progress made, it would be illusory to believe that these differences will disappear in 2013, or even in 2020."
"Consequently, it would be advisable to maintain the principles of cohesion policy and the accompanying financial resources beyond 2013."
"Naturally, this regional cohesion and convergence policy must be pursued alongside other strategies, such as the EU 2020 strategy."
"However, it must be pursued independently of this strategy and we must ensure that it does not appropriate or absorb any of the funds allocated to cohesion policy under the pretext of regionalising a specific objective of the EU 2020 strategy."
"Parliament must maintain a watchful eye on this, as it is essential for all regions, particularly those that are lagging behind, notably the outermost regions."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, future regional and cohesion policy must be aligned with the Europe 2020 strategy priorities, and therefore it must be focused on the objectives of sustainable growth, social inclusion and employment."
"It needs to support the effective development of the European regions by levelling out the differences between them and enhancing the specific characteristics of the more marginalised areas which are still facing regional development challenges."
"The projects must take into account the less developed regions, which have been most severely affected by the crisis."
"New challenges such as population density in certain areas and depopulation in others, in mountain areas, in particular, along with climate change, must be addressed through concrete actions that strengthen local and regional involvement."
"The multi-level approach must stimulate the integrated development of disadvantaged areas by involving local and regional authorities as well as civil society."
"I urge the Commission to take into account the specific characteristics of each region, namely the regional dimensions of the various levels of development, and to simplify the management and control procedures for financed projects in order to ensure their effective and prompt execution."
"(BG) This topic is particularly important for me, as five of the six Bulgarian regions are in the top 10 poorest regions in the European Union."
"The reason for this is that those who led Bulgaria into the European Union misled the nation into thinking that as soon as Bulgaria joined, billions in assistance from European funds would come raining down on the country."
"We all know that this has not been the case."
"Those same people were hoping to get their people into key positions to cream off commissions from the appropriation of European funds."
"Now that the Bulgarian people have voted them out of office, there is nobody to step forward and take their place to help Bulgaria absorb European funds effectively."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is a reluctant admission but Bulgaria is a new country."
"It cannot measure itself against France, Germany and the other founder members."
"We need your know-how to enable these policies relating to these funds to reach the people for whom they were intended, and for there truly to be a policy of convergence."
"(DE) Mr President, today we have seen fundamental agreement across all the groups in Parliament."
"We want a strong cohesion policy and structural policy in all the European regions."
"It does not matter whether we are talking about a net contributor or one of the poorer Member States; structural policy remains the strongest expression of European solidarity."
"We are helping the poorest regions to catch up with their neighbours, but we are also helping the stronger regions to remain competitive."
"Europe will only be able to develop sustainably in areas such as environmental protection, industry and energy supplies, and to conquer global markets, if it can make the best technologies even better."
"To ensure that we achieve these objectives, we need clear and fair rules."
"This means that the poorer regions must remain the central focus of cohesion policy."
"The lower the gross domestic product (GDP) of a region, the more help it must receive from us."
"Anyone who questions the use of GDP as an indicator, such as the Greens and, unfortunately, some Liberals and Socialists, is attacking the very roots of European solidarity."
"GDP is the guarantee that social force, education and job opportunities are fully taken into account."
"Poor regions often cannot provide all these things on an adequate level and they also lose out when it comes to protecting the environment."
"Therefore, GDP must remain the reliable indicator for regional policy."
"We need to rely on our local authorities and federal states when it comes to regional policy."
"We want to implement the Europe 2020 strategy on the basis of the tried and tested principle of the joint development of programmes, joint administration and regional cofinancing."
"For this reason, the calls for independent EU funds for employment, climate protection and energy must not be allowed to become reality."
"If we were to replace regional policy with a stronger sectoral policy, the only winners would be new EU agencies, and our local authorities and federal states would be mere onlookers with regard to regional policy and cohesion policy."
"I am very pleased that the European Parliament has taken up a clear position on behalf of the regions."
"This has to do with accepting the European idea."
"We cannot force people to accept it."
"The acceptance has to develop from the bottom upwards as part of regional policy."
"(ES) Mr President, in the next few months, we are going to have to discuss and decide upon the future organisation of the Structural Funds, which are essential for bringing us out of the crisis and tackling the Europe 2020 strategy."
"I think that when the time comes, it will be important to learn from experience and uphold two decisions: the decision to maintain the European Social Fund (ESF) within the body of basic rules regulating the Cohesion Fund and cohesion policy, but also, at the same time, the decision to maintain the objectives, rules and budgets of the ESF without distorting them."
"Why is this?"
"It is because, ladies and gentlemen, the ESF needs to continue to provide training, and to prepare workers for entering the labour market and for social cohesion, as that is why it was created."
"We need it now and we will need it in the next few years, and not only for building roads."
"This is because Europe's main assets are its people, and if the EU wants to play a role and maintain its social model, it will have to continue to train its people."
"We cannot use our resources any better than if we use them for the purpose for which they were created."
"This does, however, have to be done within the overall structure, working in a balanced way with synergies within territorial cohesion policy."
"Mr President, Article 4 TFEU lists the competences shared between the Union and the Member States."
"After the internal market, social policy is the next on the list, followed by economic, social and territorial cohesion."
"That gives an indication of the priorities in the treaty."
"Following on from that, Article 9 clearly states that in defining and implementing its policies and activities, the Union should take account of requirements linked to the promotion of a high level of employment, the guarantee of adequate social protection, the fight against social exclusion, and a high level of education, training and protection of human health."
"This issue is highlighted in Article 10 of our resolution on the future of the Social Fund and is, to me, of crucial importance."
"That gives us our framework."
"I agree with many of the speakers who have argued that we need a framework to establish synergies between all European policies and the Structural Funds."
"Indeed, these must act as drivers that will help us to achieve the EU 2020 targets."
"I also agree with Commissioner Andor when he says that EU citizens expect results based delivery systems."
"There is also a strong argument for greater visibility of these funds, and an urgent need for simplification."
"I regularly speak to voluntary, community, and other groups who access these funds."
"They have serious issues with the levels of bureaucracy and red tape that confront them."
"But it is not just that usual red tape: there is also uncertainty over interpretation of the rules and regulations."
"We have discussed this issue of simplification again and again in committee and in plenary, and yet nothing has changed for the better."
"In connection with rules and regulations, a colleague recently asked me why there is an insistence on 'pouring sand into every moving part'."
"Given that context, this issue really needs to be dealt with."
"Perhaps we can begin to get it right this time."
"Finally, I would once again like to emphasise and ensure that Article 9, or the 'social clause', permeates all our policy decisions, because that really will lead to cohesion in the EU."
"(FR) Mr President, I would like to express, first of all, our commitment to regional development policy."
"We consider the region to be the appropriate level at which to structure European economic policies."
"Indeed, it has a natural ability to withstand globalisation and, consequently, to sustain employment and ensure its fair distribution throughout Europe."
"Secondly, territorial cohesion policy must, in our view, form part of the long-term future."
"The threshold of 75% of GDP will naturally be renewed in 2014."
"However, do people think that if the poorest regions pass the 75% threshold in future, European territorial cohesion will be complete?"
"Can the gap between 75% for the poorest and 150% or more for the richest - twice as much - be taken to represent the fulfilment of Europe's objectives in territorial cohesion terms?"
"We should therefore take a long-term view of European cohesion policy."
"The threshold of 90% seems to me to be an objective that we can actually set today, while at the same time clearly prioritising those who are still under 75%."
"Finally, with regard to the priorities of this policy: many people have spoken of social cohesion, particularly through the European Social Fund (ESF), of the fight against global warming and of territorial cooperation beyond borders, which is also a priority of the Commission;"
"I would like to focus on the promotion of Europe's diversity."
"It is expressed primarily at the level of the regions and their cultural heritage, and it is an asset that will be taken into account and emphasised within the context of regional development policy."
"Mr President, Parliament's Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis has concluded that one of the key instruments to aid economic recovery should be that of cohesion funding across all regions of the EU."
"My nation of Wales is currently in receipt of cohesion funding, and given how badly the private sector in this region has been affected by the economic downturn, I and many others recognise the value of these funds to potentially transform the economy."
"Funds, of course, need to be put to good use in sustainable projects, hopefully with many SMEs benefiting both directly and indirectly in order to ensure the return on investment for a future investment programme in these regions to use."
"The cohesion funding should be a mechanism for stimulating economic growth across the EU, but needs to have a specific goal as supporting SMEs and entrepreneurs who are the backbone of our economy."
"Investment, not spending, should be the goal, pre- and post-2013."
"(EL) Mr President, the debate on so-called cohesion policy in the European Union has not highlighted basic characteristics such as: firstly, the fact that no EU cohesion policy can eliminate the inequalities in growth caused by the capitalist method of production, which operates solely on the criterion of profit for capital."
"Secondly, the fact that the money made available by the European Union to the regions is not intended to satisfy grassroots needs; it is intended for projects needed by capital."
"Thirdly, the fact that the debate on cuts in resources serves the interests of the large capitalist groups and, fourthly, the fact that the plans of capital for future cohesion policy serve speedier capitalist restructurings and the anti-grassroots EU 2020 strategy, which is also being used in Greece to reform the state on the basis of the Kapodistrias and Kallikratis plans."
"Thus, in my opinion, it would appear in this matter that socialisation of the means of production alone can resolve the problem and bring about real cohesion on our continent."
"(LT) We all know very well that the objective of European Union cohesion policy is to reduce development disparities among EU Member States and regions."
"However, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that in implementing this large-scale programme in regional policy, it must cover all of Europe's regions and I agree with the opinion that this policy should not be nationalised."
"We must ensure stable and sustainable economic growth and job creation."
"A strong and properly financed EU regional policy is the basis for ensuring social, economic and territorial cohesion."
"As always (as before), greater attention should also be devoted to regions lagging behind."
"It is good that in the next programming period, there are plans to earmark financial resources for investments required to implement urban and also suburban projects, without reducing rural funding, because cities have a positive impact on the economy of surrounding rural areas."
"In this case, the most important aspects of discussions should be the following: the scope of EU cohesion policy, the validity of objectives, the link with the 2020 strategy and opportunities for implementing EU cohesion policy and simplifying its procedures."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund are financing instruments of EU regional policy which aim to bridge the development divide between the regions and promote regional cohesion."
"The future challenges faced by our cohesion policy, such as globalisation, demographic change, climate change and energy supply, interact with one another in a very complex way."
"On account of our limited resources, we should focus on our key priorities and make an increased effort to identify synergies between the different policies."
"I support the call for a simple, fair and transparent transition system for cohesion policy after 2013."
"The restructuring of the policy depends on whether all the parties involved - the regions, the Member States and the EU - are in a position to respond quickly to these new challenges."
"(HU) Now that the individual policies and directions for the 2020 strategy are already on their way to being implemented in practice, we must realise that we know next to nothing about their funding or financial background."
"It only follows that by underlining the importance and necessity of the cohesion policy, in a sense, we also want to ensure that during the upcoming budget debates, the common European policy at issue becomes consolidated, not fragmented."
"While there is no doubt and it has been pointed out by many that the creation of workplaces and the increase in employment are very high on the list of priorities, we also know that European labour markets are experiencing structural tension."
"While, in some areas, workplaces often lack people with the right qualifications or skills, elsewhere, highly qualified people struggle to find a job due to a lack of appropriate workplaces."
"It is obvious that the European Social Fund has a pivotal role in counteracting this situation, with policies designed to eliminate these differences and bring them closer together."
"We are not talking about large-scale projects."
"We are talking about small projects and more flexible adjustment."
"While we endorse and support the concept of a single policy and the exploitation of synergies in the context of cohesion policy, I would also like to emphasise that where the Social Fund is concerned, we need a higher degree of flexibility and transparency and fewer rules."
"In this sense, there should be separate rules that apply to the Social Fund, and I welcome the Commissioner's statement about introducing a result-oriented assessment, considering that the biggest problem with these policies - one that also undermines their authority - is often that we are unable to see the results of funds spent in specific areas."
"Mr President, I am sure that Commissioner Hahn does not need to be persuaded that cohesion policy is one of the most successful policies of the EU, the results of which have influenced the lives of millions of citizens, wherever they live in Europe."
"I am sure that Commissioner Andor does not need to be persuaded about the successful delivery of the social policy aspects of cohesion policy, thanks to the strong synergy of the ESF and ERDF."
"Nor do the other two Commissioners dealing with EU funds in rural development and fisheries need to be persuaded that they are more effective working together with other funds, as they used to be, than on their own, as in the current period."
"I am among those who expect that in the next period, we should have proposals for even stronger synergies between a strong cohesion policy and all the other funds, based on the fact that all of them together can deliver far better results than each one on its own."
"But for some reason I fail to understand, there are voices inside the Commission that are calling for an approach of sectoral instruments, ignoring (in my view) the realities on the ground."
"To conclude, what we say in our resolution, which I strongly hope and believe will be adopted by a very large majority later today, is supported not only by this House but also by the majority of Member States, all 271 regions of Europe and thousands of local authorities."
"In my opinion, if the Commission follows the path of sectorisation of EU resources, we will arrive in a unique and conflictual situation where the Commission will be on one side and everybody else - Parliament, the Council and the regions - on the other side."
"In the coming weeks, the side which believes that future EU policies would be best covered within an integrated approach to planning, implementation and delivery will have to engage in a serious fight with the side which believes that sectorisation of EU resources is the way to go."
"Be sure that the latter will find this group against them simply because it is the wrong way to go for Europe."
"(FI) Mr President, Commissioners, cohesion policy is not simply a matter of solidarity: it is partly a means for us to create added value for Europe as a whole."
"There is a good deal of expertise in our region as well as very strong potential based on natural resources, for example."
"We can only achieve these targets, which are also closely linked to Europe 2020, through an effective cohesion policy which covers the whole of Europe and has adequate funds in its budget for the period starting in 2014."
"It will be important in the next financial period that we continue to try to level out the differences between countries with respect to GDP."
"In addition, it is absolutely vital that the present Objective 2 regions and the special challenges they face are taken into account."
"Furthermore, I would appeal to you, Commissioners, with reference to Article 174: sparsely populated regions, mountainous areas and islands must also be considered in the next period of cohesion policy, with respect to funding too, as has been the case hitherto, and with much success."
"Finally, I wish to express my gratitude for having the opportunity to take part in this very important debate."
"(PL) Mr President, I think that when planning changes which are so strategic, we should take very careful note of past experience."
"This experience tells us clearly that where money was spent on hard infrastructure investments and in accordance, primarily, with the GDP criterion, the expenditure brought advantages to the entire European Union, both to Member States which are net contributors to European funds and to those which are net beneficiaries."
"Acceleration of the process of reducing disparities in the level of infrastructure strengthened the common market and facilitated investment, which, after all, continues to flow mainly from net contributors to net beneficiaries."
"This gave clear European added value, which is something we have talked so much about today."
"Therefore, it is with concern that I look at a situation in which we are planning a reform of cohesion policy and adding new criteria - very vague social and ecological criteria - to the system for distribution of these funds."
"This money should continue to serve the poorest regions as defined by measurable criteria, in particular, concerning the achievement of hard infrastructure objectives."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we all know that the aim of the European Social Fund is to narrow the prosperity gap and promote economic and social cohesion."
"However, today, in the year for combating poverty, Europe is in recession, we have unemployment, we have businesses closing and, therefore, the attainment of this objective hangs in the balance."
"Commissioners, in my opinion, therefore, you should immediately revise the priorities of the European Funds, including the European Social Fund."
"However, Commissioners, I should like to say to you that we see the absurdities and paradoxes in your economic policies."
"In other words, you - the Commission, the IMF and the European Central Bank - have imposed a miserable memorandum on Greece, which cuts public spending, cuts wages, cuts incomes; at the same time, however, in response to my questions to the Commission about why there is a delay in the take-up of Community funds by Greece, the reply was: the inadequate liquidity of public finances; in other words, the essence of its political memorandum."
"Please could you explain to us, Commissioner, how Greece can increase take-up?"
"Is there not an absurdity, a paradox in your economic policies?"
"(SK) At present, we are giving almost one third of our budget to the EU's cohesion policy in the 2007-2013 period."
"Under a number of new proposals, some of this budget would be redirected after 2013 towards fulfilling the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"However, in the Committee of the Regions, representatives of the cities and the regions warn us against making a significant reduction in contributions to regional policy."
"In my opinion, we should pay very serious attention to their objective arguments."
"It is, for example, clear to us that we must continue to support these regions, which currently fail to achieve even 75% of the average gross domestic product of the European Union."
"However, the financial resources allotted to them should be mainly directed as a matter of priority towards constructing basic infrastructure, supporting human resources or employment, greater investment in science, research and innovation, and the target of green growth."
"We should also try to improve links between regional and local structures and to reduce the bureaucratic burden."
"Through a well considered, balanced regional policy of this kind, we might finally also help to make the new Europe 2020 strategy truly successful."
"Mr President, at a time when Member States are reducing public spending, in the UK our government is seeking to overhaul the benefits system to make work pay more."
"I do believe, then, in this context, that funds such as the ESF have a vital role to play in ensuring the employability of those who are hard to reach and low-skilled."
"We in Northern Ireland receive significant funding from the ESF administered through the Department for Learning and Employment, and I note that in a recent House of Lords enquiry into the ESF, it was noted the ESF continues to make a significant contribution to supporting economic growth in Northern Ireland, aimed at creating a knowledge-based economy with a highly skilled and flexible workforce."
"It is therefore essential that future ESF projects and the money directed towards them can be considered in the context of domestic schemes, many of which have similar aims."
"That level of joined up and targeted thinking can only bring greater rewards."
"Regional flexibility is of the utmost importance for the successful operation of the ESF."
"Post-2013, I believe that the limited resources of the ESF should continue to be focused on assisting the hardest to reach and least skilled into work or back into work through access to training and further education."
"(IT) Mr President, this resolution is fundamental because it takes on board the important requirement for renewal connected with the creation of an anti-crisis policy for 2020 by striking a balance between necessary innovation and due respect for the fundamental principles of cohesion policy."
"This is, and must remain, the pillar of European integration."
"It must continue to play an essential role as an instrument for reconciling the differences between Member States while, at the same time, strengthening regional identities."
"Therefore, notwithstanding the architecture of cohesion policy and having reaffirmed the value and relevance of multi-level governance, partnership and the integrated approach as fundamental principles, this resolution affirms the advantages of combining GDP, which must remain the only criterion for determining eligibility, with new and more meaningful indicators for the sole purpose of analysis and assessment; the need to lay down new rules for the European Social Fund, which should nonetheless be maintained under the regulation on general provisions concerning cohesion policy; and the need to simplify procedures and use financial engineering instruments, as Commissioner Hahn also stated."
"Indeed, I am referring to Commissioner Hahn's speech, in particular, to the point where he mentioned the importance of maintaining the Stability Pact within the context of cohesion policy."
"That is all well and good, but to achieve that aim, the wretched agreement that stipulates that investment expenditure must be calculated within the parameters of the Stability Pact needs to be scrapped or amended, because it would be like asking for more investment expenditure on the one hand, and then punishing it by reducing it, on the other."
"The challenges facing the European Union are difficult ones: employment, growth, development and competitiveness."
"These are the objectives of the European strategy, which provides for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth."
"As many people have said, these can only be addressed if the future European financial framework takes into account the importance of regional policy, in order to achieve true economic, social and territorial cohesion, and if it is able to guarantee adequate financing despite the constraints on resources by carrying forward a policy where objectives are set according to priorities and assessed according to results."
"(RO) Hitherto, the cohesion policy has been a successful instrument in narrowing the disparities between Member States and for displaying solidarity, very much a fundamental value of our EU."
"However, it is vital to reduce the imbalances not only for the sake of the European Union, but also of every individual citizen and region, which requires not only human resources, but also sufficient financial resources."
"The current cohesion policy requires improvements, without any major amendments."
"Above all, we must reject and refuse to renationalise and underfund it."
"At this juncture, when rich or less rich Member States are being hit by the effects of the economic crisis, cutting the budget allocated to the cohesion policy would be tantamount to jeopardising all the successes over recent years and the reduction in the disparities which we have been endeavouring to combat up until now."
"This is why I agree with the view of President José Manuel Durão Barroso that the budget allocated to the cohesion policy in the future must be at least equal to the current one."
"Otherwise, these will remain just fine words and we will undermine the European project itself."
"Mr President, the resolution is strategically very well written."
"We must support it."
"However, we have to find where the problems are at present."
"I would point out to the Commissioner that, as at 1 September, the absorption rate for the Social Fund was just 18%, which is half as much - twice as bad - as in the previous period."
"17 Member States are at less than 18%."
"Some of them are stuck at 10% or 11% absorption when it comes to the Social Fund."
"There is no pattern here: the countries with the biggest deficit are not showing the worst absorption rates."
"But the fact is that some countries were stuck at 10% throughout 2010."
"The Commission has to clarify the situation."
"If one looks at the other funds - the Regional Fund and the Cohesion Fund - the situation is no better."
"The overall absorption rate is 17.95%."
"Also, 60% of Member States have a lower absorption than this."
"For some of them, the figure is three times less."
"The Council has cut the funding under the draft budget for 2011 to less than EUR 1 000 million because the Member States have no clear idea about fulfilling their obligations."
"We in the Committee on Budgets supported the Committee on Regional Development in its request to restore the funding to the draft budget."
"The question is whether it will be possible for this money to be absorbed."
"If it cannot, there is no sense talking about a bright future."
"(LV) Thank you, Mr President."
"Commissioner, I believe that the draft prepared by Mrs Hübner, the former Commissioner for Regional Policy, is also balanced and, in fact, good."
"I understand that we all know that the crisis has created a challenge for many Member States that are net contributors, as a result of which there is pressure for the next financial perspective to be reduced in money terms."
"In such a case, this major heading that cohesion policy represents is also extremely important."
"However, it is important for all of us not to get confused, but be a little more conservative and not let go of two fundamentals of cohesion policy, namely, that it is an independent policy, the main objective of which is still, and will remain, the equalisation of development between less well-developed regions and the rest of the European Union, and second, that per capita gross domestic product by purchasing power parity is nevertheless the main criterion."
"If we disregard these fundamentals, any other debates (such as how better to align cohesion policy with the achievement of the European Union's 2020 targets) will fail to achieve anything, even with 'EU 2020' in the context of cohesion policy. Thank you."
"(DE) Mr President, we are not talking about peanuts here."
"For the period from 2007 to 2013, EUR 75 billion is available for the European Social Fund (ESF) and this amounts to almost 8% of the EU budget."
"As Brussels will only provide the money for the ESF when the Member States take responsibility for cofinancing, this means that there will be around EUR 150 billion on the table for creating more and better jobs."
"Fortunately, ESF money is not used to fund unnecessary studies, but instead goes directly to the people who need it."
"This is what makes it so valuable and what allows people to experience it at first hand, including the long-term unemployed, migrants, young people who have the opportunity to obtain the school leaving qualifications that they missed out on first time around, tens of thousands of trainees and retrainees, employees who want further training and budding entrepreneurs."
"It has a wide range of target groups."
"What will happen after 2013?"
"The Member States must make more effective use of the funding and we also need to take the special features of individual regions into account."
"I would like to see a tailor-made, bottom-up approach and effective coordination with programmes such as Daphne and PROGRESS."
"I am in favour of more flexibility, simpler controls and more transparent allocation of funding."
"However, I am opposed to a separate legal framework for the ESF."
"I believe it should remain within the Structural Fund regulation, which will ensure that the eligibility of expenditure is regulated at the level of the Member States."
"This is why I have tabled Amendment 1, together with 45 of my fellow Members, and I would ask you to support it in the forthcoming vote."
"Mr President, we all agree that the cohesion policy has had a very positive impact so far."
"This is visible and recognisable."
"However, there are different ideas for the post-2013 cohesion policy."
"We should further develop and adapt it to the new challenges and realities by building on its achievements and not by totally transforming the policy."
"This is equally important both for its basic principles and for the future budget."
"We need actions and they must be supported by adequate resources from the EU and national budgets."
"The Committee on Budgets has recently stressed that an effort will be made to avoid big losers as far as future allocations from the structural funds are concerned."
"I strongly hope that the new Member States will not fall into the category of big losers."
"Therefore, cutting money for cohesion cannot be an option in any way."
"It is not only a financial issue, but it will negatively affect the principles of solidarity."
"(GA) Thank you, Mr President. I would like to say a few words about cohesion policy."
"The future of cohesion policy has been framed in the context of rising unemployment and contracting public finances across Europe."
"It is likely that the BMW (Border, Midlands and Western) region in my country will once again fall within the 75% to 100% EU GDP range."
"Measures must be put in place post-2013 which recognise this altered economic position in Ireland and in the BMW region in particular."
"The focus of Objective 2 programmes must be building the capacity of the regions in order to effectively contribute to the development of a greener, smarter and sustainable economy in Ireland and the rest of Europe."
"Regional flights in the BMW region are an economic and social necessity."
"Therefore, public service obligation funding must be retained, as these internal flights would not survive economically otherwise."
"EU support for cross-border cooperation in Ireland must be retained."
"Cross-border cooperation can address fragmentation in border regions in terms of the labour market, trade patterns and infrastructure."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, today is an extremely important political day for the future of EU regional policy."
"This is for two reasons."
"The first is that this morning, we MEPs are joining forces and addressing our demands to the European Commission and the European ministers."
"We want to capitalise on our successes with this crucial policy and amend it as required to make it more accessible and more visible."
"We want a strong, well-financed policy that really helps to bring about economic development for all of our regions."
"We want simplified rules, and we do not just want to hear them talked about; we want them to be implemented for project leaders and potential beneficiaries."
"We want outermost towns and regions to receive special attention."
"I worked on this resolution when it was with the working group and Parliament's Committee on Regional Development."
"I supported the needs of potential beneficiaries and succeeded in ensuring that they were taken into account and adapted to the needs expressed in our regions."
"I want a united and social Europe, founded on a conquering, ambitious Europe."
"The second extremely important event of today is this afternoon's action, where 140 regions will come together and their 140 regional presidents, together with MEPs, representing 85% of the EU population, will embark on a symbolic march to the European Commission - we shall see each other later, Commissioner - to demonstrate the extent to which all of us, the regions and Parliament, are aware of the importance of this cohesion policy for business, citizens, the social sphere and the economy, and we shall be united this afternoon in demonstrating the extent to which this first strong political campaign is a campaign of the people, a clear signal to the European Commission, directly via the regions."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, I would like cohesion policy from 2013 to continue to be the prime example of solidarity within the EU."
"I would like cohesion policy to be a genuine response to the crisis and its aftermath, and in order to achieve this, it is essential for it to be incorporated into the Europe 2020 strategy and, specifically, into the target of job creation."
"Cohesion policy needs to be increasingly participative and civil society needs to play a greater role in designing and managing the projects."
"It is important that you, in the Commission, see cohesion policy as an investment rather than expenditure and as an opportunity to generate trust and sustainable development."
"I do not want cohesion policy to overlook the specific needs of the social groups with the most difficulties, as that is not compatible with an integrated approach or with a more strategic concept that is investing in the sectors of the future."
"In short, as we have said so many times, we need cohesion policy that is solid, well-financed and present in all the regions of the European Union."
"(HU) Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, a lot has been said today about regional and cohesion policy."
"However, I would like to talk about the role of the European Social Fund, which has a fundamental role and significance in cohesion policy as well, because if large groups are falling behind, then we also have a problem with the cohesion policy."
"The role of the European Social Fund will be enhanced further by the 2020 strategy, as employability is a key issue."
"At this point, I would like to draw your attention to two issues:"
"The first is to make sure there is a second chance."
"We must provide a second chance for those who have lost their jobs in the crisis which accelerated certain globalisation processes, such as the massive exodus of mass production from Europe, and for those who cannot use their skills on the labour market because there is no demand for them."
"This is what we call 'skill mismatch'."
"A second chance must also be provided for those who are unemployable due to a lack of any qualifications, such as school drop-outs."
"The second is that the 2020 strategy would increase the level of employment among women by 25%."
"However, this will be possible only if Member States can provide, with the assistance of the European Social Fund, the indispensable backing in the area of services, particularly childcare and elderly care."
"Since the support required is often smaller in extent, payment rules would probably need to be more flexible than for projects funded from the large structural funds."
"What is absolutely inevitable is to ensure that supervision and evaluation are more stringent in order to make funding more transparent and more efficient."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Hahn, Mr Andor, ladies and gentlemen, I do not need to emphasise how important cohesion and regional policy is for the process of living together and growing together in Europe."
"However, I also believe that in future, regional policy and cohesion policy must focus more closely on our cities."
"Cities are an important driving force behind development in Europe."
"At the same time, they are currently suffering from environmental, economic and social problems."
"This is why I have a particular question for Mr Hahn."
"What opportunities do you think there are for highlighting the urban dimension?"
"To come to the point, Mr Hahn, you recently indicated during an event which took place in this House that you had a specific percentage of the regional funding in mind which would be reserved for highlighting the urban dimension."
"Is this still the case?"
"If so, what percentage were you thinking of?"
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioners, it is surprising that before a further financial framework is agreed, we often have discussions whose purpose is to defend cohesion policy, a policy which has proved to be one of the most effective and most visible in the European Union."
"In fact, discussion of cohesion policy is, to a great extent, discussion about the European Union - about what the Union is, how it is supposed to function and how it is supposed to be understood by the citizens."
"We are not only talking about money; we are also thinking of whether we are really putting in place measures which lead to economic growth."
"We need to take note of the fact that cohesion policy is a very special instrument, because it combines, on the one hand, reduction of disparities with the support of measures which lead to greater competitiveness."
"These two objectives are not incompatible - they make cohesion policy favourable to development."
"It is worth talking about this, because the policy is not one of charity, but is, in fact, a policy of measures intended to assist development."
"This is why it is part of the EU 2020 strategy."
"Furthermore, it is worth saying that it is the only policy which is extremely complicated in terms of putting it into effect, because it is based on a common administration which is shared with the Member States."
"This means, on the one hand, that the instruments involved are extremely difficult and the procedures are very complicated, but, on the other, it produces a clear effect of cooperation between the European Union, Member States and local authorities."
"In view of this, let us not defend cohesion policy only in the context of the new economic conditions."
"Let us give thought to how to improve and strengthen it."
"(IT) Mr President, Open Days have been taking place here in Brussels over the last few days."
"Many municipal and regional representatives have been talking about how to address the serious problems our cities are facing and about the old and new needs affecting workers, families, and small and large production companies alike."
"The economic crisis that has hit our societies has made it harder and more difficult for all of us to find suitable solutions to a new and serious social issue."
"In this context, I believe everyone has come to understand that, time and again, cohesion policy has been the only real instrument the regions have had available to them for trying to provide solutions."
"We can therefore say that over the last few years, cohesion policy has provided a vital fillip to the European integration process for all of the regions."
"Now we are having to redefine this policy for the period after 2013, and we are therefore at a turning point."
"That is why it is vitally important to avoid certain risks."
"The first fundamental risk would be to renationalise it: that would be a serious step backwards."
"Next, when preparing the financing budget, we must lay down appropriate requirements with regard to the weaker areas without penalising the more competitive and more advanced regions."
"Lastly, it is essential to simplify the procedures for those who have demonstrated efficiency and to make more legally binding the power to penalise those who have not."
"We expect the Commission to take action along these lines."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, after four consecutive years in which the unemployment rate fell, from 2004 to 2008, the current economic crisis has wiped out much of the progress made."
"Unemployment rates across the European Union have shot up."
"In Portugal, for example, we have unfortunately reached the record level of 11% unemployment."
"Another negative phenomenon is unemployment among young people in the EU."
"Europe is thus going through a period of transformation and faces huge challenges."
"The crisis has wiped out years of economic and social progress and exposed the weaknesses in its Member States' economies and, accordingly, in the economy of the EU itself."
"The Europe 2020 strategy is showing us which ways to go."
"The EU must intensify all its efforts to promote employment and social inclusion as an integral part of its strategy to fight the economic and social crisis."
"I therefore welcome the motion for a resolution on the future of the European Social Fund (ESF), which we are debating today, because this fund plays a crucial role in achieving the Europe 2020 targets."
"This fund is, in fact, the main financial instrument enabling the EU to fulfil the strategic aims of its employment policy, through improving the education and training levels of the people of Europe."
"The ESF must be strengthened as the principal driving force behind Europe 2020, and it needs to be used by the Member States to invest in reskilling, employment, training and vocational retraining."
"Lastly, I would like to point out that the ESF reform, to be carried out in conjunction with the reform of the other structural funds, should not only facilitate and simplify its management and improve transparency, but also focus funds on results and achievements that can make a difference to the general public in their daily lives."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, there is no doubt the Structural Funds have been one of the most effective instruments for giving shape to European policies and, above all, for ensuring the solidity of the European economy."
"That is why I believe it is very important not only to reconfirm them, but also to give thought to their effectiveness by introducing some sort of flexibility between one fund and another."
"I refer primarily to the European Social Fund, which is crucial today in order to guarantee the quality of future jobs in this part of the world."
"It is certainly important to stimulate recovery and growth, but it is necessary to focus on competitive models that incorporate both the quality of what is produced through knowledge and the quality of how it is produced."
"Quality jobs are very important for people's dignity, as well as for their profit-making capacity."
"I believe the European Social Fund needs specific and simple rules."
"Simplicity is not the enemy of effectiveness and quality, and if there are strict controls, it is even less likely to lead to actions that break the rules."
"I believe that simplification and greater control should be tightly linked."
"That way, we can truly equip the Europe 2020 strategy with instruments that have proven to be effective, but which have also demonstrated the need for certain updates."
"(ES) Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank the working group led by the chair of the Committee on Regional Development, which has made it possible for us to have this debate today."
"We certainly all agree that cohesion policy is the essential element for achieving the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, and also for achieving European integration and achieving the economic, social and territorial cohesion set out in the Treaty of Lisbon that people are clamouring for so much."
"What we need to start doing now, in my view, is to see what mistakes we have made and improve what we have done so far."
"We all agree that the process needs to be much more flexible, there need to be fewer bureaucratic obstacles, and the controls need to be simpler."
"Also, the regions with specific difficulties, such as islands, mountainous areas, cross-border regions and outermost regions, must receive specific treatment."
"Gross domestic product must continue to be the main criterion, although there might be other indicators in other decision-making processes, and the regions and local bodies must play a fundamental role."
"It seems that we all agree on this."
"So we are going to go down this road, but the Commission should clarify for us whether this is indeed the road we should go down or whether it should be another one."
"It needs to clarify whether we are going to have the same budgets, which is absolutely essential in order for no one to lose out and for all the regions to be able to make progress in terms of innovation, competitiveness, development, income and progress, especially in a time of crisis when clarity is needed more than ever."
"Mr President, joined-up policies are essential to achieving results."
"So is a mechanism to drive change in a dynamic way, which is best achieved, in my view, by engaging all stakeholders in a structured manner."
"The fundamental role that services of general interest, including social services, play in economic, social and territorial cohesion, in job creation and improving quality of life, has so far been ignored in this debate."
"At the same time as we are debating how to make EU funds more effective in delivering cohesion, Council and Commission policies on fiscal consolidation are undermining services of general interest which are essential to cohesion."
"Without them, all the funds that Europe can pour into the Member States will be pointless."
"Another problem is the negative impact that EU market rules are having on regional and local authorities' right to maintain and initiate services of general interest, including social services."
"Yes, let us have more effective funds which are result-orientated, but we must stop the nonsense, the madness of stripping our societies of essential public services."
"(HU) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe a strong and efficient cohesion policy is inconceivable."
"Without the political consensus - or political cohesion if you will - required for the development and implementation of the policy, President Hübner's questions and the related draft decision, I believe, support the political consensus between political groups, political families, and maybe even between the various European institutions."
"From this point of view, I find and consider unacceptable the siren voices heard in today's debate about the GDP as the number one and exclusive indicator and measure of eligibility for regional development support."
"I would like to express my most definite and unambiguous support for the strong views of Mr Olbrycht and Mrs Mazzoni, namely, the strong views I mentioned in earlier debates in the European Parliament, also shared by Commissioner Hahn, that although GDP does not reflect all dimensions of the stage of development, it is still the most reliable indicator available."
"Obviously, at Member State level, policy makers may use alternative indicators to eliminate its deficiencies, if any, and to account for environmental and social aspects of development."
"However, in order to assert European solidarity and ensure that Member States can catch up successfully, it is essential that GDP remains the fundamental and exclusive indicator for the distribution of funds at EU level."
"(EL) Mr President, the European Social Fund is a tool, a basic tool with which to build a better Europe, so that we can forge the solidarity of peoples and states."
"However, like every other tool, it is very important that we think about how we should use it."
"Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, if we imagine the European Social Fund is a hammer, we can use it to hammer in the nails which will keep the European construct stable."
"If, however, we are careless and this hammer drops on our foot, then we shall be able to walk no further."
"I have used this metaphor to illustrate that, even if we create the best construct, the best infrastructure, if we forget that we are building it for the citizens of Europe, then we shall have failed."
"The European construct must be stable if people are to live and prosper in it, working in decent jobs with real future prospects."
"Commissioners, please never forget that the basic investment of the European Social Fund is man."
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioners, cohesion policy should be maintained and strengthened in the new financial framework."
"In accordance with the principles of solidarity and subsidiarity, which are fundamental principles of the Union, cohesion policy should support those regions which have the greatest distance to make up in terms of infrastructure, the economy, technology, employment or social integration and which, on the strength of their own resources, are unable to bridge this gap."
"This support should be for the pursuit of integrated strategies of regional development which also contain objectives established at national and Union level."
"Cohesion policy should go beyond the framework of spatial development policy and should integrate sectoral policies such as transport, energy, education, research, development and employment."
"(HU) Commissioners Andor and Hahn, the cohesion policy is the European Union's most successful and most perceivable public policy."
"It is also an important tool which will be much needed by the Union in the future as well."
"The convergence of new Baltic and Central European Member States is by no means complete."
"In addition, these funds are also needed by certain regions in Spain, Portugal and Greece."
"However, it would be a mistake to believe that the only purpose of the cohesion policy is to promote convergence, given that it is the most comprehensive integrated investment policy supporting the objectives of the 2020 strategy."
"It would be a grave mistake to split up this cohesion policy."
"It would be the equivalent of breaking up the European Union."
"As a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I think it is very important that we aim for a greater degree of harmony and synergy between regional and rural development policies in the future."
"(FI) Mr President, cohesion policy has been necessary, and it has been successful."
"In my opinion, now we need to dare to look ahead and have the courage to ask whether the money today is going to the right places and having the impact it is intended to."
"Money is allocated here and there, and no longer these days to the poorest regions and where it actually might be needed."
"I think it is time we asked ourselves whether cohesion policy should be nationalised, with joint resources at EU level only being channelled to where there is a genuine need."
"Secondly, I would like to say that bureaucracy unquestionably needs to be reduced: at present, 30-40% of the money available is spent on that, and it is definitely much too much."
"(RO) The achievements of the European Union's cohesion policy and the added value it can bring to the EU 2020 strategy are indisputable."
"The role which this policy plays in boosting regions' competitiveness and facilitating their increasing adaptability must also be highlighted."
"Although the cohesion policy's priorities should be aligned with the EU 2020 objectives, I think that there should be sufficient flexibility to be able to take into account specific regional features and to support weaker regions with greater needs, so that the latter can overcome socio-economic difficulties and natural handicaps, and so that disparities can be reduced."
"A strong, well-funded European Union regional policy which provides benefits to every region in the EU is a prerequisite for meeting our future objectives."
"(ES) Mr President, I am grateful for the opportunity to take part in a debate that is always of great interest to Members who come from and live on islands, such as, in my case, the Canary Islands."
"I am doing so in line with my participation in the debate on regional policy, under Article 174 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which took place recently, and I am only going to make three points."
"Firstly, I would like to point out that this debate on the economic, social and territorial aspects of cohesion policy needs to be consistent with the financial perspectives set for 2014-2020."
"Not despite the crisis, but precisely because of the crisis, the objective of cohesion is more important than ever."
"Secondly, I would like to point out that cohesion policy is not a sectoral policy, but a cross-cutting one, which means that the regional dimension of cohesion policy cannot be considered to be a specific sectoral policy, but rather it must cover energy, transport, communications and innovation policy."
"Thirdly, I would like to point out that this is especially important for island territories, which are all external borders of the European Union, and therefore, they are very vulnerable in terms of security to illegal trafficking and also to threats from globalisation."
"(DE) Mr President, as we know, 27 EU Member States with a large number of regions, cities and communities and a population of 500 million have, of course, a huge variety of different needs and problems."
"In addition, every EU initiative on a Brussels level has regional and local effects."
"Since the 1970s, structural aid has been available for disadvantaged regions in order to ensure that the growth of the economy and of prosperity is geographically balanced."
"However, looking at the current situation, we seem not to have come any closer to achieving these goals."
"For example, the billions paid in subsidies to the regions of Ireland and Greece have not protected them from feeling the full force of the financial and economic crisis."
"Those regions which lost their status as Objective 1 zones during the enlargement in 2004 are not much better off."
"Their situation has only improved in statistical terms, in other words, on paper, but it is a well-known fact that you cannot eat paper."
"Large regions may be showing strong growth, but they can, at the same time, contain small regions which are fighting for survival."
"Therefore, we need to make cohesion policy more efficient and the individual projects more sustainable."
"(RO) I believe that the European Commission should explain clearly and in detail how synergy is going to be achieved between the cohesion funds and common agricultural policy funds, given that harmonising the operation of these funds would generate more added value for the EU's actions and would also boost our efficiency at achieving our objectives."
"Last but not least, I support those who have called today for the rules governing every kind of fund to be simplified, both at European and Member State level."
"I also support fellow Members who have stated that GDP must remain the main criterion for determining eligibility for assistance."
"Mr President, Wales has benefited hugely from structural funding."
"It is therefore not surprising that I support the current basis of cohesion policy."
"I believe that structural funding should be made available to all regions across the EU and that adequate support should be provided for regions that no longer have convergence status."
"I believe competitiveness should be maintained, and would therefore urge all colleagues who are interested to attend this afternoon's march, organised by the Committee of the Regions."
"Finally, I believe the European Social Fund should remain part of cohesion policy and not be moved out to sectoral projects."
"I look forward to the publication of the fifth Cohesion Report, around 9 November."
"In particular, I look forward to talking about some of the details, including simplification of the process, particularly for applicants."
"I also look forward to discussing the definition of an urban area."
"That is a very important issue for us to discuss."
"We must also, of course, ensure that cohesion policy and structural funds have an adequate budget in the future."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, if we look at the aims of cohesion policy, it clearly has European added value."
"It demonstrates European solidarity by reducing regional asymmetries and contributing to economic, social and territorial cohesion."
"To be able to do that, therefore, it must have the necessary budget appropriation."
"Cohesion policy must also be flexible enough to address regional specificities, particularly those of the less-developed regions, and gross domestic product should be kept as the main eligibility criterion."
"The European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development needs to be coordinated with cohesion policy funds so as to raise efficiency and maximise results."
"I also endorse and call on the Commission to carry out an evaluation of the absorption of cohesion policy funds so that measures to improve the absorption rates of these funds can be adopted with the greatest urgency."
"(FI) Mr President, Europe 2020 was, in the wake of the deepest crisis in European economic history, supposed to represent a new beginning."
"The debate that has taken place subsequently, however, has been dominated by talk of budgetary discipline and little else."
"It seems that those who say that we need to make more cuts get the loudest applause."
"The Council is making cuts, the Member States are making cuts, and now it appears that here too in Parliament, the general feeling is that the EU budget should also be cut."
"That is not the way to build the future."
"Soon the European Union will have no cohesion policy, no regional policy, no employment policy, and no economic policy: it will only have a financial policy."
"Commissioners Hahn and Andor, are you concerned about this general climate of cuts?"
"I believe that the debate going on here right now is a little naive."
"(PL) Mr President, your statement, Mr Hahn, that cohesion and regional policy is in good condition and should be a policy which is close to the citizens, incorporating different, well-designed instruments, is - it seems to me - a good answer to the question which has been asked in this Chamber today."
"Overcoming the crisis, which has been a difficult one for all of us, and achieving the objectives of the 2020 economic strategy, necessitate cohesion policy and clear objectives, both for Member States and for regions."
"We have designated this year as the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion."
"We are also going to continue with this objective until 2020."
"We will not achieve this without the European Social Fund being incorporated into cohesion policy."
"This is what local authorities expect, too, and this is also being said by the Committee of the Regions, which represents them."
"We should, therefore, take very strong account of their opinion in this Chamber."
"(ES) Mr President, it is well known that territorial cohesion, along with the economic and social prosperity of the Member States and their regions, need communication networks that facilitate and allow genuine free movement of people, goods and services across borders."
"They need these networks to guarantee greater coherence between mobility systems, greater coherence between the objectives of economic, social and territorial cohesion and the planning of trans-European networks, which are frequently ignored or are carried out in parallel without ensuring that the necessary defaults are in place."
"However, so far, European policy regarding trans-European networks has met with a pitiful and resounding lack of funding, both from the European Union and from the Member States, especially in the cross-border sections, which everyone considers to be no-man's-land."
"It is true that in those Member States that have succeeded in coordinating the two policies, there has been a multiplying effect that has fast-forwarded historically backward regions, towns and their citizens, including them in the cohesion that we all want to see."
"This is why, in order to achieve the major objective of reducing disparities and bringing regions and citizens closer to our area of prosperity and welfare through better channels of communication, we need to add a serious discussion to the post-2013 debate regarding the urgent need to guarantee sufficient funding for the trans-European networks once and for all."
"(PL) Mr President, cohesion policy covers and unites various wide-ranging developmental objectives, as well as the expectations not only of the regions, but also of various social groups."
"The achievements of cohesion policy and experiences gained from it show that it can and should be the policy which meets the new challenges contained in the 'Europe 2020' strategy."
"Accelerated economic growth does not always translate into a reduction in poverty."
"This is why the European Social Fund plays such an important role and why we need to coordinate the various political strategies."
"Job creation and an education and retraining system which is fit-for-purpose are becoming exceptionally important."
"Cohesion policy is the basis for implementing the sustainable development of urban agglomerations and rural areas, taking into account their specific character and possibilities."
"Proper coordination of the various political strategies will allow the Rural Development Fund and other funds to reduce any delays in development and to take into account the specific character of less developed areas, including rural areas."
"(PT) Cohesion policies are not just another instrument of European integration but can be seen as a real embodiment and dynamic proof of the European project itself, in the sense of a community of citizens sharing values of social justice and solidarity."
"In this context, we can understand the insistence that cohesion policies should be targeted at all the regions and that the eligibility criteria should be expanded beyond the current focus on per capita gross domestic product in order to make them fairer."
"Nonetheless, we must never lose sight of the primary and ultimate purpose of the cohesion policies, which is to achieve an equal standard of living for all Europeans, and that always means paying special attention to the poorest regions, such as some of the outermost regions, which effectively need measures specific to them."
"(RO) I would like to ask the European Commission to ensure that the European Union's future economic, social and territorial cohesion policy allocates large sums to the transport sector, especially for intermodality, and also to energy efficiency in residential buildings."
"I think that these investments will, on the one hand, create jobs at local and regional level, while also promoting economic well-being and development for small and medium-sized enterprises in these sectors."
"Last but not least, Commissioner Hahn, I hope that after 2013, we will have a separate financing line for the European Union's Danube region strategy."
"I should mention that the European Union's Baltic region strategy has EUR 20 million just for 2011."
"The European Union's Danube region strategy may become one of the European Union's most successful projects."
"(RO) The timing of today's debate on the cohesion policy after 2013 is just right if we also consider that the Open Days are taking place in Brussels."
"The fact that numerous participants from most of Europe's regions have come here to present their initiatives, efforts and results, as well as their dissatisfaction in a variety of areas of regional development, strengthens my view that the EU's cohesion policy delivers concrete results."
"One particular aspect being considered during the current programming period is how efficiently current funds are being used."
"We will have to focus on implementing measures aimed at increasing the level of absorption of the allocated funds, especially in those regions facing difficulties in this respect."
"This is why efforts must continue at European, national and regional level to simplify the implementation of the cohesion policy."
"A proper balance must definitely be maintained between simplifying procedures and ensuring efficiency and good financial management in order to produce a policy which is easy to implement with a raised profile."
"(GA) I do not have much time, Mr President."
"Therefore, I will focus on just a few points."
"Mr President, firstly, there can be no renationalisation of the ESF just as there can be no renationalisation of CAP."
"We need more, not less, Europe."
"Secondly, there is a dire need for simplification in the process of application."
"I have met groups who did not bother to apply, even though they are entitled to funding, because the application was so complicated."
"Some actually had to hire an expert to do the application for them."
"This is ridiculous and must stop."
"Thirdly, I think there is a need to keep both Objective 1 and Objective 2."
"I represented my group in Mannheim and I saw the benefits of Objective 2."
"I think that is important."
"Finally, I want to say that there is also a need - even though some of my colleagues in the EPP do not agree with me - to look at GDP as not being the exclusive criterion."
"It should certainly be the main criterion, but not the only one."
"I think that is a debate we need to have and I look forward to it."
"(PT) The European Social Fund (ESF) is probably the instrument that does the most to promote cohesion."
"It therefore needs to be closely coordinated with the Regional Development Fund."
"It is essential to take a local approach to the problems that need solving: in other words, global vision for local action."
"Local and regional authorities are the ones that know best what the situation is like on the ground, how much investment in job creation they need, and what the most suitable measures are to promote employment in their regions."
"We have to take account of the positive experiences of the regions."
"In the Azores, an outermost region where unemployment generally reaches record levels, the unemployment rate is now 6.5%, the lowest in Portugal."
"That is largely due to the forward-planning strategy used for employment, which sets out which factors to address and how to achieve the desired targets, and also to the use of the ESF as an operational instrument of this strategy, acting on education and training and furthering employment."
"Applying cohesion policy across the board is the only way to ensure the success of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"(PL) Mr President, cohesion policy or regional policy could be one of the key drivers of the European Union's development."
"This is a policy which is more citizen-friendly than most, which concentrates on practical aims and on solving practical, important problems."
"This is why we need to complete matters of territorial cohesion within the framework of cohesion policy."
"Road building, high-speed rail links and complete cohesion, which will increase mobility throughout Europe, are key issues."
"As far as the European Social Fund is concerned, it appears that we will be unable to implement the ambitious proposals of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"Today, one third of Europeans do not have vocational qualifications."
"I think that this fund, to a large extent, should today invest precisely in vocational training and lifelong learning, and should bring about an increase in the qualifications held by our European society."
"Moreover, this fund can be targeted not only at issues of social inclusion, but also at greater vocational mobility of European citizens."
"(SK) Regional development policy is a key element in the economic, social and territorial development of the European Union, and its systematic modernisation in response to new trends therefore deserves special attention and must be a priority for the European Union even after 2013."
"The wealth of experience from the past must lead to the elimination of repeated errors, to greater efficiency, and to the rapid and high quality implementation of the cohesion policy, as well as to a smoothly functioning partnership and greater transparency."
"I firmly believe that implementation of the cohesion policy must, in future, be more geared towards results and the quality of results, which requires better monitoring and evaluation of the efficiency of the programmes implementing regional policy and the cohesion policy, so that resources go into infrastructure, science and research, and the fight against unemployment - for companies and for citizens - so that the regions can develop and catch up with the best."
"(IT) Mr President, I should like to express my support for maintaining the European Social Fund's own budget and rules, albeit with a view to its greater integration with all the other Structural Funds."
"However, the rules need to be revised in at least five areas: we need more simplification and more monitoring of results and not just of procedures; we need to really make the most of experience such as that gained in the Italian regions over the last two years, to offer integrated packages of guidance, training, retraining and support to help integrate workers who have been made redundant or who are unemployed into SMEs; we need to promote training partnerships between educational training institutions, universities and businesses in order to provide opportunities for continuous training that take into account the need for new skills; we need more transnational projects, which, until now, have only been experimental; and we need more national and transnational work-study initiatives for young people."
"I believe that it is on the basis of these points, among others, that we need to reconsider the prospect of introducing new rules for the European Social Fund."
"Mr President, we are talking about cohesion and regional policy."
"As some of you may already know, there is a leaked document on the future of the common agricultural policy towards 2020, which also addresses the territorial challenges of the future."
"So there are links between all of our policies."
"In each of them, we want an adequately funded policy framework."
"I have a few points in relation to the resolution."
"We also need coherence in Member States."
"We have seen where Member State policies have undone the good work of cohesion and regional policy."
"This week, we met members of regional authorities who spoke about the huge level of frustration when they are trying to access funding."
"Their voice must be not just heard but listened to and responded to."
"I support this resolution."
"(HU) The European Union's cohesion and regional policies are extremely important, not only in order to increase competitiveness, but also to put the concept of a single Europe into practice."
"I think we all agree that a truly united Europe will only be built in the medium and long term if the levels of economic development are balanced across Europe."
"It is indispensable for the efficient implementation of the EU 2020 strategy and for reaching its objectives that regions with different levels of development all benefit from the process."
"This is why it is vital to keep cohesion policy funds available to less developed regions at their current level."
"We must prevent Europe splitting in two due to the deceleration of the catching-up process of Member States that joined the EU starting from 2004."
"(SK) In all of these strategies and frameworks, we must bear in mind the fundamental fact that Europe is not a project to construct an open-air museum."
"It is not a communist utopia where everyone works and everyone gets what they want."
"The European Social Fund is not a tool for implementing such ideas."
"It is a tool for assisting development but, first and foremost, it provides assistance to those who cannot help themselves."
"If people are struggling with employment, housing, food or health, we must help them - that is what solidarity means."
"It does not mean artificially created jobs which deform the labour market, and it does not mean the levelling out of social and regional differences, which smacks of egalitarianism."
"Unless we want to share the fate of Prince Potemkin, we should avoid using the word 'social' more often than the word 'responsible'."
"The global financial crisis is a warning for us against the unrealistic and the irresponsible."
"(CS) Mr President, I would like to express my thanks for today's presentation and for the subsequent fruitful discussion."
"It fills me with enormous optimism."
"The fact that there is agreement on the need for a cohesion policy is undoubtedly good news for everyone, and the fact that there is agreement within this Parliament is, of course, even better."
"I would like to thank the Commission for preparing to facilitate the drawdown of funds."
"I had the opportunity to review its proposal, and it is certainly a step in the right direction."
"Finally, I would like to note that cohesion has an absolute and a relative dimension."
"The absolute is what we all understand as support for the poorest regions, but the relative dimension, within individual states, is equally important."
"I am interceding in order to ensure that it is not forgotten."
"(DE) Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank Mr Hahn, the former Austrian Minister for Science and Research, for starting a new debate which will make a major contribution to promoting growth in Europe."
"If every small and medium-sized company in Europe were to create one additional job, we would have no more unemployment in Europe."
"Therefore, we should be thinking about how we can enable these small and medium-sized businesses to hire new employees and also to play a more active role on international export markets."
"However, the research and transport infrastructures are also important concerns."
"The Commission has major tasks ahead of it when it comes to restructuring the East-West connection, for example, from Paris to Budapest, or the North-South connection."
"New jobs, which are urgently needed in Europe at the moment, can be created in these areas."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, cohesion policy is the great pillar of European solidarity."
"It is through cohesion that we achieve the objective of reducing regional disparities and stimulate harmonious development throughout the European Union."
"We must establish a framework for the forthcoming 2014-2020 period that can enhance the effectiveness of regional policy."
"Good governance must be encouraged at all levels through the greater involvement and participation of regional and local bodies, with respect for the principle of subsidiarity, as laid down in the new Treaty of Lisbon."
"The special circumstances of the outermost regions must not be forgotten."
"This group of regions faces major challenges and must continue to benefit in future from special provisions regarding the implementation of European policies."
"Gross domestic product must remain the principal eligibility criterion, but we must take other indicators into account to provide a more complete picture of the regional situation."
"Mr President, this has been a very lively and committed debate."
"I would like to thank everyone involved."
"I would also like to remind everyone and to repeat and reinforce the fact that regional policy is an investment policy which covers all the regions."
"It should be regarded as an integrated policy, which is why it definitely focuses on cities."
"However, this is also because different policy areas are concentrated in the cities, including energy wastage, reducing energy consumption, energy use, transport and social problems."
"These are all factors which we need to look at in an overall context."
"We very much support the calls for a simplification of the rules."
"However, I would like to ask for your understanding in this area, because we also have to take into consideration taxpayers' requirements."
"Several speakers have referred today to the need to make the situation simpler, but we must do this by putting in place standardised rules for the different funds, as far as this is feasible and possible."
"I would like to thank you for the discussion and for the backing of Parliament."
"However, I would also like to call on you to make your voices heard at a national level, in order to enlist support for the causes you have spoken about today, so that regional policy remains at the heart of European policy in future."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, for me, too, this has been an extremely useful and helpful discussion about the future of cohesion policy and, within that, the future of the European Social Fund."
"I agree with everyone who stressed that this is a crucial financial instrument to support the Europe 2020 strategy and its three objectives: it is smart, sustainable and it involves inclusive growth."
"Within inclusive growth, we have to support both targets: to increase employment and reduce poverty."
"The two are interlinked, and we have to make the ESF capable of serving a wide range of objectives within a social agenda."
"It is clear that the discussion identified the major threats to cohesion policy, such as sectoralisation or nationalisation, or weakening the overall capacity by reducing the size of the envelope."
"We have to avoid these trajectories and identify the issues requiring further action."
"We have to ensure that there is innovation in terms of what the ESF funds, and in terms of how the ESF is funding these objectives."
"I am completely open to working with Members on particular issues such as simplification, improving evaluation, strengthening conditionality, exploring the opportunities of financial engineering and cooperating with other sources of finance, because the challenges are enormous."
"We are aware of the absorption problems, especially in Greece in a few years, and we are working hard with the services and with the Member State authorities to eliminate the obstacle to more rapid disbursement."
"It is in the common interest of the Commission and the Member States to make progress on that. But it is very clear and, together with Commissioner Hahn, I think we all agree that we have to ensure that there is a robust cohesion policy in the future, and my goal is also to ensure that within that, there is a strong and visible European Social Fund."
"I have received two motions for resolutionstabled in accordance with Rule 115(5) and Rule 110(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place shortly."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"By voting today, Thursday, 7 October 2010 on a resolution, the European Parliament is demanding that the Commission give thought to significantly improving cohesion policy instruments."
"Thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon, cohesion is no longer just economic and social; it is also territorial."
"Regional policy is one of the spearheads of European integration."
"It is the second heading in the Union's budget, after the common agricultural policy."
"Europe needs to adopt an integrated strategy for the development of its regions."
"The development of cross-border transport links is one of the major challenges of this policy."
"One of the priorities in this area is the route across the Pyrenees between France and Spain, which specifically concerns the European constituency of the South West."
"At the moment, the road and rail links do not meet expectations."
"Some regions, although linked from a socio-economic point of view, do not today enjoy adequate means of communication."
"The various projects that the Commission is due to carry forward in this geographical area will be carried out in the medium and long terms."
"They therefore deserve to be included in the discussion on cohesion policy after 2013."
"In the current economic and social crisis, the European Social Fund (ESF) is one of the principal European Union financial instruments for combating mass unemployment as well as poverty and social exclusion."
"Moreover, this fund plays a significant role in the areas of the education of workers, lifelong vocational training, the improvement of work opportunities and the integration of workers into the labour market."
"I agree that in order to achieve the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, especially in the areas of employment and social affairs, we must strengthen the ESF and increase its effectiveness, while improving this fund's financing procedures."
"Currently, this fund's financing system is far too complicated and therefore, it is very important for the Commission to simplify the financing procedures for the structural funds and make them more flexible, because only this will enable Member States to use money allocated from the ESF as effectively and efficiently as possible for the creation of new and better jobs."
"In terms of financing from the structural funds, we must not forget transparency and the strengthening of control over money earmarked for aid."
"Furthermore, I call on the Commission to distribute ESF money in an even more effective and targeted manner in future and to take all possible measures to ensure that EU money goes directly to people experiencing poverty, who need that aid the most."
"Only a more effective and stronger fund can contribute to reducing unemployment and poverty in Europe in the future."
"I consider the resolution submitted on the basis of the oral question to be important in many respects."
"It is certainly worth mentioning that the common position presented in the draft resolution emphasises the call based on experience from the current programming period for the structure of the cohesion policy for the period after 2013 to be simple, fair, and transparent."
"I consider GDP to be the main criterion for determining eligibility for assistance within the framework of regional policy."
"It is possible, however, to discuss the addition of other measurable indicators for determining eligibility for assistance within the framework of regional policy, insofar as their significance can be proven."
"At the same time, I consider it important to maintain the European Social Fund as part of the regulation on general provisions relating to financial resources within the framework of the cohesion policy."
"We need to emphasise that this fund should have its own rules."
"In the formation of regional policy and cohesion policy after 2013, I consider it absolutely necessary to coordinate these policies in the area of rural development with the other pillar of the common agricultural policy, so that the two policies do not work at cross purposes and lead to mutually contradictory goals."
"The Structural Funds contribute to hundreds of economic, social and cultural projects in every region of Europe, with action taken as close as possible to the citizens."
"Their role in the success of the EU 2020 strategy is crucial."
"Like the vast majority of my colleagues in the Committee on Regional Development, I feel it is imperative to guarantee for the future a strong and well-financed cohesion policy that is aimed at all European regions."
"Last year, it was rumoured that the European Commission might be planning a partial renationalisation of the Structural Funds."
"That is unacceptable."
"I shall fight to safeguard the European added value of cohesion policy at regional level."
"Some people would also like to concentrate the Structural Funds even further on the poorest regions."
"This is madness: cohesion policy is not meant to be a policy of handouts; the so-called rich regions also experience many social and economic structural problems."
"Cohesion requires solidarity between all regions."
"It would be worth examining the relevance of the criteria used to assess eligibility for the Structural Funds."
"While GDP must remain the main criterion, the Commission should also look at other indicators that might better account for regional difficulties."
"We all know that the European Social Fund is the main financial instrument available to the European Union for supporting Member States' employment policies."
"We are currently facing a crisis scenario at EU level and Member States have different capabilities for managing the situations triggered by the economic and financial crisis."
"I welcome the intention behind the 'European Platform to combat poverty' of ensuring economic, social and territorial cohesion which will benefit from suitable financial support."
"However, I think that support from the European Social Fund must be based on solidarity."
"The future European Social Fund must support regions' efforts to train human resources so that they are able to comply with their development guidelines at the lowest possible labour costs."
", in writing. - During its history, the ESF has always adapted to the current economic priorities of the EU."
"It is evident that the ESF has to adapt itself again, because circumstances have changed."
"It has to be adapted to the EU 2020 strategy, where raising employment is a key goal."
"It has to adapt to the crisis."
"The ESF is not a crisis management tool per se, but now it has to function during a period of crisis."
"We should not forget that, even when macro-economic crises are over, employment levels may remain low."
"Unemployment has risen in Europe."
"Some European countries are forced to introduce budget cuts, which threaten jobs, especially in the public sector."
"The majority of public workers are women."
"Therefore, public sector lay-offs threaten women in the first instance."
"Enhancing women's labour market participation is a key goal for EU 2020 and for all reasonable political decision makers - women's participation is particularly important in order to protect and reshape our social model."
"Therefore, we should help those who lose their jobs due to budget cuts."
"Some countries would favour the ESF being nationalised to some extent in the next budget. But I strongly believe that the European Social Fund has to remain an integral part of EU policies."
"When we talk about the future of the cohesion policy and particularly about the objectives, priorities and structure of the policy, we must mention the EU-wide integration of EU and regional energy markets and the strategic infrastructural network promoting the use of renewable energy sources, because urban and rural development projects financed from structural funds constitute a very important part of EU energy investments."
"These include district heating investments, certain energy efficiency projects and local and regional energy network development projects."
"We must improve the future use of existing EU funds in a way that supports energy efficiency measures, and encourage a wider use of structural funds and Cohesion Fund sources for this purpose."
"As regards energy policy, the funds used for research, development and demonstrations should be doubled by 2020 compared to the current level."
"This should include a significant increase in funds allocated to renewable energy, smart grids and energy efficiency."
"One instrument that could help achieve this objective is the European Union's post-2013 cohesion and regional policy."
"in writing. - It will be crucial to link and accommodate the EU future cohesion policy to the EU 2020 strategy, because only this link can provide for sustainable economic growth, competitiveness and the creation of new jobs."
"At the same time, we should not allow the cohesion policy to be fragmented."
"EU 2020 will be an important component of the future cohesion policy; however, it cannot become its substitute."
"A radical simplification of the rules of financing is badly needed in order to make EU funds better available at the local and NGO level."
"These levels offer the best potential for a meaningful and well-targeted use of EU means."
"At this point, the often excessive bureaucratic accountability takes more time and energy than goes to the real working out of the projects."
"Such an imbalance is an increasingly serious practical and moral obstacle for further progress."
"When preparing the framework for the next financial period, it will be important to engage in time the representatives of the regions and the business sector."
"Their experience and practical sense should be seen as a valuable contribution in efficiently implementing the future regional policy and in obtaining additional resources."
"The draft motion for a resolution of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is correct in highlighting the importance of supporting SMEs and creating synergies between the structural funds, because while the European Social Fund is a success story, errors are still made and it continues to struggle with many problems, especially during the financial and economic crisis."
"Moreover, the opportunities provided by and the positive effects of the European Economic Recovery Plan will also decrease in the future."
"Under the plan, the provisions of the General Block Exemption Regulation (Regulation (EC) No 800/2008) had previously allowed Member States to provide, on a temporary basis, additional subsidies and compensation for the employment of people with disabilities, subject to a number of conditions."
"As regards the simplification proposed for the ESF, it is not the issues related to the management of the fund that should be the main focus."
"Instead, the priority should be to make sure that synergy (cross-subsidies and eligibility) is actually achieved in the course of planning and implementation by Member States."
"Furthermore, the continued increase in the number of experts without useful qualifications should be curtailed, because unemployment in disadvantaged groups should be reduced."
"At the same time, experts' networks and professional cooperation should be strengthened."
"One framework for achieving this could be the development of cross-border cooperation based on intra-regional connections."
"Last but not least, let me comment on what Commissioners Hahn and Andor said: issues of urbanisation and sustainability should be given more attention as well."
"The reduction of burdens on families and of the disproportionate distribution of tasks within society which makes it difficult to start a family, as well as improving accessibility, are essential in reaching and ensuring a more active and healthier old age."
"The cohesion policy is vital to the European integration process."
"We need a uniform EU-level regional policy which will bring about sustainable growth, job creation and modernisation across the whole European Union."
"We will successfully achieve our objectives only through viable synergy between all the European policies and by means of suitable budgetary instruments."
"The regional aspect must be fully considered as part of the proposed EU budget review and in the future financial framework."
"The cohesion policy after 2013 will need to provide an easy, transparent transition, based on a suitable quantifiable assessment of past experience and a proper evaluation of the specific economic and social features of the regions involved, thereby also ensuring tangible progress for them."
"GDP must remain the main criterion for determining eligibility for assistance under the regional policy."
"However, other indicators must also be accepted after carrying out an extensive evaluation proving their viability."
"The principle of subsidiarity, multi-level governance, strategic planning and simplified implementation of the regional policy must be linked effectively in order to achieve an ideal balance between quality, performance and financial control."
"I should like to say a few words."
"Those who are well informed know that debates on the future shape of this policy are now starting to become more intense."
"Sometimes, the question is even raised as to whether this policy should exist at all."
"The cohesion policy has its supporters, but also its critics."
"I would like to mention the fundamental idea behind the creation of the cohesion policy in 1974 - the principle of solidarity between the economically more advanced and the economically weaker areas."
"In the EU, significant differences remain, and until they are evened out, the problem-free implementation of the idea of free movement of services or capital is unthinkable."
"There are a number of expert studies showing that the cohesion policy functions in principle, and creates the desired added value, and I therefore see critical voices more as a warning against procedural failures and a call for improvement in the future."
"We know that the situation has changed since 1974 and that the cohesion policy is now an important instrument for the development of European regions and towns."
"This is also a strong argument for it to continue and to encompass the entire territory of the EU."
"It is necessary to have a discussion on the level of support in different regions, which will result from negotiations between the Council and Parliament."
"I trust that the Commission will come forward with good proposals."
"I would like to express my firm belief that with the right set-up, the critics will fall silent and will defend the existence of the cohesion policy for all EU citizens."
"I am grateful to Mrs Hübner for her responsible work."
"All the issues included in the resolution are of current concern to Latvia."
"Unfortunately, in the cohesion policy programme, Latvia is represented by a single region."
"By contrast, Poland, for example, consists of 16 regions."
"In this connection, blatant violations are taking place in the application of EU structural funds in Latvia."
"I have received many reports that far from promoting the application of EU funds, officials in the Latvian Ministry of Economics and the Ministry of Regional Development are impeding this process by demanding illegal payments from ordinary people in Latvia."
"The application of funds is not helped either by the fact that Latvia counts as one region."
"This gives politically committed forces the opportunity to 'put a brake on' projects in those local authorities where their political parties are not represented."
"By the same token, they give the green light to those who are included in their tight circle of corruption."
"All of this gives no opportunity for a region such as Latgale to make full use of the funds earmarked for the implementation of cohesion policy."
"A general review of the application and effectiveness of EU structural funds in Latvia needs to be carried out urgently."
"I am prepared to play an active part in such a review."
"Despite assurances from the Commission and the Council, Cohesion Policy is at risk because the size of its budget is making some people envious."
"This policy, which promotes the balanced development of Europe's regions, accounts for one third of Community expenditure between 2007 and 2013."
"It is important to remember some of its principles: Cohesion Policy should continue to be a Community policy, retain substantial financing, ensure decentralised management of funds and multi-level governance, and retain an overall and integrated approach in order to meet the complex challenges which all European regions have to face."
"Although GDP should remain the main criterion in determining the eligibility of regions for European grants, it has been a struggle to get an ongoing consultation on other criteria."
"With its humanist tradition, Europe should remain at the forefront of the debate on new ways to assess our fellow citizens' wealth and well-being."
"Finally, territorial cooperation deserves particular attention in the next Cohesion Policy."
"This objective is the embodiment of Europe in the everyday lives of our fellow citizens and makes an 'ever closer union among the peoples of Europe' possible."
"European regional policy after 2013 must cover all the regions, while being sufficiently flexible to take into account regional and territorial differences."
"In order to exploit fully the potential for growth of the regions and to achieve economic, social and territorial cohesion in the European Union, it is essential for us to focus on the goal of competitiveness, as well as on cohesion."
"In particular, we must take into consideration small-scale problems in wealthy Member States."
"We must also pay particular attention to the needs of mountain areas, as we plan and implement structural measures."
"The specific geographic features of these areas give rise to particular problems which must be reflected in coordinated strategies and measures."
"Alongside the urban dimension, the development of rural areas under the umbrella of regional policy is particularly important."
"By coordinating sectoral and territorial measures, we can maximise synergies and avoid possible conflicts."

"2008 discharge: European Police College ("
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following on from the unanimous vote in the Committee on Budgetary Control, the decision to refuse to grant discharge that has been submitted to you today is vitally important for our institution."
"Firstly, I am keen to remind you of the professionalism and the efforts made by the other regulatory agencies to comply with standards of good administration."
"These efforts should not be tainted by the bad example set by the European Police College (CEPOL)."
"That is why Parliament must assume its responsibilities as a discharge authority and refuse to grant CEPOL discharge for the financial year 2008 in the circumstances of which we are aware."
"Thus, Parliament cannot accept the serious managerial failings of the former director, and, what is more, it cannot condone the fact that the management board has not assumed its responsibilities by adopting the necessary measures."
"Finally, given that the College has been experiencing major difficulties since 2006 and that progress will not be seen until 2014, it is no longer acceptable for the College to need at least nine years to reach an adequate level of good administration."

"Formal sitting - 20th anniversary of German reunification"
"Dear colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, let me, on your behalf, welcome to the European Parliament all our honoured guests."
"Thank you for coming."
"Many of us remember - some of us who are very young will know it from history - the reunification of Germany 20 years ago."
"Four great world leaders were there: the President of the United States, George Bush senior, the leader of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Margaret Thatcher and the President of France, François Mitterrand, and, of course, the foreign ministers of the four countries, negotiating the reunification treaty."
"One of the foreign ministers is today with us."
"I am very glad to welcome to the European Parliament Mr Roland Dumas."
"We are very glad to see you."
"We also greet both German leaders at that time: the Chancellor of West Germany, Helmut Kohl and the Prime Minister of East Germany, Lothar de Maizière."
"Welcome to the European Parliament, 20 years later."
"The European institutions played a very important role in German reunification."
"I should also like to say on behalf of all of us: welcome home, Enrique Barón Crespo, former President of the European Parliament."
"Enrique, it is your home!"
"Thank you for coming."
"And last, but certainly not least, the President of the European Commission in those times, President Jacques Delors."
"We are very glad to see you."
"We are very grateful and we remember very well your speeches from those times."
"You were a great supporter of German unity and it was very important for all of us."
"There would be no reunification of Europe without the reunification of Germany."
"Those days were momentous for our continent and we can be proud of it and we will forever remember those days."
"(The House accorded the speaker a standing ovation)"
"Mr President, Mr Delors, ladies and gentlemen, as I look around, I can spot many well-known and familiar faces here and I am very pleased to see all of you again."
"It is a great honour for me to be able to speak to you on this occasion today in the European Parliament."
"This makes it clear that the reunification of Germany was by no means just a national matter, but also a fundamental European issue."
"I could even say that by unifying Germany, we have put an end to the misguided nationalism of the European peoples."
"Therefore, I want to use the opportunity presented by this anniversary and my speech to call on all the people of Europe to strive to achieve all of the things that unite us."
"Today, 7 October, is an appropriate day for this occasion because it marks the founding of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) 61 years ago."
"For 40 years, the Day of the Republic was celebrated lavishly and even ostentatiously on 7 October."
"However, I became Prime Minister in order to abolish the GDR and to lead the East Germans into unity."
"At no point did we have the opportunity to resolve the open German question except in the context of European unity."
"The European Union, based on the foundations of the Treaty of Rome, has shown that the countries of Europe have learnt the right lessons from the horrors of two world wars."
"In 1957, Chancellor Konrad Adenauer ensured that the treaties enshrined the full membership of the East Germans in the case of reunification."
"This turned the intention behind the preamble to the German constitution, which refers to acting on behalf of those who have been prevented from participating, into a practical policy."
"As a result, the German question always remained on the agenda, because it was also one of the keys to overcoming the division of Europe."
"The two things are inextricably linked: the war which was started and lost by Germany and the Iron Curtain which divided Europe."
"One particularly tragic aspect of this was that those people who were particularly hard hit by the Iron Curtain were the same people who had suffered most under National Socialism."
"Neither the uprisings in East Berlin in 1953 and in Poland and Hungary in 1956, nor the Prague Spring of 1968, succeeded in seriously shaking the foundations of communist rule."
"However, from this moment on, many people across the Eastern bloc states knew that the system that we lived under could not be reformed, but only overcome."
"This insight represented a bleak hope which we continued to cherish in the face of difficult circumstances and the behaviour of those in power, but which most people, including me, believed would not be fulfilled in their lifetimes."
"Freedom had no voice."
"It was a time of oppressive silence and paralysis."
"However, all of this changed in October 1978 with the election of a Polish cardinal as Pope."
"His faith and his words alone unsettled the intolerant regimes."
"Firstly, the Polish people and then the whole world realised that this man said what he believed and believed what he said."
"John Paul II was the first conspicuous sign of the winds of change which would blow across Europe from then on and which, in 1989, would become a storm of upheaval."
"(Loud applause)"
"The strikes in Danzig in 1980 and the founding of the first free trade union in the Eastern bloc made it clear that a process had been started that could no longer be stopped."
"The decisive factor in all of this is that none of the peoples were fighting just for themselves."
"Anyone who called communism into question was doing so on behalf of everyone."
"Perhaps that is an ironic result of internationalism."
"Tadeusz Mazowiecki and Lech Wałęsa not only changed their own world, but also ours."
"We Germans have a great deal to thank the Polish people for."
"(Loud applause)"
"Today, we should also remember the names of other figures who were representative of many people."
"I will only mention Andrei Sakharov and Václav Havel, who had already pulled stones out of the wall in Berlin long before it actually fell in 1989."
"(Applause)"
"I would also like once again to emphasise our respect and gratitude towards Hungary which was the first country to be brave enough to open its borders."
"(Applause)"
"It was a time when people acted on behalf of one another, because of their longing for freedom."
"This upheaval was a genuine joint effort and its most important result should and must be a lasting European community."
"Therefore, we should see these experiences as a challenge to search in Europe from now on for the things which unite us."
"(Applause)"
"I will not forget how John Paul II in his speech at the Brandenburg Gate in 1996 said, looking back, that people had been separated from one another by walls and lethal borders."
"In this situation, the Brandenburg Gate in November 1989 bore witness to the fact that people were shaking off and destroying the yoke of oppression."
"The closed Brandenburg Gate stood as a symbol of separation."
"When it was finally opened, it became a symbol of unity and a sign of the fact that the call in the German constitution for the completion of the unity of Germany had been achieved in freedom."
"Now, people could rightly say that the Brandenburg Gate had become the gate of freedom."
"I would like to add to what he said, if I may do so as a Protestant from Brandenburg and a descendant of the Huguenots, that with the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Brandenburg Gate has become a symbol of European unity."
"We Germans would not be doing justice to our national unity if we did not see it as a contribution to the unity of Europe, following the historical events which I have outlined here."
"(Applause)"
"The first and the only free elections to the East German Volkskammer on 18 March 1990 resulted in a parliament which represented a true cross-section of the population and expressed the vitality and persuasive power of democracy as a form of government."
"A total of 93.4% of the electorate turned out to vote in the elections."
"I believe that this is a record which will not be matched in the near future."
"No one was left untouched by these elections."
"History will see them as astonishing proof of the fact that we East Germans, after liberating ourselves in the autumn of 1989, succeeded in introducing democracy to our country in the spring of 1990."
"The people of the GDR acted confidently and responsibly and did justice to their newly acquired freedom."
"Democracy and freedom are not simply abstract concepts."
"They permeate and define all aspects of our lives."
"On the 20th anniversary of these elections to the Volkskammer, I said in the Reichstag, and I would like to reinforce this once again here, how important it was that the Volkskammer immediately made it clear to all our neighbours that the changes in the GDR and the reunification of Germany were not a cause for concern."
"The parliament immediately, and of its own free will, admitted responsibility for the whole of German history."
"It bowed its head before the victims and guaranteed our Polish neighbours secure borders."
"It also asked for forgiveness for the GDR's involvement in crushing the Prague Spring."
"It did all of this before choosing a new government, because the new era after the end of the Cold War was to be a time of reconciliation, peace and community."
"This admission of responsibility alone represented the beginning of the work of the only freely elected East German Parliament."
"Everything that followed was linked to this admission and was the consequence of it, so to speak."
"This admission remains valid even now that the GDR has come to an end and it represents an obligation to search in everything we do for those things which unite us in Europe."
"The East German Parliament gave me the responsibility of putting in place the process which would bring about the unity of the two states."
"I would like to emphasise that all of us at that time were only able to achieve those things that had long since become clear as a result of the people's enthusiasm for unity."
"The elections on 18 March 1990 were also a plebiscite on the German question."
"However, we still had to devote ourselves to drawing up treaties and putting in place regulations covering an almost endless number of problems."
"All areas of society were subjected to fundamental change."
"The German states were reintroduced, the separation of powers was re-established, the state under the rule of law was restored and education, the police and the administrative bodies were all democratised."
"One decisive factor was the reintroduction of local self-government which went back to Stein and Hardenberg's reform of Prussia and which allowed the people to take part in free local elections on 6 May 1990."
"We also drew up the major national treaties on the economic, currency and social union, the treaty of unification and, finally, the 2+4 treaty with the Allied powers - I am very pleased to see Roland Dumas here - which we signed in Moscow on 12 December."
"(Applause)"
"In those six months, we achieved a huge amount and we are justified in referring to this as the most hardworking parliament in our history."
"I remain grateful to this day for the fact that all our partners were highly committed comrades-in-arms."
"There are so many names which I could refer to at this point, but I would just like to mention Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev and George Bush senior."
"The speech about a common European house was one of the main starting points for Gorbachev's policy of glasnost and perestroika."
"It finally opened a door to unity for the Germans."
"For this reason, we should never forget that Russia is an important part of this European house and that our partnership with Russia is essential to our survival."
"(Applause)"
"On the basis of the Atlantic Alliance, George Bush provided special protection for our right to self-determination."
"I would also like to mention the name of Jacques Delors, who achieved a great deal as President of the European Commission and who provided us with indispensable help in the process of bringing about German unity."
"He was a true friend to the people of Germany."
"Many thanks!"
"(Applause)"
"I remain certain that the reunification of Germany would not have received such broad acceptance and cooperation if it had not been supported in the old Federal Republic by Helmut Kohl, who is undisputedly a very great European."
"(Applause)"
"Two important things came together here."
"In an unrivalled act of self-liberation by peaceful means, the East Germans overthrew an oppressive regime and brought down the wall."
"Through democratic elections, they succeeded in bringing about fundamental change."
"With heads held high, the East Germans said 'We are the people' and then, a few weeks later, 'We are one people'."
"Those who achieved so much in such a short time should be full of self-confidence and pride."
"They have every reason to believe that they can withstand what we are now referring to as a crisis and that they will emerge stronger from every crisis."
"We have experience of transformation."
"(Applause)"
"On the other hand, we have also realised that we are part of this great community of European peoples and part of the Atlantic Alliance."
"Other states and peoples have also defended our freedom and have done everything in their power to help us to achieve unity."
"Therefore, it is important for us to remind ourselves and future generations that we Germans were ourselves responsible for the defeat and division of our country."
"We have our friends, neighbours and partners to thank for our unity and freedom."
"(Applause)"
"However, reunification did not just create the Germany that we know today."
"It also, of course, brought about fundamental changes in the old Federal Republic and throughout Europe."
"This process of change is continuing undiminished."
"Our people and our country were able to stop running round in circles over the German question."
"Instead, they could seriously dedicate their efforts to achieving the other great objective which is embodied in the German constitution and that is, promoting peace throughout the world by acting as an equal member of a united Europe."
"Now we want to be, and we are in a position to be, the driving force behind European unity and a guarantor of peace in the world, because we have achieved our unity peacefully, in cooperation with our neighbours, and we largely owe it to those neighbours."
"However, above all, we see this task as a valuable service provided by our country."
"This will allow us to put something into practice externally which internally represents the decisive content of democracy."
"Democracy is much less a type of state and much more a genuine service offered by everyone to the community and for the common good."
"More than any other type of regime, democracy calls for everyone to take action and to become involved."
"The same applies to the social market economy, which is more than just an economic system."
"It requires and encourages a sense of responsibility among all citizens."
"It puts the common good before self-interest and it uses property in the service of the community, without which it cannot be guaranteed."
"In one way or another, we must keep saying to ourselves that the important issue is to replace division with participation in our country and in Europe."
"However, participation does not mean that everyone is given something."
"Instead it means that everyone can contribute something and needs to participate."
"I am increasingly concerned about the growing contempt for the rights which form the foundation for our freedom."
"The authenticity and the power of democracy come solely from the attitude of the citizens."
"This concept of citizenship is what allows us to live together as a community and encourages us always to search for those things which unite us."
"We are part of a community of peoples who guarantee the rights of citizens, strive for peace and prosperity and want to live in peace."
"In my opinion, the continent on which we live will have a positive future if it can find the centre point of these values of justice, democracy, peace and freedom and if it can find the unity which we lost after the Second World War."
"We spoke about the Western alliance, the Eastern bloc and the East-West conflict; we had East and West Berlin; our world was divided into East and West, but it no longer had a centre."
"An honest search for the things which unite us is also a search for our centre."
"Sometimes, it almost makes me feel irritated that all the things which we went without in East Germany and which we longed for over many years are now taken for granted and go almost unnoticed."
"I am thinking of freedom of travel, of speech, of trade, of the press and of religion."
"I am thinking of the right to free and fair elections with a secret ballot and the right to codetermination."
"People nowadays take all of this so much for granted that they hardly notice it any more."
"There is always a risk that no attention will be paid to these things and that they will not be valued."
"Sometimes I feel disturbed when I remember how often people tend to gamble away what they have achieved, because they take it for granted and no longer appreciate it."
"They also make too little effort to expand their achievements."
"(Applause)"
"We are often faced with difficult tasks."
"Now that we have enlarged the European Union, we also need to give it more depth."
"However, these tasks are still much more appealing than a relapse into conflict."
"It is so much better to work together to overcome crises and resolve problems than to face them alone."
"(Applause)"
"The greatest disaster for the peoples of Europe would be a return to a lack of unity."
"For this reason, and in particular on a day like today, let us search for all the things that unite us."
"The rights and the freedoms which I have referred to form the heart and the centre of our society and of the European Union and our community of values."
"These are the things which unite us."
"From this centre comes the decisive and perhaps the only important duty which is imposed on us as citizens of Europe."
"We should be prepared to defend these rights and freedoms."
"The defence of freedom lies at the heart of Europe."
"(Applause)"
"We have learned that freedom is indivisible."
"It is not possible for one part of a people to be free while the other part lives under an oppressive system, as was the case for us in Germany."
"The fall of the Berlin Wall and of the Iron Curtain in Europe has not only freed the East Germans and almost all the people of Eastern and Central Europe."
"It has also made the freedom of the whole of Europe complete."
"For this reason, the peoples of Europe can only find the things that are their own in the truest sense of the word within the community."
"We must preserve freedom within our community in order to ensure ourselves a positive future."
"The last century, with its climaxes and terrible low points, has taught us one thing."
"History is not a mysterious destiny that is visited on peoples."
"History is simply the things which people do."
"However, it is more difficult to influence people's actions by calling on them to change than it is by setting them a good example."
"Those things which apply to individuals also apply to members of parliament, governments and entire peoples."
"We cannot demand that our citizens take a freedom-loving, democratic approach to life."
"We have to set them an example."
"Therefore, I am asking you for just one thing today and I am making an urgent call to the peoples of Europe: Let us search for, promote and defend the things which unite us in everything we do."
"I am grateful that I was permitted to take on responsibility and that as a citizen I am, of course, still responsible for Brandenburg, which is my home, for a united Germany, the fatherland that I love, and for Europe, whose unity will determine our fate and our future."
"Thank you very much."
"(Loud, sustained applause)"
"As you have shown, Mr de Maizière, our reunification - the reunification of Germany - started even earlier because we changed our attitude, our approach to our common European history and our common European future."
"But the most exciting moment was, of course, on 3 October 1990."
"You will have realised that I did not welcome to the European Parliament former President of the European Parliament, Hans-Gert Pöttering, because Hans-Gert, you are one of us."
"You sit here every day and work with us, but we are very glad that we are sitting in your honourable place among us."
"Now we have our second honoured speaker, Jacques Delors."
"First, he was appointed as an advisor to the Prime Minister of France, Jacques Chaban-Delmas."
"Later, for two and a half years, he was a Member of the European Parliament."
"Probably not all of us remember that."
"Later, he was also a Minister of Economy and Finance."
"He had two terms in office as President of the European Commission."
"He led the single market project and was a key player in the preparation and implementation of the Maastricht Treaty, which was very important for the whole European Union."
"He was the founder and the President of the think tank Notre Europe, and some other initiatives."
"(Applause)"
"former President of the European Commission. - (FR) Mr President, Mr de Maizière, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, Excellencies, Members of the European Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, barely a year elapsed between the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany."
"During the whole of 1989, the peoples of Europe expressed themselves: in Poland, the events that had begun with the Gdańsk strikes in the summer of 1980 led to the Belvedere Agreements between February and April 1989, followed by the first free elections on 4 June 1989; in Czechoslovakia, the people commemorated Jan Palach's sacrifice by fire; in Hungary, they marked the solemn funeral of Imre Nagy, at last rehabilitated; in Bulgaria, President Zhivkov was forced to stand down; and, of course, in East Germany, increasing numbers of people took part in peaceful demonstrations."
"The people's demands were gaining strength and, on 2 May 1989, the opening of the border between Hungary and Austria enabled some East Germans to cross over to the West."
"We therefore witnessed a moment in time when history accelerated, and we must admit that it took us all by surprise."
"Some of us knew intuitively that there were growing imbalances in the communist countries, but no one could have known that the lid would blow off so fast."
"1989 was a year of profound change in many parts of the world, with, as I recall, the fall of the Pinochet dictatorship in Chile and the Tiananmen uprising in China."
"To come back to Europe, the events of 1989 could, at any moment, have triggered brutal repression or resulted in bloody conflict, leading to a period of prolonged instability and threats to peace."
"This did not happen."
"This is the second lesson, after the one learned from the popular uprising."
"We, who have lived through these events, must bear witness to them."
"Indeed, new generations must be taught about the events of that period, since they did not experience them first-hand."
"Today, they live in prosperity and peace, while seeing the tensions and revolts that are shaking the world from afar."
"Therefore, the only images of violence and hatred they see are through the prism of the media."
"Yet they must store in their memories the all-important fact that it was thanks to the wisdom of a number of world leaders in the years 1989 and 1990 that Europeans were able to live through a transition that was admittedly emotional, but free of any significant bloodshed and dangerous contamination."
"(Applause)"
"I will not name all those leaders - Mr de Maizière has already done so - whose calm under pressure and whose wisdom I have just lauded, for fear of forgetting someone, offending sensibilities, or being misunderstood."
"Some of them, I should add, have unfortunately suffered the ingratitude of their peoples and their successors."
"History, I am sure, will correct these errors and omissions and will shine the light of truth on these events."
"However, let us return for a moment to the shock of the fall of the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989."
"Even before politicians and diplomats had time to catch their breath, the European Community had to respond, if only in terms of the provisions of the Treaty of Rome to which Mr de Maizière has referred."
"On 11 November, having convened an urgent meeting of the members of the European Commission, I was interviewed on German television and I asserted that the East Germans were free to choose, and that there was a place for them in the European Community."
"I added, and I quote: 'We are a great community within which we shall together build our destiny to better harness history in the interest of all.'"
"At the time, it was not possible to say more."
"It was my duty to send a message of welcome and hope to our East German friends."
"At the same time, I tried to allay the fears and anxieties felt by many people."
"From that moment on, many meetings were held between leaders across the world, between the United States and the Soviet Union, between the latter and the Europeans, and between East and West Germany and the four allied powers of World War Two, the 'Two-plus-Four' Process."
"Meanwhile, progress was being made in the negotiations between the Federal Republic of Germany and representatives of the German Democratic Republic, and primarily between Mr de Maizière and Chancellor Kohl."
"This raised many questions, it should be said, within the European Community in light of this radically shifting political landscape."
"However, the European Community could ultimately only approve and support reunification of the two Germanies, which it did at the European Council meeting held on 24 April 1990 in Dublin."
"In acting in this way, and in taking note of the assurances given with regard to the lasting and fair nature of the arrangements made in the 'Two-plus-Four' Process, the Community remained true to the values for which it stands: peace, mutual understanding between peoples, and solidarity, especially with all Germans in the East and in the West."
"Moreover, I cannot help but think that throughout the dark years, the Community's very existence, and not just its material prosperity, always stood as a reference point and a beacon for the peoples living under the communist yoke."
"Indeed, let me just remind you: the Community was moving in concert with these events."
"As early as July 1989 - as Mr Dumas will remember, as he was one of the people involved - even before the fall of the Wall, the Commission had persuaded the G7 to adopt a plan to help the countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"The spirit of openness and a favourable predisposition towards enlargement had already been formally confirmed."
"Nevertheless, after the fall of the Wall, the German question, it has to be said, was a major concern."
"What path would reunited Germany choose?"
"On 19 November 1989, on the initiative of Mr Mitterrand, an extraordinary European Council met to pave the way for regular consultations between the two Germanies and their partners."
"A long presentation by Chancellor Kohl summed up the situation which, of course, was still necessarily in flux."
"History had begun on its accelerated course."
"The European Parliament was also very active and attentive during this time."
"Its debates reflected the questions being asked about the future of Germany and the risk, feared by many MEPs, of a slowdown in the European integration process, after the boost given by the Single European Act of 1987."
"On 28 November 1989, Parliament adopted a very important resolution affirming, and I quote: 'All European peoples, including the Polish people, have, in accordance with the Helsinki Final Act, the right to live within secure borders as currently defined.'"
"In this way, the European Parliament referred to one of the most difficult debates, which was resolved by maintaining the Oder-Neisse border."
"On 17 January 1990, I stood before the European Parliament as President of the European Commission and stated that, and I quote: 'East Germany is a separate case."
"It belongs within the Community, if that is what it wants.'"
"This prospect led your Parliament to set up a temporary commission to study the impact of the German reunification process on the European Community."
"That commission, which was composed, I must stress, of highly experienced individuals including several ministers for foreign affairs, effectively dispelled doubts about the integration of the East German Länder, and paved the way for it."
"This is a useful reminder for sceptics of all persuasions that, thanks to the European Parliament, the concept of a pluralist and living democracy is not a vain hope but a reality."
"The commission demonstrated it on that occasion."
"(Applause)"
"All things considered, we should not underestimate the achievements and influence of European integration, regardless of the obstacles standing in its way."
"Of course, I will not attempt to single out the most important facts and ideas that were able to influence this great liberation movement."
"Undoubtedly what comes first is the people's ability to stand up to oppression, to express their thirst for freedom, and to quietly display their courage."
"However, it would be remiss of me not to recall the appeals made by John Paul II, and particularly his call made to the Polish people at a critical juncture: 'Have no fear!'"
"Nor can I forget West Germany's firm but open and generous policy towards the GDR during the years leading up to the fall of the Wall."
"Freedom triumphed, but with freedom come obligations."
"The treaty on the reunification of Germany presented two challenges."
"The first was for the people of West and East Germany to understand each other."
"This was met with great presence of mind, understanding and generosity."
"The second was economic and social, and equally difficult to meet."
"It required a tremendous effort in the form of massive annual transfers, from the West to the East, of resources amounting to 4-5% of West Germany's national product, or, ladies and gentlemen, EUR 1 400 billion over 20 years."
"This is without mentioning the other contributions in the form of technical assistance, which was required to restructure the East German economy."
"A single figure illustrates the scale of this achievement: over a twenty-year period, per capita income in the GDR went from 40% to 73% of the West Germans' income."
"The effort will continue over the years to come thanks to the ongoing payment of the solidarity tax - if I am not mistaken, it will continue until 2019."
"The Germans themselves agree to this."
"Work still needs to be done to change mindsets as much as economic and social structures."
"For its part, the European Community contributed by extending economic and social cohesion policy, which MEPs know well, to the Eastern Länder."
"While the sums pledged were not on a par with the efforts made by the Germans, the European contributions clearly indicated East Germany's status as a fully fledged participant in the European adventure, the increased human and technical exchanges and the regular dialogue between the European Commission and the leaders of the new Länder."
"It had been my wish for the Community to do more, but the German leadership, worried about how its partners would react, asked me not to take the Structural Fund effort any further."
"Ladies and gentlemen, 20 years later, at a time when, the financial crisis aside, many people are questioning European integration, the 27 Member States are faced with an historic responsibility: to deepen European integration, or to live day to day as a result of compromises that may well be necessary but that do not bode well for the future."
"(Applause)"
"Today, as we joyfully celebrate German reunification, how can we fail to ask Germany what future it sees for Europe?"
"Reunified Germany is the economic powerhouse of the 27 countries that make up the Union."
"To cite just one figure, Germany produces 25% of the total GDP of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU)."
"I refer to the EMU because, whether we like it or not, it is the strongest link between the European nations that share the same currency, with the rights, but also the obligations, that this entails."
"Many people in Europe perhaps tend to forget this."
"(Applause)"
"In geopolitical terms, Germany is today poised between the European Union and the rest of the large European continent."
"This is a strong and, in many ways, attractive position, which raises many questions both within and outside of Germany."
"The Germans themselves agree with this view, as the White Paper on security in Germany clearly shows."
"I quote: 'An important role in the future shaping of Europe, and beyond, falls to united Germany because of its size, population figures, economic power and geographical location at the heart of the continent.'"
"We are therefore no longer in the pre-1989 period, when Germany showed restraint and tact, for reasons that everybody could understand and even be thankful for."
"This very restraint caused successive German governments to take the lead in European integration, especially when it came to abandoning the mighty Deutschmark - and I say the mighty Deutschmark because it is 10 Marks and is the symbol of Germany's rebirth - in exchange for the euro, for the single currency."
"These remarks, far from being nostalgic, are an appeal by one of Europe's activists, and are directed not only at Germany, whose reunification we are celebrating, but at all the Member States."
"Are the values handed down to us by the founding fathers of Europe still meaningful?"
"Do they still prevail?"
"The legacy we have been given has more to do with why we want to live alongside one another than with the treaties, which are merely necessary institutional agreements."
"However, I would not wish to end on this slightly pessimistic note, with this question mark hanging over matters."
"No, emphatically not."
"What I retain in my memory and in my heart is that night of 3 October, when the President of the European Parliament, Mr Barón Crespo, and I had the pleasure and honour of being invited to that memorable evening gathering in the former Reichstag."
"The leaders of West and East Germany enthusiastically came together in an atmosphere marked by solemnity and joy."
"All Europeans would have shared that deep emotion."
"After the ceremony I wanted to experience what a nation was feeling by going out on to the streets of Berlin."
"There, too, I saw only solemnity and joy; there was no fanfare or ostentatious demonstrations."
"It was a quiet night that everyone was savouring by reflecting on the separations of the past, on the anguish of families torn apart by an arbitrary act of history; a quiet night during which I thought of our Europe, freed from hatred and conflict, a Europe that I wanted to be at the same time united, strong and generous."
"You will surely agree that so much remains to be done to consolidate our achievements and progress into the future."
"(The House accorded the speaker a standing ovation)"
"We remember, Mr Delors, your speech at the College of Europe in Bruges at the beginning of 1990."
"It was about German reunification, and German reunification, in your words, was the best way for better coordination in Europe and a better future for Europe."
"It was a great and visionary speech."
"Thank you very much for your speech today as well."
"Let me thank our honourable guests from Spain, from France, from Germany, and the presidents of our institutions, the Commission and the Council, for being together with us."
"We will now hear the European anthem."
"1."
"Conference on Biological Diversity - Nagoya 2010 (vote)"
"- Before the vote:"
"(FR) Mr President, I will be very brief."
"I should like to express through this short point of order both my admiration for the great musician Beethoven and my disapproval of the fact that we are regularly subjected to a European anthem which has disappeared into ..."
"(Protests)"
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(FR) Mr President, I am outraged by those statements."
"(Applause)"
"Out of respect for freedom, peace and for what our citizens suffered, I simply request, if these gentlemen wish to be respectable and respected by myself, that they no longer accept the salary of an MEP, paid for by Europe."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Gollnisch, I am a very nice and patient man."
"You do not have the floor."
"This is not a point of order."
"If you continue shouting, you will be taken out of this room politely."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to ask you to consider that the exact and original wording of paragraph 35 of the resolution, which is put to the vote and which stresses that corporate social responsibility should include biodiversity, is the French version, and that that should be the version used."
"Moreover, the word 'social', which has disappeared from the English version, should be reinserted and the version corrected."
"(FR) Mr President, you invited us to vote for the original text of paragraph 16."
"However, there was a separate vote beforehand, and paragraph 16 was amended."
"There were two separate votes."
"Therefore, we voted for the original text but not for the amendment."
"Mr President, before we take the final vote - and although I am very happy with the fact that we adopted Amendment 1 - I think that Ms Bélier of the Greens is right."
"In fact, you called out to vote on the original paragraph."
"On the screens, we then saw that we voted on Amendment 1."
"To be fair to the Greens, I think we should take the vote on Amendment 1 again."
"If Amendment 1 is adopted, the original paragraph falls."
"It may have been because I speak Greek, which is not a particularly well-known language, and I speak it fast in order to help everyone here."
"I believe - I may be wrong - that I first put Amendment 1 to the vote by roll-call vote and that I then put to the vote ..."
"(Objections)"
"OK, I will trust the House."
"My guess is, if my recollection is correct, that Amendment 1 will be rejected and then the original text will be adopted, but I will do it."
"I will go back to Amendment 1 by roll-call vote."
"The vote is open."

"(NL) Mr President, my fellow member, Mrs Mathieu, suggested in her report that, for the time being, we refuse to grant discharge to the European Police College in respect of the implementation of its budget for the financial year 2008."
"Naturally, my group, the delegation of the Dutch Freedom Party (PVV), thought that that approach was quite right."
"To be precise, the dossier on the Police College reads from beginning to end like a Hercule Poirot whodunit."
"Poor management, an accounting system vulnerable to fraud, many financial irregularities and, in particular, 'creative' budgetary spending, unauthorised use of funds, and the list goes on."
"In fact, the situation was so bad that, in the end, OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office, was forced to step in."
"It is a positive thing that an investigation is under way and that action is being taken against fraud."
"However, would it not have been better if we had prevented the fraud right from the start?"
"How could this have been allowed to happen?"
"Why were the controls in place so obviously inadequate?"
"Again, we have a situation where our citizens can only look on and shake their heads."
"On behalf of Dutch citizens, we explicitly request that you put an end to this entire European police puppet show as soon as possible and simply leave real police work to the Hercule Poirots of individual Member States."
"(ES) Mr President, I voted in favour of this initiative in order to condemn the mass human rights violations and the use of rape as a weapon of war against women, boys, girls and babies; in order to ask for those implicated to be held responsible; in order to demand more commitment from the United Nations following the failure of the actions of the United Nations Organisation Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; in order to demand a political solution to the armed conflict, which needs to happen by resuming the dialogue on the peace process; and in order to demand greater commitment from the Great Lakes region to promoting peace and stability in the region."
"Mr President, I was pleased to vote in favour of this proposal."
"At the last plenary session, we voted to ask the Iranian Government to suspend the execution by stoning of Sakineh Mohammadi-Ashtiani."
"That was done pending a review, but that review is most bizarre."
"She has now allegedly been found guilty of murder, despite the fact that another man had already been found guilty of that murder."
"He has now been released on the basis that Ashtiani's children forgave her father's killer."
"This murder allegation is based on court documents which do not stand up."
"We need to use our influence to bring more pressure to bear on the Iranian Government to suspend the execution permanently, and maybe to grant her the asylum in Brazil offered by the Brazilian President."
"(SV) Mr President, according to UN reports, at least 8 300 rapes were committed as a weapon of war in eastern Congo in 2009."
"During the first quarter of 2010, 1 244 women were raped."
"There are an average of 14 rapes per day that we know about, because over and above these figures, the numbers of unreported cases are huge."
