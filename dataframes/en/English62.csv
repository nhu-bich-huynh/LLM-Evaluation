"Text"
"We all know that this is an area that has a direct and profound impact on all working people."
"To illustrate this point, I should like to list a few alarming statistics, which are also included in the report."
"There are a total of around five million occupational accidents every year in the EU."
"Around two thirds of these result in absences from work lasting longer than three days, and almost 14% of workers suffer more than one occupational injury each year."
"Every year about 150 million working days are lost and almost 300 000 workers allocated a certain degree of invalidity as a result of occupational injury or illness."
"It is estimated that the Union as a whole suffers losses of up to 3.8% of GDP as a result of illness and occupational accidents."
"In my view, these data demonstrate the high economic cost that results from the lack of an appropriate social policy."
"I should emphasise that this report deals only with the original 15 Member States."
"It must be acknowledged that there are too few effective tools at European Union level that might be used to address this problem successfully."
"I am sure we all agree, however, that at least those tools that are available to us must be used as effectively as possible in order to improve working conditions."
"On this basis, I very much welcome the fact that this draft report has been the subject of extremely detailed discussions, not only within the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, but also with representatives of the Commission and of non-parliamentary institutions."
"We have been able to clarify certain misunderstandings with regard to a number of matters; for example, that it is of course up to the Member States to adopt appropriate national legislation, to monitor the application of this legislation and to submit national reports on its implementation in a timely fashion."
"When the text was first discussed, critical comments were made with regard to the statements relating to the Commission."
"In this respect, I am pleased that, at a meeting with representatives of the Commission, we were able to explain our approaches and we reached broad agreement when looking at the individual draft amendments."
"Following this meeting, I also made some amendments to the text of the explanatory statement, and I supported the proposal of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality."
"As rapporteur, I have attempted to cooperate on equal terms with all the political groups within the committee, and our collaboration has resulted in many balanced compromises."
"These compromises were supported by all the political groups, and the report was therefore unanimously accepted during the final vote in the committee."
"Originally, voting on the report was to have been carried out in accordance with Rule 131."
"At the request of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, a closing date was set for the draft amendment, and this is why we now have the opportunity to discuss the report."
"Members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have again put forward four draft amendments, which have already been discussed once and put to the vote in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"Allow me to make a few comments with regard to their content."
"The draft amendment to paragraph 6 aims to delete a very important passage, which emphasises the positive role of the trade unions and employees’ organisations in the field of health and safety at work."
"It must be emphasised that paragraph 6, as included in the report, is the result of a compromise between all the political groups represented in the committee, including the Group of the European People’s Party."
"All the political groups voted for this draft in committee."
"The draft amendments 2, 3 and 4 are submitted in the same wording that was discussed, and eventually rejected, during the vote in committee."
"Draft amendment 4 states that a high level of worker protection would result in a weakening of the competitiveness of the original Member States if the new Member States did not fully implement rules on health and safety at work."
"This is hypothetical, and we must assume that all 25 Member States are obliged to observe directives, since they form part of the ."
"On this basis, I am therefore against these draft amendments and I recommend that they should be rejected."
"In conclusion, allow me to say a few words on the most important points contained in the text on which we are to vote tomorrow."
"First of all, the Commission and the Member States are urged to make every effort to monitor and make effective improvements to the practical application of directives on health and safety at work by means of specific strategies."
"Attention must be paid to prevention, a multi-disciplinary approach, improved cooperation between social partners and improved compliance with and awareness of regulations on health and safety at work."
"Thank you for your support and attention."
". Ladies and gentlemen, I should firstly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Maštálka, for the outstanding commitment and effort he has put into drafting this report."
"It deals with an area which is complex and which provokes much discussion, as it relates to our most important asset, namely the health and safety of employees at work."
"I greatly welcome this report."
"It was drafted after the Commission had adopted its communication on the implementation of Framework Directive 89/391/EEC and of the first five individual directives."
"It thus responds to the Commission’s wish that the communication should provoke genuine and broad public discussion as to how best to promote health and safety at work and how to strengthen the European framework in order to provide an environment ensuring equal opportunities for all businesses in the enlarged Europe."
"Since 1989, Europe has adopted a number of important pieces of legislation setting out the responsibilities and obligations of employers and employees."
"There may only have been a small number of such pieces of legislation, but they cannot be called minimalist in any way."
"They have introduced a policy of integrated prevention at all levels of business, and cover all sectors of economic activity, whether private or public."
"Within this framework, information, education and consultation with employee participation represent the three main supporting elements of the system."
"This legislation, ladies and gentlemen, has had a positive effect."
"As can be seen from the statistics, there has been a 30% drop in fatal occupational accidents."
"Thousands of lives have been saved."
"There has also been a 15% reduction in occupational accidents resulting in incapacity for work."
"This development is part of a long-term trend, even though it is true that the number of occupational injuries is still too high, and therefore unacceptable."
"Even the best legislation, however, is pointless if it is not effectively applied in the workplace."
"It must be emphasised that the attitude of employees and employers, who are the main participants in preventive measures, is of fundamental importance."
"The Commission and Parliament are agreed on the need to enhance and support awareness, education and active participation by employees and employers in defining the policies for prevention at company level, and to enforce the principles laid down in this area under European legislation."
"The Commission also agrees with Parliament on the need to develop additional legislative instruments to facilitate implementation, as well as labour inspectorates armed with structures, resources and deterrent powers in order to help change attitudes, as such a change is necessary for the proper and equal enforcement of legislation in the Union."
"The Commission’s evaluation of the implementation of the framework directive and the first five individual directives, which was based on a thorough examination carried out in the field and on the results of assessments carried out by Commission services, points to areas where the directives are not be implemented adequately, and identifies the main problems requiring attention."
"The Commission is delighted that Parliament agrees with the analysis carried out by the Commission, and that its report makes proposals which should improve the practical application of the legislation."
"The recommendations made in the report deserve full support and, together with the results of the assessment of Community strategy for the period from 2002 to 2006 and the reactions of Member States and the social partners, will form the basis for the next Community strategy, covering the period from 2007 to 2012."
"I should also like to thank Parliament, and especially the members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, for their constant efforts and on-going support for an effective policy on health and safety at work."
"Today’s adoption of this report, which includes specific recommendations for the various players, is an important step along the road to increased interest and awareness among all those involved."
"The Commission is grateful to Parliament and wishes to assure it that this recommendation will be taken into account as soon as deliberations begin with respect to the next strategy in the field of health and safety at work."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the staggering amount of national financial expenditure has been mentioned, and it is true that national expenditure appears in the accounts."
"Yet although pain does not appear in them, it is no less important."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank you for your efforts."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the subject of our debate this evening is very important to citizens' prosperity and lies at the heart of the European social model which we all want to protect and improve."
"That is why I thank the rapporteur, Mr Maštálka, for his initiative in drafting this report and I also wish, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, to express our thanks and our satisfaction, because the Committee's main proposals are included in the motion."
"Thus it is emphasised that, according to recent statistics, there has been an increase in accidents in sectors employing women."
"That is why we call on the Commission, the Member States and the social partners to pay particular attention to this issue and to include occupational risks for women among the indicators used for monitoring health and safety at work, by which we mean the relevant research and studies carried out, statistics and accident reports."
"We also stress that we need to combat the discrimination suffered by women in the workplace, discrimination relating to motherhood and sexual harassment, which cause working women psychological problems."
"To close, I wish, on the one hand, to point out that Community directives on health and safety at work do not cover housework or the undeclared work of helpers in companies and on farms, who are mainly women, and, on the other hand, to repeat a request by our committee: that the European Commission take initiatives in this matter."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to start by thanking Mr Maštálka for drafting this report."
"Health and safety at work are key objectives of European policy, and so I welcome the Commission communication and Parliament’s own-initiative report, both of which reflect the principle that the practical enforcement of standards of safety at work be subject to controls and that deficiencies in national implementation be reported."
"Almost all the Member States have had infringement proceedings brought against them on the grounds of their failure to properly transpose the EU’s rules and regulations on health and safety at work."
"It is for that very reason that we must have as our main and initial objective compliance with, and monitoring of, the existing regulations even before the EU enacts new regulations and directives and imposes requirements."
"This is where adherence to the subsidiarity principle is a matter of priority."
"As the Commissioner mentioned, responsibility for the enforcement of the health and safety at work regulations lies principally with the Member States, the regulatory bodies and the local social partners."
"These must be reinforced, as is indeed demanded by paragraph 12 of the report’s motion for a resolution."
"If uniform conditions for competition are to be created, support for the new Member States is particularly important, for they have enormous potential for development."
"Nor is it tolerable that small and medium-sized enterprises should bear the brunt of this legislation."
"They create most of our new jobs and are our driving force as we journey towards Lisbon."
"I have called in my Amendment 3 for the rationalisation of health and safety at work regulations, which will make them more efficient without thereby reducing the standard of protection that workers enjoy."
"We also need preventive strategies that can be communicated to people."
"My Amendment 2 therefore calls for priority to be given to informing workers about preventive measures."
"What is most important to me is that Articles 27 and 29, which articulate generalised concerns about the proposed working time and services directives, should be deleted."
"They are too sweeping by far, and have nothing whatever to do with the title of the report."
"It is not for us to comment on other lawmaking processes or to attempt to use a non-legislative report to make legislation through the back door."
"I have, in my capacity as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, tabled a number of amendments that improve the report, changing it in such a way that it achieves its actual objective, which is the uniform implementation and monitoring of existing provisions in all the Member States, whilst avoiding the creation of new bureaucracy."
"I therefore ask for your support."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen."
"First of all, my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Maštálka, for his work in drawing up this report on promoting health and safety at the workplace."
"Every year, 4.8 million people are victims of accidents at work, 5 200 people lose their lives in the workplace, and at least 158 million working days are lost."
"This is a great waste, of both human and economic resources."
"So great is the cost of the many accidents at work as to be equivalent to between 2.65% and 3.8% of the EU’s gross domestic product."
"This is money that could have been used instead to promote employment and create more and better jobs: a clear objective of the Lisbon Strategy, which aims to make the EU the most competitive region in the world."
"Businesses often complain that it is too expensive to introduce these health and safety measures, but then the cost is very great if workers die or become chronically ill as a result of accidents at work."
"The EU has already presented a number of directives on health and safety at work, and this legislation is working."
"According to one estimate, EU legislation has prevented the loss of 25 million European working days per annum, and many lives have already been saved, as the Commissioner, too, mentioned."
"Yet the common framework directive from the EU is not enough."
"National laws or clear collective agreements between the social partners must be introduced, just as the practical work on securing a better working environment could be greatly improved."
"The accession of ten new Member States to the EU presents us with a great challenge as regards the creation of a good, safe working environment in these new Member States."
"In many countries, the workers are not so well organised, and safety in the workplace has not been a topic for discussion."
"We need a greater focus on prevention and implementation, something that is also proposed in the report, and, in this connection, we need a detailed survey of the specific situation in the new Member States, too."
"It would be useful if the Commission were to draw up a report on this."
"It would also be a good idea for evaluation reports in future to focus more on evaluating the degree of practical compliance with legislation by the Member States."
"Otherwise, the work we are doing is worthless."
"We must pay special attention to the situation in small and medium-sized enterprises."
"There is a much larger number of accidents at work in these businesses than in large businesses, and also large numbers of workers who are poorly informed."
"It is very important, then, that the Commission take appropriate steps both to give a structure to the work on safety in businesses and to stimulate the social dialogue on the working environment out in the workplace."
". Mr President, I thank the rapporteur for his cooperation and indeed Members from other political groups as well."
"We have achieved several very good compromises."
"My group will support the report."
"I should like to say in a personal capacity that it is wrong to include references to the working time and services directives in paragraphs 27 and 29, because it still has to go through the parliamentary process."
"While I am pleased that the reference to women and domestic work in the home in paragraph 16 has been removed to get away from gender stereotypes, which I know the rapporteur did not intend, my group has asked for a separate vote as paragraph 16 no longer makes sense as it refers both to men and women."
"The reference to gender mainstreaming in paragraph 14 is welcomed by my group."
"I am delighted that we got all-party support for inclusion in paragraph 21 of a reference to injuries caused by needles and other medical sharps to health workers."
"I thank everybody for their support on that."
"This affects one million health workers across the EU."
"I hope that the Commission will take that on board."
"I should like to thank Commissioner Špidla very much for the constructive meeting we had this afternoon on this subject."
"I am also pleased that the implementation of directives has been mentioned."
"There is no point in bringing forward completely new health and safety legislation unless current legislation is equally implemented in all Member States."
"If new legislation is brought forward it has to be subject to comprehensive impact assessments based on up-to-date scientific and medical evidence."
"That is the only way that new health and safety legislation should be brought forward."
"Mr President, Commissioner, what we have here is a report with an outstanding catalogue of demands, one which has been well and truly hammered out and for which Mr Maštálka deserves our congratulations and gratitude."
"I was amazed at the great scepticism evinced from the very outset with respect to this report by one of the Commission’s officials."
"I am glad to have heard Commissioner Špidla say today that he is fully supportive of the general line of this proposal."
"I am baffled by the curious way in which Mrs Weisgerber submitted four retrospective amendments, and cannot understand the purpose behind her doing so."
"If, for example, you want to exclude trade unions from sharing responsibility for safety at work, that is an expression of a lack of desire for improvements in this area."
"The free market must take second place to the workers’ fundamental right to health, safety at work and tolerable working conditions."
"Here in this House, I often get the impression that growth, productivity and competitiveness are valued for their own sake and cannot be questioned under any circumstances."
"Human beings, whether they be EU citizens, guest workers or temporary workers, must not be reduced to being economic fundamentals."
"It is disturbing, and indeed shocking, that a research report should be able to state that no preventive measures are in place yet for around half the workers in the EU."
"It is women who are at a particular disadvantage."
"While fewer accidents are being recorded overall, it is an unfortunate fact that more of them are occurring in sectors in which most of the workers are women."
"The home is not even recognised as a workplace, and no account is taken of workers in family firms, who are often women."
"What I have to remind those who think in purely economic terms is that prevention is more humane, and also cheaper."
"I would ask them to be rather more careful in adding up the ultimate cost to the economy of the philosophy of maximised business profits and of the negligent approach to safety at work."
"More accidents, with all their consequences, cost far more than a great many preventive measures ever could."
"No doubt the human suffering of the accident victims and their families does not add up to much of an argument in the eyes of those who think only of their own wallets."
"If the entrepreneurs had to pay the resultant costs themselves, this debate on safety at work would doubtless progress in a quite different way, but, as the costs of fatal accidents, incapacitation, sickness and early retirement are largely borne by the public purse, many of them have no interest in accepting precautions and controls."
". Mr President,"
"I would like to commend my colleague, Mr Maštálka, for his report on promoting health and safety in the workplace."
"It is a very good, comprehensive report, and one worthy of support."
"The health and safety of workers is paramount."
"The enhancement of workers' rights and entitlements can only lead to a better quality of life for workers and their families."
"As we have already heard, there are 4.8 million work-related accidents every year in the European Union and this is unacceptable, given that many of the injuries sustained would be avoidable with proper health and safety guidelines and procedures."
"As the European Union continues its pursuit of a successful global economy, sustained economic growth and the privatisation agenda, many people believe that workers' rights have been relegated to second place."
"The Commission and Member States must ensure full implementation of protection measures and it is, quite frankly, an inadequate response to tell us that implementation is insufficient."
"The report indicates that a number of groups within society are particularly at risk with regard to workplace health and safety."
"Many women face sexual harassment, bullying, lower pay than their male counterparts, and discrimination in relation to their maternity entitlements."
"Many migrant workers and temporary workers face intolerably long hours and disgraceful pay at the hands of unscrupulous employers and these are the very people who require the most protection."
"The improvement of conditions requires the universal recognition of trade unions as workers' representatives."
"Trade unions are an essential element in the delivery of healthy and safe workplaces and practices."
"One issue that has already been mentioned in requiring urgent attention is accidental needle stick injury, which medical professionals face every day."
"Due to the nature of their work they are at risk of contracting blood-borne viruses such as HIV and hepatitis."
"Again, these injuries are preventable through better training and safer work practices."
"We need to redress the balance between the rights of business and the rights of workers because, after all, it is workers who are the backbone of any economy."
"We cannot afford not to have healthy and safe workplaces."
". Mr President, I would like to bring a few particular groups of workers into this discussion."
"Aside from general health and safety measures, persons with disabilities have their own individual requirements."
"Assessing and meeting the requirements of an employee with disabilities should be a matter of course and not a hassle that an employer is tempted to avoid by not hiring persons with disabilities."
"In my country, there has been a dramatic increase in the numbers of teenagers working."
"Teenagers tend to be short-term, part-time, untrained and uninformed workers."
"Added to these risk factors, teenagers tend to feel indestructible; they have little thought for their health or safety."
"I know: I have teenagers."
"One of my sons worked for an employer who was very health conscious: the employer avoided the toxic jobs and gave them to the youngest workers."
"I had to make my son quit the job."
"If employers are going to use the energy, enthusiasm and cheap, unquestioning labours of young people, the least we can do is to require employers to ensure that teenage workers are safe."
"A special school of 47 children was having a fundraiser; as a parent, I attended."
"It was mentioned that there was no problem getting tickets printed, as eight of the children had parents who worked in printing."
"I was not surprised to read scientific research later that there is a probable connection between Down's syndrome and other developmental disabilities from exposure to inks, glues, paints and other workplace-related chemicals, such as those used in a printing works."
"Women, especially mothers, have unique health and safety issues that, when they are not addressed, are a major cause of stress."
"In the case of breastfeeding mothers, a lack of appropriate measures means that mothers stop breastfeeding, or do not attempt it at all."
"In Ireland, we have no support for breastfeeding and we have the lowest rate of breastfeeding in the EU."
"This is in contrast to countries like Norway, where there is good protection and good support, and where they have 98% breastfeeding rates among their mothers."
"Research shows that the shortage of nurses, long working hours and overtime, all increase the risk of dangerous errors like needlestick injuries."
"There is no legislation currently governing minimum staffing levels, or any of those stress-related issues."
"Directive 89/391/EEC is not specific enough to protect healthcare workers."
"In the United States, the need for more specific legislation was recognised and the new Needlestick Injury Prevention Act now requires appropriate measures to be taken, particularly in terms of the equipment used by healthcare workers."
"I feel that it is vital in every discussion in the area of workers and workplace, especially in health and safety, to discuss those workers who are denied the status recognition, benefits and protection of employees."
"Those are the homeworkers, both men and women."
"I will focus on two types: one is the family member."
"In my experience, it is usually a spouse, who works on the family farm or in the family business without pay."
"In terms of health and safety, they may benefit from the measures that are taken for their spouse, but there are no appropriate measures taken for their own needs."
"I think of the daily unrecognised farm working of many of my friends, of my own sister."
"I can still picture her and my young teenage nephews trying to deal with a bull while her husband was at the mart: no protection there."
"Though their work is financially productive, they are not factored into EU directives."
"The other group of workers, men and women home carers, are probably the largest single workforce in the EU."
"They work very hard and save society a fortune."
"They are precluded from earning because they are caring for the elderly, the sick and those with disabilities."
"Often that work costs them money to perform; often they are impoverished in their efforts."
"Their health and safety situation is critical."
"Home carers are commonly lifting, living on little sleep, impoverished by the cost of caring, dealing with challenging and sometimes erratic behaviour."
"I know, I have been one for 30 years."
"I urge you to bring the home workers and home carers into the employment loop with all that means, especially in protection for health and safety."
"I would like to mention the European Parliament workers, who facilitate our work here so well."
"The staff who are stationed at the visitors' entrance in the LOW Building are freezing."
"There is a powerful heating unit over the door to warm the entrance for visitors and staff, but it has been broken all winter."
"I spent some time waiting there and I was frozen."
"I do not know how it can be healthy for the staff who must sit there all day."
"I have asked on a couple of occasions for the heater to be fixed and I would ask you: please, see if you can get the heater repaired for the sake of the health and safety of the staff in this building."
"Lastly, I agree with the rapporteur that it is essential to have the input on health and safety regulations from the workers themselves."
"It could not be simpler: ask people what they need; they will tell you, and then the money spent on health and safety will be spent well."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, 4.8 million accidents a year resulting in 5 200 deaths and leaving 13 000 victims with permanent disabilities."
"This is not a new epidemic occurring outside our borders, Mr President, but something that is actually happening within the European Union."
"Accidents in the workplace are a real tragedy and have incalculable human and financial costs."
"I have to acknowledge that the most recent indications are that the number of accidents is falling – precisely, I believe, because of measures taken to improve the health and safety protection of workers."
"The figures are still worryingly high, however, and, incredible as it may seem, more than 50% of European workers still have no access to accident prevention mechanisms."
"Among the most vulnerable targets, temporary migrant workers deserve particular attention, as do the construction, fisheries and agriculture sectors."
"This list is not exhaustive, and I should like to underline the risks to which workers in small and medium-sized enterprises are exposed."
"Although they are a major driving force in Europe’s economy, SMEs suffer from a lack of information and a lack of resources in managing their health and safety problems."
"Without the necessary financial backing to promote worker training and awareness activities regarding the risk of accidents at work, many of the initiatives that have been considered could not even be implemented."
"Lastly, an explicit reference to the key concept in this area – prevention."
"It is essential to increase the number, quality and competences of the workplace inspection services and to raise the penalties for failing to comply with legislation."
"At a time when the Lisbon objectives have just been reviewed, in the sense that a healthy, safe working environment is a decisive factor in the growth – and continued growth – of Europe’s economy, I would point out that the text of paragraphs 27 and 29 of the report we are debating does not make sense."
"Mr President, I congratulate Mr Maštálka on a truly excellent report."
"The rapporteur exposes, in no uncertain terms, the inadequate and unacceptable way in which the Commission has dealt with the issue of health and safety at work over the last few years."
"He makes concrete and logical suggestions on how to remedy the situation."
"The importance of having proper legislation in this field and its effective and speedy implementation is clear."
"The current situation is totally unsatisfactory and the human cost involved is enormous."
"Each year in the 25 EU Member States, approximately 400 000 workers become permanently disabled because of a workplace-related accident or disease."
"Each year it is estimated that about 8 000 people die as a result of work-related accidents or disease."
"The economic cost is equally vast."
"It is estimated to be about three to four per cent of GNP."
"So why has the Commission been so complacent in dealing with this hugely important matter?"
"Is it due to mere inadequacy and naivety?"
"Or is it due to excessive pressure from employers, many of whom have not yet managed to comprehend the simple fact that it makes good economic sense to have high standards of health and safety at work?"
"We expect and must insist that we get clear answers from the Commission on this issue."
"We also expect that the new Commissioner will do his utmost to put right the deficiencies of the past."
"I would like to make two suggestions for further consideration."
"First, more attention should be paid not just to the health of workers in the workplace, but also to their families."
"Many of the toxic substances that workers are exposed to at work can be carried home, for example by way of their clothing."
"Second, a publicly-available blacklist of employers with proven bad records for poor hygiene and accidents should be established."
"Employers with the best health and safety standards should be publicly lauded and suitably rewarded."
"This way, consumers will be able to know who is worthy of their business support and who is not."
"Mr President, all parties across this House clearly agree on the importance of health and safety in general, and on health and safety at work in particular."
"It is very good that this should be so."
"However, I disagree completely with the last speaker, who maintained that the Commission has been complacent in this area."
"Far from it;"
"I would congratulate the Commission on producing a report that has covered this important issue with a firm but light touch."
"The rapporteur, however, has chosen to use a somewhat heavier hand."
"The Commission report mentions simplified and improved benchmarking and the importance of existing legislation being evenly applied in all Member States."
"It points out that Belgium, France and Ireland have not yet provided any information."
"It also mentions the importance of developing non-legislative instruments for the protection of workers."
"I can agree with all of that."
"The rapporteur has used the opportunity to call for further legislation and to highlight the importance of extending the powers of trade unions."
"I do not agree with that and hence will be supporting the amendments of my colleague, Mrs Weisgerber."
"Rather mischievously, the rapporteur has also used the opportunity of this health and safety report to promote, on the apparent basis of health and safety, the Atypical Workers Directive concerned with temporary agency work."
"I also notice efforts to undermine the proposed Services Directive on the same spurious grounds."
"I cannot support either attempt."
"I understand the determination of the Left to use every possible chance to derail the Lisbon Agenda by promoting the first directive and emasculating the second, but I am sure that the Commission as a whole will not be taken in for one moment."
"It was a good try, though."
"I know that the rapporteur has put a lot of time and thought into this report."
"I agree with some of his points, but I hope he will forgive me for saying, as respectfully as I can, that I prefer the original Commission document."
"() Good evening everyone!"
"Working at night certainly does not do our health any good."
"Our efficiency at work and our success also depend on how we feel at work and how our health is cared for."
"In this regard it is important that legislators provide laws and regulations, that employers provide safety measures and that employees themselves are also aware of their own responsibilities and ensure that measures are observed."
"I would like to draw particular attention to greater workplace protection for pregnant women, because in such cases two lives are endangered."
"It is also necessary to pay greater attention to health and safety education both at the primary level of education as well as vocational schools and colleges."
"Regulations cannot be effective if we are unaware of them or are not prepared to follow them."
"The report frequently mentions new Member States, as though they have poor standards in employee health and safety."
"In Slovenia we have very strict regulations for safeguarding health in the workplace, and obligatory training is also regulated."
"Employers that are aware of the usefulness of regulations follow them closely."
"Unfortunately, however, this often stops at formal observance of regulations and quick profits for those that carry out training programmes."
"There also needs to be supervision over the implementation of regulations for the benefit of both employees and employers, because savings at the expense of workers' health are often more expensive than investment in safety, education and increasing awareness."
". Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to sum up the debate, which has confirmed what was said in the introduction, namely that Mr Maštálka’s report has been drafted very thoroughly on the basis of a debate which has involved all the interested parties."
"I must say that there were a number of key aspects that pleased me."
"The first of these has already been mentioned in the debate, namely that nobody is in any doubt that health and safety at work is an important topic and, it may be said, one of the most important topics to be addressed."
"I also welcome the fact that nobody is in any doubt that sensible regulations are effective, and indeed the report backed this up."
"Even though I said that there had been a 30% drop in fatal occupational accidents, that still means a cruel loss of 2 500 human lives – approximately 2 500 human lives every year."
"Furthermore, it is an unfortunate fact that for every death around two people are crippled, or in other words disabled for life."
"This means 5 000 more human tragedies."
"I believe that it was also right to say that it is not entirely correct to use the concept of new and old Member States, because since 1 May neither Member States nor problems relating to health and safety at work have been bound by geographical borders, and there are many factors involved."
"Issues relating to particular problems in health care were also of great interest, and it is quite clear that health care is a sector beset by many difficulties and considerable risks."
"I also appreciate the concerns relating to those who are less able for whatever reason, and the concerns over the gender aspects of certain risks."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the work that has been carried out forms a good basis for the drafting of the next strategy."
"In this strategy, we shall have to react in a sophisticated manner and take account of new risks or newly understood risks."
"I am certain that we will be able to cooperate with this House to find the best way forward, so that it will be possible to record improvements in the situation in the next report."
"This situation, and this is again something that has been heard from all quarters, is certainly not at a level with which we can be satisfied. I thank you."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 12 noon."
"– The next item is the Commission statement on the steel sector."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, problems relating to the steel industry appear regularly on Parliament’s agenda, even though the complex period of large-scale restructuring in this sector is now over, at least in Western Europe, and even though the European steel industry is generally competitive."
"It is true that companies in this sector are still adapting to economic competition and to global market conditions, however, and this is why restructuring has been carried out so regularly in this sector."
"I should first of all like to emphasise that the generally satisfactory state of the European steel industry at present is undoubtedly based on the capabilities of businesses and their workers, as well as on a general capability to adapt to changing conditions."
"These capabilities have been demonstrated in the past, and I am sure they will be demonstrated again in the future."
"It is essential that this sector, in common with all industrial sectors and services, adapts constantly, and these adaptations form the basis of future prosperity."
"Yet this does not mean that we can forget our collective responsibility for ensuring that the process of change takes into consideration the men and women who work in the sector."
"The reason for today’s debate in this House is again the ThyssenKrupp plant in Terni."
"Parliament discussed the future of this plant a year ago, and it appeared that negotiations would end happily, since the company abandoned the plans it had announced a few weeks earlier to close the plant, or at any rate postponed these plans."
"Yet now it unfortunately appears that ThyssenKrupp intends to put its original ideas into practice."
"It is not for the Commission to judge whether a decision of this kind is economically justified, or to become directly involved in this process in any way, unless Community rules are infringed."
"Nothing points to this being the case at present."
"The Commission is not in possession of any information that would lead it to believe that the company is contravening the standards applied in such cases, whether these be standards governing working relationships or standards in other fields."
"As far as we are aware, no complaints or statements have been submitted in this respect."
"If this were to happen, the Commission would of course take the appropriate steps in execution of the powers conferred to it on the basis of the Treaty."
"Economically speaking, we may bemoan the decision on the fate of this factory and this plant, and we must take account of any negative impact the decision will have on hundreds of people and on the prosperity of the region if it is confirmed."
"We may regret that the efforts made by officials in the regional administration for over a year, and which I believe should be acknowledged, were not enough to prevent the termination of some of the activities at the plant in Terni."
"The company is free to make such decisions, however, and as such its decision must be respected."
"The company’s freedom must be respected, but it also has responsibilities, in particular with respect to the full and effective involvement of the workers and their representatives in the decision-making process."
"Reference is made to this in several Community directives and in national legislation. and it can only be reiterated that they must be observed even in difficult circumstances such as these."
"The company is also responsible for any social consequences that a partial stoppage of production may have."
"It is likely that the workers affected will be redeployed to other activities within the plant, but in any case solutions other than redundancy should be found, in accordance with well established procedures."
"If redundancies are essential, steps should be taken to help the affected workers to adapt to the new circumstances."
"These principles for the management of restructuring were established three years ago by European social partners themselves, on the basis of a Commission request."
"I can therefore now address broader questions, which reach beyond the bounds of the matters we are looking at today."
"The Commission has recently proposed that the Lisbon strategy for growth and employment be renewed."
"In order for us to achieve this ambitious goal in the context of the significant economic and social changes we are currently experiencing, we must successfully overcome the problems of restructuring."
"The social agenda adopted by the Commission a fortnight ago also includes measures which will help our companies, our workers and all other parties involved in the process of change to put any advantages to the best possible use, and to resolve any problems."
"In a few weeks’ time I intend to propose that the Commission should adopt a communication on the European Union’s general strategy for the management of restructuring and an ambitious programme to enhance the potential for economic renewal and make provision for related problems."
"The key phrase in this strategy will be preparing for the future at all levels."
"The Union has developed policies, programmes and instruments to make it easier for companies and workers to adapt to the changing world."
"These include an employment policy, an industrial policy, social dialogue, Community legislation and financial support instruments."
"It is now time to coordinate these different aspects more effectively and to develop new, future-oriented approaches, making it possible to anticipate future developments and enabling individual players to prepare for the future."
"I should like to emphasise that preparing for change at all levels, and in particular at sector, local and company level, is primarily dependent upon partnership and social dialogue."
"I propose that the Commission should use this communication to entrust European social partners with the task of implementing the second phase of consultation on two major themes, namely on the role of European works councils as mediators of change, and on the use of general principles laid down by social partners on the management of restructuring."
"There is also a need to strengthen social dialogue at sector level, and this dialogue must supplement Community industrial policy."
"Different forms of social dialogue need to be developed, with the main one with regard to preparation for and management of change and restructuring being collective bargaining."
"The social agenda depends on the creation of a non-binding optional Community framework, which would facilitate the conclusion of supranational collective agreements and represent a specially adapted instrument for restructuring at European, and even global level."
"These are a few elements of the strategy which we should like to develop in partnership with the other Community bodies, the social partners, public authorities at all levels and all those for whom the strategy is intended."
"I am aware that this kind of political initiative does not provide a direct and immediate answer to those affected by the restructuring of the plant in Terni."
"The existing Community policies and instruments, for which we aim to achieve even greater effectiveness in the future, can now be used to deal with the social consequences of the decision, which I hope, in spite of everything, can still be altered in some way following dialogue with all the parties involved."
"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attention."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today’s Europe, which has been built on the foundations of the European Coal and Steel Community, is in danger of seeing its own origins rejected at the heart of the steel industry in one of the founding countries."
"The decision by ThyssenKrupp first to close the magnetic steel production line and then to lay off and release hundreds of workers at the Terni plant is not just a breach of all the agreements signed at the time of privatisation but also a decision that makes no economic sense."
"The company has, in fact, been given special treatment by all the national and European institutions in a way that no other Italian company in the sector has."
"We just have to recall the public investment it has received, starting with the Objective 2 Structural Funds – in that respect I foresee possible Commission intervention – not to mention the recent commitment by the Italian Government to guarantee its power supply on economically favourable terms until the required new power plant is built."
"In addition, all the problems associated with putting in the infrastructure needed to improve the plant have been solved by the Italian Government."
"We must not forget the market for magnetic steel, either: Italy is its largest market, together with Germany."
"It is difficult, therefore, to understand the reasons that have led ThyssenKrupp not to conclude the talks on signing the draft agreement aimed at ending the dispute, as they are now in their final stages."
"The suspicion arises, then, that the negative results issued by the company may be connected to decisions designed solely to make inter-group transfers at prices favourable to its associated companies."
"The joint resolution on which we shall be voting tomorrow is not just a gesture of solidarity, but it seeks to represent Parliament’s commitment to mobilise the Commission and the Member States to intervene with initiatives to avert downsizing in the steel industry."
"We also call on the German Government to intervene with ThyssenKrupp’s top management immediately so that they resume talks with the social partners."
"Relocation, above all to China, must not happen without complying with human and union rights, beginning with the rights of the Chinese workers themselves."
"The Terni affair, Mr President, does not just involve Italy."
"It is a European affair, and one which must not be underestimated, because it is typical of the whole steel sector."
"That is why all the institutions and all the political groups are being asked to draw up concrete proposals to protect the steel industry, jobs and also research, because research is conducted at the Terni plant as well."
"It would be a serious mistake for us not to condemn the company’s refusal to listen to constructive proposals, a mistake that should be condemned by all the political groups."
"That is why we appeal to the German Government again to intervene with ThyssenKrupp’s top management immediately, to make them realise the importance of the Terni plant and the mistake that they have just made."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I do not know how to regard the decision by ThyssenKrupp to make 630 workers redundant tomorrow morning – in addition to those already laid off in the magnetic steel sector."
"I do not know whether to regard it as a lack of respect towards this Parliament, which is debating the matter, or merely as an open admission by the company of the contradictions that come with industrial policy."
"Only a few days ago, the company sent a letter to Members of the European Parliament – I do not know how widely – in which it said it wanted to protect its position on magnetic steel and also to invest in stainless steel."
"The decisions it has just made contradict all that."
"The fact is that the decision to close down the magnetic steel division is causing serious employment problems and having adverse repercussions on the whole plant and the Terni area."
"In employment terms, this decision may cause the loss of more than 1 500 jobs in the steelworks and allied industries."
"As if that were not enough, ThyssenKrupp no longer seems to show any interest in enjoying its infrastructure and energy-cost benefits, after repeatedly asking for them."
"Clearly, that means that it wants a free hand: a free hand gradually to dismantle the stainless steel production line too, which according to the company should actually be the plant’s core business."
"We seem to have seen it all before."
"After taking over the Italian market, the company is gradually reducing production volumes at Terni, with magnetic steel production being abandoned so that investment can be made elsewhere."
"Downgraded to regional status, with its production volumes severely cut – I am talking about 800 000 tonnes a year, compared with its capacity of 2 million tonnes a year – and with high energy costs, the Terni steelworks would then basically end up being dismantled."
"Are we perhaps maligning the company?"
"Why, then, has it been making stainless steel in a decades-old plant for the last three years while a new plant, just three years old, has hardly been used at all?"
"I think everyone now knows that it is hard to find a kilo of steel of any kind, because the market is showing clear signs of a severe shortage of materials, soaring prices, and worldwide production capacity fully saturated for a long time."
"It is quite clear that pulling out from Terni would push prices up further and would leave Italy’s electromechanical industry in serious difficulties, as it accounts for 40% of European consumption."
"The company has not even been willing to consider alternative solutions, such as promoting a consortium of Italian users similar to the one that already exists in the United Kingdom; supplying hot coils from Germany, as is already done for certain production plants (such as Genselkirchen and even competing plants, such as Newport); or reactivating an electric furnace that has already been installed at Terni, which requires only modest investment for environmental reasons."
"As a result, we now find ourselves in this difficult situation, which for us is unacceptable because of the production costs and social costs involved."
"How can we find a way out of this situation?"
"First of all, the company should be asked to accept its responsibilities with regard to the commitments it has made and the agreements it has signed."
"Secondly, it should resume talks with the social partners and local bodies, as these are currently not taking place."
"We believe that dialogue between the parties is essential in order to find solutions to the current problems."
"Thirdly – and I address this to the Commissioner in particular – it is important to be consistent with the Lisbon strategy, which seeks to achieve competitiveness by protecting and expanding the production base, rather than closing down plants, which is precisely the opposite approach."
"Lastly, I believe it is absolutely vital not only to provide answers on the state of restructuring processes across Europe but also to give some serious, in-depth consideration to the kind of industrial policy that Europe needs in order to deal with problems of competitiveness."
"The sooner we do that, the better."
"By discussing such important topics, Parliament can make a tremendous contribution to a positive solution for the Terni steelworks affair and can provide real prospects for the future of European industry."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament has been called on to deal with a subject that is highly significant for the European Union’s economy: the future prospects of the steel sector."
"It is doing so this evening after a long debate among the political groups in recent weeks, which has resulted in a broad compromise on the text of the resolution which is to be put to the vote tomorrow."
"It is a balanced text and one that should attract broad agreement."
"The topic in question should be seen in the context of achieving the Lisbon objectives as well as greater economic and social cohesion, since the sector employs a large number of workers in Europe, includes areas of excellence and produces technologically high-quality products. These are genuine reference models for the whole world."
"ThyssenKrupp, partly through Acciai Speciali Terni, has until now unquestionably been numbered among the leading world producers of stainless and magnetic sheet steel and has been at the forefront of research."
"In its own investment plan, the company committed itself to making Terni the European centre of excellence for magnetic steel, based partly on the infrastructure and energy-cost benefits guaranteed by the Italian Government in June 2004."
"It should also be borne in mind that extra investment from the European Social Fund has been used to develop local systems, infrastructure and vocational training."
"The commitments I have just mentioned would not be honoured if there were a change in corporate strategy, and the consequence – as we are now learning – would be a gradual reduction in employment levels through the implementation of as yet unspecified procedures."
"What that means is that thousands of jobs would be lost within a fairly short time, which would be an extremely dangerous precedent."
"We call on the Commission today to stand by its own decisions and to ensure that those who are granted Community funding should honour the commitments they make, including their choice of location."
". Mr President, I am in full agreement with the substance of what previous speakers have said and would like to make a couple of comments that are fundamentally critical of the business world."
"What will show the real value of the social pieties constantly recited at EU level and only a couple of weeks ago ceremoniously set down in writing, not only as part of the Lisbon process, but also in the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe?"
"It will be the treatment of Thyssen-Krupp’s workforce at Terni in Umbria, which is a depressed area."
"This commitment to the objective of full employment, to social cohesion, to the social responsibilities associated with ownership, to social dialogue – just what is it worth?"
"Is this all no more than a dead letter?"
"Can one simply ignore it all whenever one is overcome by the craving for profit?"
"After all, one will not be punished for it."
"That is what we have to resist – the flouting of Europe’s social benefits, which are essential to civilised life and work on this continent of ours, and also essential in terms of our own capacity for competition and innovation."
"If Europe is to be able to succeed in extending its influence to the rest of the world, its social conscience must not be allowed to slumber."
"What is happening at Thyssen-Krupp is also, for us, about putting these things to the test in a practical way."
"A lot of money from the European Structural and Social Funds has been spent on it; to what extent are the EU Member States and the Commission willing and able to insist on their conditions for the subsidy of businesses actually being kept to?"
"That is something that not only the affected workers and their families can expect; so, too, can taxpayers the length and breadth of Europe, in the interests, among other things, of the future viability of a vital industrial sector – one that was, after all, godfather to Europe’s first community, that of coal and steel."
"We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will be voting in favour of the resolution."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are only a few of us here in the Chamber at the moment, although in fact a great many people are listening to us in a state of anxiety and distress."
"Yesterday, a small delegation from that working community came to Strasbourg at their own expense."
"Indeed, although we may be discussing Terni, a small town in Italy, we are actually debating the future of the whole of Europe."
"For those who are not familiar with it, Terni is a town in the green countryside of Umbria that is different from the others."
"Located in the region of Lake Trasimeno, with its little medieval towns and the mysticism of Saint Francis and the renaissance painters, Terni has, for 120 years, been a town of steel and steelworkers."
"Its lifeblood is the steelworks and, through innovation, it has been able to protect and to improve its production for over a century, even during the war."
"There are no valid economic reasons why the production of magnetic sheet steel should be concentrated in France and Germany: in 2004 ThyssenKrupp made a net profit of many millions of euros from the Terni plant."
"Only a few months ago, in June, the company signed an agreement with the social partners, witnessed by the Italian Government, to revitalise production at the Terni plant, and the European Parliament voted to support the agreement."
"Now the owners of the company seem to want to tear up those agreements by announcing today that 600 workers will be made redundant as of tomorrow, after having already got rid of the 370 workers in the magnetic steel sector."
"The letter the company sent to us Members of the European Parliament is therefore belied by the facts, as well as by the contradictions in the letter itself, and it has further convinced me that we must vote for the unified resolution that we have tabled both for substantive reasons and for the sake of democracy."
"The situation is even more tragic and unacceptable when one thinks of the dignity of those European citizens and their families who have been protesting for more than a year, and of the rules for social dialogue in Europe, for which all the Community institutions have pleaded so hard, especially the Commission."
"We are expecting the Commission to give this Chamber some concrete answers, which so far have not been forthcoming."
"If signed and sealed agreements are ignored and an already submitted investment plan is loudly denied, it is a serious matter for the whole of Europe, because it would give rise to a European Union dominated by uncontrolled relocations, industrial dismissals and speculative thinking, which would inevitably drag it into decline and crisis."
"Intervening in the Terni case therefore means intervening for the future of each one of us and performing a duty that upholds the genuine interests of a Europe of work and development."
"Furthermore, if all other approaches are constantly blocked, it would be appropriate to resort to public intervention to guarantee the future that would otherwise be denied."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should like to make it clear yet again that the Acciai Speciali Terni affair must not be seen merely as a local affair and much less a national one, because it affects all European steelmaking, a vital sector of EU industry."
"Italy is doing what it can at all levels to resolve the ThyssenKrupp case."
"It is now time for Germany to send out some positive signals as well, and for the European Union to accept its own responsibilities."
"We all know that the Terni affair is not the first or the only case."
"There is a long list of companies that have made considerable profits in part through the sacrifice, commitment and professionalism of their workers, and have then chosen to relocate, often to non-EU countries, unscrupulously dumping the resulting job and social crisis on the Member States."
"As a number of Members have already stated, while ThyssenKrupp has on the one hand reassured us with a letter, on the other it has today announced its so-called ‘release’ of 630 workers this morning."
"How can that not be seen as an arrogant way to behave?"
"It shows that ThyssenKrupp has no intention of taking any notice of what Parliament is preparing to vote on tomorrow."
"That is why it is our duty, especially to the workers and their families, to propose practical measures today, and so we ask the Commission for some specific commitments. First, we need legislation on corporate social responsibility, combining competitiveness with respect for the rights of workers and regions."
"Above all, however, we call on the Commission to stop dodging the main challenge facing Europe’s economy, on which the future of the European economic system depends: in other words, the ‘relocation’ crisis."
"The European Union is virtually still in the dark ages on this issue, whereas instead it is essential to intervene with a strategy to limit and regulate relocations both within and outside the EU, to guarantee, among other things, growth and employment, competitiveness and innovation: in short, to achieve the principal objectives of the Lisbon Agenda."
"This Parliament, which has the specific duty to represent the rights and expectations of European citizens, must have the courage to send the Commission a strong, unified document that does not ignore the crucial question of relocation, which is putting the future of Europe’s economy at stake."
"We therefore call on you to vote for our amendment."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party, the new PSI."
"The hurried e-mail from ThyssenKrupp, full of promises, which was sent to Members of the European Parliament this afternoon in anticipation of this debate, is not at all convincing."
"It is time for action, not words."
"Behind the hundreds of redundancies that have been announced lies the tragedy of hundreds of families who see an uncertain and more difficult future ahead."
"A few days ago I held a political meeting of the new PSI at the Terni steelworks, where I could see unequivocally that Terni and Umbria as a whole are united and determined to fight on bravely and hard, not only in defence of their own productive and economic environment, but above all to uphold the dignity of the local community."
"The Community institutions in general must not remain silent at this stage, since massive disinvestment and relocations of valuable production plant to non-EU countries are tearing Europe’s overall productive capacity apart."
"Moreover, it should be made clear in this specific case that ThyssenKrupp received funds and tax breaks from the Union when it decided to buy the Terni plant, and it gave an assurance that it would keep production in Italy and safeguard jobs."
"All these commitments have been ignored in favour of Far Eastern scenarios."
"We should be asking ourselves what those scenarios are and to what extent union rights and guarantees will be observed."
"In 1950, Robert Schuman launched the High Authority for Coal and Steel, thus establishing the basis and the guidelines for an ambitious and comprehensive journey towards unification, and not just in the economic sphere."
"Now that such a complex political project has made great advances, let us not allow this particular strategic sector to be dismantled by remaining silent."
"The institutional actors, especially the government, the Umbria region, the province and Terni municipality, need to agree on a common strategy with the social partners, who should be involved to a greater extent in the decision-making processes. The strategy should then be put firmly, frankly and decisively to ThyssenKrupp."
"The company must accept its own responsibilities and give up its confused and somewhat devious defensive tactics."
"It should also be made clear that any further grant of public money should be conditional upon agreements – specific ones agreed by both sides this time – on jobs and local development and on investments designed to modernise production."
"Commissioner, raising our voice to seek and to demand immediate, concrete solutions along these lines is our political duty, in order to preserve and protect a section of our economic network."
"It is also a moral duty to those hundreds of workers, family men and women, who, with their eyes full of hope and never resigned, have been protesting at the gates of their steelworks for months."
"Let us in this Chamber send them a clear message: ‘Stand firm in your demands for the right to a future for yourselves and your children."
"Now that we are united, we stand beside you.’"
"Mr President, much as I understand our Italian Members’ concerns, entrepreneurial decisions at a particular location within the European internal market can be changed only by agreement and not by governments that have no responsibility for them."
"The appeal for intervention on the part of the German Government does not carry much weight."
"I was interested to hear Commissioner Špidla say that there are no indications that the agreements have been breached."
"Documents sent to me by Thyssen-Krupp state that the company invested EUR 700 million in the last few years and received a total of EUR 17 million in subsidies."
"With a global steel market totalling one billion tonnes, it follows that domestic production of 1.2 million tonnes amounts to rather more than one-thousandth of global steel production, along with the 70 000 tonnes of magnetic circuit band with which we are concerned, for it is here that there have been losses, the cause for which is to be found not only in Italy, but also in the laws enacted by the European Union, in the high cost of energy and in the legislation on the environment."
"I think of the requirements we have imposed on emissions trading, requirements demanded by the steel industry in particular, in order that the technical minimum standards that it already has should apply throughout Europe – for coal is indispensable to the production of steel, and there are technical limits in this field;"
"I recall how consideration is being given throughout the industry to investing in a way that involves firms relocating to places where the Kyoto Protocol is not binding;"
"I consider how the ore-smelters, particularly those in the countries that are major producers of raw materials, have announced an imminent 90% rise in the price of these, and the massive demand for them that exists in China."
"All these things are framework conditions, and, to my mind, they make it necessary that the Commission should address not only what is happening at Terni – enormously important though that of course is for the workers concerned – but also the steel sector as a whole."
"Over and above what is happening at Terni, it is for that reason that we demand, in paragraph 8 of the resolution, a communication, an inventory, and the setting-up of a high-level group, for we must, in the long term, safeguard steel as a raw material in the European Union, and hence its productive base and locations, albeit also independently of the latter."
"This is an objective we all share, and so we support our Italian fellow Members in their initiative."
"Mr President, this House unanimously adopted a resolution on this very subject just over a year ago."
"The outrage expressed from every quarter last year caused ThyssenKrupp to reconsider its decision to close its Terni plant."
"It went further: in June 2004 it signed a new agreement with a new investment plan."
"This plan, as has already been said, promised to make Terni a centre of excellence in magnetic sheet steel production, which is strange in light of what Mr Langen has just said."
"In return it would receive infrastructure and energy cost benefits under an agreement with the Italian Government."
"These were in addition to the substantial benefits the company received directly or indirectly from Europe's Structural Funds."
"Just seven months later, ThyssenKrupp has torn up that agreement – and that is the issue we are considering here this evening."
"It has gone ahead with closure, bypassing the social partners, the Italian Government and others who were party to the agreement."
"The company is the latest in a long line to make a mockery of EU laws on worker information and consultation."
"Commissioner, you mentioned the Social Agenda adopted just two weeks ago."
"Let me quote a heading from that: ' Moving towards full employment: making work a real option for all, increasing the quality and productivity of work, and anticipating and managing change'."
"I am sure those words will ring hollow in the ears of the workers hit by this decision."
"I am not criticising the Commission;"
"I applaud many of the ideas Mr Špidla has included in the new Social Agenda."
"Let me remind you of some."
"The Agenda underlines the need for a proactive approach to the positive management of industrial change."
"It talks of the need to reinforce social dialogue, update legislation on collective redundancies and update and consolidate existing laws on information and consultation."
"It launches the idea of transnational collective bargaining."
"Finally, in the context of this debate, it underlines the need for improved corporate social responsibility."
"The outrageous behaviour of ThyssenKrupp in Italy underlines the need for all these things and more to be done as a matter of urgency."
"What do I mean by 'more'?"
"Let me say two things in closing."
"The first is that although the new Social Agenda foresees the creation of a number of high level groups, it fails to include a number of good ideas from past high level groups."
"How about the recommendations of the 1998 Gyllenhammar Group on Industrial Change that companies should produce annual managing change reports, and that any company dismissing workers without safeguarding their employability should be barred from access to public funds?"
"Only when CSR includes such provisions, will companies like ThyssenKrupp take any notice of it at all."
"Finally, Commissioner, you say that the Commission is powerless."
"When the closure was announced at the beginning of last year, the Commission and its President joined Parliament in roundly condemning the decision."
"I hope, Commissioner, you can give us the assurance this evening that you will do the same."
"Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your communication, and for having broadened our debate on the Thyssen situation into a debate on the steel industry in general."
"Following the restructuring measures and mergers within the industry, we are very concerned, for several reasons, by the loss of entire sections of the production structure in Europe."
"There is the chronic loss of jobs in the industry, the risk of losing technological know-how and the knock-on effects on other economic activities, such as vehicle manufacturing, aerospace, energy production and the construction industry."
"There are also consequences for research: how can we develop the new materials vital for the technology of tomorrow if our steel industry disappears?"
"Accordingly, the European Union must have a duty and a right to intervene in the activities of the steel industry, by using public funds, where necessary, to support steel companies’ research and development activities, by monitoring public investments to ensure that they help to safeguard or develop employment and to modernise industrial plant and processes, by adopting a more resolute strategy on industrial restructuring and its social impact, by supporting moves to restructure the steel industry or to switch to manufacturing products with high added value, by creating favourable conditions, especially for cutting-edge, high-tech sectors, through the allocation of EU funds under the seventh framework R[amp]D programme"
"Practice makes perfect or, as the French proverb says, forging makes a blacksmith."
"In short, we must keep forging if we are to keep our blacksmiths and steelworkers, and we must keep forging to acquire more know-how and invent the steels of tomorrow."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the same ideas are being repeated in this Chamber about a situation which, alas, is emblematic – a case study – of so many other industrial situations typical of this continent."
"Europe can and must provide a different response."
"If we based our judgment solely on the harsh and unpalatable logic, which undoubtedly exists – the logic of numbers, which may appear solid but which are in fact intangible – we should neither understand the problem nor be able to analyse it, since the concepts invoked are delocation, globalisation and compatibility."
"This is all part of the paradigm, not only of this particular multinational company, but also of so many other multinationals which, throughout their history, have often obtained large amounts of aid from national governments and significant incentives from the European Community, and then, with their traditional propensity to nationalise losses and privatise profits, carry on down this same path impervious to either guarantees or rights."
"The Europe we need and want to develop must be different. It must be a Europe in which labour as an abstract concept is obviously important, but where human beings are also important; a Europe in which the company’s interests count, but so do those of the workers."
"The direction in which this truly emblematic case is pointing leaves us feeing profoundly embittered because this is not the type of Europe we want to build."
"We should like to agree with Commissioner Špidla on the need to move towards social dialogue."
"However, at the very time when Parliament is preparing, fortunately with a degree of unanimity, to approve a resolution obliging ThyssenKrupp to face up to its responsibilities, we have seen that the company concerned, this very morning – shortly before being subjected to the judgment of freely-elected European Members of Parliament – is laying off over 600 employees."
"Is this social dialogue?"
"Is this the Europe we want?"
"Frankly, I believe that greater weight must be given to this Parliament’s opposition and that the will of the people’s representatives must genuinely be made to count for something."
"Mr President, being myself a blacksmith and therefore wanting to express my concern about the steel sector, I too would very much like to thank Mr Tajani."
"Although we know today that you can do business only if customers are willing to buy, businesses go bust or move away if policies are not in place to create the right conditions for them, and my specific question to Commissioner Špidla is this: what will you do in order, in so far as possible, to limit the adverse effects of emissions trading on the steel industry?"
"We are faced with the prospect of a 15% rise in the cost of steel production, with another 15% being added on for energy costs. That represents a threat to Europe’s steel industry as a whole."
"What will you be doing to prevent REACH from having detrimental effects on the steel industry, which is threatened and at serious risk?"
"And will you, in the Seventh Framework Programme for Research, be taking up the steel industry’s cause?"
"At the end of the day, this is also about how we guard the steel industry against the threat of the international hedge funds, with their speculation in steel, coke and coal meaning that responsible management is now no longer possible."
"This is where the Lisbon process imposes on us the responsibility of focussing on Europe’s lawmaking and of standing up for our industrial firms in order to safeguard the jobs they provide."
"Seeing as we do today that five million jobs have been lost in Germany, and that there are five million more unemployed, we really do have to give some thought to how we get Europe’s industrial policies to create new jobs rather than doing away with ones that already exist."
"This is where our Commissioner has a particular responsibility to make every effort for the sake of our jobs, and I thank him in anticipation of his doing just that."
"Mr President, we must act to prevent the recurrence of any such cases."
"We have an obligation to do that."
"The steel industry is an important sector for us: it accounts for a fifth of all global manufacturing."
"We need it; it is a major source of employment."
"Competition is driving us into a tough situation that can only have an effect on job numbers, unless we intervene."
"We cannot, however, start to compete with the Chinese on pay."
"We have to maintain high standards in goods, working conditions, and pay as well."
"In addition to international competition, the European steel sector has to meet tighter environmental standards with the advent of emissions trading in the Union and the coming into force of the Kyoto Protocol."
"The steel industry is the largest of all the energy-consuming industrial sectors and one of the most significant causes of carbon dioxide emissions."
"It should therefore cut its greenhouse gases either by investing in new technology or by purchasing emissions rights."
"I would like to mention that in my country the steel industry invested heavily in environmental technology years ago."
"We have been able to reduce carbon dioxide emissions as far as is possible with current know-how."
"The steel industry in my country is indeed one of the cleanest in the world."
"Under the Kyoto Protocol, however, a steel industry that years ago invested resources to become one of the cleanest has to buy emissions rights from dirtier industries such as Russia’s."
"So those that did not bother about the environment in earlier times are selling emissions rights to those who have cleaned up their industry."
"The cleaner industries are therefore paying for the dirtier ones."
"Timely investment in the environment reduces the competitiveness of the most modern and cleanest factory."
"The one that works better is worse in terms of its competitiveness."
"Commissioner Spidla, how do you intend to act to prevent cleaner industries from having to reward dirtier ones in the context of emissions trading?"
"Europe needs its own steel sector: it lies at the heart of our basic manufacturing, and we have to remain self-sufficient."
"Commissioner, could the Commission look into the possibility of somehow easing the situation in this sector of industry while keeping within WTO rules?"
"The Commission should also draw up a fundamental strategy for those vital sectors of industry in which our self-sufficiency is important."
"Could we engage in more research and product development to improve this sector’s competitiveness?"
"At the same time, it is obviously essential that our trading partners, starting with the United States of America, should join the Kyoto Protocol."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it was announced this morning that a further 600 workers have been laid off by ThyssenKrupp."
"Social concerns are increasing, because what is at stake is the economy of a town, a region and thousands of families."
"The problem of Terni, Commissioner, is the problem of Italian and European industry as a whole."
"The resolution we have signed does not only represent a token of solidarity with the workers and institutions present this evening, and with the workers involved, but also reflects the commitment of the European Parliament to rethink the major strategies of industrial policy."
"Europe, within the Lisbon Strategy and the Stability Pact, must rethink a policy to stem the distorted effects of globalisation, which itself needs to be reconsidered."
"We cannot, in the name of globalisation and unfettered competition, throw away social protection, workers’ rights and environmental safeguards."
"Public action must provide the motive power for innovation, research and industrial renewal, based on a new competitiveness – not one which involves destroying the industrial fabric of both Italy and Europe."
"As part of the current debate on the Financial Perspective, we need to ask ourselves what resources have to be committed to investment in order to relaunch economic development and create new jobs."
"We also need to ask ourselves, Commissioner, what control and assessment mechanisms need to be introduced to verify and ensure that industrial projects which require public financing are able and obliged to provide protection for jobs."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this issue raises a large number of questions."
"The Terni case is, in many ways, just the tip of the iceberg."
"We must not fail to deal with this problem, which represents the true challenge facing Italian and European industry."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, previous speakers have explained the situation clearly and set out what needs to be done to resolve this most critical situation."
"I have to bite my tongue and avoid referring back to some of the demands made concerning the REACH regulations, which will come into force in eleven years' time, undermining the competitiveness of Italian and European industry, which now seems to be facing very different and more immediate competitive challenges."
"Like you, I have long union experience behind me, on which I should like to draw to make two observations."
"Firstly, exactly one year ago, on 10 February 2004, we were discussing here in Parliament the case of Terni, the steel industry and the wider crisis in European steel-making."
"On that very day we were informed that the dispute was being resolved at ministerial level and that negotiations were being started which were ultimately to lead to the June agreement which, today, ThyssenKrupp has once again torn up."
"Why was such an agreement possible at that time?"
"In my view, for one fundamental reason only: because ThyssenKrupp had been isolated, both nationally and on a European level."
"The exceptional mobilisation of the workers and citizens of Terni and Umbria, as previously referred to, played a leading part in that political process."
"The Terni plant is not a mere factory; it is an integral part of the town."
"Today, the same situation is being played out once again."
"Today, as before, we are seeing an attack not only on a professional body, a production capability, a tradition, but on the dignity of the entire population of a town."
"This must be the starting point for the renewal of a powerful unity which will again leave ThyssenKrupp in an isolated position."
"A second comment also drawn from my union background: why has ThyssenKrupp chosen today to take two apparently contradictory initiatives?"
"It has sent us the letter describing the problems in detail, while simultaneously laying off, or threatening to lay off, a further 600 workers, for more or less plausible reasons."
"In my view, the company is afraid of being isolated again by this Parliament."
"That explains the importance of the agenda on which we shall be voting tomorrow."
"Commissioner, I appreciated your speech and the pointers you gave, notwithstanding the Commission’s limited powers, of which we are perfectly well aware."
"However, the Commission can perhaps do something politically, possibly at the most senior level, as it did last year, thereby making a significant contribution to the isolation of ThyssenKrupp."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the ThyssenKrupp affair in Terni is a highly dangerous signal for the entire European steel industry and its dependent industries."
"The unanimous agreement on the resolution shows that the concern is neither isolated nor rhetorical, but is a general and international recognition of the gravity of the situation."
"A reassuring letter was received by all Members yesterday, as has already been mentioned. It reiterates the fact there will be no alteration in employment."
"That, of course, does not convince us; on the contrary, it is even more worrying in the light of the 600 workers being laid off."
"The letter appears to be – I do not know if the Latin saying can be translated – a case of ‘[an unsolicited excuse is an obvious accusation]’."
"The decisive measures adopted by the Italian Government in support of the Terni steelworks and the attention given by all the Institutions have served little purpose."
"The suspicion that ThyssenKrupp may be caving in to Asian, particularly Chinese, competition is now a certainty."
"The problem is not only the job losses in Terni, although these alone are sufficient cause for concern."
"It is even more serious because it represents a fully-fledged strategy of delocation or – not to mince words – pulling out, after many years benefiting from subsidies which have produced vast profits."
"Commissioner, I would have expected a little more from your speech."
"It seemed more like a recital of the events that have happened than a strong affirmation of European industrial policy."
"We therefore request that this issue be dealt with on a strategic level by the European Commission, which has the strength and political muscle to tackle it, to show that it accepts the consequences of a possible silence, which would result in a catastrophic failure of the European economy."
"I would ask Members to allow me to depart briefly from my formal role to express my own full and unconditional agreement, both on a personal and political level, with the reasons, content and aims of the joint resolution on which Parliament will vote tomorrow."
"."
"I have listened with interest to this debate, which relates to an extraordinarily sensitive subject."
"It is quite clear that the European steel industry is a very important component of our economy and, in its own way, of our European identity."
"It is also quite clear that consideration is given in the Lisbon strategy to industrial policy."
"One of the strategic decisions included in this document is to support European industry and to facilitate its stabilisation and development, since industry is a key part of our European civilisation."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the European steel industry has undergone significant restructuring, and it is competitive."
"It is quite clear that there will of course be further partial restructuring, and such restructuring must be backed up by appropriate social measures."
"As regards the Commission’s role, I must say that its powers are limited in this case; to put it more precisely, the Commission has no power to take action against the ThyssenKrupp management and to persuade it or force it to change its decision."
"As regards the relocation of the factory, or part of the production at this factory, to the Federal Republic of Germany, it is generally said that we are free to choose where to locate the production of goods and where to provide services within the European Union."
"This derives from the idea of the internal market, and it is enshrined in the Treaties we have approved."
"It is of course clear that restructuring of this kind is always accompanied by social problems and difficulties, and this is why we need a public policy which enables these sectors, regions and workers to make the necessary adjustments, and which guarantees an appropriate level of protection."
"This is also one of the aims of the Commission communication I intend to present as soon as possible on restructuring and employment."
"I should like to reaffirm the importance of social dialogue when preparing for and managing restructuring."
"The communication I mentioned will therefore represent a second phase of consultation with European social partners on issues relating to the restructuring of companies and on European works councils."
"I firmly believe that the social partners will take up this challenge, and enter into negotiations aimed at introducing mechanisms for the implementation and monitoring of guidelines for restructuring, and that they will also exploit the capabilities of European works councils as mediators of change within companies."
"With regard to the matter of whether Thyssen was granted any Community funding in Italy, the Commission has approached the competent Italian bodies for an answer to this question, and we are currently awaiting their response."
"If confirmation is given that funding was granted, however, and that the conditions under which it was granted have not been observed, the Commission would of course insist that the competent Italian bodies should take the appropriate steps."
"I would point out that according to the existing arrangements, assistance cannot continue to be granted under the Structural Funds if the business involved undergoes fundamental changes, for example if it is relocated within five years following the decision to allocate funds."
"I would also point out that the Commission has proposed extending this deadline to seven years for the 2007–2013 period, as well as stipulating that if this rule is infringed in any way any funding granted must be returned, and that a company that has failed to comply with this condition once should be forbidden from obtaining any kind of funding in the future."
"Ladies and gentlemen, a whole series of questions have been raised, such as the matter of a framework programme."
"It is quite clear that what the steel industry needs is innovative measures, and that this industry is a source of outstanding innovations, since metallurgical processes always involve the use of high technology."
"There is therefore no question that the steel industry will be allocated an appropriate place in the framework programme."
"There is much debate over the REACH directive, and while I do not believe that anyone is in any doubt as to whether consideration should be given to this directive, it is clear that it must be balanced and that it must be focused on its goals."
"The enforcement of the Kyoto Protocol can in any case be regarded as a success story for the European Union, and there can be no doubt that it is a major global success for the stability of our world as a whole."
"We began examining the problem of emissions trading a few days ago, and it will clearly be very important to evaluate all the findings and to formulate a position on processes that may on occasion be paradoxical in nature and have unintended side effects."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the steel industry is worthy of our attention, and restructuring, which is part of modern life, calls for a comprehensive European policy, the involvement of social partners and a desire to respond to these challenges."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to reiterate my appreciation for the efforts undertaken by the Italian authorities."
"I believe that it is still possible to influence developments to a certain extent, and we shall respond to such developments."
"At the end of the debate, I would advise Members that I have received three motions for resolutions, in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure(1)."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the oral question (B6-0012/2005) by Mr Ransdorf, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, to the Commission, on the doubling of EU budgetary resources for research."
"– Mr President, I shall open the discussion on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy."
"I welcome Commissioner Potočnik here today."
"There is a great deal of goodwill towards the Commissioner and the Commission as a whole with regard to the Seventh Framework Programme, as demonstrated by the speed with which the committee has conducted its business on the Locatelli report."
"I hope the Commission will build upon this goodwill and not dissipate it."
"The research community and the wider community expect a great deal from the Seventh Framework Programme, as it is seen as a crucial part of the Lisbon strategy for strengthening the European economy."
"Research and development are key elements in that process."
"Therefore, it is all the more important for us to get this right."
"Commissioner, the purpose behind this oral question today is to give you the opportunity to share some thoughts with us before making your proposal to the Council and Parliament on how research is to be funded."
"It seems to us that the crucial question relates to the doubling of expenditure on the research programme within the overall EU budget."
"Can this fine ambition be achieved?"
"How it is going to be achieved?"
"We are looking with keen anticipation to you, Commissioner, to tell us how you think you are going to achieve that."
"Bearing in mind the existence of the 'one per cent club' of Member States who wish to keep European-level spending within an overall cap of one per cent of GDP, I want to offer some suggestions as to ways in which spending on research might be increased at a European level, without necessarily breaching that one per cent cap, and given that there seems to be no lack of goodwill on the part of Member States to spend more on research."
"The first suggestion is that the proposals for the spending programme with regard to research on security should be funded by the Member States at European level, but outside the Seventh Framework Programme."
"Therefore, it would not count as part of the relevant budget item."
"Secondly, I see great potential for using part of the Cohesion Fund for directing research spending to the new Member States, and I hope you will be sympathetic to that suggestion, Commissioner."
"Now for the third suggestion. Mr Mayor Oreja heads a special working group on the European Research Council, which has suggested that an independent body of scientists should take the programme of research forward, and that this should happen on the basis of excellence and scientific merit."
"Quite a substantial budget has been proposed for this, totalling EUR 2 billion a year once the working-up phase is complete."
"That will take a huge slice of the existing framework budget."
"I would therefore suggest that Member States should also consider funding that outside the context of the Seventh Framework Programme."
"I hope we will take on board a number of the suggestions in the Marimon report."
"One of the most frequently-voiced concerns about our research activities at European level is the complexity and burden involved in the administrative procedures and regulations relating to the funds, which make it very difficult for small- and medium-sized enterprises and small research entities to access the funds and take part in the programmes."
"We all pay at least lip service to this."
"Even when were debating the Fourth Framework Programme, there was a great deal of concern about that."
"We talk about it; let us hope this time, Commissioner, you are able to do something about it."
"The objective of pursuing excellence above all else is crucial to achieving successful research at European level."
"I look forward to your comments about how we fund all this with keen interest, Commissioner."
". Mr President, I would like to thank you, and in particular the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, for this opportunity to discuss in plenary the issue of doubling the research budget."
"I start by saying how happy I am that Mrs Locatelli's report on the future of European research received almost unanimous support from the ITRE committee on Monday."
"This report, which I understand will be voted on in the March part-session, gives us an excellent grounding in preparing the formal Commission proposal for the new framework programme."
"I would particularly like to thank two members of the committee, Mr Chichester and Mrs Locatelli."
"Allow me first to underline that today's discussion is not just important for research."
"It is a debate about nothing less than our credibility to reach the Lisbon objectives, and is a crucial debate for both our institutions only a few weeks before Europe hopefully agrees on the financial means for the next decade."
"The discussion about the new Financial Perspectives is a moment of truth and the question of sufficient funding for European research is an essential part of it."
"This is because research is about knowledge, and knowledge is truly a European strength in global competition."
"Let me explain."
"Some of our trading partners are competing with primary resources, which we do not have."
"Some compete with cheap labour, which we do not want."
"Some compete on the back of the environment, which we cannot accept."
"The only way for European enterprise to build sustainable leadership is to exploit the knowledge triangle fully: the creation, transmission and use of knowledge through research, education, training and of course innovation."
"My strong conviction is that European enterprises will only achieve competitiveness and leadership on global markets if we rapidly put Europe in the lead as an economy and as a knowledge society."
"We are strong in knowledge, but we can become even stronger if we pool our efforts in an intelligent way; if we give full emphasis to excellence; and if we use the full research potential throughout the EU – old, new and future."
"This is what I want the next research programme to stand for."
"Knowledge does not only mean more competitive businesses."
"It also brings continuous progress to society: progress in fields such as health; preservation of the environment; and sustainable energy supply."
"All of these rest largely on the progress of knowledge."
"In view of this, the questions you raised are indeed the right ones."
"First, will the Commission fight for the doubling of the research budget?"
"The answer is yes."
"In February 2004, when launching the debate on policy challenges and budgetary means of the enlarged Union, the Commission emphasised the role research will play in building our common future and consequently proposed the doubling of the budget."
"This was reaffirmed in the Commission's communication on the Financial Perspectives last July and President Barroso confirmed the approach to this House last December, when he endorsed the Financial Perspective that had been proposed by the Prodi Commission."
"The last confirmation came in the proposal of the Lisbon mid-term review."
"It spells out clearly the importance of investment in research and development."
"On behalf of the European Commission, I can therefore confirm not only our strong commitment to research, but also that we will do everything to achieve the doubling of the research budget."
"Second, does this doubling take account of the programme's duration, inflation, enlargement and the need to support new actions?"
"I am very grateful for these questions."
"It is good that we clarify these fully justified issues."
"FP7 will be the principal financial tool for realising the ambitious objective of driving productivity growth and ensuring competitiveness through knowledge."
"When I speak about the doubling of funds I am talking about doubling the budget of FP7."
"This figure does not include related Community programmes such as Mr Gunther Verheugen's programme for competitiveness and innovation."
"Our proposal will not simply be a doubling of the initial FP6 budget."
"It will be built on the basis of the yearly amount to be spent on research during the period 2007-2013 compared to the yearly estimated amount for FP6, and revised following accession."
"This means doubling on a yearly basis regardless of the duration of FP7."
"Moreover, in the Financial Perspectives these amounts will be adjusted for inflation according to our general calculation methods."
"Enlargement is one particular issue."
"In the area of research, enlargement was a reality long before the Accession Treaty was signed."
"The current candidate countries also participate in the Framework Programme."
"I could, therefore, answer this question by saying that it is true that enlargement has been taken into account, but I would have to add immediately that it is not only in the budgetary figures that enlargement needs to be taken into account."
"I want this programme to be built on excellence, because I know this is also a strength of the new Member States."
"However in addition, I want this programme to be an enabling one that allows the use of the full research potential in the new Member States and creates an active and effective link with the Structural Funds."
"Additional new areas of research are included and are part of the justification for doubling the funds."
"Thirdly, will the FP7 proposal cover basic research, space research and security research?"
"To be brief, our FP7 proposal will be all inclusive, i.e. there will be no mechanisms outside the framework programme."
"Let me make an important addition here."
"Parliament has highlighted that the complementary objectives of continued reinforcement of existing EU research support, on the one hand, and of support to new areas of research that are of interest to the EU, on the other, require adequate funding."
"In other words, it would not be possible to strengthen existing activities in an efficient way and, at the same time, introduce widely supported new activities, such as the European Research Council and technology initiatives, if the research budget was not doubled."
"Doubling will enable us to take a decisive step forward in our overall research policy and in continuing support for the European Research Area."
"Agreement on the substance of future research activities necessarily implies agreement on adequate funding for these activities."
"Fourthly, how will the Commission try to influence the debate on the Financial Perspectives to achieve the doubling of research funds?"
"In order to underpin the debate on the Financial Perspectives, the Commission will present its proposal for FP7 on 6 April."
"This will help Parliament to give its preliminary reactions to the Council that your rapporteur, Mr Borg is planning to present during the May part-session."
"It will also allow the ministries for research and science to have an initial discussion at the Competitiveness Council on 18 April."
"The Commission proposal will provide sound justification for doubling the budget for FP7, based on a detailed and thorough assessment of the impact of the research and development instruments on investment in growth and jobs."
"I will list the two main reasons for doubling the funding."
"The first – and, for me, the most important set of reasons – is the need for the European Union to be credible in delivering the renewed Lisbon Agenda on growth and jobs."
"This includes the need to deliver results on the 3% GDP target for research and development that was mutually agreed in Barcelona."
"Doubling the funding is one of the crucial steps towards a more growth-oriented European Union budget."
"The second set of reasons is more specific to research and development spending."
"Firstly, we need high public spending on research and development because it is an important source of R[amp]D investment and for its strong leverage effect on private investments in research and development in the future."
"Secondly, we need more R[amp]D funding at EU level because of the strong added value of European research funding through the critical mass of resources, sharing of knowledge and facilities, strengthening excellence through close cooperation, competition at European level, the coordination of national activities and support for European Union policies."
"Let me add to that the fact that we are currently rejecting an unacceptable number of excellent proposals purely because of the lack of financial resources."
"In addition, there is the need and willingness to fund new category and activity initiatives which demonstrate high value added impact at EU level without, however, endangering existing ones."
"Finally, we should not forget the very simple fact that the costs of research itself are also growing."
"Your fifth question was whether the duration of FP7 should be synchronised with the Financial Perspectives to ensure a better coordination of planning activities?"
"Reaching the goals that I have described will require a long-term view and commitment."
"That is why the Commission will propose that the duration of FP7 should be the same overall as the next Financial Perspective for 2007-13."
"We should take stock mid-way through the programme to ensure that FP7 continues to respond to the needs faced by the European economy and citizens."
"By doing so we will introduce more stability on the one hand, and more flexibility on the other."
"Both factors are needed."
"I should also like to take this opportunity to underline the exemplary execution rates in the research budget."
"The current execution rates are close to 100%."
"We have proved in the past that we can effectively manage constantly increased FP budgets."
"We are aware that the challenge to managing the doubling of the funds is demanding, but we are determined to provide proper answers."
"Simplification and rationalisation of procedures are greatly needed."
"Administration and modernised management, including externalisation, will provide answers to this challenge."
"The proposals in the field of research are at the core of the delivery of the new Lisbon Agenda."
"That is the only way we can succeed."
"The time for delivery is now."
"Building a knowledge society is probably the best, and perhaps only, way to sustain the European social model without having to make a trade-off between economic growth, social cohesion and environmental protection."
"The first and foremost policy priority for the Union is thus to strongly support the three sides of the knowledge triangle – research, education and innovation – and to ensure that the triangle operates in the most favourable framework conditions."
"The change in the structure of the European budget in favour of more growth and competitive oriented expenses in the direction proposed by the Commission is thus crucial."
"This structural change to the European budget should also be followed by the Member States in their budgets."
"The doubling of funds in the European budget should not be seen as compensation for the reduction of Member States' efforts."
"On the contrary, it should be an example followed by the Member States."
"Their effort is necessary."
"If we do not make the effort now, we will have to make it later; but it will be more difficult later and it could even be too late."
"I intend to do my best to achieve the vision I have described because I believe it is the right one."
"We can bring it to life by working together."
"That is why I ask for your support."
"I trust that I will receive it, for the sake of the European model of life and for the sake of Europe's future."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday this House discussed the European driving licence, and I believe that part of the current policy is to press hard on the accelerator of the vehicle in which we are travelling, and this is something on which I should like very much like to congratulate Commissioner Potočnik. He is also taking steps to ensure that the Lisbon agenda is implemented and promises great things, such as new jobs and higher incomes for our people."
"On the other hand, there are Commissioners who are in favour of REACH and emissions trading, which would result in the relocation of large parts of our industry outside Europe."
"I should therefore like to congratulate the Commissioner on having made a knowledge-based European Union his main priority, and on not merely following in the footsteps of the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, but intends to strike out on an entirely new path with the Seventh Framework Programme."
"The aim of this is not only to implement the Lisbon criteria, but above all to target the Financial Perspectives at new, better and more secure jobs and to ensure that Europe can hold its own in international competition, as what a further priority should be to safeguard existing jobs."
"Achieving this by 2010 will be a far from easy task."
"Whether it takes place on the basis of a certain percentage of GDP or not, and however it is calculated, we regard doubling as a way to send out a signal, namely that on the one hand we are debating using 1% of GDP for the European Union, but that on the other hand we are talking about spending 3% on research."
"It is apparent from this how large the gap is when it comes to dealing efficiently with issues relating to our future."
"I believe that this goal – knowledge-based training and further training and life-long learning in connection with research findings at university, with a clear focus on new jobs – must be pursued, and that for this reason we must also demand of the Research Council that its representatives from business and research departments have a large say in shaping the goals, and that the political goals we fund with the Lisbon agenda are implemented accordingly and that we get a grip on bureaucracy."
"We are stumbling from one accusation of fraud to another, and a great deal of criticism is currently being levelled at Europe."
"Yet we should highlight the positive aspects, and the opportunities we are creating in Europe for our citizens."
"I should therefore like to urge Mr Potočnik to come to Parliament immediately after the programme has been adopted in the European Commission on 6 April."
"An extended Conference of Presidents will take place here, and the President of the Commission should join you in presenting the Seventh Framework Programme to the public."
"We should take this opportunity to make a big impression on the public, and to show them that we take the Lisbon goals seriously and want to achieve them."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy has been virtually unanimous on this issue, because we are certain that only long-term commitment to increased resources for research channelled through the Seventh EU Framework Programme can help us to pull through."
"We are adding this to the Lisbon objectives, as I noticed the Commissioner is also doing."
"We are therefore in agreement with Commissioner Potočnik."
"The problem is the Member States."
"It is the Finance Ministers of the Member States and Ecofin that are our targets and whom we should be grabbing by the scruff of the neck."
"Only two Member States have achieved the 3% target for research, my own country being one of them."
"We therefore have a lot of housework to do."
"We require some exceptionally determined work from the Commission, and this really is, as you have said, the first test, or actually a test both for you and for us."
"The funding is to be doubled, but where is it being channelled?"
"This must be kept in mind the whole time, because it is no good having funding unless you know what to do with it."
"I would like to know exactly which areas it is destined for."
"How important, for example, is the lack of digital literacy?"
"It has been calculated that we lose three hours a week because of it."
"Here, moreover, the working week is being lengthened."
"In many cases these three hours would salvage our economy."
"At the same time, of course, we have to consider enlargement."
"I am one of those who believe that 1% on the budget is not enough to take care of enlargement, the Lisbon Process and many other matters."
"We certainly knew that enlargement would cost money, and the budget cannot subsequently be reduced: it should remain at the same level it has done up till now."
"Finally, we need more training, know-how and research."
"That is the only way out of this vicious circle of competitiveness."
". – Mr President, Mr Potočnik, ladies and gentlemen, we are calling for research funds to be doubled with respect to the Sixth Framework Programme, without asking ourselves whether the latter programme is an appropriate yardstick."
"In fact, when it was established, there was not yet such a pressing need to revitalise the competitiveness of the European Union, such a massive and important enlargement had not taken place, international competition had not yet emerged so forcefully, and nor had a knowledge-based strategy such as the Lisbon strategy yet been formulated."
"All of that has now happened and, furthermore, very little has been done in terms of the Lisbon objectives."
"We therefore need to make up for lost time, considering that half of the time laid down for them has already passed."
"We must pull out all the stops, starting precisely with research, which sustains all the progress we make."
"To this end, last Monday the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy approved the three main lines of action for the next framework programme: the European Research Council, the new research proposals and the technology platforms."
"The European Research Council has emerged out of the acknowledgment that basic research now has an importance which goes beyond the Member States and must be supported at Union level and in accordance with the Lisbon strategy."
"It is an initial focus around which we can elaborate a development and competitiveness policy, which will then be filled out in the technology platforms."
"These platforms must obtain resources chiefly from enterprises, but also from public institutions, the Member States, regions and local authorities, in order to organise research of general interest and to help businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, meet the need for research in order to make them competitive."
"These are sound, decisive innovations which will give fresh impetus to our businesses."
"We must have a presence in the new sectors, adopt innovative measures and provide conventional manufacturing businesses with a new competitive capacity if we do not wish to sit idly by as Europe undergoes full deindustrialisation."
"We must be consistent and invest in research which, even when it is not strictly targeted, has an extremely high potential for return."
"Perhaps it will not suffice to double the funds but, in any case, we cannot afford to be too sparing when it comes to these resources."
"I would make it clear that the Commission can count on the support of Parliament in order to face this challenge."
". – Mr Potočnik, we Greens are pleased with the new impetus you wish to provide for research and we support this substantial promotion of European research."
"Nevertheless, not only are we concerned about the budget, but also about the social and environmental ends, because we all want a larger cake. However, of primary importance are the ingredients of the cake and how it is cooked and then, but also extremely important, how the cake of European research is shared out."
"We want open science, with a fluid and open transfer of knowledge to all sectors of society, and, within this context, we are worried that some patents may represent obstacles to innovation in the case of small and/or young companies."
"At the same time, we want to see a type of research for which small is beautiful, in which SMEs, small laboratories and small universities are treated as priorities within European programmes."
"Within this context, we want to create ‘clusters’, groups of small companies at European level, in order to prevent all research from being concentrated within a few projects."
"In the field of research, we should promote a return to basics, to fundamentals, so that basic scientific research can be supported openly and provided with more funds."
"We must offer more public support to basic research, with social and environmental objectives in the medium and long terms, rather than restricting ourselves to achieving short-term technological performance."
"In this regard, there must also be more investment in preventive health and not just in pharmaceutical research, as has happened in the past."
"Furthermore, we must invest in protecting the climate and not direct all or most of our investment in energy towards nuclear programmes."
"Renewable energy currently needs a level of support which is at least equivalent to that being given to the ITER or Euratom programmes."
"We are pleased with Mr Potočnik’s projects in support of social sciences, since they are essential to progress in research into our society."
"Finally, I would like to call for the creation of an independent European Research Council, with the participation of all the social actors, so that there may be a genuinely fruitful debate, a dialogue, between society and the scientific world."
"."
"Voltaire once said that the secret to being boring is to say everything, so I shall limit myself to making only a few points."
"The first relates to the total volume of funding for science and research."
"I believe that certain instruments that we could use, such as European securities, are currently being neglected."
"In the USA a number of key projects are funded by securities, and this could also act as a financial basis for key European projects."
"Another way to boost funding would be to exploit the resources available in the new Member States."
"The research potential in these countries is extremely strong, although it is currently underfunded."
"The costs of achieving research goals could realistically be reduced if these countries were involved."
"My third point relates to the way in which the 3% is to be structured."
"The Commission is relying on two thirds of this money coming from the private sector."
"This will be very difficult to achieve, however, given that only 3% of small and medium-sized enterprises, which pay 85% of all business taxes and provide 75% of jobs, currently invest in research, and 40% of them are involved in innovation."
"We will make no progress in this field without a new policy on depreciation, generous funding for investment, flexible legislation, a new credit policy and tax relief."
"I believe that it is also crucial that there be a high ratio of research workers to technicians."
"At present the European Union is lagging 50% behind the US with regard to the number of researchers for every 1000 workers; in other words, the US has 50% more researchers for every 1000 workers."
"Major technological breakthroughs and key discoveries need to be based on a constant stream of minor innovations, and at present this is not happening."
"Finally, I should like to note that research follows certain laws."
"In the past this was analysed in terms of Kondratiev waves, whereby key breakthroughs were found to be concentrated in clearly defined clusters."
"We should provide generous funding in order to ensure that clusters of this kind come into being once again."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for being present at this important debate today."
"If you want to double funding – and many millions of Europeans would be in favour of doing so, if only they knew anything about it, and indeed I am in favour of it, although I only know a little about it – what investments do you actually want to boost by doing so?"
"Experience has shown that 80% of funding from the Fifth and Sixth Framework Programmes has gone to the large corporations, and only 20% to those that could be termed SMEs or that are of an even smaller size."
"I believe that the main reason for this is that lobbyists – in particular those acting on behalf of the large corporations – have an above-average amount of influence."
"They have long since taken a good look around and asked where they can get even more money if funding is to be doubled."
"These people are very good at their jobs."
"The second most important reason, however, lies within the Commission itself."
"Many of the measures you take – and having been a member of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for many years, I can say that this has always been the case – demonstrate that you still follow the same old motto as the World Bank: ‘big is beautiful’."
"It is an unfortunate fact that the Commission is making the same mistake that the World Bank made, by constantly funding oversized projects all over the world."
"The new and enlarged Commission has a real chance of preventing such a mistake and moving away from the 80:20 ratio that favours large businesses."
"This would be a sure-fire way of creating jobs, and it would mean that progress was made with all aspects of the European dream."
"The second question, of course, is which areas really receive investment."
"I should like to warn you against pretending to Europeans that military armament in the field of research can result in any kind of positive progress, and against making the same mistakes that history is full of."
"What we are seeing is a new armament by stealth in the EU, and I can only issue the most fervent of warnings against it."
"Less dramatic, but equally important, is the nuclear issue."
"It is absolutely crucial, Commissioner, that if you wish to double funding you must make it quite clear what is actually going where."
"Transparency is needed so that people know exactly where funding is intended to go, and so that action is not taken behind closed doors."
"When it comes to informing the public about how funds are used, the European Union will have to decide whether it wishes to move towards propaganda – made what it is by Josef Goebbels, himself the subject of much debate at present – or towards information, with the pioneer of this approach being Jean-Jacques Rousseau."
"For Europe's sake, I would ask that you move towards informing citizens about funding."
"As a final point, I believe that 1% of GDP from Member States will be more than enough for you to manage with."
"There are a great many ways in which money could be saved in the EU."
"This House alone has EUR 50 million to spend this year, and has no idea what it should do with it all."
"In this instance less would mean more, and doubling is in no way incompatible with a maximum of 1%, which is what many countries want."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, following a half-hour analysis of the Lisbon strategy, there is no need to emphasise that it is essential to strengthen research and innovation in the European Union."
"The main indicators for developments in this sector clearly show not only that we are lagging behind the world leaders, but mainly that we are unable to make use of our own research and innovation potential."
"There is an undoubted need sharply to increase the volume of resources allocated to this important area, but this must be in line with our financial perspectives."
"It is not, however, clear how this is to be implemented."
"The framework programmes for research and technological development, which have been the main tool in the European Union’s implementation strategy, have been found, for various reasons and throughout their existence, to be inadequate in promoting the research and innovation potential of mainly small and medium-sized enterprises."
"It has been most frequently a matter of the complexity of the entire structure and procedures for access to financial resources, which deters mainly small research and innovation units or small companies."
"Regional experiences also point to other reasons: there is a lack of an adequate regional infrastructure, relevant institutions, such as university development centres, technological incubators, high-tech centres and so on but also of risk capital funds, which would, on the one hand, stimulate regional innovation and research potential in its broader sense, but also create a stronger competitive environment, on the other hand."
"The European Union budget must take account of both an increased level of financing for its framework programmes and a strengthened budget for the structural funds in order to establish a regional research infrastructure and also strengthened programmes for the European financial institutions to stimulate the development of regional risk capital funds."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the Commission communication on the guidelines for the Seventh Framework Programme and in its proposals for the Financial Perspectives, reference is made, in general terms, to doubling the funds."
"This affirmation needs to be substantiated, something which you, Mr Potočnik, have already done in part."
"In addition to the issues of enlargement and the new activity headings, namely space and research, I would point out that the Constitutional Treaty confers fresh powers on the Union in the field of research."
"I would also like to mention that the European Research Council will be established, a new instrument which we assume will use up 10 to 15% of the overall resources of the Seventh Framework Programme."
"Mr Potočnik, you are already aware of the outcome of the vote of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on the guidelines for the Seventh Framework Programme."
"The document calls for additional funding within the Seventh Framework Programme for the European Research Council."
"It also states that a doubling of the budget is the bare minimum if we truly intend to give substance to a European Research Area and pursue the objectives under the Lisbon strategy."
"I would ask you whether you agree with the European Research Council being funded from additional resources."
"And with regard to doubling the budget, what is meant by doubling?"
"We need to find a criterion and I would suggest a criterion of proportion, that is, the framework programme resources as a percentage of the Union’s gross domestic product."
"That is the percentage that we should double."
"I therefore ask you, do you agree with this interpretation of doubling?"
"Moreover, we know that at this stage in the preparation of the Financial Perspectives, there is a major debate underway among the Member States because some of them intend to cut their contribution to the budget of the European Union to 1%."
"These cuts are likely to have negative repercussions on the ‘research appropriations’ item."
"Do you agree to fight hard to oppose this position taken by the less generous Member States?"
"And if, in any case, these cuts are effected, will you still be in favour of calling for the funds to be doubled?"
"The Seventh Framework Programme must not merely be a new framework programme, but it must mark a turning-point, in line with the Union’s new powers, if we really want to create a new European Research Area."
"Mr President, I am very pleased that the basic, underlying idea concerning how we are to achieve better development in Europe is now the knowledge-based economy."
"I think that this is the answer to a very large number of problems."
"I also think it is right to focus on education, research and innovation, dealing with each of these areas separately but also in the context of the other two."
"I also think that the technology platforms will serve a very useful purpose."
"It is good that the social sciences are included in this connection."
"What we need to focus on is, of course, the infrastructure surrounding research, about which we have not yet had a great deal of discussion."
"In this context, I should like to raise two matters that are of concern to me."
"The first relates to the way in which European researchers experience professional and social conditions at a personal level."
"We see how, in the current situation, large numbers of people are leaving research for other jobs because they find it impossible to carve out careers and create good bases for family life, given the rules and conditions we lay down for them."
"This is, of course, all the more regrettable now we know that, with this new research policy, we shall require not fewer, but twice as many, researchers."
"I want to know what measures the Commission intends to take in this area."
"The second matter of concern to me is, of course, industry’s share of the total resources allocated to research."
"The general trend in all the Member States is for this to go down instead of up."
"I want to know what the Commission is doing to make industry more enthusiastic about investing more in research and development."
"Now that we are seeing the framework for a new European research policy, we must, finally, at the same time also think about how to translate these research results into job opportunities."
"I should therefore also like to see an initial fundamental framework programme for innovation."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am of course in favour of doubling the EU budgetary resources allocated to research."
"When you realise that public and private research and development expenditure in the EU amounts to only 1.95% of GDP compared with 2.64% in the United States and 2.98% in Japan, you can see how much the famous Lisbon strategy and the Commission have failed."
"That is why I believe that if the European Union is to have an effective research policy, we must not only double the appropriations for research but also review and radically question the methods and objectives of the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development implemented by the European Commission and the Council."
"Indeed, contrary to the philosophy of the Seventh Framework Programme, a successful research and development system can only be based on cooperation and exchange between public and private researchers and laboratories and not on all out competition and shortage of money."
"What I fear the most is that resources will be concentrated in a small number of priority areas of research, which are bound to be those most likely to bring immediate profits for the large industrial groups, at the expense of fundamental physics and the human and social sciences; that would mean researcher recruitment and careers would probably no longer be based on scientific assessment but on priorities directly dictated by the interests of the multinationals involved in the framework programme’s activities."
"For my part, I, of course, believe that research expenditure must be taken out of the Stability Pact calculation, but that is not enough."
"It is even more important that questions of research in Europe should no longer be decided by the Commission alone, but by elected representatives of the scientific community."
"I therefore propose the creation of a representative assembly of all researchers at the European Parliament."
"That assembly would have such important tasks as ethical appraisal, the drafting of recommendations, encouraging cooperation, monitoring and continuity of the funding granted, and ensuring that the regions are not forced to compete with each other."
"That is the only way in which the European Union will be able to look to the future with greater optimism."
"– Mr President, I have two minutes in which to make two points and bring them together."
"As you know better than we do, Commissioner, the research programmes will have an even greater effect if you use them to build a bridge between, on the one hand, the research and development programmes under the Cohesion Policy, and, on the other, the Seventh Framework Programme."
"If the two instruments are brought into line with each other, they will be a great deal more far-reaching in their effects."
"Please allow me to give an example from my own region, which is bounded by the frontiers between the Netherlands, Germany, and Belgium."
"Commissioner, the universities of Eindhoven, Louvain, and Aachen, as well as those of Hasselt and Maastricht, now cooperate closely in research, training and development, as well as in the field of cohesion projects."
"I believe that similar cross-border collaborative projects deserve to be followed and encouraged, as they primarily reinforce the regional dimension as part of the Lisbon process."
"Surely nobody can object to the towns, universities and regions within which they move and operate playing such a role?"
"We were therefore particularly pleased to see the Commission accept an amendment to that effect proposed by Mr van Nistelrooij to the Locatelli report after all, which Parliament approved at the beginning of this week."
"In it, this House expressly requests cooperation with the regions and the coupling of, on the one hand, national programmes under the Structural Funds and, on the other, programmes under the Seventh Framework Programme."
"To sum up, Commissioner, businesses are, as you know, ready to invest and to anticipate the opportunities that are presenting themselves."
"If we in the EU, who deal with financial matters, now allow them to pass by, if our fine words about innovation policy are not followed up by action, then our credibility will, of course, be shattered – both yours and ours, I would say."
"We will then be giving national governments the ideal excuse for not coming up with the national funding that is so vitally needed."
"At the moment there exists what is termed a ‘window of opportunity’, with many members of government at every level – regional, national and, of course, European too – being convinced that we must drastically upgrade our investments in innovation."
"If we simply allow this to ebb away, then I think we will have to look among ourselves to find the reason why."
"– Mr President, I too should like to thank the Commissioner for emphasising that, in line with the Lisbon objectives, Europe should be competing on the basis of knowledge and not on the basis of poor wages or environmental destruction."
"Of course, knowledge is now to be understood in the broad sense of the word, and if we look at the proposals for the Seventh Framework Programme in the context of the Sixth – and also going back to the Fifth Framework Programme – we can see that socioeconomic research played an important part at that time and contributed to an analysis and understanding of the interaction between advanced technologies and social development."
"Separating scientific and sociological research when drafting the Seventh Framework Programme has, however, in actual fact put sociological research into budgetary competition with technological research in relation to the IST programme."
"This tends to marginalise the relevance of socioeconomic research, and, in future, technological research should therefore be developed in tandem with the development of society’s needs, values and expectations."
"Socioeconomic research in the information society is a precondition for our achieving this objective."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, with the justified momentum which has developed today in favour of research, I personally feel that the doubling of funding is one of the , as our ancestors would have said."
"However, I should like to take the opportunity of today's debate to approach the matter differently."
"I therefore ask:"
"First, is it or is it not our strategic choice that the European economy should become the most competitive economy in the world by 2010?"
"Secondly, if the answer is yes, I would like to know the degree to which, in order to achieve this objective – and this is something in which I truly believe – the economy of the European Union must become and it is enough if it becomes a knowledge-based economy?"
"Thirdly, if the answer is again yes then, logically, should the European research community, companies and industry not be wondering about the means needed to complete this mission?"
"In other words, should the bottom-up approach not be used in our case, by which I mean consultation with the people who produce knowledge and innovation in Europe, in the aim of our agreeing where and exactly how much we should invest in order to achieve our objective?"
"Commissioner, ultimately what we need to achieve is not double the resources, but our strategic objective and this begs the question as to whether double is enough to achieve our objective."
"– Mr President, Mr Potočnik, I too would like to thank you for your comprehensive reply."
"There is no question that if we are to achieve the objectives set in the Lisbon strategy for 2010, we must be committed to improving substantially the resources dedicated to Research and Development, since that is the central pivot of a knowledge-based economy and, therefore, the main tool for promoting growth, employment and competitiveness."
"Consequently, we agree that the Union's scientific policy should be placed at the centre of the strategy for the coming years, and also that overall spending on Research and Development should be set at 3% of the Union's GDP, and, of course, I agree with what most of the previous speakers have said."
"I would like to add something else."
"It is certainly very important to reduce the technological gap between the Union and countries such as the United States, but it is just as true that within the Union there is another significant technological gap between the different countries, which we must also try to reduce."
"In this regard, our objective must be to improve the competitiveness of the Union as a whole, in order to narrow the gap with the most technologically-advanced countries, but we must do so in such a way that this does not involve increasing the differences between our various countries in terms of technological capacity."
"It is therefore very important, Commissioner, that we take concrete measures to improve the capacity of the countries which so far have participated less in the framework programme."
"Commissioner, we would ask that you commit yourself to reducing the internal technological gap which unquestionably also exists within our Union."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we wish to get to grips with the Lisbon strategy, we must invest in research, development and innovation."
"In order to do that, we need money, and so we must increase funding."
"Commissioner, you have my full support in obtaining the Council’s agreement with the help of this House."
"Secondly, if we ask for more money we must see to it that these funds are put to the best possible use."
"We must also learn the lessons from the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, and make procedures simpler, less bureaucratic and more streamlined."
"I see this as an absolutely crucial task that we must all strive to achieve, and both the Commission and Parliament are needed in this respect."
"The members of the Committee on Budgets are presently examining the Financial Regulation, and this is another area where work must be done and improvements made."
"Commissioner, this is another task for which you and your College are needed."
"What is needed is professional project management, and I am eagerly awaiting your proposals on this issue on 6 April."
"Finally, I should like to return to the lessons we should learn from the Sixth Framework Programme."
"Industry involvement fell under the Sixth Framework Programme, and we must come up with ideas of ways to buck this trend."
"If we are serious about the Lisbon goals, we simply need more investment in research and development."
"Such investment must also come from the private sector, and I would be interested to hear the Commissioner's ideas in response to the following question; how do you intend to get industry, in small and medium-sized enterprises, more involved in the Seventh Framework Programme?"
"I listened very attentively to Mr Ransdorf’s comments; he mentioned that we need, among other things, a better depreciation policy and more flexible legislation."
"These are useful considerations, but I would be interested to hear the Commissioner's proposals in this regard as well."
"Mr President, Commissioner, research and innovation are the basic tools for implementing the Lisbon strategy."
"The Seventh Framework Programme has presented us with a unique opportunity to move towards this goal by improving the way we exploit the intellectual potential of the European Union’s 450 million citizens, including its almost 80 million new citizens in the new Member States."
"The Seventh Framework Programme should accelerate European integration, and it should provide not only for a much-needed and significant rise in funding, but also for measures under which this funding will be put to effective use."
"This will only be possible if entirely new and innovative methods are devised for implementing European policy on science."
"The main priority should be to alter the criteria according to which funds are distributed, as this will make it possible to establish centres of expertise at institutions where the researchers are based."
"Students from Central and Eastern Europe do not wish to be treated as an afterthought, or sometimes merely as the odd ones out, in ‘Centres of Excellence’ programmes, as is the case under the current Sixth Framework Programme."
"Two questions come to mind in this connection."
"The first is whether the concept of ‘excellence’ is not being misused here as a strange kind of curse, which can later be invoked to justify an unequal distribution of funds."
"We should not strive for excellence only with regard to gaining and spending funds."
"The second question that arises concerns the kind of objective criteria for the distribution of funds provided for in the Seventh Framework Programme."
"I thank you."
". Mr President, I much appreciate the strong support of this House."
"It is very encouraging for my future work."
"Many questions were asked, some of which I cannot answer very precisely, but I will group them together and try to be as informative as possible."
"The calculation behind doubling is made in real terms on a yearly basis and with the same assumptions in mind as with the other aspects of the debate on the new financial perspective."
"At the end of the day it is crucial that we double the funds as a percentage of GDP."
"That is a credible way of looking at it."
"Our proposal was based on that thinking and I believe that this proposal is ambitious enough to achieve our goals."
"I am more afraid of going backwards than of asking whether it goes far enough, although even that question is credible, too, and could be approached in an official way."
"Public funding is not the only funding."
"As you know, public funding is estimated as being approximately one-third, with two-thirds private funding."
"So it is crucial that we increase public funding, because of the source and because of the leverage effect on private investment."
"However, as some of you stressed, it is even more crucial to create conditions under which companies will stay and invest in Europe."
"The latest figures are not promising: in 2002, investment by the 500 biggest companies in the European Union decreased by 2%; investment by the 500 biggest non-EU companies increased by 3.9%."
"In Europe, around 24% of investment involves the car and spare part industries."
"In the rest of the world, information technology is the biggest sector with regard to investment."
"Those are the facts we have to deal with."
"That is why it is crucial to create a better environment for research and development."
"Ways of doing this might include state aid; tax incentives; intellectual property rights; the structural and cohesion funds; and risk and venture capital, which is certainly one of the problems."
"Two days ago, I met the President of the European Investment Bank and we have already started to prepare actions in an effort to address that problem."
"Environment is crucial."
"If we want to achieve our goal, we need to create an environment in which companies will work, compete and carry out their research and development activities in Europe."
"The framework programme now being discussed in the Commission has to take account of the Lisbon Agenda."
"I would like it to be simple, flexible, understandable, easily applicable and based on continuity."
"We would like to establish four major areas of support."
"First, cooperation."
"Today we call this the 'collaborative approach', although in some countries the term 'collaboration' is not particularly acceptable."
"That area should be more industry-driven than it was in the past."
"That is why technology platforms should play an important role in deciding where money will go and how decisions are taken."
"It will be more thematically orientated and less instrumental than in the past."
"I believe that is the proper way to do it."
"The second area is ideas."
"This means the European Research Council."
"This area is researcher-driven, so the division between basic and applicable research is practically outdated."
"We would try to make it clear what is industry-driven, what is politically driven and what is research-driven."
"That will be more transparent."
"We will give everyone the opportunity to make known their views on this."
"The third area should be people."
"The major problem there is that they have been under-financed."
"The fourth area is capacities, which involves infrastructure, SMEs, regions and research potential."
"Here, we would like to address the question of new Member States, but not in a way that would undermine the excellence of the programme."
"Researchers in those countries should be supported so that they develop and become more visible."
"We should establish actions which allow us to access the structural and cohesion funds."
"The worst thing for the new Member States and their researchers would be to create conditions under which they would not be able to compete."
"It is best for them to develop rapidly so that they are competitive from the very beginning."
"They are doing that already."
"I am very much aware that conditions in some countries mean that they cannot compete."
"We have to help them, but the question is how we do this."
"Our programme seeks to achieve excellence and competitiveness in the EU, which is crucial."
"We have structural and cohesion funds for solidarity."
"If we are using these funds for road, rail and environmental infrastructure, we could and should use them for the development of research infrastructure as well."
"It is crucial that we create conditions in which researchers from the new Member States will remain in these countries and compete and cooperate with others in the European Union."
"Simplification and streamlining should be the name of the game, otherwise we will have major problems."
"I am aware of all the challenges ahead of me and I count on your support."
"The Commission is not the only body involved: I have created a taskforce in my directorate."
"We now also have an inter-service task force."
"We are now organising sounding boards among SMEs and smaller groups, to give them a chance to voice their opinions on the proposals."
"Framework programmes, research and development structures, cohesion programmes, and competitiveness and innovation programmes are crucial."
"These should seek to achieve the same goals."
"That is one of the points I would especially like to underline."
"For smaller users, we are trying to establish better definitions for the instruments, which are often far from user-friendly, especially the integrated projects."
"On the other hand, simplification and streamlining are major problems for smaller users."
"For them, costs are proportionally much higher and burdens are greater than they are for the bigger users."
"I believe these two things will be crucial."
"We should bring more SMEs into the process itself."
"In conclusion, I believe that the talks on the next financial perspective will be a kind of moment of truth."
"I hope that we will be strong enough to reach conclusions which tally with the Commission's proposal."
"I am afraid that if certain changes are made the structure of the budget will be worse than it is now."
"Thank you for your support."
"The debate is closed."
"– Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for his outstanding answers, and to apologise for the fact that a fellow Member asked extremely aggressive questions, while not thinking it worth his while to wait for your answers to them."
"I should like to thank you for taking this initiative, which bids this House continue its cooperation on the issue."
"For that fine example of Austrian politeness and correctness, I should like to thank you."
"The next item is the report under Rule 134 of the Rules of Procedure on a specific action for transfers of vessels to countries hit by the tsunami in 2004 (COM(2005)0036 – C6-0036/2005 –2005/0005(CNS))."
". Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of my fellow-Commissioner Mr Borg, who has unfortunately been unable to fly to Strasbourg due to the heavy snow."
"Concerning the subject, I wish to thank Members of Parliament for accepting the urgency procedure, and the members of the Committee on Fisheries for their support and their efficiency in handling that matter."
"The tsunami disaster devastated the coastal areas of numerous Asian countries and, besides tourism, the fisheries and aquaculture sector of these countries was the most affected."
"Parliament and the Council have already welcomed and encouraged the initiatives taken by the Commission, in particular the measures aimed at rebuilding the sector in the areas concerned."
"This proposal is only a specific part of a whole package of rehabilitation and restructuring measures."
"It aims to create the legal framework to allow Community vessels receiving public aid for permanent cessation to be transferred to countries affected by the tsunami, rather than being scrapped or reassigned for non-profitable purposes other than fishing."
"The intention is to make fishing capacity available in order to allow for a quick return to the activities on which the livelihood of countless coastal communities is completely dependent."
"We have taken particular care to ensure that the local needs are carefully assessed."
"In this respect, the role of FAO, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, is decisive for the implementation of the rebuilding efforts in the area."
"This is on the agenda for the next FAO meeting of fisheries ministers in Rome on 12 March."
"Two main guiding principles have determined our approach in this proposal."
"Firstly, a strong commitment to ensure consistency with the general objectives of the common fisheries policy and promote sustainability of the fishing activities in the long term."
"To achieve those objectives, we have proposed technical assistance to make an immediate impact assessment and design of the rehabilitation and reconstruction requirements for the areas concerned."
"In this respect, a monitoring system will be set up in order to avoid possible adverse effects on the local economy and to ensure that the vessels transferred meet the needs identified by FAO."
"In addition, we have also emphasised that the transfers must be in accordance with the third country’s requests and that they respect the local fishing traditions."
"Secondly, the European Community must offer a mechanism making it possible to act swiftly, while establishing an effective monitoring and control system without imposing unnecessary administrative burdens."
"The present proposal respects these constraints."
"Indeed, the proposal will not require reprogramming in the Member States under the current structural regulation for the fisheries sector."
"It has the further advantage that there are no financial consequences for the Community budget."
"I would underline the political importance of this proposal."
"Faced with an immense destruction of thousands of vessels, this proposal alone will certainly have only a limited impact."
"The expected availability of suitable vessels, taking into account the principles of adaptability and sustainability, will allow us to meet only a fraction of the needs with this short-term measure."
"Doubtless, this specific and focussed action will be followed by other actions in the humanitarian field to address the immense needs also of the fishing sector in the affected countries."
"I can tell you that the Council has already discussed this proposal at a technical level and Member States' reactions are overall very encouraging."
"I also welcome the amendments that were tabled by Parliament, which clearly has this issue very much at heart."
"The Commission can accept a number of them."
"Regarding the other amendments, I note that in many instances they are noteworthy in the sense that they go far beyond what this regulation may provide for and so, very regretfully, they cannot be taken on board as part of this regulation."
"Their spirit, however, is undeniably driven by a clear commitment to alleviate the suffering brought on by the tsunami."
"I hope that the European Parliament will give a positive opinion on this proposal to enable me to move this regulation forward in the Council next Monday, on 28 February."
"This will allow the Member States to make the necessary changes in their internal regulations so that, if the needs are indeed established by FAO, we will be able to act quickly and effectively."
"Let me turn to the amendments."
"The Commission can accept Amendment No 1."
"On Amendment No 2: the Commission is in agreement with the spirit of this amendment, but it is somewhat misplaced and inappropriate to have such a reference to education and training since this aspect is not within the scope with respect to third countries."
"However, I will be willing to make a declaration before adoption by Parliament later on, wherein the Commission will declare that appropriate training and educational measures towards fishermen in the countries hit by the tsunami should be encouraged and wherein the Commission will state its intention to provide an assessment of the needs, at the request of the third countries, through the expert facility which has been made available for the long-term rehabilitation of the fisheries sector in the affected countries."
"On Amendments Nos 3, 18 and 19: again we agree with the spirit of these proposals, but the actions being proposed are provided for by the monitoring mechanism contemplated by the regulation."
"Providing for such detailed and specific amendments within the text of the regulation itself could, however, have the affect of making the regulation cumbersome and too difficult to implement."
"We are, therefore, of the view that there is no need for these specific amendments."
"We can accept Amendments Nos 4 and 5."
"On Amendment No 6: we have no problem with the substance and we are willing to look at this change with the Presidency and the Council and expect to be able to overcome legal and technical difficulties that may arise with introducing changes to a title at a late stage."
"On Amendment No 7: there again we agree with the spirit, but we have difficulty in accepting the amendment because it goes beyond the scope of this regulation."
"On Amendments Nos 8, 9, 11 and 21: again, we agree with the spirit, but we feel that this is not the place to address such wider issues relating to the humanitarian assistance programmes."
"What this regulation enables us to do is to take a very concrete and specific action within the fisheries sector and more specifically within the FIFG regulation."
"Other initiatives will follow, not only to meet the overall humanitarian needs but also for the fisheries sector, but unfortunately they cannot be addressed in this regulation."
"On Amendments Nos 10 and 12: the coming into force of these amendments to Regulation 2792/99 cannot be made dependent to specific requests being made by affected countries."
"I wish to point out that this regulation guarantees the participation of the third countries and I refer honourable Members to Article 1 of the current regulation, which amends Article 7 of the basic regulation, and which states that our actions are to be in accordance with the third countries' request."
"On Amendments Nos 13, 14 and 15: we agree with the spirit of these amendments and we will take them up with the Presidency and the Council to see how best they can be reflected in the regulation."
"On Amendment No 16: the regulation already provides in a number of instances for the assurance that fishing activity will be carried out in a sustainable manner."
"We, therefore, feel that this amendment is already taken into account in the regulation."
"We can accept Amendment No 17, but we would like to limit the scope of the action to small-scale fishing vessels, as defined in Article 3 of Council Regulation 2371/2002 (the CFP reform regulation)."
"On Amendment No 20: we feel that this point is sufficiently covered by the provision under which the vessels to be transferred should be for the benefit of the affected fishing communities, and so this amendment is not required."
"On Amendment No 22: the Commission has difficulty accepting this amendment: whereas technically it may be sound, its scope clearly undermines the spirit with which the regulation is being adopted."
". – Mr President, I know that the Commission proposal is based on the best of good intentions and we support good intentions in the wake of the awful tsunami disaster."
"The trouble is that the road to hell is paved with good intentions."
"20 000 vessels under 12 metres in size were destroyed by the tsunami in the affected countries."
"The Commission proposal is to send somewhere between 150 and 200 old, redundant vessels from the Mediterranean to help replace the 20 000 that were destroyed."
"It is, as the Commission has pointed out, no more than a symbolic gesture."
"It is nevertheless a very expensive symbolic gesture."
"The cost has been put at roughly EUR 9 million, with an additional EUR 400 000 to pay for transporting these vessels to the affected part of the Indian Ocean."
"Therefore we are talking about roughly EUR 47 000 per vessel with the costs to be met entirely by Member States."
"I am reliably told from experts on the ground in the Indian Ocean that replacement vessels of exactly the size required can be built for EUR 2 000 each."
"For the same amount of money that we propose Member States should spend, we could build 3 500 fishing vessels."
"This would be a much more meaningful response."
"The Commission's response to the amendments tabled by the various groups this morning would nevertheless suggest that the entire focus remains on this regulation to transfer vessels."
"I would suggest that the Commission refocuses and looks more closely at sending the things we can provide quickly, such as skilled experts, fishermen, carpenters, engineers, blacksmiths, boat builders, and the money to get people over there, as quickly as possible, to start rebuilding the kind of vessels they need to help replace the ones destroyed, instead of this nonsense of sending redundant, old, decrepit boats from the Mediterranean as a symbolic gesture."
". – Mr President, the destruction of a huge number of boats has meant that an entire sector of the economy has been damaged."
"Aid can come in many different guises, and one way in which emergency aid could be provided would be to transfer fishing boats that would in any case be taken out of commission in the European Union."
"These boats could, then, be taken out of service in the European Union, but the victims of the tsunami in South-East Asia could reuse them if they wished and asked to do so; they would, indeed, be exactly what would meet their requirements."
"In order to provide emergency aid in this way, however, amendments must be made to the legal framework currently in force."
"Most of the members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament welcome this opportunity, which will remain open to us only for a short period of time, although we are obviously aware of the many problems it entails."
"In our opinion helping people to help themselves is always the better option in the long term, and this should be apparent from our amendments."
"Yet we view this proposal as a political sign of solidarity, and will support it accordingly."
"– Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the groundswell of solidarity provoked by the tsunami disaster on Boxing Day may have been even greater among the seafaring community, which is more aware than others of its consequences for populations most of whom lived from the sea’s resources."
"That is why, in response to this, Parliament, in its 13 January resolution, asked for an examination of the possibility of sending to the communities affected anything that might be of assistance to them, including boats."
"That is why Commissioner Borg and his services went to see things for themselves and are now asking us to approve the regulation authorising these potential transfers."
"As Mr Stevenson has just said, this announcement has stirred the feelings of some of my fellow Members, who are alarmed at the idea that Europe was in this way going to salve its conscience by simply sending its old vessels to people who would have no use for them and who would thereby be deprived of the resources essential for getting their economies going again."
"Obviously, that is not what the Commission intends, since it has sent the necessary experts to look at how to reconstruct the devastated countries in the medium and long term."
"Authorising the transfer of a few dozen vessels suitable for the needs of the local populations and therefore requested by their authorities is therefore a short-term measure, one for the next few months."
"As you know, these vessels will be less than 12m long and must be less than 20 years old."
"Before approving the Commission’s draft, as I hope we will, Parliament wanted, by means of a number of amendments, to clarify the terms for this transfer which, in particular, will not be made until the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation has completed the study you mention, Commissioner."
"The FAO has the necessary expertise and authority and is responsible for coordinating aid from all over the world."
"The amendments also seek to introduce new recitals to make clear that this is obviously in addition to the funds granted for the reconstruction of the sector’s industries and infrastructures."
". – Mr President, let us first agree that everyone wants to provide aid as quickly as possible, as effectively as possible."
"It is a nice idea to export old fishing vessels, but it would not work."
"This is a clear case of the emperor’s new clothes."
"Everyone can see that the idea would not work, but no one dares to say so publicly and to scrap the proposal."
"The FAO has not received any request for boats."
"On the contrary, both Indonesia and Sri Lanka have declined such offers."
"In addition, a conference of regional fishing organisations met last week in Sumatra, with representatives from all the countries affected."
"They oppose the export of old vessels."
"They would rather have assistance in building up their local shipyards and fishing fleets."
"That is what we must help them with."
"At all events, our amendments are aimed at reducing the risk of this export of boats destroying sea beds and the local economy and damaging fish stocks with the wrong kind of equipment."
"I hope that the Commission acts on its good intentions, but its voting recommendations could have been more generous."
"Is there anyone from the Council – yes, the Council – in this House?"
"Can you see that the emperor has no clothes and scrap this proposal?"
"Forget about prestige, and see things not from a European perspective but from the point of view of those affected."
". – Mr President, at first glance, this proposal to send surplus EU boats to the disaster-hit areas, where so many vessels have been destroyed, seems an extremely good idea."
"On further consideration, however, all of the difficulties come to mind and, on still further reflection, the question arises as to whether the proposal would create more problems than it would solve and, ultimately, of whether the costs might not outweigh the benefits."
"Firstly: what would be obtained in return for the money?"
"If an amount similar to the total cost were spent on manufacturing boats locally, the benefit to local fisheries would be many times greater."
"It would also have the effect of supporting the local economy and the local shipbuilding industry, which need support in this emergency."
"Secondly: the practicalities."
"Is it really so practical to collect these boats and transport them to the region?"
"How should we handle distribution and allocation?"
"Thirdly, there is the matter of ecology."
"Completely different kinds of fishing are involved, different kinds of equipment are used and different catches are fished for."
"Sending a completely different kind of boat from those traditionally used in the area would be in danger of making fishing less sustainable and less environmentally friendly."
"Fourthly: do the countries intended as recipients of these boats really want them?"
"The answer to this question is, of course, the one we have received from the UN body FAO, which coordinates such matters: ‘no, they do not’."
"No request for these boats has been received; instead, the countries concerned want to be able to build their own boats, using their local traditions and their local techniques."
"Having considered and twice re-considered this proposal, it becomes quite clear that it was a good idea but one that, on closer reflection, should be abandoned."
"It could undoubtedly be improved by adopting the amendments, especially those by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance."
"This would make it a better proposal."
"Most sensible of all, however, would no doubt be for the Commission to understand the situation, withdraw the proposal and instead try to persuade the Member States to provide at least equivalent sums for increasing the number of boats locally in the countries hit by the disaster."
"That would bring greater benefit to those we all wish to help, that is to say the victims of the terrible tsunami disaster."
". – Mr President, Boxing Day saw one of the worst natural disasters of modern times."
"Hundreds of thousands of people lost their lives, millions lost close relatives or their livelihoods."
"The historically unparalleled demonstration of solidarity and generosity with which the rest of the world responded constituted a ray of hope in the middle of this tragedy."
"The fishing industry was hit particularly hard by the tsunami."
"In many cases, the survivors lost their boats, which are the tools upon which their livelihood depends."
"The proposal to help countries hit by the tsunami by giving them vessels from the EU is therefore morally commendable, but the measure would be a drop in the ocean, making the proposal almost absurd."
"A far better alternative would be to buy boats, suited to local purposes and needs, in the countries affected and in other neighbouring countries."
"This would also give the local economies a very badly needed boost."
"Nor is it obvious what constitutes the EU’s role as an international player in such contexts."
"There is a tendency for forces within the EU to use disasters to advance their own positions."
"New EU authorities, programmes and measures are proposed, and anyone questioning this development appears disloyal at this particular moment in history."
"Often, the truth is, however, that, in such situations, the EU Member States should coordinate financial and material resources through other international bodies, principally within the framework of cooperation with the UN."
"One example of this would be the urgent development of an early warning system, of the kind already in place in the Pacific, for tsunami disasters in the Indian Ocean."
"I object to the use of international tragedies for the purpose of giving the EU new powers."
"The EU’s powers must be discussed under normal conditions and in the context of the principle of subsidiarity, and not determined by quick decisions in disaster situations."
"The European peoples’ support for global solidarity should not be abused with a view to undermining the principle of subsidiarity."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, the great options for European aid for the countries affected must be mobilised as soon as possible and, as you have acknowledged, this Parliament has done its duty by approving the urgent procedure."
"Nevertheless, we also believe that it is important to do things quickly, but to do them well."
"In this regard, we can only applaud the fact that humanitarian aid is being directed towards the fishing sector in question, but we believe that opting exclusively for the transfer of vessels is not the most appropriate approach."
"The Commissioner says that she agrees with the spirit of many of the amendments; we would have liked the Commission to have presented a full package of measures to alleviate the problems faced by this sector and we believe that the method presented is not appropriate, since it has been rejected by the NGOs working in the area, which have received this proposal with great reservations."
"The FAO itself has stated that our good intentions may aggravate the problem rather than resolve it and, as far as I know, two countries have said that they do not want ships to be sent, and some of them have extreme restrictions such as, for example, the prohibition of fishing by vessels of more than 10 horsepower."
"It is therefore not sufficient simply to ensure that we do not send large vessels, as the proposal states, but rather we must send appropriate vessels to the area, which are designed to anchor at shallow beaches and are made with materials which are resistant, amongst other things, to high tropical temperatures and humidity."
"There is a further problem, that of funding, and we had been promised it would be resolved."
"In this case, as the Commissioner has quite rightly said, there is no extra funding, which means that this burden is going to affect countries at the expense of an FIFG which has already been promised to them, and I very much doubt that this proposal can be at all effective."
"For all these reasons, we would ask that the amendments which have been presented by the majority of these groups, which we have all signed and which we are going to support, and which propose other alternatives and furthermore propose accepting the European Commission’s proposal, be seen as a political message from this Parliament to the European Commission and the Council, and I hope it will become effective over the coming weeks."
"– Mr President, two months have passed since the tsunami tragedy."
"These two months must have been the most terrible eternity for the many thousands of human beings who have lost not only their families, their homes and their communities, but have also been deprived – and unfortunately remain deprived – of their only means of subsistence, especially those whose livelihood was fishing."
"The proposal tabled by the Commission is therefore a welcome one and should be adopted by Parliament once the proposals for improvement, tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and other parliamentary groups, have been incorporated. The proposal must, however, be assessed realistically and in terms of its actual scale."
"In other words, it should be viewed as a limited, short-term solution that is little more than symbolic, bearing in mind that thousands of boats were destroyed and it is unlikely that this action will help to replace more than a few dozen vessels. In addition, doubt has also been raised as to the suitability of the vessels for their intended purpose, and the logistics of the proposal are becoming complex and costly, especially when it comes to transporting the vessels."
"The initiative does have the merit, however, of demonstrating that the EU has not turned a blind eye to this aspect of the tragedy."
"Yet solidarity will only be effective if we go further, that is, if adequate funding is granted for building and rebuilding vessels , especially small boats and traditional tools that are appropriate for local fishing methods."
"The funding in question can be secured by removing part of the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance from the appropriations allocated to each Member State."
"To sum up, the Commission’s proposal should not be subject to demagogical criticism simply because it falls short of what is needed."
"Our primary objective is to do everything we can to bring it up to speed."
"– Mr President, this is a very difficult one to call."
"No one begrudges help to the people affected by the tsunami."
"Parliament, in its resolution on the tragedy, made special mention of those engaged in fishing, calling on the Commission to examine ways in which tangible aid in the form of vessels, gear, technical expertise and raw materials can be directed towards the affected communities."
"But there have been too many examples in the past of well-intentioned aid being left to rot because it was not suited to local conditions, or because there was not the wherewithal or the expertise to make use of it."
"If decommissioned vessels are to be exported, this must be under stringent conditions as to suitability, processed in accordance with the full assessment of needs, only upon request by the country concerned and accompanied by appropriate assistance."
"Because of concerns about distortions of local economies and the depletion of fish stocks, we also seek some further reassurances."
"First, about where the ownership of vessels will rest and second that this is purely an emergency measure and will not open the back door to a wider export scheme."
"Given such reassurance, and on the understanding that both the Commission and the Council will take our reservations seriously, it is possible to support the proposal."
"The Commissioner has made some commitment in this regard, but I am disappointed by the reluctance to incorporate much by way of amendment into the regulation itself."
"I would urge the Commission and the Council to take a much more comprehensive approach to rebuilding fishing communities."
"The swift commitment of support to projects like that offered by the Maritime Rescue Institute in Stonehaven, Scotland, is just one example, and it is much more directly in tune with Parliament's earlier call."
"– Mr President, it can sometimes be difficult to explain to European tax payers, our constituents, why it makes sense to use their money in order to destroy vessels that may well be seaworthy and which could be used in some way, even for non-fishing purposes."
"However, that does not mean that these vessels are suitable for use in any area."
"The more I have looked into the actual situation in the tsunami-hit countries, the more sceptical I have become about the value of this particular proposal."
"It may be a symbolic gesture and it may be that a small number of vessels could be used or converted, but I do not think that will be of major assistance to areas that were devastated."
"I support the amendments tabled by the various groups."
"I very much regret that the Commission has not agreed to support them."
"If this proposal is adopted in some way by the Council, I believe that the amendments would bring about very considerable improvements, not only to in a practical sense, but to its intention and spirit."
"A measure such as this should be looked at as an enabling measure; not to enable Member States to actively offload unsuitable vessels to the these countries, but to enable those countries that have been affected to request certain vessels to be transferred to their areas if they are suitable for use or conversion."
"Mr President, every once in a while the world is hit by a major natural disaster."
"We are incapable of either predicting or preventing such disasters, and they act as a reminder of how insignificant we are in the face of nature."
"They also remind us that animals are sometimes better at sensing danger and preparing to face it than we are."
"This should act as a warning to us all against feeling too clever, too overconfident and too sure of our own omnipotence."
"There is a force more powerful than we are, and from time to time it humbles us and reminds us of our insignificance."
"The rest of the world responded to the tsunami disaster by making extremely generous donations, whether on an individual, governmental or institutional basis."
"The question that must be asked, however, is whether we will succeed in putting these donations to appropriate use, and whether we will succeed in getting them to where they are most needed."
"Immediately after the disaster, there was a lack of everything, including water, food, tents and blankets."
"The world already has a certain amount of experience in the rapid provision of such items, and aid reached the victims quickly."
"The provision of long-term aid is a different story, though, and another opportunity for us to be reminded of our own small-mindedness."
"Jackals tend to appear wherever money is involved, with the sole aim of snatching something for themselves."
"This gives rise to a number of problems, such as the way in which the money should be shared out, what should be rebuilt first, which institutions or parties should be used to transfer the money and who can be trusted."
"The tsunami destroyed the coastal and seaside economy."
"The tourist industry was hit hardest, including the sex tourism industry, for which many of the regions devastated were renowned, but the fishing industry was also hit."
"The question is whether, and to what extent, money that people have been generous enough to donate should be used to rebuild the sex tourism industry, with its escort agencies, massage parlours and brothels."
"We must also ask ourselves whether we will succeed in reassuring those who have donated money that their money will not be used for such purposes."
"Today we are debating a proposal to transfer fishing boats to fishermen whose livelihoods were destroyed by the tsunami."
"This is the best possible form of assistance that could be provided."
"In the European Union we pay fishermen to scrap their boats."
"Surely, if the boats are still seaworthy we should instead give them to fishermen in the areas hit by the tsunami disaster who have lost their own boats?"
"Provided the costs of transferring fittings for these boats and other related costs are not too high, aid should be targeted at such measures."
"We can be confident that donors will be happy with such an arrangement."
"The proposal deserves our support, but it is only a drop in an ocean of needs."
"We should do more, by allowing aid to be used to build fishing boats that meet the specific needs of the tsunami victims."
"We would then be confronted with the familiar problem of who should benefit from these orders and from being paid to build the boats."
"The countries hit by the tsunami should be the ones to benefit wherever possible, with donor countries taking second place."
"At the same time, those who build the boats must agree to forsake their profit, and to earn only a minimal amount of money."
"We should also rebuild other branches of the coastal industry destroyed by the tsunami, such as the shellfish farming industry, but we should take care to ensure that aid is not granted to the tourist industry, in particular the part of it that preys on human weakness."
"I thank you."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Commission’s laudable desire to transfer Community vessels, which would otherwise be scrapped, to the Asian countries affected by the tsunami disaster is all to its credit."
"It is only right that the European Union should show solidarity when major natural disasters occur."
"All the same, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my concern here about measures of this kind."
"There is a real risk that the vessels sent to the Asian countries will be suited neither to those countries’ fishing habits nor to their environment."
"Worse, they could be a source of pollution."
"Let us not add to the tragedy of the tidal wave that of seeing unsuitable vessels abandoned to pollute those countries’ coastlines."
"My other concern is about the cost of transport."
"The European Commission estimates that transferring fishing vessels from the European Union to the countries affected by the tsunami will cost around EUR 50 000 per vessel."
"In that case, would it not be better to give that money directly to the countries concerned, which could then build far more boats that are in keeping with their traditions, especially since the NGOs that are in contact with the fishermen have told us they can build a vessel for around EUR 1 200?"
"That is why I believe that two essential conditions must be satisfied for Europe’s action."
"The request for the transfer of shipping vessels must come from the Asian countries themselves; it would in fact already appear that neither Indonesia nor Sri Lanka wish to receive any."
"Moreover, the FAO has not received any requests for this kind of transfer."
"I am also convinced that the transfer of the vessels must only be one part of our efforts."
"Community humanitarian aid funds must also be mobilised for the reconstruction of the fishing sector."
"Aid could for example take the form of sending experts and fishermen to help with the rebuilding of the local fishing infrastructures."
"The FAO report we are expecting at the beginning of March will be crucial in determining the strategy to be followed by the Community."
"– Mr President, we were all shocked by the physical and emotional devastation wreaked by the tsunami across south-east Asia on Boxing Day 2004."
"It will be some time before the full extent of the loss and damage suffered by the fishing industry is known."
"But severe losses and/or damage to fishing vessels of all types have been reported from countries affected by the tsunami disaster, in particular Sri Lanka, Thailand, Indonesia and India."
"Sri Lanka, for instance, has lost nearly 70% of its entire fishing fleet, according to a recent report by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations."
"Most of the fishing in the area is carried out by thousands of small boats of around 4.8 m in length."
"As well as the loss of fishermen's lives and boats and gear, harbours, production plants and freezing plants all suffered extensive damage."
"Normal fishing activity cannot resume without intervention and investment."
"Understandably, we want to help."
"The urgency before us today relates to transferring vessels from EU Member States to countries hit by the tsunami."
"The proposal has been strongly criticised, as we hear this morning, as being inappropriate because the climate and fishing practices of EU countries vary from those of south-east Asia."
"I can understand why concern has been expressed over how suitable EU boats may be for fishing in south-east Asia."
"However, I welcome the proposal before us today on the basis that it allows for the transfer of boats that meet the restricted criteria and that might be useful."
"I also welcome amendments tabled on behalf of the PSE Group by Mr Kindermann, both singly and jointly with other groups, in particular the amendments that ensure that adverse effects on fisheries resources and the local economy are avoided, that the transfer is accompanied by any appropriate training, that boats are suitable and that the transfer meets the requirements of the FAO's needs assessments and is requested by the third country."
"On that basis, I am happy to support the urgency and I call on colleagues to do likewise."
"– Mr President, well-intentioned initiatives can sometimes have the wrong consequences."
"This week, the FAO has written to this House to say that, firstly, we were mentioned seven times in the Commission’s proposal, about which it itself was not consulted even once."
"Secondly, it informs us that no governments are currently asking for European boats, and, thirdly, that the vessels and the industrial fish sector on the Atlantic coast are in every respect different from the traditional canoes and catamarans of Sri Lanka and India."
"A fourth point is that local boatyards must do the repair work, for that is what they are good at, and that provides the people there with money, work and the wherewithal to earn a living."
"Our money would buy something like 2500 boats in place of the 200 referred to here."
"Fifthly, we must prevent our vessels from further interfering in the already gravely ravaged fishing grounds and local fishing communities."
"The only conclusion to be drawn from this is: help the local fishermen in the boatyards, but do not send ships, or else, no matter how good our intentions, we will be inflicting another tsunami on the coasts of Asia."
"I am disappointed that the Commission is willing to accept only 3 of this House’s 22 amendments, which, let me add, I was happy to support."
"All this, along with the FAO letter and the reports from the NGOs on the ground, leads me to vote against the report."
"– Mr President, I would just like to make two points."
"Firstly, while the Commission is trying to find innovative solutions to an unprecedented disaster, I would urge it to remain pragmatic about the impact of this gesture."
"This proposal is well-intentioned."
"I appreciate we all want to do all we can to help the hundreds and thousands of people who have lost their homes and their livelihoods because of the tsunami but it is important that this is additional help and not replacement help or help in kind and that this does not count towards the EUR 350 million that the EU has already committed to this."
"Secondly, I would like to ask the Commission to look at the best use for the larger decommissioned boats."
"The fishing communities in India and Thailand were equally devastated and I believe that the more developed fishing industry in these countries may be better placed and better equipped, to use the larger vessels, so this idea should be explored."
"Obviously, these boats will not be of any use to the individual, local fishermen, but they could be used by cooperatives or SME businesses."
"It is important that all the countries are treated equally and that we explore the right avenue for them."
"Mr President, Commissioner, in January 2005 the European Commission and the European Parliament joined the international show of solidarity by taking an instant decision to grant enormous amounts of financial and other assistance to the victims of the tsunami."
"One of the ways in which non-financial assistance will be granted is the transfer of second-hand boats to fishermen who were affected by the tsunami, and who lost not only their families and their closest friends, but also their homes and the means of earning their living."
"When the House held a vote on this resolution on Tuesday morning, no one was in any doubt as to whether to vote in favour."
"This was a natural expression of emotion and solidarity."
"There are a number of questions that must be asked, however."
"Will the Commission pay out compensation to all of those to whom it has been guaranteed?"
"To what extent will this make extra demands upon the European Union’s budget, and why does the Commission wish to transfer some of the cost to the Member States?"
"Will European fishermen who have decided to give up their jobs receive the compensation promised by the EU?"
"Will there be any chance of compensation for companies and steelworks that had already been awarded contracts to demolish boats and had incurred organisational costs, and will jobs created under the previous programme be safeguarded?"
"Should the Commission consider providing assistance for building new ports and shipyards in countries affected by the tsunami, instead of restricting itself to the transfer of old fishing boats?"
"Many thanks."
". Mr President, as always there is no easy answer."
"I shall attempt to address all the questions that have been asked, but I should like to start my answer with a phrase that Mr Kindermann used; ‘a political sign of solidarity’."
"Our aim is to send out precisely such a sign by means of this project, which is merely a small part of a much larger aid measure, and one way in which we can provide aid rapidly and to those who need it."
"With your permission, I am now going to give a more specific answer to a few particular questions."
"First, the question of the calculation."
"I have heard talk of EUR 47 000, 50 000 per vessel."
"As has already been explained to the Committee on Fisheries, these figures are not correct."
"The vessels’ owners are paid a scrapping premium for them in any case."
"The only thing that changes is that the vessels are not scrapped but transferred, and the transport cost is no more than EUR 4 000 per vessel."
"That is therefore the cost to be taken into account and not the fanciful figures that have been mentioned."
"Incidentally, they are not small boats."
"Small boats like dinghies can of course be rebuilt on the spot. What we are talking about here, however, are medium-sized vessels of not more than 12 metres, and the necessary capacity for building such vessels does not exist on the spot."
"Another question was about the age of the vessels."
"The average age of European vessels in service is 25 years; that of the vessels that will be exported to the countries affected by the tsunami will be between 5 and 20 years."
"We are not therefore talking about very old boats."
"On the question of experts, I would like to say that experts have already been sent out and more will be sent."
"Moreover, it is at our request that the FAO is making an assessment of needs and this point will be on the agenda for the 12 March ministerial meeting, at which Mr Borg will represent the Commission."
"We are all in favour of close cooperation with the FAO; we will see to it that our experts are able to contribute."
"So far as the establishment of the early warning system is concerned, together with experts from international bodies, the Commission is in the process of setting up early warning systems by transferring our technologies to the countries concerned."
"Mr President, I would like to say very clearly that the condition of the vessels and their suitability for the needs will be examined by experts."
"The needs will be assessed by the FAO."
"We want to be ready if requests come in."
"We have already had a request for vessels from Thailand."
"Finally, Mr President, I believe this is a moral question."
"Can we continue to scrap vessels here if they can be of use to fishermen on the other side of the world?"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place during voting time, which will follow shortly."
"I should like now to announce to the House and, at the same time, welcome to the distinguished visitors' gallery, the delegation from the Turkish Grand National Assembly led by vice-president Professor Dumanoglu."
"The delegation attended the 5th meeting of the EU-Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee yesterday and today."
"– Mr President, on a point of order."
"At the beginning of this debate, the Commission informed us that it would not accept most of the amendments that have been agreed between the political parties in this House."
"That now means that instead of sending meaningful help to the devastated fishing communities by way of skilled experts, fishermen, engineers, boat-builders and money, we are going to send one or two old, redundant boats at massive cost as a purely political gesture."
"That is not helpful."
"The FAO has written to the chairman of the Committee on Fisheries to explain that Sri Lanka and Indonesia reject this help."
"They do not want these boats."
"Under these circumstances we should think again, before the final resolution is voted upon."
"I would suggest that we are not in the business of political gestures; we are in the business of giving real, meaningful help to the fishing communities that have lost their livelihoods and their lives."
"Meaningful help does not mean sending one or two redundant boats from the Mediterranean."
"I hope that we will therefore reject the Commission proposal."
". Mr President, you will not be surprised if I tell you that the Commission does not agree at all with what has just been said."
"There was probably a little too much noise in this House just now to hear what the Commission said at the end of the debate."
"So far as the cost is concerned, I will repeat what I said so that everyone can hear."
"There is no cost of EUR 47 000, 50 000 or 100 000 per vessel."
"In any case, these are vessels the owners of which are paid a scrapping premium."
"Now the final destination for these vessels is not scrapping but transfer; that is what has changed."
"The transfer of a vessel costs EUR 4 000 at the most, and they are vessels that are too large to be built on the spot."
"Finally, we are supplying such vessels only if we are asked for them."
"At present, we have a request from Thailand."
"– Mr President, I would like to propose an oral amendment in relation to Amendment No 7 presented by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, on which we will vote next."
"This is a very important amendment, Mr President, and, together with others, our political group’s final position on the important report on the next meeting of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva will depend on it."
"Since this amendment is presented by the Socialist Group, I have spoken, rather than to the author — who is not in the chamber at the moment — to Mr Howitt, and I have proposed to him that, in order that our group may take a favourable position, we focus on the second part of this amendment and remove the first part."
"Mr President, I shall simply propose an option on behalf of my group and I believe that the authors of the amendment agree with it."
"The political groups clearly have the right to oppose, but we also have the right to vote against the report."
"I therefore intend to take this opportunity, Mr President, to try to unite the house in relation to this report."
"I believe that the essential content of the amendments is preserved, although our group is against it, and that this may be a reasonable solution that would allow our group to vote in favour of the resolution in the end."
"– Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group, as I understand it, Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra proposes removing the word 'deplore' as part of a deal that maintains the support for the Brazilian initiative in this paragraph."
"The Socialist Group accepts that proposal."
"I have just spoken to the President of the Subcommittee on Human Rights and I appeal to other groups to support it because it will enable this report to be agreed in full."
"– To be quite clear, I want to ask Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra whether he is in fact proposing that we remind the Presidency of his request to continue its efforts in support of the Brazilian initiative concerning discrimination based on orientation and sexual identity by seeking other countries’ support for a resolution on this problem."
"Is that it?"
"Does he want to repeat the terms?"
"In fact, if we delete the first part, we will have to restate what it is about in the second part."
"–Mr President, this is the situation specifically."
"I believe that a majority will be in favour of this proposal."
"We are clearly opposed to it."
"But in these terms, I believe that, in the end, if the result of the rest of the vote on the amendment is positive, our group could consider taking a favourable position."
"– Mr President, I should like to point out, on behalf of the Socialist Group and my colleague, Mrs Valenciano Martínez-Orozco, that we believe there may be an error on the voting list concerning Amendment 15, tabled by the PPE-DE Group."
"This amendment mentions the recent declaration of the Donors Conference for Colombia held in Cartagena."
"Also involved are the identical Amendments 4, 19 and 23, tabled by the Socialist and ALDE Groups."
"These concern support for the recommendations of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia."
"These are clearly not mutually exclusive."
"It would be quite wrong for Amendments 4, 19 and 23 to fall if Amendment 15 is adopted, as the voting list suggests."
"The services have advised me that this problem can be resolved by voting on the PSE and ALDE amendments as recital Ia (new), rather than as amendments to recital I. I ask for your support on this, Mr President."
"In conclusion, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is established in Bogota by agreement with the Colombian Government."
"It is actually funded by the European Union."
"I hope the entire House will reaffirm its support for the work of the Office by supporting the PPE-DE amendments and the PSE/ALDE amendments."
"Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra agrees that it should be voted separately, although he advises his Group to vote against."
"I regret that, but I am grateful for his support in the technical matters concerning these amendments."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to apologise for tabling a last-minute amendment."
"I believe this is an important amendment, however, as it could help ensure the adoption of legislation that would benefit millions of EU citizens."
"Paragraph 7 is divided into two parts, and I propose that the following text be added at the end of its first part: ‘in accordance with the decisions taken by Parliament’s Committee on Legal Affairs on 2 February 2005 and by its Conference of Presidents on 17 February 2005’."
"After this amendment, the first part of paragraph 7 would read as follows: ‘invites the Commission to review its proposal for the software patents directive in accordance with the decisions taken by Parliament’s Committee on Legal Affairs on 2 February 2005 and by its Conference of Presidents on 17 February 2005’."
"The second part of the paragraph would be left unchanged."
"I thank you."
"– Mr President, concerning Amendment No 15, I would like it to be considered as a supplement."
"In that case, we could vote in favour, if not we will vote against."
"– Mr President, could I ask the Verts/ALE Group to accept this amendment as a supplement to the paragraph and not as a substitute for it?"
"– Yes, Mr President, for Amendment No 21 we would like it to be a supplement."
"In that case, we could vote for it, if not we will vote against."
"– Mr President, I merely wished to extend my sincere thanks to all Members, especially those on the Right, who voted in favour of our amendments."
"Unfortunately those Members were too few in number, and not enough consideration has been given to the social concerns that are of such crucial importance to us and to the public."
"This means that we cannot vote in favour of this resolution, and we will continue to fight for the public’s social rights."
". – The conflicts and general developments in Côte d’Ivoire constitute a significant political issue."
"The UN has a commitment with regard to this conflict and, by means of Resolution 1572 (2004), has decided to introduce restrictive measures against Côte d’Ivoire."
"This resolution was adopted by the UN Security Council."
"The UN is, and must remain, engaged in international issues."
"The June List does not believe that the EU Member States should coordinate their respective commitments as members of the UN within the framework of EU cooperation."
"There is a general tendency for the EU to attempt to promote its foreign policy positions."
"We object to this development and recommend that there be national foreign policies, together with international cooperation within the UN."
"Our fundamental view is that the EU should not be involved or engaged in issues of foreign policy."
"We have consequently chosen to vote against this report."
". The most important issue addressed by this report is the effectiveness with which the EU deals with its international obligations, especially those arising from the fact that all of its Member States are Members of the United Nations."
"In this context, and bearing in mind the Union’s legal structure, this proposal for a Council regulation makes perfect sense."
"Nonetheless, the intention of this proposal is to implement sanctions – and they will hopefully be implemented with the necessary rigour – intended to thwart anyone who may constitute a threat to the peace and national reconciliation process in Côte d’Ivoire."
"Given the fragile nature of this peace and national reconciliation process, it requires all the international protection that it can be accorded."
"Furthermore, the sanctions laid down in this proposal do not concern – nor are they intended to concern – the wider population; rather, they are solely aimed at certain persons. It is therefore evident that they are both useful and just."
"For these reasons, I voted for the report."
". – The aim of the proposal for a directive on unfair commercial practices is to increase harmonisation of rules on unfair commercial practices that harm consumers’ financial interests."
"The directive is to help improve the functioning of the internal market and strengthen consumer protection."
"The proposal bans unfair commercial practices."
"We wholeheartedly support the completion of the internal market and effective consumer protection."
"The reason that we are unable to support the proposal for a directive in its current form is that it threatens to result in Sweden being unable in the long run to retain its ban on TV advertising aimed at children."
"We do not want to be instrumental in weakening the existing rules on advertising aimed at children and have therefore chosen to abstain in the final vote on the Bresso report in its entirety."
". I warmly welcome this proposal to outlaw sharp practices by rogue traders."
"Many of my constituents have suffered as a result of the kinds of behaviour this will hopefully bring to an end."
"For example, one of the practices targeted by the legislation is prize draw swindles, where consumers and encouraged – often via mobile phone text messaging – to ring a premium-rate number for a prize that does not exist."
"This new legislation will overhaul disparate national rules across the 25 nations of the EU and make it easier for consumers to take legal action against unduly aggressive or misleading selling methods."
"It will also introduce a ‘general duty’ to trade fairly."
". One of the essential prerequisites for the smooth running of the capitalist economic model is genuine freedom of choice for consumers, and genuine freedom of choice only exists when, , consumers are properly and accurately informed about the products and services that they purchase."
"It is also true, however, that the overregulation of business is a barrier to standardisation and harmonisation and ultimately renders competition unworkable."
"When the issues are viewed from this perspective, the directive of the European Parliament and the Council concerning unfair business to consumer practices in the internal market clearly manages to achieve, as stated in the report, ‘sufficient harmonisation of mutual recognition of national legislation’, resulting in a proposal for a directive that the report rightly deems ‘properly balanced’."
"Accordingly, I voted in favour."
"– Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance shares the universal concern that it should be ensured that the viability of the fishing communities in the regions affected by the tsunami be secured, but it has to be said, ladies and gentlemen, that the present regulation is a bad idea and a poor proposal."
"We have had advice from the WWF and from the NGOs on the ground, and I have also sought an opinion from the FAO."
"It is evident that the boats that we want to send there are completely inappropriate, being different in terms of structure; the fishing techniques used are different, and, without adaptation, aid can be counter-productive in its effects."
"The operational maintenance of the boats we are willing to donate will also bring problems in its train."
"Let me add to that the fact that the FAO confirmed to me that most of the fishing grounds in that area have been over-fished and that we have to take into account the limited biological capacities that exist there."
"It is a matter of absolute necessity that fishing techniques be adapted accordingly."
"As if that were not enough, ladies and gentlemen, the FAO also stresses that the affected countries do not wish to import vessels, whether old or new."
"The Indonesian and Sri Lankan Governments have themselves told the FAO that they have no desire for such action."
"The authorities and the fishing community would far rather receive support in building boats for themselves, adapted to local traditions and methods of fishing."
"The FAO has confirmed that there is ample technical capacity in the area to build these vessels there."
"In short, this sort of support is unwanted and inappropriate."
"The Commission has even stated that it will accept only 3 of the 21 amendments we have passed, and so, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a very large majority of my group has voted against this proposal for a regulation."
"– Mr President, I voted for this proposal, but I have to admit it was a difficult call to make."
"In the end, I voted for it because I see it as giving the Commission permission to investigate the transfer of vessels to the tsunami region; it does not mean, even with this vote, that they have to go ahead with it."
"I insist that the Commission take the FAO advice before taking any action; that they only respond to requests from tsunami countries and do not impose the transfer of vessels on any particular country; and that they carry out a full cost/benefit analysis of shipping boats to the tsunami region, as opposed to building boats in that region."
"Today, we have given the Commission the green light to change the regulations."
"What we have not said is that, even if they change the regulations, they should necessarily then start to send the vessels."
"That decision should be based on other considerations."
"– Mr President, like my colleague, Mr David Martin, I found this to be a difficult vote."
"I voted against this resolution with a heavy heart but I did so for practical and sensible reasons."
"I was very disappointed by the Commissioner's lacklustre explanation and her rationale for rejecting Parliament's amendments."
"They were amendments that would have moved the vote in the right direction."
"Nevertheless, I believe that the proposal was a flawed gesture from the EU and not the sort of aid we should be intent on sending."
"I was in the north and east of Sri Lanka recently."
"I saw at first hand the devastation."
"I saw boats ruined and lives devastated, but I saw nothing to make me believe that discarded, old, unwanted European vessels would be of use to them."
"Nor can I believe it is economic to try to transfer them: a few hundred boats to replace thousands that were lost."
"The people of Sri Lanka and elsewhere in South Asia need real help."
"Eight-and-a-half weeks on from 26 December, here we are offering a few clapped-out boats."
"I believe in real aid; helping the people to rebuild their lives themselves."
"Give them the tools to build their own boats, suitable vessels."
"Lend them the labour, by all means."
"Help them make nets for continued fishing and everything else that they need."
"At the moment that aid is not getting through in the way that it should."
"We should not be in the business of just making gestures, however well-meaning they are."
"– Mr President, thank you for this opportunity to give a very brief statement about my vote on the transfer of vessels to countries hit by the tsunami."
"I completely agree with Mr Evans."
"I think that the region needs real help, not some symbolic gesture from the European Union."
"I was very disappointed with the answers we received from the Commission as regards our criticism and amendments."
"Right up until the last minute I was undecided whether I would vote for or against, but in the end I voted against."
"This statement explains my decision."
". – The tsunami disaster is a major international tragedy requiring global solidarity and generosity."
"We have chosen to vote in favour of the proposal."
"In our opinion, however, the UN is the international body best suited to providing humanitarian aid in connection with international disasters."
"The UN has broader international support and greater experience in handling crisis situations than the EU."
"We disapprove of the EU taking every opportunity to promote and strengthen its own position and influence."
"In addition, there is good cause to question whether sending vessels from EU Member States to the countries hit by the tsunami is the most appropriate way of helping."
"An alternative contribution would be to buy the vessels locally."
"This would simplify the relief effort and contribute to the development of the local economies of the countries hit by the tsunami."
". The tsunami disaster had an enormous impact on the fisheries sector in India, Indonesia, Myanmar, the Maldives, Somalia, Sri Lanka and Thailand."
"Figures show that thousands of fishermen died, 110 000 vessels were destroyed, with the costs in the sector rising to around EUR 400 million, more than EUR 450 million if one includes repairing damaged port facilities."
"The scale of the disaster means that a major effort is required on the part of the international community to support the rebuilding of this key sector"
"Unfortunately, the proposal to transfer vessels to these countries that were destined for the scrapheap in the various Member States illustrates the hypocrisy of nominal and barely practicable aid that does not address the needs on the ground."
"We have arrived at the unheard-of situation of there having been no request from the countries affected."
"According to the figures, with the money spent on sending out these vessels, 9 600 new ones suited to the fishing methods used in those countries could be built."
"We therefore support the amendments aimed at turning this Commission proposal into humanitarian aid and financial and technical aid to develop the fisheries sector in the countries affected."
"We must ensure compliance with the concept of transferring boats if requested and with the criteria laid down by the Food and Agriculture Organisation."
"We voted in favour, in order to rectify a mistake."
". I voted in favour of the proposal as amended, substantially improved, by the European Parliament."
"In particular, my own amendments, which were supported by a large majority make it clear that this should be only part of a wide range of necessary measures to aid the fishing communities around the Indian Ocean."
"The challenge laid down by the European Parliament is to the European Commission to change its mind and accept our amended proposal, and to the Council of Ministers to follow the strong lead which we have given in this matter."
". Despite my heartfelt sympathy for the victims of this unimaginable tragedy, I voted against the Council regulation, for the reasons I shall now explain."
"No estimates have been made of the costs this measure will incur, although preliminary analyses indicate that they could be enormous."
"The fishing boats sent out will be old ones that would otherwise have been scrapped."
"In other words, they no longer meet basic safety requirements."
"This is essentially the same as what happened in Poland during the 1997 floods, when flood victims were sometimes sent completely worn out clothes that were not fit to wear."
"The European fishing boats in question were built to operate in conditions that are entirely different from those prevailing in the countries affected by the tsunami."
"It has become very clear from what we have heard that countries such as Sri Lanka and the Philippines have absolutely no desire to be helped in this way."
"For these and other reasons, I am inclined to believe that the sending of around 150 fishing boats is intended to appease European consciences and to be a symbolic gesture."
"Genuine assistance is what is needed, however, not symbols."
"Seen in this light, it must unfortunately be concluded that the Council regulation does not make sense."
". – The European Parliament voted today on a proposal whereby small fishing vessels no longer used in the EU would be transferred to fishing communities hit by the tsunami."
"I fully agree about how important it is for the fishing industries of the countries hit to recover."
"On the other hand, I do not believe that transferring fishing boats, as put forward in the proposal for a regulation, is the right way to proceed."
"Transferring a number of fishing boats will not meet existing needs."
"In addition, support for the fishing industries of the countries hit should be adapted to local needs and local demand."
". – I am voting against this resolution, as I consider it to be contrary to the principles of the market economy."
"Experience in Sweden shows that the solutions proposed in the resolution will make no impact on the problems there is a desire to solve."
". – The June List does not believe that the European Parliament should become involved in deciding where enterprises should locate their production."
"Each Member State should be free to conduct its own industrial policy within the framework of competition law."
"The survival of the European steel industry depends on its competitiveness on the international market, not on protection and subsidies."
". I voted in favour of the resolution on future prospects for the steel industry."
"The steel industry is one of the areas in which technological development is crucial and in which we have come across a number of examples of areas of production viewed as models in terms of their technological know-how."
"These industrial activities account for a large proportion of the population of the enlarged Europe and, in recent years, there has been substantial public investment in innovation and development in European industrial interests."
"I should like to point out that much of that investment has come from Community funds and that clear and practical rules are required as to how those funds are used."
"We must not allow the businesses concerned to sidestep the agreed conditions on the basis of which they enjoy those subsidies, obligations such as long-term production in the territory and maintaining jobs."
"The situation is all the more serious when, as mentioned in the resolution, the business concerned registers positive net results and economic growth, and yet takes the inexplicable decision to relocate or to close the plant in question."
".– We express our undivided solidarity and support for the workers at the Thyssen Krupp steelworks in Terni in Italy, who are fighting for the right to work and for industrial steel production to be protected and against the anti-labour policy of the EU and of the company, which is expressed in terms of coercion and threats of further redundancies."
"Nonetheless, we abstained from the vote on the joint motion for a resolution by the European Parliament because:"
"- it places the workers' interest within the Lisbon strategy, which is an assault on employment rights and which promotes mass redundancies and unemployment;"
"- it equates the interests of workers being made redundant with the competitiveness of the European monopolies and of this specific industrial group and pleads for social cohesion, meaning the abolition of the class struggle to reverse mass redundancies;"
"- it calls for more 'corporate social responsibility', thereby cultivating the dangerous delusion that monopolies can be pro-worker and pro-grass roots."
"The state of the steel industry is the result of capitalist restructurings, market liberalisation and the concentration of capital."
"The European Union itself and the governments of the Member States have strengthened big business in the practices of restructuring, relocating and shutting down units and activities, indifferent to the social consequences."
"The right to work and satisfaction of contemporary grass-roots needs will be achieved through the working-class and grass-roots fight against the ΕU and its anti-labour policy."
"– Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I should like to give the following explanation of vote with regard to the vote on the human rights report. We have voted in favour of the report as a whole, although there are a number of key paragraphs in it that we have been unable to endorse, above all the one relating to reproductive health and the Brazilian initiative."
"I should like to stress that our Group voted against these points because we do not wish the human rights report to be used as a pretext for the liberalisation of abortion through the back door."
"– Mr President, with this resolution on human rights we have looked at the situation in a very large number of countries of the world, which are mentioned in the United Nations report."
"There are so many, it would be impossible for me to list them all."
"What is worse, a recital to the resolution that was adopted expresses concern that not enough of them are mentioned."
"This disturbing list of countries does not include any Member States of the European Union."
"That really is a problem, ladies and gentlemen, because I think we ought to put our own house in order first, the Kingdom of Belgium for example, where we have recently witnessed the sorry spectacle of an unbelievable legal action brought by an agency directly dependent on Prime Minister Verhofstadt and financed by him."
"I am referring to the ‘Centre for Equal Opportunities’, the director of which is a Dominican by the name of Johan Leman, a new kind of Torquemada, who, following scandalous proceedings, brought about the prohibition of the Vlaams Blok, a perfectly legal and peaceful party, simply because of its beliefs."
"It is an absolute scandal, but it has never been mentioned in this House other than by members of the political grouping in question."
"Finally, what should we say about the situation in many European countries, including France?"
"France, where ‘thought crime’ is hunted down in many fields; where making reference to the crimes of communism during the second world war is banned on the pretext of revisionism; where criticism of immigration policy is banned on the pretext of combating racism; where mentioning a legitimate national preference is banned on the pretext of fighting xenophobia; where, only recently, on the outrageous initiative of Mr Perben, stating a preference for the natural family over homosexual or lesbian partnerships is banned on the pretext of fighting homophobia; that is the scandal our Parliament should be concerned about."
". I am very much in favour of the work of the UNHCR in Geneva, but I do think sometimes we should proceed a little more carefully, engaging in real versus resolutionary politics."
"The European Union had a human rights dialogue with North Korea modelled on our human rights dialogue with China."
"This was suspended in 2003 when the EU sponsored in Geneva a highly critical human rights resolution on North Korea without even informing our interlocutors in advance."
"At a recent meeting I attended in Geneva on the issue of human rights in North Korea, in the presence of the special rapporteur for North Korea, we were told we must have a new resolution next month because there was no dialogue, something we lost with the initial resolution."
"It might have been worth considering whether a real ongoing dialogue might do more to assist improving human rights than merely passing resolutions."
". On behalf of the European Parliamentary Labour Party, can I stress that we strongly support human rights and the call for free elections in Zimbabwe."
"That is why we specifically support, in today's resolution, condemnation of the failure of the EU's resolution on Zimbabwe at the UNCHR last year, calling for the EU once again to co-sponsor a resolution condemning human rights abuses in Zimbabwe in Geneva this year."
"Today we voted against EPP amendment 12 for the technical reason that it simply duplicates these political positions, which were already contained in Parliament's text."
". – The resolution by the Committee on Foreign Affairs expresses in its entirety the reactionary, aggressive and anti-grass roots foreign policy of the ΕU and its imperialist character."
"It uses as a pretext human rights and their selective protection, legitimising intervention in and even war against countries."
"It is no coincidence that the long list of countries on which the UN is called upon to issue condemnatory resolutions also includes countries in the immediate sights of imperialism (Cuba, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Iran, Belarus, Zimbabwe and so on)."
"It refers to violations in dozens of countries, but is provokingly silent on the subject of the human rights of the hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, Afghans, Palestinians and so on murdered during the imperialist wars and interventions."
"On the contrary, it collectively condemns Iraqi and grass-roots resistance in general as terrorism."
"It hypocritically emphasizes the protection of the fundamental freedoms which it massacres with the so-called anti-terrorist laws which criminalise social struggles."
"The references to poverty, hunger, environmental pollution, health, education and so on are an insult to the grass-roots classes and millions of people in the third world who are deprived of fundamental human rights as a result of the (temporary) imperialist and capitalist dominion."
"That is why we MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece shall vote against the resolution."
". The EU and its 25 Member States must endeavour to look upon the forthcoming 61st session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights as a further opportunity to put into practice the stated and repeatedly reaffirmed values of the EU and each of its 25 Member States."
"The EU has undoubtedly been a factor in the expansion of the defence of human rights, both in its relations with third countries – although some serious anomalies continue to exist – and, particularly, throughout its enlargement process, whereby the expectation of accession or some kind of privileged partnership with the Union has led to some welcome reforms in various countries."
"What we must do – beyond saying that the content is right but the practice is failing – is be consistent with the values that we state, both as a Union and as countries."
"This is the idea that must be uppermost in the minds of those participating in the 61st session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights when it gets underway."
"The world will only be a better place if someone shows the way forward, and we should be that someone."
"It was in this spirit that I voted in favour."
". I welcome this resolution and the support it gives to G8 countries in their plans for up to 100% debt relief to the world's poorest countries."
"It is important that money for debt cancellation comes from new funds and the diversion of existing resources for development."
"To this end debt relief must be treated and reported separately from aid."
"Developing countries must be encouraged to use funds saved from debt repayments to finance core services such as health and education without which it will be practically impossible to achieve the Millennium Development Goals."
"In this context it is important that the poorest countries are not subject to undue pressure to liberalise their service sector in reciprocity for EU trade liberalisation."
". I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution on action against hunger and poverty because I feel that we must keep a close eye on all of the measures that have been proposed and put in place to combat this scourge that affects millions of people around the world."
"I should like to reiterate my deep concern at the delay in meeting the deadlines for complying with the millennium development goals and to point out that debt and trade relief are key factors to be taken into account when drawing up measures to fund development."
"The main challenge that we face is the difficulty in finding the right means of ensuring that the poorest countries receive transparent and effective help."
"The Member States and the Commission must continue the work done in this area on a continuous basis and must be alive to any potential new initiatives, be they private or public, that may contribute towards raising the level and effectiveness of aid, towards debt relief for the poorest countries in the world and towards international trade, which plays a crucial role in eradicating the root causes of poverty and hunger."
"– Mr President, I want to give an explanation of vote on the Commission's legislative work programme."
"I did not vote to support this report because, while much of the content of the work programme is acceptable, I was concerned about what is not there."
"I am concerned that the EU continues to overregulate; it continues to produce legislation that is too detailed, imposes too much red tape on enterprise, and is significantly harming the prosperity of Europe and its Member States, including, of course, the United Kingdom."
"I am also concerned that we do not see serious enough measures put in place in this work programme to try and get serious financial control over the EU budget."
"It is not acceptable that, for nearly a decade, the EU has failed to produce a budget that is capable of being signed off by its own auditors, and that over 80% of the EU budget is not properly accounted for."
"It is taxpayers' money, and I would have liked to have seen a Commission work programme that took this scandalous situation much more seriously and proposed action to deal with it."
"I would also very much like to see a Commission work programme that considered ways in which powers could be returned to Member States, to decentralise power in the European Union, rather than driving forward more integration with the euro and the European constitution, both of which I firmly oppose."
"One thing I am pleased about is that Amendment 64, the amendment on Cyprus, proposed by the Liberal Group, was rejected."
"That would have sought to increase economic ties with the unrecognised regime in Northern Cyprus."
"It is important that we give financial support to Northern Cyprus, but that must be through the recognised democratic Government of the Republic of Cyprus."
"It would not be acceptable to have direct links with a regime that is not recognised."
"The reason for the embargo is the initial invasion by Turkey that took place so many years ago."
"This is not an international boycott: it is simply that the regime there is not capable of issuing export certificates."
"Therefore, the embargo is a reflection of the illegal nature of the invasion by Turkey."
"That is why I cannot vote to lift the embargo, but I would support legitimate financial support being given to Northern Cyprus but only with the consent and cooperation of, and via, the democratic, recognised, lawful Government of Cyprus."
". When what is really required is a sea change in the orientations and objectives of Community policies, by revoking the Stability and Growth Pact and replacing it with a Growth and Employment Pact, along with root and branch changes to the Lisbon strategy in order to put an end to the liberalisations and privatisations in industries and essential public services and to give absolute priority to the creation of jobs with rights and to the fight against poverty and social exclusion, the Commission continues to follow the path of even greater liberalisation; that is, more of the same."
"When it is disclosed that the operating profits of the large companies in the EU rose by almost 80% in 2004, and that the percentage of profits as a proportion of GDP in the euro zone is currently approaching its highest level in the past 25 years; while salary levels continue to fall, yet both the trade balance and the balance of payments on current accounts in the euro zone have registered positive results in the past 12 months, we cannot accept the prevailing strategic importance that the Commission attaches to competitiveness and on the structural economic reforms."
"It is also unacceptable that the new Social Policy Agenda is deprived of both the necessary instruments and adequate financial resources, ..."
". My EPLP colleagues and I abstained on the final vote as we did not wish to vote against the whole resolution."
"We believe that the Commission Work Programme takes forward the Lisbon Agenda and details some necessary environmental action."
". – I shall be voting against the Commission’s legislative work programme, presented by Mr Barroso, for the following reasons."
"It says nothing about the withdrawal of the directive on services or of the country of origin principle."
"It gives no precise commitment for a framework directive on public services. There is no upward fiscal and social harmonisation, and the anti-social trends of the draft ‘working hours directive’ are maintained."
"It calls for flexibility, for structural reforms to take account of ageing, which will call retirement schemes and labour law into question."
"Its industrial policy is weak, containing no sectoral plans for sectors such as textiles, nor a strategy to prevent relocation."
"It lacks ambition in development aid, especially with the creation of a tax on capital movements."
"It is clear that this programme does not make for the creation of a genuinely social Europe, but will instead pose a threat to the present European social model."
"It confirms the ultraliberal tendencies of the Barroso Commission."
". I welcome the Commission's intention to promote policies designed to get the European economy moving."
"However, I am not convinced that the programme presented to Parliament strikes an appropriate balance between being ‘pro-business’ while continuing to promote social inclusion and sustainable development."
"Economic, social and environmental policy do not appear to be addressed in an integrated way."
"For example, I am concerned that no proposals to promote equality of opportunities between men and women or to reduce economic disparities between regions are included in the work programme."
"I also find it unacceptable that the Commission does not foresee any legislative action in the priority area of climate change."
".– The barbaric reality experienced by the workers and the peoples is the result of the imperialist policy of war, the policies of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, exploitation by the multinationals and predatory free trade agreements."
"The ΕU and the European monopolies are jointly responsible for the situation."
"Neither resolution contests the unfair international economic order or its causes."
"They pass in silence over the attack on workers' rights and the general wave of privatisations, even in health and education, under policies implemented by conservative and social-democrat governments."
"They have deleted all reference to the unfair, imperialist wars against Iraq, Afghanistan and so on."
"Universal problems are deliberately projected, so as to conceal the class character of the policies applied for the benefit of big business."
"Both resolutions cultivate the theory of social assent and social partnership in a bid to bring the workers and other movements to subordination and subjugation to capitalist barbarity."
"The motion by the European People's Party and the Liberals proposes the formulaic solution of the free market, WTO agreements and G7 agreements, while the other resolution proposes a more democratic form of global governance, which will never come about through the dominion of the imperialist class."
"To conclude, an effort is being made to legalise the reactionary Davos guidelines on the pretext of the World Social Forum, by projecting the message that a world other than a capitalist world is not feasible."
"The Communist Party of Greece will vote against both resolutions."
". I voted in favour of the resolution on the World Social Forum and the World Economic Forum."
"I feel that globalisation offers genuine opportunities for growth and for improving standards of living throughout the world."
"I should like to highlight the work of these two fora each with its own perspective, in addressing global issues such as the fight against poverty, health, education, trade, agriculture and human rights."
"I wish to restate my belief that globalisation must be accompanied by strenuous efforts aimed at reducing poverty; we must recognise the value of cancelling debt as a means of fighting poverty in countries where progress is made towards democratisation, respect for human rights, the rule of law and a sustainable economy."
"I wish to restate my belief that globalisation is a key element in promoting competitiveness and growth in the EU and in developing countries. I therefore feel it is essential to establish a worldwide system of free and fair trade."
"I also wish to point out that this work is being done primarily by the World Trade Organisation, the main forum for managing globalisation by means of opening up trade, by strengthening multilateral standards and the pursuit of sustainable development."
". I voted in favour of the joint resolution on the parliamentary elections in Moldova."
"Within the scope of the European Neighbourhood Policy, Moldova continues to pursue the reforms in the Action Plan, which was drawn up to promote and consolidate democracy, respect for the values of the rule of law and respect for human and civil rights."
"The political and institutional reforms will offer the country gradual integration into the EU’s policies and programmes."
"Accordingly, I wish to restate my belief that the forthcoming elections will be an important yardstick for measuring the Moldovan authorities’ commitment to democratic standards."
"I also note with concern that the situation as regards access to information in Moldova has yet to be resolved. Parliament therefore expects from the elections a clear sign that the Moldovan Government will ensure that the parliamentary elections will be free and fair, both on election day itself and throughout the election campaign."
"I am sure that my country, which has a large Moldovan community, will work with the Moldovan diplomatic authorities to find ways of helping the highest possible number of Moldovan immigrants to have access to the ballot box."
". We voted in favour of this important report on promoting health and safety at the workplace, drawn up by a Member of our Group, which contains a number of very positive proposals."
"The figures cited in the communication are alarming: 5 200 workers lose their life as a result of work-related accidents per year."
"Throughout the EU there are about 4.8 million work-related accidents per year."
"About two thirds of accidents lead to an absence of more than three days at work and almost 14% of workers suffer more than one accident in a year."
"This means that around 158 million days’ work are lost annually, and nearly 300 000 workers will get various degrees of permanent disabilities resulting from a workplace-related accident or disease every year."
"It is estimated that the total cost to the economy amounts to between 2.6% and 3.8% of GNP."
"These data are evidence of the high economic cost of not having appropriate social policy in place, which constitutes a major obstacle to attaining the strategic objective of full employment."
"The framework directive could go further and could be more practical..."
"The proposals tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats are unacceptable."
". – The June List has chosen to vote against the own-initiative report on health and safety at the workplace."
"This report deals with important issues, and the June List supports many of the basic ideas proposed."
"A good working environment is important for all employees."
"The June List is of the opinion, however, that each Member State must be permitted to decide for itself how it wants to achieve a good working environment."
"As far as Sweden is concerned, for example, it is a matter for negotiation between the social partners, and not a matter for regulation by EU legislation."
". I congratulate Mr Maštálka on his important report on promoting health and safety at the workplace, to which I offer my support, particularly as regards the need to strengthen the system of prevention as a key means of increasing safety at work and of reducing the number of work-related accidents."
"It is now fundamental for the Commission to examine the state of Member States’ preventive systems in greater detail and to come forward with proposals, in cooperation with the competent national authorities, for framing coherent national prevention policies based on an overall EU strategy."
"To this end, it is essential to improve the statistical system for accidents at work, since the absence of reliable and compatible statistics makes it difficult to devise Community policies and promote them in an effective way."
"Health and safety at work represents one of the Community’s most important policies, and safe and healthy organisations have a very positive knock-on effect on the economy and on competitiveness in a society."
". The report before us raises a general point that has, in itself, influenced my vote."
"Whenever we speak about health and safety at work we immediately think of how far we have come since the beginning of the industrialisation process."
"This unavoidable thought process illustrates that, as far as this issue is concerned, what is acceptable today will fall short of what is required tomorrow."
"In other words, we are increasingly demanding and, with regard to this issue, that is a sign of significant progress."
"That is the first consideration."
"Although I do not agree entirely with some of the points made in the report, and whilst I would change the order of priorities in some cases, I welcome the thrust of its content, because its guiding principles are close to mine on this issue."
"Indeed, bearing the above in mind, I believe that the defence of health and safety at work is a prerequisite to the kind of civilisation that we must promote, and, moreover, amounts to an obligation on the part of employers, because businesses also have social obligations."
"In addition, the better the conditions at work, the greater the productivity, the better the quality of work and the lower the losses incurred, both individually and collectively."
"Consequently, I voted in favour."
"– Mr President, first of all I would like to apologise to the services, who do a great deal of work, most of it unthanked and unrecognised."
"I know that they work long through the night."
"I approached them yesterday in relation to a ruling on paragraph 89 of the Commission's legislative proposals."
"I have to apologise because I believed that another colleague would raise this at the time and I expected a ruling on the admissibility of that paragraph from you."
"Therefore, I should like to ask if such a ruling has been made."
"If so, was it made in conjunction with paragraph 88?"
"In any event, is what we voted on today legally admissible?"
"Mr Cashman, I have to tell you that the matter has in fact been examined and that paragraph 89 was considered admissible."
"– Mr President, I am sorry to raise this again but, given that this issue was raised, I thought, as indicated in the voting list, that the matter had been referred to the authorities for a ruling."
"We expected – perhaps wrongly – that the ruling would be made prior to the vote being taken."
"Mr President, are you telling me that the ruling was that paragraph 89, as written, was in any event admissible?"
"Indeed, the paragraph, as written, was admissible."
"This is what they told me."
"We just had the ruling before the voting."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the sitting is resumed."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this morning Pope John Paul II was admitted to hospital in Rome."
"Before we begin the debate on the defence of human rights, I think it is appropriate, if you agree, to send a message of support and solidarity from Parliament to a great defender of human rights, a man of peace and a great European, loved by all European citizens, believers and non-believers alike."
"I think that this could be an important signal from the European Parliament."
"Yes, certainly, Mr Tajani, we shall immediately communicate your suggestion to the President's office, since I believe it is very appropriate and we will tell the President that the House wishes to send a message of support and solidarity to the Holy Father at this time."
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Togo(1)."
"– Mr President, it is not only in monarchies that the Head of State’s children succeed to power; it is also, alas, not unknown in republics."
"It has already happened in Sri Lanka, Azerbaijan, Syria and the Democratic Republic of Congo, more recently in Togo, and may well happen soon in Egypt as well."
"It sometimes happens that elections are announced to decide the succession, but it is known in advance who will emerge from them as the victor."
"In Togo, this step was missed out; the Gnassingbé family took power by violent means from the Olympio family a long time ago, and they want to hold on to it."
"An amendment to the constitution, accomplished in the twinkling of an eye following the death of the Head of State, prevented the President of the country’s parliament from succeeding him temporarily and preparing new presidential elections in good time, and instead made it possible for his son to take over the state as if he were the heir to private property."
"The fact is that the son is in no more legitimate a position than his father; what is happening is the continuation of a long-past ."
"Continuing this state of affairs has robbed Togo of the hope that it, having been a German and then a French colonial possession, and then for a long time a home-grown dictatorship, might develop into a democracy."
"Up to now, it has been cause for popular lamentation that power has almost always been in the hands of profiteers who were supported by military might and were not concerned with serving the national interest; their concern was rather with taking up their privileged positions."
"Not only in Togo, not only in Africa, but throughout the world too, this state of affairs must come to an end."
"Instead of being selective in our outrage at what is happening in Togo, let us help to put a stop to the military and economic protection of regimes of this kind."
"That is what matters at the present moment."
"The unfortunate fact that it is the rule rather than an exception means that we have to ensure that these events do not repeat themselves and that it would be a good thing if free elections could be held in Togo within a short period of time."
"– Mr President, I believe that the reaching of a clear conclusion about the events in Togo demands that a differentiated approach be adopted towards them."
"Togo is similar to many other West African countries in that it is an artificial state, created to serve colonial interests, and indeed one only needs to glance at a map to see this, as Togo, in common with most other West African countries, is shaped like a narrow handkerchief."
"Togo was governed first by German and then by French colonial masters, but its borders were imposed artificially, and initially there was very little chance of it enduring in this form."
"In view of the fact that Togo’s borders were drawn on a drawing board, with entire peoples and families being torn apart in the process, and other ethnic groups that had nothing in common being artificially merged, it must be said that in spite of this the country made every appearance of developing remarkably well for a number of years."
"It appeared to be an island of stability in West Africa, even though we are all aware that there have barely been any real democracies in our sense of the word in the region."
"Yet Eyadéma’s rule, as Mr Meijer has pointed out, has come ever more to resemble an extremely violent dictatorship, and attempts are now being made to put it on a hereditary basis."
"Without wishing to deny the fact that families and tribes have a different meaning in Africa than in our societies, it must be said that we cannot accept this hereditary dictatorship."
"Our demands are therefore quite clear; resignation by the President, who came to power illegally, a reinstatement of the parliament’s legitimate President, free elections to be held without delay, and widespread respect for the rule of law and human rights."
"Above all, one thing must be clear; this time the African Union itself – and this is something I welcome greatly – as well as the West African Economic Community that is forming along the lines of the EU have made it very clear that they do not accept this illegal rule."
"I should like to thank both these communities, and see this as an encouraging sign that Africa is – albeit hesitantly – beginning to seize its own destiny in such issues, and deserves our full support in so doing."
"– Mr President, after nearly 38 years of dictatorship by President Eyadéma and with his son Faure Gnassingbé having seized power in defiance of every constitutional rule and the commitment given in Brussels on 14 April 2004 for a return to political dialogue between all forces, Togo is sinking deeper every day into crisis and the risk of civil war."
"The Togolese people and Togo nationals living in our European countries are looking to the European Parliament and the European Union to take a firm and resolute stance."
"They want our solidarity and new prospects for their future and that of their children."
"This requires first of all a genuine return to popular sovereignty."
"There are two conditions for that."
"The first is that Faure Gnassingbé must withdraw immediately and without argument and put an end to this hereditary dictatorship that he sought to install by military in defiance of democratic principles and the laws of his country and in violation of international law."
"The second is the restoration of constitutional legality and the resumption of pluralist dialogue involving all parties, including of course the opposition parties."
"Only Mr Natchaba, the speaker of the National Assembly, would be in a position to provide an interim government to prepare for presidential elections in accordance with the constitution."
"It will only be possible for Mr Natchaba to return to Togo if his safety can be guaranteed, however."
"In this connection, Mr President, I want to stress the justified concern expressed in this House yesterday by a representative delegation of associations of democratic movements and human rights associations about the real risks that political activists, human rights activists and journalists are running today."
"With my colleague, Marie-Arlette Carlotti, we received them and listened to them with the greatest attention, because some of them, or members of their families, have been physically ill treated and abused under the Eyadéma dictatorship."
"They made an emotional appeal to us and to all international bodies to take definite concerted action to restore democracy permanently to Togo."
"Knowing that their country, which is already subject to sanctions, has suffered during the last several years, they nevertheless said they expected us to adopt a firm and tough attitude towards Togo if nothing happens to guarantee the holding of free elections."
"Our resolution responds to that expectation by referring to sanctions, some of which have already been imposed by the Economic Community of West African States, while others are planned by other international bodies."
"For my part, I want to stress the need for targeted measures to be taken quickly concerning the supply of arms and transfers of money outside Togo."
"International bodies must also act to give the population the security necessary for future elections to be prepared for in an atmosphere of calm."
"It is essential that the political parties should be able to conduct a proper election campaign; it is equally essential that all the media do their duty by providing information."
". – Mr President, it almost beggars belief that, in 2005, we can still have tinpot dictators seizing control of countries based on nothing more than being the sons of their fathers but, sadly, that is reality in Togo."
"The good news, as Mrs Trautmann has emphasised, is that the Economic Community of West African States responded very quickly and positively."
"They insisted on the withdrawal of all their ambassadors, they applied trade sanctions, they banned arms sales and stopped issuing visas both for their own citizens to visit Togo and vice versa, for Togolese citizens to visit their countries."
"That is a step in the right direction."
"We need the rest of the international community to follow that example."
"The European Community needs to support the democratic forces which, I am glad to say, exist inside Togo."
"We need to give them encouragement; we need to urge the army to stay in its barracks."
"As Mrs Trautmann has said, we need to try and work with Mr Natchaba to establish a situation whereby he can return to his country and organise fair and free elections."
"The idea that this is popular is killed by the fact that, on seizing power, the president has had to ban all public demonstrations for two months."
"He has closed eight television and radio stations and has made sure that every other voice of opposition is oppressed."
"This is a coup in every sense of the word and we should show no sympathy for it."
". Mr President, as the honourable Members know, the Commission is following the situation in Togo very closely."
"Incidentally, EU aid to the country has been suspended since 1992, and the unconstitutional seizure of power, described as an hereditary dictatorship, has called into question any hope of normalising relations with the country that we might have had at the end of last year."
"The European Union has responded firmly by condemning what must be considered a and by calling for a return to the constitutional order and respect for the principles of the rule of law."
"Mr Louis Michel has voiced a very firm position on behalf of the Commission."
"Everything we are doing and saying is therefore in support of the action taken by the Economic Community of West African States and the African Union, which have been exemplary in their handling of the Togo crisis."
"The actions of the international community have already begun to have an effect, since on 18 February Mr Gnassingbé agreed to hold presidential elections within the time laid down by the constitution."
"However, we must also condemn the breaches of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the days following the takeover."
"Demonstrations were banned and many radio and television stations were closed."
"The first demonstration was put down violently, pressure was put on journalists and arbitrary arrests were reported."
"It was because of international pressure that the Togolese Government started to backtrack."
"The right to demonstrate was restored on 18 February and some radio stations were able to resume broadcasting from 21 February."
"So far as cooperation is concerned, Mr President, and in particular the ninth EDF, the Commission is therefore sticking to the conclusions of the consultations contained in the Council decision of 15 November 2004."
"There will be no new cooperation measures until free and transparent elections have been held, and obviously that now also means presidential elections, which are part of the process of returning to the rule of law."
"There will therefore be no resumption of EU aid outside that framework."
"The Council decision of 15 November last also provided for a partial resumption of cooperation."
"All the projects concerned are suspended until the situation is clarified."
"So far as the money remaining from previous project-funding EDFs is concerned, the Commission intends to organise support for the presidential and legislative elections should the government express a desire to hold them soundly and transparently and if the time available allows."
"Regarding the proposal for targeted sanctions, in its statement of 20 February the European Union indicated that it reserves the right to take measures to support the action taken by the Economic Community of West African States."
"In general, the Commission supports Parliament’s draft resolution, which is in line with the proposal and position adopted by the European Union and backed by the Commission."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place following the debates."
"– The situation we are seeing in Togo today calls for the strongest condemnation from our Parliament of the that brought Fauré Gnassingbé to power in that country."
"I am therefore very pleased about the Council’s statements and the European Parliament’s response today through this resolution."
"Just as we showed our solidarity with the protagonists of the ‘orange’ revolution in Ukraine a few weeks ago, we must today give our support to the Togolese demonstrators who are refusing to accept this and are being harshly repressed for doing so."
"There have already been several deaths in the demonstrations taking place in Lomé."
"It is all absolutely unbearable and intolerable."
"Europe must bring all its weight to bear in rejecting this hereditary dictatorship, which is backed by certain Mafia financial networks, calling first of all for the resignation of Fauré Gnassingbé and then for the drawing up of a new constitution."
"That is the only way to guarantee the holding of free and transparent elections, to ensure the return to democracy of a country that has been bled dry and reduced to poverty by General Eyadéma’s dictatorship and to enable the European Union to resume its cooperation with Togo, which has been suspended since 1993 and which the Togolese people greatly need."
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Nepal(1)."
"– Mr President, in January 1990 Nepal celebrated the Year of Tourism."
"A magnificent parade involving tens of thousands of participants and several hundred thousand spectators demonstrated the full extent of the cultural wealth of the country, with its sherpas, monks, temple dancers, sadhus, mahouts, mandala artists and mountaineers."
"I took part in this parade with the organisation Friends of Nepal."
"We marched through Kathmandu and past King Birendra, who enjoyed the highest respect of 95-98% of the Nepalese people, both as a person and as a champion of the constitutional monarchy."
"This makes the contrast with King Gyanendra, seven years later, appear all the starker."
"He has dismissed yet another prime minister, and dozens of politicians, human rights activists and journalists have been taken into custody or placed under house arrest."
"He now intends to rule as an autocrat for three years."
"The question that needs to be asked is why not one prime minister in recent years has managed to hold free elections, and the answer is that agreement has never been reached between the various parties, not to mention with the Maoists."
"The main reason, however, is the lack of security in the country."
"People are living in fear, and by no means only in western Nepal."
"Two thirds of the country is now under the control of Maoist rebels, and inadequately-trained police officers fall victim time and time again to lethal attacks."
"The civil war has claimed 10 000 lives so far and shows no sign of coming to an end, with tourism, the country's main source of income, having been brought almost to a standstill."
"I am afraid that the Maoists will gain further supporters following the coup of 1 February."
"The state of emergency will be used to place further restrictions on human rights, and it is for this reason that it is a cause of great concern to us in the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"By way of example, key places of refuge for Tibetans who have been forced to leave their homeland have been closed, including the Tibetan Refugee Welfare Office."
"For the past 15 years, this Office has supported the work of the UNHCR refugee centre in Kathmandu, with which I myself am familiar, and at present around 1 000 asylum seekers are living there."
"In addition, the Office of the Representative of the Dalai Lama, which was established in 1959, has been closed."
"The situation is becoming increasingly desperate."
"Commissioner, I welcome the initiatives taken by the European Union, as well as those taken by India and the USA, one example of these being that the King has been called upon to end the state of emergency within 100 days."
"A representative of the European Commission who was present at the meeting of our SAARC Delegation this morning said that a number of funding programmes would be suspended, in order to strengthen democracy by means of economic pressure."
"Fortunately, however, development aid will continue to be granted, and targeted at the poorer sections of the population and local human rights organisations and NGOs."
"I would be delighted if the issue of human rights violations in Nepal were to appear on the agenda of the session of the UN Commission on Human Rights to be held in Geneva."
"Nepalese democracy is only 15 years old; it is still fragile, and must be protected rather than destroyed."
"Many thanks, Mr President."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament is facing a dilemma."
"On the one hand we cannot afford to waste any time in taking a stance on this issue."
"That is exactly why we are aiming to adopt a position today."
"On the other hand, however, we have no detailed knowledge of the precise reasons behind the staged by the King of Nepal, although that knowledge would be extremely useful for us."
"If we delay on this account, however, it is likely that our intervention will come too late, and rapid intervention is key."
"The King has announced that he wishes to mount a more effective fight against the Maoist guerrilla movement, but at the same time he has closed the Tibetan Refugee Welfare Office, as Mr Mann mentioned a short time ago."
"In addition to this closure, Nepal has stopped its aid to Tibet, which was intended to strengthen the country’s resistance against China's aggression."
"Against this background, the reasons given by the King appear somewhat unconvincing."
"The European Parliament must adopt a stance on this issue rapidly, as if we leave it too late we will be unable to achieve our goal, which is to prevent further criminal acts."
"I believe we should be reassured that the more active diplomatic measures taken by other countries, such as the United States and India, are appropriate."
"India is a neighbour of Nepal, and so it may well have its own reasons for taking diplomatic action."
"These may be reasons we would not entirely subscribe to if we were familiar with them."
"The measures taken by other countries such as the United States, however, should convince us that that theirs is a course of action we should also be following."
"All rights have been suspended by the King, and while we have not forgotten the tragedy that befell the royal family several years ago, since that time no questions have been asked by the international community or international organisations as to the legitimacy of the royal rule."
"There are therefore a number of considerations that must be weighed up."
"As I said earlier, the reasons behind these events are unclear, but they are a source of some concern."
"Furthermore, and reiterating Mr Mann’s comments, we cannot condone cutting off aid to Tibet, just as we cannot agree to the suspension of civil rights, to arrests, to the closure of press outlets or to far-reaching restrictions on freedom of speech."
"We are therefore fully justified in taking action, and we should adopt the resolution."
"Let us hope that a rapid reaction by this House, along with the measures taken by other countries, will go some way towards normalising the situation in Tibet."
"Many thanks, Mr President."
"– Mr President, Nepal, like Afghanistan, was, in the Sixties and Seventies, a holiday destination for Western European disciples of the alternative life, who went there in search of a less materialistic way of living, of different ways of dressing, and in order to do drugs – rather fewer of these than we now know about."
"Both these destinations for alternative holidays have since become places of horror to which nobody goes any more as a tourist or as somebody in search of a better world."
"In both countries, over past decades, various attempts have been made at imposing from the top downwards an authoritarian monolith lacking any real support from a majority of the population."
"The outside world, too, has an interest in putting governments in the saddle or imposing one new regime or another."
"It is under such circumstances that people, on realising that they cannot bring about change by peaceful means, reach for their weapons."
"In Nepal, one king after another has dismissed democratically-elected governments in the belief that they could do a better job themselves."
"In so doing, they have not only incurred the hostility of a wide variety of political parties, but have also provoked popular uprisings."
"Insurgents are now in control of much of the country, particularly its western parts."
"The warring factions on both sides will stop at nothing."
"While this is going on, mainstream politicians are in dispute about how best to gain the upper hand over the insurgents, whether through one-man rule by the king or by means of parliamentary democracy."
"It is Belgian weapons suppliers that protect the King against the insurgents."
"There seems to be no prospect of an end to this misery for anyone, and yet a stop must be put to it."
"The traditions that Mr Mann celebrates may well not return that quickly, but the people of Nepal still have the right to make their own choices, to opt for democracy and human rights."
"Let us not impose limits on the people of Nepal’s ability to choose for themselves."
"– The state of emergency declared by King Gyanendra on 1 February represents a clear threat to human rights in Nepal, since it has increased the power of the security forces and reduced the prospects for a political peace process."
"We must all remember, however, that although the European Union's Code of Conduct in the field of arms exports explicitly prohibits sales to countries in armed conflict, certain European governments, such as the government of the United Kingdom, have been selling arms to the Nepalese Government over the last three years."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the resolution we are voting on today is of crucial importance in terms of clarifying the European Union's position on the peace process and on human rights in Nepal."
"Given the seriousness of the situation, we must firstly welcome London's decision, and that of the Indian Government, to suspend all military aid to the current Nepalese Government."
"Furthermore, the European Union must strongly insist that King Gyanendra immediately suspend the state of emergency and engage in a political process aimed at resolving the conflict, based on justice and respect for human rights."
"In addition, the European Union must urge the Maoist guerrillas to commit themselves to respecting international humanitarian law and to signing a humanitarian and human rights agreement with the governmental security forces."
"Fourthly, in accordance with the resolution we adopted this morning on the next session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, we must also urge that Commission to adopt a specific resolution on Nepal and to appoint a Special Rapporteur to monitor the human rights situation in that country."
"Finally, with reference to Mr Mann’s invitation — with whom I entirely agree — we must not forget that the situation in Nepal has a regional dimension, particularly with regard to its neighbour Tibet."
"To this end, we must demand that the Nepalese Government reopen the Tibet Refugee Welfare Office, as well as the Dalai Lama’s representation in Kathmandu."
"– Mr President, as we have all heard, the state of emergency was declared on 1 February by the King."
"He sacked the Government and assumed direct powers himself."
"This follows on from a decade-long conflict, which has cost 11 000 lives."
"The Nepalese people have suffered a legacy of human rights abuses, both from the security forces and from the Maoist rebels."
"They have suffered torture, detention, disappearances and unlawful killing."
"Communication links with the outside world have been severed and, hidden from public scrutiny, the risk of further abuse escalates, according to Amnesty International."
"Radio news broadcasts have been shut down, foreign news channels taken off air and local media barred from publishing news or commentary without prior approval."
"In the immediate aftermath, telephone lines were severed, and some mobile phone services have not resumed."
"Approximately 3 000 people are currently under house arrest according to Nepalese Government sources."
"The people who have been arrested are either senior members of the ousted government, human rights defenders or student and trade union leaders."
"Access to them has been restricted."
"They should either be charged or tried under due process of the law, or released forthwith."
"The EU and the Member States provide more than EUR 100 million in aid per year."
"All military assistance should be stopped now."
"Emphasis should be put on a multiparty democracy, conflict mitigation and alleviating poverty and suffering."
"A military solution is not the answer."
"– Mr President, I would like to welcome to the Chamber Mr Desmond de Silva QC, who is assistant Secretary-General of the United Nations and the Deputy Special Prosecutor for the Special Court in Sierra Leone for war crimes."
"He is here to listen to our debate on Sierra Leone."
"– Mr President, it is with deep regret that we witnessed the recent events in Nepal."
"It cannot be overlooked that King Gyanendra's actions on 1 February were a sad day for democracy in Nepal."
"Neither can we ignore the actions of the terrorists."
"The European Parliament cannot just stand by."
"Nepal, as we have heard, is a desperately poor nation with an unfortunate history of conflict and has recently suffered under terrorist attacks from the Maoist rebels."
"This Himalayan country faces several problems, including the issue of refugees from Bhutan."
"The dissolution of the Nepalese Parliament does not help the situation of the common Nepalese people."
"On the contrary, the Nepalese need stability and democracy in order to prosper economically and politically."
"The most immediate actions that we demand of the Nepalese authorities are: the lifting of the state of emergency; the release of all political prisoners under house arrest or detention in prison; and the lifting of the media embargo, to allow freedom of the press, national and international."
"In the medium and long term, we must also examine the ways that the EU and other international bodies can help."
"So, I ask the Commission and the Council to support the following three suggestions."
"First, that the EU look very closely into our conflict resolution programmes and identify other innovative solutions to help reduce poverty."
"This is conducive to reducing the vulnerability of the Nepalese to the Maoist rebels."
"Secondly, I would request that the Member States impose sanctions in their bilateral programmes."
"That would send a clear message that Member States do not approve of what has happened."
"However, we must be careful not to penalise the ordinary people, as that would alienate us from helping them."
"Thirdly, we must look at the diplomatic efforts we could make."
"That could include arbitrating between the monarchy and other political parties, so as to encourage them both to the negotiating table, where steps towards multi-party democracy could be made."
"Furthermore, we need to explore the possibility of sending a neutral third party, such as Javier Solana, the EU High Representative, or the United Nations, to formulate a road map to peace and democracy in Nepal."
"It might even be helpful to send a delegation from Parliament."
"In conclusion, I would like to stress the importance of the restoration of fundamental freedoms in Nepal, and the role we can play to encourage and support a democratic future."
"However, the EU must act with caution: there are dangers in this unstable time of aggravating a fragile situation."
"We must remember Nepal's fairly precarious geographical situation between India, Pakistan and China."
"So, this small country is very significant for regional security."
". – Mr President, I wish to congratulate Mrs Gill on her excellent speech."
"We have heard that the King has declared a state of emergency, dismissed the government, assumed direct power and suspended civil rights indefinitely."
"Since then the King has continued to suppress the media and potential opposition, detaining thousands of people, including politicians, student leaders, human rights activists, journalists, professors and other important public figures."
"A few have been released since then."
"Nepal is relatively new to the concept of multiparty democracy, which it established only in 1990 with the framework of a constitutional monarchy."
"I enjoy and respect constitutional monarchies."
"At this time, Nepal reinstated previously banned political parties and increased the civil liberties of the Nepalese people."
"Unfortunately, its attempt at democracy has been fraught with difficulties."
"Over the last 15 years, the credibility of the Nepalese politicians has been repeatedly undermined with allegations of corruption and self-interest."
"They refuse to put Nepalese interests first; they have been putting their own first."
"Politicians have proved incapable of ridding Nepal of a group of so-called 'Maoist insurgents' that was launched in 1996 to bring down the monarchy and the regime."
"The ceasefire they attempted to negotiate with the insurgents broke down in August 2003."
"The King's recent actions exemplify someone who, on the one hand, wishes to rid Nepal of terrorism and, on the other, wishes to bring stability to a country whose democratic actors have failed to achieve it."
"He has decided to take matters into his own hands."
"However, in doing so, he has played into the hands of rebel forces and has infringed upon the very rights he was purportedly aiming to protect."
"Nepal cannot be allowed to regress to a system whereby the King is undisputed ruler and the rights and lives of his subjects are in the hands of one man."
"The recent chain of events is extremely worrying and reminiscent of the Nepal of the Rana oligarchs, a Nepal whose human rights record the world had hoped was finally going to be laid to rest."
"We in the international community must encourage the King to undo his recent actions."
"If necessary, this may involve suspending military aid to Nepal until the King finally realises that the fight against terror is an international struggle which is best dealt with in an open and democratic society, as opposed to the oppressive, closed, authoritarian state which he is sadly attempting to recreate."
"– Mr President, Nepal, one of the poorest countries in Asia, has had a very troublesome recent history not least because of the rebellion by powerful Maoist forces, which has been going on for the last nine years."
"In this period more than 11 000 people have been killed."
"In June 2001 the King of Nepal was murdered, along with other members of the royal family."
"His brother, Gyanendra, was crowned as the new King."
"Gyanendra's democratic credentials have never been too obvious, quite the contrary."
"He has followed the line of aggravating confrontation with the rebels and he has side-stepped the country's political forces."
"In 2001-2002 a state of emergency was declared which led to an explosion of serious human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings and torture."
"Despite this, the King continued to enjoy the support of Western nations, including EU Member States, I am sorry to say."
"On 1 February this year, the King, supported by the Royal Nepalese Army, dismissed the government, assumed direct power and again declared a state of emergency."
"As expected, widespread human rights violations ensued."
"This joint motion calls on the King to lift the state of emergency, to restore all fundamental democratic freedoms, including freedom of the media, and re-establish parliamentary powers."
"It also calls on the Council and the Commission to take practical measures such as imposing an embargo on military assistance to force the King to give up his dictatorship."
". Many thanks."
"The events of recent weeks have left the European Parliament with no choice but to hold a debate on human rights violations in Nepal, a problem that has been escalating for many years."
"The Kingdom of Nepal, which is situated between India and China, is becoming ever more dependent on China, as that country is both its main trading partner and the main source of inspiration for the Maoist guerrilla movement."
"The latter is engaged in a struggle to overthrow the constitutional monarchy, and its aim is to establish a Communist state."
"The civil war in Nepal has already claimed over 12 000 victims, and the political situation is Byzantine in its complexity, although the information blackout means that we are not familiar with all the details."
"After the Prime Minister was dismissed, the King and the Nepalese army seized power and suspended basic constitutional rights such as the right of association, the freedom of speech, the right to information, privacy and property and the ban on illegal detentions."
"The King has prohibited criticism of the security services on the radio, on television and on the Internet."
"Censorship and persecution are part of everyday life."
"The Nepalese Government also disregards the rights of refugees, as it has closed the Office of the Representative of the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan Refugees Welfare Office, which provided assistance to Tibetans persecuted for their faith."
"Every year 2 500 people flee from Chinese-occupied Tibet because they wish to practice their religion freely and to study in their native language."
"An ever-greater number of Tibetans are choosing to leave the country because they feel increasingly threatened."
"The Nepalese Government, however, acts in violation of national and international law by handing Tibetans over to China."
"These Tibetans are imprisoned and subjected to unbelievably cruel abuse after having been deported to China."
"Both the Government and the Maoist rebels have been accused by international humanitarian organisations of committing atrocities against the civil population."
"The debate this House is holding today will make it possible to identify the roots of the conflict."
"These can be found in an insane totalitarian, Communist and atheist ideology that denies the existence of God and treats human beings as objects, as well as trampling on their dignity and violating their rights."
"Nepal has a population of 23 million, and every second person is illiterate, whilst society is still governed by a caste system."
"What are needed are improved living conditions and education, not a civil war aimed at establishing a destructive Communist system."
"The only options available to us are to increase awareness of the conflict and to use diplomatic channels, such as this European Parliament resolution, to insist that the Nepalese Government puts an end to the illegal arrests and other corrupt practices."
"We must also demand that the Nepalese Government protects human rights activists, journalists and political leaders from such practices."
"Public pressure has already resulted in a decline in persecution once before."
"Consideration should be given to the question of whether EU aid is in fact used to foster development and for humanitarian purposes, and there is also a need for action."
"Finally, I should like to quote the Holy Father John XXIII, who wrote that a threat to the family is a threat to the state, and that similarly, a threat to social order in one state is a threat to international order."
"I thank you."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the previous speakers have spoken very knowledgably on the internal situation in Nepal, the lack of democracy in the country and its history."
"I should like to highlight a further point, namely the lack of media freedom, which has become particularly acute since 1 February 2005."
"We know for certain that censorship is taking place and that journalists are being dismissed and arrested, often without their families being informed."
"The Government has also barred private radio stations from broadcasting, and 800 journalists have lost their jobs as a result."
"As many Nepalese citizens cannot read, the closure of these radio stations means that they no longer have any access to news or to any radio stations other than the BBC."
"As if this were not enough, editorial offices have been ransacked and documents censored."
"This is a brief snapshot of the present situation in Nepal, and we must not remain unmoved by it."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome and support the resolutions on the unacceptable domestic policy, the suppression of civil liberties and the systematic infringements of human rights implemented by King Gyanendra of Nepal."
"Having said that, I would press for just as much effort to be put into resolutions and, above all, into robust measures to place political and economic pressure on China, which has been oppressing the Tibetan people for decades."
"The goal of Parliament and the other institutions must be to promote the defence of Tibet and its culture, and we should do so not just by denouncing the systematic genocide of the Tibetan people, which has been taking place for decades."
"We must draw on principles such as non-violence, democracy, tolerance, solidarity, dialogue, respect and justice as a whole, without choosing, as often happens, however, easier or more convenient struggles with regard to upholding peoples’ right to self-determination."
"This principle knows no geographic boundaries, nor must it ever be subject to the dictates of the economy, or worse still, of finance on policy."
"These initiatives are the best means to promote the principles of freedom and self-determination, principles which cut across parties and institutions."
". Mr President, the European Commission is gravely concerned about the sharp deterioration in the political situation in Nepal since 1 February."
"I do not have to tell Members of this Parliament how important the respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law are in our relations with third countries."
"The Presidency’s declaration of 2 February is very clear: the European Union views the King's move as a serious setback for the prospect of a negotiated and democratically-based solution to the current conflict."
"The European Union troika, which visited Nepal only two months ago, expressed at that time its grave concerns at the rapidly deteriorating human rights situation."
"Since 1 February, Nepal has been experiencing a profound human rights crisis, as many parliamentarians have now underlined."
"The United Nations has recorded more than 340 detentions of political leaders, journalists, human rights defenders and civil society activists."
"We, the European Union, will continue to press for the release of all those who remain arbitrarily detained, and we will use the opportunity of the forthcoming session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva to remind both sides to the conflict of their obligations under international law."
"As Members may be aware, no European Union position has yet been taken on the issue of continued external assistance to Nepal, because the situation is very complex."
"The Commission's global approach to conflict prevention calls for us to ensure that Community instruments and programmes are directed towards achieving political and social stability and democracy."
"As we have frequently stated, development policy and other cooperation programmes provide the most powerful instruments at the Community's disposal for treating the root causes of conflict."
"We have learned that conflict countries sometimes require more, rather than less, assistance, and applying blunt political conditions risks penalising the weakest in society."
"That is why we think that the basic objectives of EC cooperation remain achievable."
"Indeed, the priorities of support to poverty reduction, human rights and conflict mitigation are more urgent in the new environment."
"Now is not the time for us, for instance, to cancel our support to Nepal's National Human Rights Commission, provided this institution continues to operate as an autonomous and independent technical body, seeking to promote the rule of law."
"However, this does not mean that it is 'business as usual' in terms of donor support to Nepal, not least because of the new constraints faced in ensuring that all sides respect the donors' basic operational guidelines in the state of emergency as the conflict escalates."
"Therefore, the Commission has taken the following position."
"The delegation of the European Commission in Kathmandu will not accept any high level invitations from the King or from any of his cabinet ministers unless instructed otherwise by its headquarters."
"All ongoing EC cooperation activities are carefully reviewed and the situation in the field is constantly monitored."
"For the time being, activities continue but new appraisals or identification missions will not be launched for the preparation of the 2005 cooperation pipeline until further notice."
"The Commission maintains extensive contacts on this issue with Member States and with other donors on the ground, and will participate in a meeting of like-minded donors during the week of 7 March in Europe to continue to seek a coordinated line."
"As ever in such situations, the cost of conflict falls heaviest on the weakest in Nepalese society."
"I am thinking of the children denied schooling or forcibly recruited, the poor deprived of basic healthcare and shelter and the many victims of brutal violence."
"Whilst the primary responsibility for resolving the conflict in Nepal rests with the local actors, we must not abandon them now."
"Working closely with the European Union Member States and especially with successive European Union Council presidencies, the Commission remains committed to pursuing all diplomatic, political, and developmental efforts that might facilitate the peace process and a return to democracy in Nepal."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place following the debates."
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on The Special Court for Sierra Leone: the Charles Taylor case(1)"
"– Mr President, Liberia and Sierra Leone have moved on from being countries whose social elites were very much in thrall to American and European traditions, to being countries that have brought into the present day the most primitive aspects of African history."
"We can take it as read that the chaos and the reversion to old ways have resulted from the long-standing discrimination against the people of the interior, who are poor, ill-educated and least urbanised."
"They rebel against the English-speaking inhabitants of the coastlands, whom they regard as colonials."
"That is what happens in Liberia, established in the nineteenth century as a colony where slaves freed in America could return to their African roots."
"One group managed the land, while the other regarded themselves as colonial masters along the lines of the Europeans in other African countries."
"It is significant in all African countries that present-day state borders were drawn by foreign colonial powers."
"Groups that belonged together by virtue of a shared language and culture were separated from each other."
"Groups that had very little in common were joined together in a single federated state."
"Mr Posselt also drew attention to this during today’s discussion of Togo."
"Adventurers and profiteers, who employ drug-addled children as assassins and decorate themselves with the heads of the victims they kill, terrorise those whom they cannot control."
"I might add that the Americans did a good job of training Charles Taylor as President and bringing him into office, after which it was very difficult to get rid of him again."
"What is even more important is that, after the removal of one person, the groups in the interior who have reverted to primitive living should be given the opportunity to develop as fully-fledged twenty-first century people."
"I would counsel against pinning all our hopes on Nigeria’s influence."
"Nigeria may well be a major power in the region, but it also has a tradition of internal conflict, and dictatorships, although it is fortunate that matters have been improving recently."
"The problems of Liberia and Sierra Leone will not be resolved in the long term without all the groups of their inhabitants being involved on an equal basis."
"– Mr President, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Liberia are all members of the ACP and signatories to the Cotonou Agreement."
"This agreement secures good governance."
"However, Sierra Leone is ranked as the least-developed country in the world."
"Sadly, the criteria set out by the Cotonou Agreement as essential to long-term development could also be used as a list of what Sierra Leone lacks most."
"In January 2002 Sierra Leone saw the end of a decade-long, savage civil war."
"The conflict in Sierra Leone cost tens of thousands of lives and the displacement of millions."
"Charles Ghankay Taylor, the former President of Liberia, has recently been indicted by the Special Court for Sierra Leone with actively supporting the Revolutionary United Front which was responsible for the widespread atrocities in Sierra Leone."
"According to Amnesty International, Taylor's crimes included the systematic killing of civilians, amputation, rape, other forms of sexual violence, the use of child soldiers, abductions and forced labour."
"The Special Court of Sierra Leone created by the international community and which the EU supported with some EUR 800 000 last year, has charged Taylor with 17 counts of war crimes, crimes against humanity and other serious violations of international humanitarian law."
"However, Nigeria has given Taylor asylum."
"International law now cries out that those suspected of committing war crimes or crimes against humanity must be investigated and brought to justice."
"Under the 1949 Geneva Convention the Nigerian authorities are obliged to arrest Taylor and to surrender him to the Special Court of Sierra Leone."
"There is no legal base whatsoever for Taylor to be protected by President Obasanjo of Nigeria."
"If Taylor remains in Nigeria, however, it is doubtful that this man accused of heinous crimes will ever face trial."
"Moreover, if he seeks sanctuary in another ACP country we should bring the full force of the Cotonou Agreement to bear on that country."
"– The impassioned speech by the previous speaker and the motion for a resolution before us, along with its justifications, which has been endorsed by all political groups in this House, are proof that action is urgently needed."
"Those of us who live in prosperous countries have no idea of what is happening in many African states."
"Immediately upon achieving so-called freedom after centuries of exploitation as colonies, many countries suffered another tyranny of the worst kind, for example in the case of Liberia under Charles Taylor."
"We cannot remain indifferent to the catalogue of crimes of which a Special Court in Sierra Leone found Charles Taylor guilty in 2003, and we must do everything in our power to ensure the handover to the courts of this criminal, who, whilst in exile, is persisting in his attempts to destabilise Liberia and its neighbouring countries."
"I support all the initiatives that this House has called for, yet it is with concern that I note that neither the UN, the UN Security Council, nor any of us yet possess anywhere near the authority for which world peace cries out."
"International law and human rights require that all people of good will overcome their indifference, and that all possible means be used to find fairer and more peaceful solutions."
"I should like to thank everyone in this House who has worked on this motion for a resolution."
"– Mr President, Charles Taylor, as President of Liberia, was guilty of serious crimes against humanity and of acts of war."
"He actively supported armed opposition groups in Sierra Leone in their committing of such atrocities as murders, mutilations, rapes and the conscription of child soldiers."
"Under his rule, Liberia bore the brunt of violence and the misuse of power, all of which resulted in great human suffering that must not be allowed to go unpunished."
"Nigeria must be induced to surrender Charles Taylor to the court in Sierra Leone, thus doing the right thing by the innumerable victims and survivors in Liberia and elsewhere, and bringing peace to West Africa."
"The European Union is working for peace, security, stability, respect for human rights and democratic principles."
"We cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that Charles Taylor remains at liberty in Nigeria, from where he is still in a position to manipulate the peace process in the region."
"Not only is Nigeria under a moral obligation to hand Charles Taylor over to the tribunal, but it is also subject to an obligation under international law."
"Among other things, the international legal order, in the shape of the Geneva conventions, stipulates that war crimes must be punished at all times."
"This rule of international law ensures that states refrain from offering protection to this sort of malefactor."
"Nigeria will need to extradite Charles Taylor to the tribunal in Sierra Leone, in order that he may be judged by it."
". – Mr President, Africa has for too long been torn by civil strife, hunger, economic mismanagement and blatant corruption."
"It is now, at last, beginning to get its own house in order with regional blocs and continent-wide supranational institutions committed to observing international human rights law, such as Economic Community of West Africa (ECOWAS) and the African Union."
"Charles Taylor, as a former warlord, ruled Liberia brutally between 1997 and 2003 as a bloody dictator, sanctioning rape and summary executions at the end of that country's 14 years of civil war, but he was forced into exile as part of a peace-making deal mediated by Nigeria."
"During Taylor's reign, ECOWAS imposed sanctions on Liberia because of the abuses he perpetrated."
"In power, he supported the Revolutionary United Front in neighbouring Sierra Leone, which, in alliance with renegade soldiers, overthrew President Kabbah in 1997, having wreaked havoc in the country since 1991, with tens of thousands of civilians brutally slaughtered, and which made use of child soldiers."
"The War Crimes Tribunal in Freetown, Sierra Leone, is a hybrid mix of national and international justice, accepted by all parties and with UN backing, and aims to be a model for other war courts not mandated by Chapter 7 UN resolutions."
"Taylor was indicted for war crimes by this court in 2003, but Nigeria is refusing to extradite him, claiming he has sovereign immunity and benefits from the asylum deal they agreed to."
"A children's rights group called FOCUS is now calling for his surrender to the court in Sierra Leone, directly blaming Taylor for the limb amputation of thousands of women and children in Sierra Leone, as well as for ordering bloody, cross-border raids into neighbouring Guinea."
"We now know that sovereign immunity no longer applies for war crimes, but the group has also pointed out that Taylor has breached the terms of his asylum by interfering in Liberian politics ahead of the elections scheduled there for October and by financing parties sympathetic to him with money he obtained corruptly through the diamond trade when in power as President."
"He presumably hopes that, with a change of government, he will be allowed back."
"President Obasanjo of Nigeria is currently Chairman of the African Union, and his country must set an example to the international community, and end impunity for bloody tyrants, by handing Taylor over."
". – Mr President, Charles Taylor, the former warlord president of Liberia, is alleged to have been responsible for gross human rights violations, including thousands of killings, widespread torture, massive forced displacement of populations and the breakdown of social and economic structures, over the ten year period of his rule over Liberia."
"In July 2003, Taylor fled the country and accepted the Nigerian Government's offer of asylum."
"In March 2003, Charles Taylor was indicted by the prosecutor of the Special Court of Sierra Leone on 17 counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes, including murder, mutilation, rape, sexual slavery and the recruitment of child soldiers."
"It is an insult to international law and an affront to human dignity that this alleged mass murderer continues to be given refuge by Nigeria."
"The Nigerian Government not only has a duty to humanity, but also has the obligation under the Geneva Convention, which it has ratified, immediately to surrender the infamous Charles Taylor to the jurisdiction of the Special Court of Sierra Leone, so that he can be tried, and if found guilty and punished accordingly."
"If it fails to do so, it should and will face the justifiably serious consequences from both the EU, and the international community in general."
"We should ask ourselves one question: why has it taken 14 years of rule by Taylor in Liberia, with him having already carried out all his terrors, before we decided to take some decisive action?"
"– Mr President, I am pleased to have this brief opportunity to strongly support this resolution."
"Perhaps the strongest contributing factor to the likelihood of current and future human rights abuses and war crimes is the fact that, in the past, persons of power have been allowed to act with impunity, with no fear of prosecution or trial under international law."
"This is particularly the case on the continent of Africa."
"This resolution emphasizes a high-profile case in the necessary fight by the international community to bring an end to the scourge of people committing human rights abuses with impunity, anywhere in the world."
"On 7 March 2003, Charles Taylor was indicted by the Prosecutor for the Special Court of Sierra Leone on 17 counts of crimes against humanity."
"These crimes included mutilation, rape, sexual slavery and the recruitment of child soldiers – all significant human rights abuses that this Parliament and the EU is trying to act against in a positive way."
"Charles Taylor is being protected and given asylum status in Nigeria at present, despite the fact that Nigeria has ratified the Geneva Convention which states that those that have committed war crimes may not be granted refugee status."
"I encourage the Council, the Commission and indeed the UN to act and take this resolution seriously."
". Mr President, the resolution before the House summarises the background to this question very well."
"Charles Taylor is indicted for heinous crimes, including extermination, murder, rape, enslavement, inhuman acts, crimes against humanity."
"The resolution also recognises the importance of the pacification process in the region, a process led and implemented by African countries and organisations."
"It has been said several times in this House that it is very important that African nations themselves take the cleaning up of the continent in hand."
"The crimes Charles Taylor is accused of are terrible and have led Interpol to add his name to the list of the most wanted criminals in the world."
"Taylor's challenge to the Special Court's indictment on the ground of presidential immunity was an insult to those who suffered the atrocities."
"Taylor's alleged interference in Liberia's economic and political life, and his openly expressed desire to return to the country, represent a threat to the continuation of peace-building in Liberia and to this year's electoral process."
"The non-execution of the arrest warrant issued by the Special Court undermines the legitimacy of this Court."
"The Special Court of Sierra Leone, unlike the international courts for Yugoslavia and Rwanda, was not granted a mandate under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter requiring all UN member states to comply with the court orders."
"Making the Special Court successful, therefore, needs the cooperative attitude of all countries hosting criminals."
"The Commission formally supports efforts by the European Union to ensure the handing over of Taylor to the Court."
"The latest UN initiative was during the high-level troika meeting with Nigeria in December."
"Nigeria's position has been as follows, and I quote: 'There cannot be impunity for Taylor."
"However he is currently a guest of the Nigerian Government and he will be handed over to the first democratically elected Liberian Government asking for his extradition'."
"The Commission believes that EU offers have to continue and we must make it clear that at some point – and we hope that this point is not too far away – Charles Taylor will have to go to trial."
"It is also vital that effective initiatives are taken in Nigeria and elsewhere to stop Taylor from continuing to interfere in Liberian affairs and destabilise other countries in the region."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place next."
"– Mr President, I just wanted to make it absolutely clear how the Special Court was established."
"Therefore, I propose that we amend the first citation of the joint resolution to read: 'having regard to the Special Court for Sierra Leone, established through an agreement between the United Nations and the Government of Sierra Leone pursuant to UN Security Council Resolution 1315 of 14 August 2000, with the aim of putting on trial those accused of war crimes, crimes against humanity and violations of international law committed in Sierra Leone,'."
"This is a tidying-up exercise."
"Furthermore, because of the importance of this issue to the international community, the Commission and the Member States, I should like to request a roll-call on the final vote."
"– Mr President, I support my colleague’s call for a roll call vote."
"We shall therefore treat this request as if it were presented by a political group and we shall vote on this joint motion for a resolution by roll call, with the oral amendment by Mr Deva incorporated."
"– Mr President, I obviously have no objections to this decision."
"I should like to state, however, that this morning we agreed with Commissioner Potočnik to request that a Conference of Presidents open to all Members be held at 2.30 p.m. on 6 April – and I would ask that this be entered in the Minutes – in order to present the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development."
"We would further ask that Commission President Barroso, Commissioner Reding and Commissioner Potočnik be present on this occasion to outline the Seventh Framework Programme to the House, and I would ask that the Conference of Presidents take a decision on this matter."
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on 24 February 2005."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin this sitting by making a statement on certain issues which are topical and which have been raised by some Members of this Parliament."
"Ladies and gentlemen, last Thursday, the Conference of Presidents of the Political Groups unanimously adopted a statement on the situation of journalists in Iraq for me to read to you today."
"This statement was the result of meetings I held with heads of the French and Italian media organisations of the European journalists held hostage in Iraq and representatives of the ‘Reporters Without Borders’ organisation."
"The Conference of Presidents issued this statement, which was very widely reported in the European media."
"A little later, on Friday afternoon, we were overjoyed to hear of the release of Giuliana Sgrena."
"That joy was soon overshadowed by the death of Nicola Calipari, who died tragically while using his own body to protect Giuliana."
"Let us acknowledge today the courage and sense of duty that lost Nicola Calipari his life in carrying out that duty."
"In tribute to him, I would like today to join with the Italian authorities, in particular Presidents Ciampi and Berlusconi, who have called on the United States authorities to clarify fully the dramatic circumstances in which Nicola Calipari died."
"As in other similar circumstances, we must know how and why these tragic events have taken place."
"This morning the whole of Italy paid a posthumous tribute."
"I would like our Parliament to join the Italian people in their acknowledgement and, on behalf of all of you, to communicate our solidarity and friendship to his family at this painful time."
"Today, Giuliana is back amongst us and enjoying freedom, but we must continue our efforts to achieve the release of Florence Aubenas and her interpreter and guide, Hussein Hanun Al-Saadi."
"They are still being held captive, held by people who reject the right to information and, therefore, democracy."
"As from today, pictures of them will be displayed at the entrance to our Chamber."
"They are a visual demonstration of our solidarity."
"The European Parliament wants them to return to their friends and families as soon as possible."
"In these circumstances, the European Parliament must once again state that there can be no democracy without freedom of information and that the security of journalists must be protected in every part of the world."
"We must take every possible measure to ensure that the media can carry out their duties, particularly in regions where there is armed conflict, including Iraq."
"After this statement on topical issues, some painful and some happy, I must make another statement on what we may call historical commemorations."
"As you know, centuries of fratricidal wars between our countries are etched on our memories."
"As President of the European Parliament, I frequently receive requests for minutes of silence to commemorate the events which remind us of the saddest moments in our history."
"Just a few days ago, our Polish colleagues asked that we observe a minute’s silence to remember the massacre in Katyn, Miednoye and Jarkov, when 14 000 Polish officers were executed in cold blood by the Stalin regime on 5 March 1940."
"There is no question that this is a legitimate request and it is our duty not to forget those events or the victims of them."
"But every day, given the history of our continent – a tragic and turbulent history – the calendar is going to record sad events for each of our countries."
"This is the case because Europe has been divided by wars in which millions of our fellow citizens have died."
"Nevertheless, although we must remember the past – and we do – last week the Conference of Presidents agreed not to observe a minute’s silence or make statements systematically at every plenary session on every occasion when we are reminded of a painful event."
"Our current history, our reunification, must help us to overcome the events of the past and to remember that the consolidation of peace and democracy, the values of the European Union, must prevent them from ever happening again."
"Finally, while I hope that all our fellow Members understand the resolution we have adopted in this regard, I must mention the police repression suffered by women who were demonstrating in Istanbul ahead of International Women’s day."
"Before coming to this plenary session, I issued a press release in which I strongly condemn these events and I call on the Turkish Government to apply exemplary penalties in relation to events that in no way send the correct message in terms of Turkey’s possible entry into the European Union."
"The final version of the draft agenda for the present part-session as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 3 March pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed."
"No amendment has been proposed."
"I have received two requests for the Commission to make statements."
"On the one hand, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has requested that the Commission make a statement on its position on services in the internal market."
"The Commission is prepared to make that statement and we could discuss this issue tomorrow, Tuesday, from 6.00 p.m. to 6.30 p.m., with a communication from Commissioner McCreevy, followed by questions and answers by means of the ‘catch-the-eye’ procedure."
"Secondly, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has requested that Commissioner McCreevy make a statement tomorrow, Tuesday, at the same time, on the Directive on the patentability of computer software, followed, at least, by speeches by the political groups."
"The Group of the Greens has also requested that on Wednesday the Council and Commission statement on the health workers detained in Libya be replaced by a Council and Commission statement on the patentability of computer software."
"Clearly, to a large extent, these requests are not compatible with each other."
"We cannot approve all of them."
"We cannot discuss two different things at the same time, and I shall therefore have to submit the requests for amendments to the agenda to a vote in the order in which I have received them."
"If any of them is approved, there would be no point in voting for the others, since that would clearly contradict the decision we had adopted."
"I am therefore going to submit the Group of the Green’s request that the Commission make a statement on its position on services in the internal market to a vote by a show of hands, naturally."
"Mr President, is there any reason why the Commission cannot deal with both the Services Directive and software patents at 6 p.m. tomorrow?"
"This would allow us to keep the serious and ongoing issue of the health workers detained in Libya on the agenda for Wednesday."
"– Mr President, we could go along with that suggestion."
"If Commissioner McCreevy were to make a short statement on both matters, we in the groups could then decide where our priorities lay."
"I would support this as an alternative compromise."
"– Mr President, we too are perfectly happy with this proposal, on condition that discussion of the subject is not completed in thirty minutes."
"Mr President, I did not properly understand what you were proposing to us at the start."
"What we want is for its to be possible for the two issues, that of the patenting of computer software and that of theservices directive, to be tackled during the sitting."
"For example, one could be dealt with on Tuesday and the other on Wednesday, or at any other time, but placing one of the two on the agenda must not lead to the other’s being removed."
"Mr President, we do not agree with this proposal."
"In fact, we want there to be a debate involving clarification of the Commission’s position on the directive on liberalisation of services."
"That is very important."
"Regarding the patentability of computer software, we consider that Parliament’s work should be done in the normal way."
"There will necessarily be a debate within our Parliament, but as part of the second reading procedure, since we have just adopted a joint position."
"We do not, therefore, want there to be any confusion between the two debates, and we prefer to give all the time needed to the debate following the Commission statement on the directive on liberalisation of services."
"– Mr President, I should just like to make it clear that our request regarding the software patents debate was a call not just for a Commission statement but also for a Council statement."
"Mr President, irrespective of how the vote turns out, I would just ask you to ensure that tomorrow’s questions to the Commission can be of the same length, as that is a fundamental parliamentary right, and one guaranteed by the Treaties."
"Very well, Mr Posselt, you may rest assured that we shall do that."
"I believe we should vote on an amendment to the agenda to the effect that tomorrow, from 6.00 p.m. to 6.45 p.m., the Commission should make a statement on the two items proposed, that is to say, on services in the internal market and on the Directive on the patentability of computer software, for which there are currently more requests in favour."
"Mr President, I beg leave to make a comment on the procedure."
"I would ask you first to have a vote on the services directive, for which there may or may not be a majority."
"We can then – still in a split vote – move on to the software business."
"If you have them both voted on together, you may well end up with a result that this House does not want in the least, and so I ask that we vote item by item."
"This is a complicated issue."
"We shall proceed as follows, and this is a decision by the Presidency that I will carry out next."
"We shall vote on the request for the Commission to make a statement tomorrow on services in the internal market and then, regardless of the result of that vote, we shall vote on the proposal that the Commission make a statement tomorrow on the patentability of computer software."
"If both are approved, they will take place jointly from 6.00 p.m. to 6.45 p.m."
"We shall proceed to the vote on the proposal that the Commission make a statement on services in the internal market:"
"– Mr President, I am really sorry but I do not understand what we are voting on at the moment."
"Are we voting on replacing the debate on the services directive with the debate on the software patents directive?"
"Mrs Frassoni, we have voted on a proposal that tomorrow there should be a Commission communication."
"Now we are going to vote on another proposal that there should be a Commission communication tomorrow on the patentability of computer software."
"We shall proceed to the vote."
"Tomorrow, therefore, from 6.00 p.m. to 6.45 p.m., there will be a Commission statement on the two issues we have dealt with."
"Mr President, this concerns the last decision you made."
"I wish to make two points."
"As Coordinator for the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the question of the internal market for services, I hope that first of all we will have the first opportunity..."
"Which Rule are you invoking?"
"Mr President, this is new."
"We do not have a point of order, we have a new procedure."
"We have now agreed to combine two statements and I would like to ask …"
"Mr Harbour, please sit down."
"You do not have the floor."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament have requested that the whole of Wednesday morning be dedicated to the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy and that the debate be extended until 12.30 p.m."
"The agenda could be presented as follows: from 9.00 a.m. to 12.30 p.m., mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy."
"At 12.30 p.m., the vote."
"From 3.00 p.m. to 5.30 p.m., Council and Commission Statements, firstly on the preparation of the Brussels European Council, and secondly on the health workers detained in Libya."
"Mr President, I would be very much against removing from the agenda a debate on the health workers detained in Libya."
"Indeed, my understanding is that there is no longer a request to remove that item from the agenda."
"Mr President, could you explain again?"
"You are keeping the statement on the Lisbon strategy between the hours of 9 a.m. and 12.30 p.m."
"The votes will take place at 12.30 p.m., but at what time will the debate on the health workers detained in Libya take place?"
"From 3.00 p.m. to 5.30 p.m., we would debate the two Council and Commission statements on the Brussels European Council and on the health workers detained in Libya."
"Fortunately, we do not have any proposed amendment for the Thursday sitting."
"Pursuant to Rule 144 of the Rules of Procedure, we shall proceed to the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"– Mr President, you have paid tribute to the name and the story of Nicola Calipari, a high-ranking Italian State and SISMI intelligence officer, who was in Baghdad for the fourth time with the task of rescuing a hostage from the hands of armed terrorist groups who have murdered Iraqis."
"Thank you for doing so, but I should also like to say that it might perhaps be time for Parliament to stop being unintentionally racist."
"The fact is that we consider the death of a westerner to be an event of worldwide significance, but we remain silent while Iraqi men and women are continually being slaughtered for the sake of ideologies like Saddam Hussein’s and other comparable ideas, just as we have also stayed silent about the mass graves in Katyn for the last fifty years."
"That is an absolute disgrace!"
"Mr President, I should like to make the point I was going to make earlier."
"Could I say to you first of all that as political group coordinator for the committee most affected by the new procedure for tomorrow, you should have allowed me to speak earlier."
"I hope that the discussion on the internal market for services will be taken first and that we have enough time."
"Last Thursday, when we had a special meeting with the rapporteur, all the committee members signed an oral question."
"It was not in time but we want that statement in full."
"The second point is crucial and I feel I was perfectly entitled to make it when everyone was here."
"As a number of colleagues have indicated, the statement on the Computer-Implemented Inventions Directive must also involve the Council."
"The issue at stake is that the Council reached an agreement today. You completely ignored that, Mr President."
"You did not indicate whether the Council would be available."
"That was the point that I wanted to put to you."
"The coordinators and senior people involved in the discussions have detailed knowledge, and if you are going to stop them commenting on changes of procedure, you are not doing justice to the Members of this House when they are discussing changes to the agenda."
"Thank you very much, Mr Harbour."
"You will appreciate that changes to the agenda always create conflict and controversy;"
"I must deal with the requests made by the political groups via their spokespeople."
"Mr President, this House has a very proud record of supporting the peace process in Northern Ireland and of supporting both the Irish and United Kingdom Governments in trying to achieve a lasting solution to the difficulties there."
"It is the view of both the Irish and UK Governments that the only remaining obstacle to peace is the criminality and paramilitary activity of the IRA, a statement that was greeted with some surprise by IRA circles."
"However, the events of the last few months – the raid on the Northern Bank, the murder of Robert McCartney, the intimidation of witnesses, the evidence of money laundering – suggest there is extensive criminality, which has now become part and parcel of the Northern Ireland scene."
"I hope that this Parliament will send a message of support to both governments and tell all parties that criminality has no place whatsoever in political action."
"Criminality imprisons people, it does not liberate them."
"For Croatia to become an associate member, it has pushed through far-reaching reforms in the last few years in order to meet the European Union’s political, economic and legal requirements, the so-called Copenhagen criteria.The Council has recognised these efforts, thanks to which in December last year Croatia won the status of associate member, and a date was set for the start of accession talks."
"However, disputes surrounding the handover of General Gotovina have created uncertainty as to whether Croatia can really begin the negotiations."
"During the talks in Zagreb last week, our committee should have satisfied itself that the Croatian Government is responding to the Council Decision of 17 December and is wholeheartedly cooperating with the International Tribunal."
"Above all, I ask the members of the Council that they accept as wholehearted cooperation the fact that 625 of the Hague Prosecutor’s 626 demands have been met."
"It is not fitting for the history of European Union enlargement that the destiny of a thousand-year-old European nation should be tied to a single man."
"Ladies and gentlemen, genuine integration of the peoples of Europe will only be possible on the basis of truth."
"On the occasion of the recent commemoration of the tragedy suffered by the victims of the Auschwitz German concentration camp it was clear that not everyone finds this truth pleasantor easy to accept."
"Today I should like to draw Members’ attention to certain events deliberately written out of modern European history."
"Sixty-five years ago, the Polish nation felt the full brunt of the coalition between the two criminals Hitler and Stalin."
"The aim of this coalition was to annihilate the state of Poland and the Polish people, and to subjugate Europe."
"On 10 February 1940, the Soviet aggressors began the inhumane task of deporting Polish families to Siberia, the Golgotha of the East."
"Children, women and old people were snatched from their homes in the dead of the winter night and herded into cattle trucks."
"After a journey in life-threatening conditions that lasted several weeks, they arrived at the forced labour camps in the so-called evil land, where temperatures fall as low as 40 ºC."
"Years of humiliation, hunger, disease and homesickness awaited those who survived the journey, and 1 500 000 innocent people were deported in this manner merely because they were Polish."
"Such wrongdoing continued even after the end of the war, when Poland was ruled by the Soviet Union."
"The majority of my fellow citizens did not survive these genocidal deportations."
"My fellow Europeans, are you familiar with this period of history?"
"Do they teach children about it in European schools?"
"If we wish to build a peaceful future for our peoples, we must stand in truth, both before..."
"– As you mentioned, Mr President, yesterday, 6 March, a demonstration in Istanbul to mark International Women’s Day was brutally put down by the Turkish police and dozens of people were detained."
"Unfortunately, this act of violence is not an isolated incident."
"On 26 February, an activist of the EMEP, the Turkish Labour Party, was shot."
"I wish to express my solidarity with your words, Mr President, and would ask you to condemn such acts to the Turkish authorities and demand that the perpetrators be held to account."
"– Mr President, we have heard that the Cuban Foreign Affairs Minister is to visit the EU and that you are going to receive him."
"I do not know if this is true, but we should like confirmation."
"If it is true, it would never even cross our minds to have him kicked out, unlike the Cuban Government, which did just that to Spanish and Dutch Members of this House a few months ago."
"On the contrary, we feel that he should be received and we want him to be received."
"There are three things that we would like to ask you to do once this visit is confirmed, Mr President."
"The first request is that you forward to the Cuban Foreign Affairs Minister the resolution adopted by Parliament on 17 November of last year, which is Parliament’s position on the Cuban situation."
"Secondly, if the Minister does come here, he will be coming without an invitation."
"We have nothing against this, but we have repeatedly invited Oswaldo Payá Sardiñas, the 2002 Sakharov Prize winner, to come to Parliament, and it is this Minister’s government – the Cuban Government – that has not allowed him to come."
"We would therefore strongly urge you to emphasise that we want Oswaldo Payá to be able to come to Parliament to discuss the Cuban situation with us."
"Lastly, a request: I would ask them to release the political prisoners, to release the political prisoners in Cuba once and for all, and to announce a general amnesty, particularly for all those targeted by the March 2003 wave of repression."
"Thank you very much, Mr Ribeiro e Castro."
"In fact, tomorrow at 7.30 p.m. I shall receive the Cuban Minister for Foreign Affairs."
"You may rest assured that I take very good note of your request and I shall communicate it to the Minister."
"Mr President, I would like to refer to a manifesto issued by 157 state school teachers from the Basque Country affected by a Basque Government decree which means that they will lose the jobs they have been doing for more than 15 years, because they have not achieved a sufficiently high level in the Basque language, the co-official language with Castilian and the language in which the subject they teach is taught."
"They are the victims of a form of linguistic discrimination which puts political considerations before professional qualifications."
"They are suffering discrimination when compared to other groups of teachers and other public administration departments."
"It is regrettable that the Basque Government, in its intransigence, is forcing these teachers out of the Basque public system, without recognising the professional work they have done or offering any compensatory solution."
"Mr President, thank you for giving me the floor."
"I should like to endorse what has been said about the situation in Turkey."
"Over and above Parliament’s rejection, expressed by the President, I should like to ask whether there are further initiatives the President has considered taking in this connection."
"That is because this Parliament has, for the most part, been sympathetic to Turkish membership – and we, for our part, are very positive about Turkish membership of the EU, which we see as presenting great possibilities – and it is incredibly important that Parliament also be the first to shout out and protest whenever Turkey is clearly moving in the wrong direction."
"If the President could come up with an offer of further initiatives, that would be very helpful."
"Mr President, a few days ago doctors at the World Health Organization warned that the world faces the very grave possibility of the virus known as bird flu triggering a human flu pandemic."
"The mortality rate for the virus is currently around 72%."
"Should the virus spread among humans, this flu could kill literally millions of people."
"The World Health Organization advises that stockpiling vaccines is just one of the measures governments can implement to combat the spread of the virus."
"Italy and France reportedly plan to stockpile two million doses of a vaccine each, while the UK has decided against this owing to the difficulty of designing an effective anti-viral drug in advance against a mutative virus."
"Klaus Stöhr, head of the World Health Organization’s Global Influenza Programme, voiced his concerns in November last year."
"It is now time to ask whether the European Union is doing enough to prepare itself for a potential pandemic, and if not, why not?"
"Mr President, millions of people around the world are currently observing International Women’s Day, and that includes Turkey, where, as we have heard, their demonstration was brutally suppressed."
"I thank you for responding so rapidly and for sending out the right message."
"We have to see the women of Turkey given their democratic rights, or else the country’s accession will come to nothing."
"Something else I would like to mention is that this House will, tomorrow, be discussing the outcomes of the UN’s ‘Beijing + 10’ Conference."
"The debate will begin tomorrow morning with an oral question, and the vote will be held at midday."
"President Barroso has now sent out invitations to an exchange of information with ten members of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality to be held at that same time."
"This I regard as an affront, and none of our Members should have any part in such a meeting, held here in this House but ignoring the vote."
"I ask that it be made clear to Mr Barroso that we have to do our duty here in the plenary, and it is there that we will be debating women’s rights."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on my own behalf and on behalf of the ‘Green Initiative’ Association, I should like to alert Members to the potential destruction of the environment along the Lower Oder between the cities of Szczecin and Schwedt, on the Polish-German border."
"There are plans to reconstruct the channel at this point, or in other words to widen and deepen it."
"The work is more than likely to damage and destroy the International Lower Oder Valley Park."
"Having seen the plans, I am convinced that this reconstructed channel will destroy the local peat bogs, as well as disrupting water flow and destroying natural breeding grounds for birds."
"I am certain that in this day and age and in this House there will surely be no lack of people willing to fight to protect the environment from destruction."
"– Mr President, the question of Lebanon is included in this week's agenda."
"We shall be debating the withdrawal of the Syrian occupying forces from Lebanon, a Security Council resolution."
"We here – in civilised Europe – welcome this, we applaud it and there is not one among us who does not want the occupying army to leave Lebanon."
"However, there is also an identical Security Council resolution for the Turkish occupying army in Cyprus."
"Is there no sensitivity on that subject?"
"We cannot maintain that there are two sets of standards?"
"We here in the European Parliament must say that what applies to the Syrian army – which must leave Lebanon – should also apply to the Turkish army, which must leave Cyprus."
"It is an identical resolution by an identical council, the Security Council."
"If, therefore, we really want democracy and equality before the law, we should call on the Turkish army to leave Cyprus, just as we are calling on the Syrian army to leave Lebanon."
"Mr President, like Mrs Dührkop Dührkop, I wish to condemn in this House the fact that 157 teachers in the Basque Country, 157 workers with more than 15 years professional and educational experience, may lose their jobs for linguistic reasons, because they do not speak a particular language."
"The Basque Government, headed by Mr Ibarretxe, wishes to discriminate against, to marginalise and to expel these Basque teachers from the administration."
"This is a scandalous case of linguistic and educational apartheid, which is contrary to the Spanish Constitution, to the Gernika Statute, to the European Constitutional Treaty and to the Charter on Human Rights, since the right to work is a human right and these teachers are going to be deprived of that right by means of a nationalist decree despite their professional and educational experience."
"What the Basque Government is doing, ladies and gentlemen, does not conform to educational or academic criteria, but to the ideological, political, xenophobic and exclusive criteria of the Ibarretxe Plan."
"The Europe of freedoms, solidarity and equality must therefore ensure that regrettable cases such as this do not arise again in any part of our European Union."
"– Mr President, I should like to commend you for taking a stance so promptly on the sad events in Turkey that we saw on television yesterday, where a demonstration to mark International Women’s Day was put down in a manner that was both extremely brutal and incompatible with Turkey’s commitments arising from its application to join the EU and from the decision made by Parliament and by the European institutions to open negotiations."
"Mr President, you requested sanctions that would set an example and those sanctions demand that not only the perpetrators of this brutality but also those in charge of giving the orders be brought to book."
"Combating impunity is an essential factor in promoting human rights and impunity is rife in Turkey."
"This was seen recently with the death of the Kurdish child, Ugur Kaymaz, which was covered up by the Turkish police."
"The Commission and the Council must also send out a clear message to Turkey that this is incompatible with its commitments as regards negotiating accession to the EU and that respect for human rights involves not only changing the law, but also putting that respect into practice."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Gomes."
"You will have noted that in the Presidency’s initial statement I referred to this issue and to the press release I have issued on behalf of all of you."
"– Mr President, in your opening speech you recalled the death of Nicola Calipari, but I would rather call it the murder of Nicola Calipari."
"A statement by Mr Barroso was put out a few minutes ago, in which he describes what happened as an unfortunate incident."
"I do not know whether the Commission has any information that has not yet been made public which enables him to state that it was an unfortunate incident and not something more serious."
"About an hour ago, CNN, referring to Pentagon sources, leaked the conclusion reached by the US inquiry, which is that it was simply a misunderstanding between the Italian and US authorities over the communication that the vehicles would be going past."
"I should like to endorse the demand by Reporters Without Borders for a United Nations inquiry to be set up, and I call on the Commission and the Council to support their demand."
"In addition, I request that this issue should be included in the debate within the European Union on transatlantic relations, since we, as the European Union, have a very specific responsibility."
"Mr President, as has already been mentioned, this week we celebrate International Women’s Day, but I also hope that during this week Parliament will take time to help raise awareness of an illness that affects more than 14 million women across Europe: endometriosis."
"This week is also Endometriosis Awareness Week."
"I know we get fed up with weeks for this and weeks for that, but this horrible disease is too little talked about and too often dismissed."
"The average time for diagnosing it is going up: it now stands at nine years."
"It affects 14 million women across Europe."
"For this disease there is still no known cause and no cure."
"It wrecks lives and families."
"If nothing else makes us think, perhaps the fact that over EUR 30 billion is lost to our economy every year might make us think."
"There will be a written declaration on this open later this week."
"I hope colleagues will take the opportunity to sign it and support raising awareness of this horrible disease."
"Mr President, while endorsing the last point, I also wish to emphasise the points made by Mr Mitchell."
"The World Health Organization has issued one of its severest warnings ever on an imminent flu pandemic, likely to be on a scale not seen since 1917, and yet Parliament remains mute."
"We asked for this matter to be placed on the agenda of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety; it is not on the agenda this week."
"We asked for it to be placed on the plenary agenda; it is not on the agenda this week."
"The United States took action six months ago."
"Member States are beginning to take what amounts to inadequate action now."
"Mr President, will you write to the Commission and request a progress report on the action being taken by the Commission and Member States, and attach the response to the Minutes of this sitting?"
"Could you also ensure that, through your good offices and mine, pressure is exerted on the Commission to make a statement the next time Parliament meets in plenary?"
"Thank you, Mr Bowis."
"I have taken good note of your request. We shall deal with it."
"Mr President, thank you; another incident has occurred in Turkey to which I should like to draw attention."
"It has been reported in the press that the Turkish Foreign Minister, Mr Gül, has been critical of the European Commission’s representative, Mr Kretschmer, and has, in fact treated with contempt the criticisms he has made in recent days."
"Speaking as one who voted in favour of the commencement of negotiations with Turkey and is still committed to them, I believe that it is quite improper for Mr Gül to heap contempt on someone such as Mr Kretschmer, who is very calm and level-headed."
"Let it be known to the Commission that we are right behind Mr Kretschmer in the justified criticisms he has levelled at Turkey."
"Notwithstanding our support for the commencement of negotiations with Turkey, Mr Gül’s recent actions are unacceptable."
"Mr President, further to what was said earlier by Mr Harbour, I would like to take this opportunity to make it quite plain that I think the House was very wise earlier to decide that we would be discussing both the Software Patent Directive and the Services Directive tomorrow evening."
"I also want to make it clear, in my capacity as rapporteur on the Services Directive, that I see it as unacceptable for that directive to be used to exclude other, equally important, legislation from the European Parliament."
"As that is something I am neither able nor willing to accept, our group has abstained."
"Mr President, we have become used to receiving bad and alarming news from Russia."
"I have another incident to add to the long list of bad news."
"The Finno-Ugric Mari people are currently suffering severe discrimination."
"The Mari people live in an autonomous republic of the Russian Federation."
"Recently, attacks, beatings and killings have been reported."
"The targets are journalists and opposition leaders such as Yelena Rogacheva and Vladimir Kozlov."
"What is more disgusting is that the regional government, run by a Moscow-born politician, is inactive and completely indifferent to these serious violations of human rights."
"I call on the European Parliament to protest against these violations and to call on the regional government of the Federation to put a stop to human rights abuses."
"Mr President, I should like to draw the attention of the House to the McCartney family in Belfast and pay tribute to their strength in their response to the recent murder of their brother and son Robert McCartney."
"Many of us have been touched by the strength of this family."
"This murder must be condemned by all right-thinking people."
"It is not enough for Sinn Fein and the IRA to say they are going to make excuses or give up one person or five people."
"Everyone guilty of this attack should be given up to the forces of law and order in Belfast."
"There is no other way to do this."
"You cannot have half a law; you cannot apologise for the law."
"The law is the law."
"That is what we have to recognise as a Parliament and as people."
"I urge you to exert maximum pressure to show that this Parliament is totally opposed to these ongoing attacks and murders."
"I have suffered far too much of that in my own constituency."
"Thankfully things are much better now."
"Mr President, the highpoint of the opening of the so-called parliament of Communist China was the announcement of the vote on an anti-separatist law, amounting, in fact, to a threat against Taiwan, which – as we all know – has been a democratic country enjoying independence since 1941."
"At the same time, the Communist regime announced a 12.6% increase in military expenditure."
"It is difficult to see the two facts in complete isolation from one another."
"It is at a time such as this that the European Council is preparing to lift the arms embargo against China, a decision which is completely unacceptable if Europe wants to retain its credibility in terms of human rights in the world."
"It is therefore desirable that this House should send a strong message in favour of maintaining the arms embargo and against the so-called People’s Republic of China’s threat of aggression against democratic Taiwan."
"In Leeuwarden, Friesland, a strike is underway involving 30 workers of the company Atoglas who are protesting against the plan by its French parent company, Total Fina Elf, to close it down."
"Atoglas is a successful and innovative company, for which independent experts have predicted a profitable future."
"The works council is completely behind this statement and wants to avoid closure, but the French management want to close the company down all the same."
"It is beyond me that Total Fina Elf should remain deaf to the works council’s arguments."
"Total Fina presents itself as a socially responsible enterprise."
"The least it should do is to listen to what the works council has to say."
"It is also beyond me that Total Fina should remain blind to the innovation that is taking place in Friesland, and, as the European Constitution specifically states that regional coherence and solidarity between the Member States is a common goal, we can also expect French companies to have an eye for regional development in the Netherlands."
"The strikers in Friesland are making an appeal to this European goal and to Total Fina to keep Atoglas open."
"I would urge my fellow MEPs to support the strikers in Friesland."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that you and many others have already called attention to the way in which yesterday’s women’s march in Istanbul was broken up, but also to other serious irregularities in Turkey."
"This House cannot protest enough against this."
"Those women yesterday had personal and first-hand experience of the Turkish Government’s somewhat casual approach to respect for human rights."
"Now, however, Commissioner Rehn, who is responsible for enlargement, and is today starting his first official visit to Turkey in preparation of the opening of the accession negotiations, should realise that such violent action does indeed matter."
"This situation illustrates the fact that there is still little evidence in real life of the many reforms that exist on paper, that many reforms in terms of minority rights – those of the Kurds, for example – have even ground to a complete standstill and that we in this House must closely monitor developments over the next few months."
"Mr President, regarding the financial perspectives, the situation is extremely worrying in a lot of areas, especially those of rural development and environmental protection."
"Clearly, ‘more Europe’ cannot be achieved with less money."
"The financial resources for 2007-2013 are manifestly insufficient, but budgetary constraints affect the Fifteen and the ten new Member States differently."
"For us, the rural development funds would make it possible in some degree to offset the severely discriminatory measures taken at the Copenhagen Summit, in accordance with which small farmers in the ten new Member States receive only 25% of the direct aid."
"For us, there was just one hope of compensation."
"This took the form of the much-vaunted rural development, which has been declared to be a priority of the European Union where the agricultural world is concerned."
"Resources do, however, clearly appear to be restricted or limited."
"I would ask the Commission to make sure that resources for the benefit of the least advanced regions are not reduced."
"Mr President, Voltaire, the philosopher of the Enlightenment, once stated that although he may disagree with what you think, he would fight tooth and nail to defend your right to say it."
"Unfortunately, we who think we uphold human rights across the world sometimes overlook the fact that we should put our own House in order."
"God knows that I, with my political ideas, do not see eye to eye with the Mayor of London or the French comedian Dieudonné, but I will never ever stop them from saying what they have said in the recent past."
"Wherever we may be on the political spectrum, though, we should join forces in expressing our indignation about the way in which the Torquemadas of the University of Lyon have sacrificed a Member of this House, Mr Gollnisch, on the altar of political correctness, simply on account of an indiscretion of opinion."
"Even though your opinion may be diametrically opposed to his, he has never misused his professorship or his status as an expert on Japan for the sake of political advantage and, outside the university, he should be entitled to say what he likes."
"What happened in Lyon today is a disgrace."
"We must end the one-minute speeches."
"Many Members, including myself, are not satisfied with the ‘catch-the-eye’ procedure."
"I understand all of those who ask to take the floor, but not everybody can speak."
"We shall have to seek a procedure with which we are all rather more satisfied."
"I understand everybody’s point of view, but I have half an hour and I try to be balanced when giving the floor;"
"I know that after each sitting more and more Members are angry with the President."
"We must seek a procedure that will ensure that these speeches can take place in a manner that is more acceptable to everybody."
"Although I have raised the issue of European prisoners in Thailand a number of times, the plight of the Dutch prisoners compels me to raise the issue again."
"Not only is Rien Parlevliet seriously ill, and Li Yang and Eddy Tang, both from Rotterdam, are in a bad way, but I should also, and particularly, like to again highlight the cause of Machiel Kuijt."
"In April 1997, he was arrested, acquitted, suddenly condemned to lifelong imprisonment in further appeal six and a half years later and is now awaiting the Court of Cassation’s verdict."
"In January 2004, on the occasion of the Dutch royal visit to Thailand, it was promised that the verdict would be delivered before the summer, since which time we have heard nothing from the Supreme Court."
"We are being taken for a ride by the Thai legal authorities and this humiliation should not persist any longer."
"Although consular affairs are within the remit of the Member States, I ask myself in all honesty whether the EU can allow the fundamental rights of its citizens to be flouted to this extent."
"It is a good thing that the Commission follows these matters, but the Council and High Representative also have a role to play in this."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A6-0032/2005) by Alain Lipietz, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Report on the activities of the European Investment Bank (2003) [2004/2187(INI)]."
"Mr President, it is exactly five years since the European Parliament began its dialogue with the European Investment Bank in an own-initiative report."
"I was already your rapporteur five years ago and I can therefore bear witness to the extraordinary progress those five years have seen in the quality of the dialogue between the European Investment Bank and the European Parliament, in the quality of that dialogue with civil society and in the matching of the European Investment Bank’s policy with the tasks assigned to it since the European Union was formed."
"I would therefore like to begin by expressing the heartfelt gratitude of all of us who were already present during the last legislative period and, I hope, of all who will now be taking an interest in the European Investment Bank’s work and its contribution to the implementation of European policy."
"Warm congratulations and thanks, too, to the EIB’s directors with whom we maintained this dialogue."
"It has been a demanding dialogue, a rich dialogue, with genuine interaction on both sides."
"We have changed our perception of the EIB and the EIB has changed its own perception of its responsibilities."
"I would therefore like to take advantage of the few minutes allotted to me to sum up the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs’ unanimous report and underline the five most salient points of our report, in questioning terms of course."
"Firstly, we can no longer be content with talking about Lisbon and Gothenburg, we now need to try to make progress in clarifying the objectives."
"The EIB recognises that it exists to assist European Union policy; it needs to adopt criteria, quantitative indicators, in dialogue with Parliament."
"Secondly, we in the European Parliament were among those calling most strongly for the European Investment Bank to make loans to small and medium-sized businesses."
"However, that can only be done by means of global loans, which are made to banks, and the banks distribute the credits."
"In this case, we risk losing the ability to check that these loans are consistent with European Union objectives and we need to find a way of checking where these global loans have gone, obviously."
"Thirdly, it has to be possible to extend this microcredit policy to an area that is very important in a society that is both a knowledge-based economy and also an ageing economy."
"I am speaking of third-sector enterprises that provide assistance to individuals and families."
"The fourth problem is that a potential conflict emerged during the hearing we held."
"The European Investment Bank is making a lot of effort to offer cheap long-term loans to local and regional authorities."
"Attractive as these loans are, however, they obviously come up against the limits imposed by the Stability and Growth Pact."
"The tendency to get around that difficulty by making loans to private businesses guaranteed by the State obviously introduces an ‘off-balance sheet’ risk."
"We suggest that the European Investment Bank should emulate the European Central Bank in adopting rules of ethics."
"Finally, my last point: in the first version of my report we noted the criticism voiced in certain sections of the press, mainly outside the European Union as it happens, regarding possible conflicts of interest involving senior EIB management staff because of their past activities at the head of large private undertakings that might benefit from EIB loans."
"Since then, the EIB has sent us a whole series of new internal codes designed to avoid such conflicts of interest or at any rate to take account of them by dealing with them before they arise."
"I have therefore tabled an amendment which I believe has been taken up by all group coordinators or shadow rapporteurs, thanking the European Investment Bank and noting the details it has provided following our vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
". Mr President, the Commission welcomes the report of the European Parliament on the EIB annual report 2003 and encourages the EIB Group and Parliament to continue the ongoing dialogue which has developed over successive annual reports."
"The Commission is working more and more closely with the EIB Group on a wide range of issues, both within and outside the European Union."
"As a ‘policy driven’ bank, the EIB needs to keep its finger on the pulse of European policy development and to react when necessary."
"Within the Union, the EIB has a very important role to play in taking forward the Lisbon Agenda and the European Action for Growth."
"I would particularly like to highlight, as does Parliament’s report, the Innovation 2010 Initiative, which supports innovation and research and development, and the TEN Infrastructure Facility, which finances TEN projects."
"The bank’s long experience of infrastructure projects, and therefore its ability to offer expert advice, can and should add value above and beyond the financial advantages conferred by its loans."
"I would especially welcome the environmental activities of the EIB, particularly its expanded lending for renewable energy projects."
"Outside the Union, the European Investment Bank has expanded its operations with existing partners and also taken on new partners."
"I would particularly like to highlight the bank’s work in the Mediterranean partner countries, where activities under the FEMIP have grown year-on-year."
"As Parliament has noted, we will need to ensure that the bank’s future external activities are firmly framed in the context of the Community’s external relations policies."
"We will take this into account during the work to develop the next set of external lending mandates, which will need to be in place from 2007 onwards."
"Parliament’s report suggests that prudential rules be laid down to ensure that EIB loans do not compromise the sustainability of the Member States’ public debt."
"I would like to point out that the existing framework under the Stability and Growth Pact provides a detailed and powerful mechanism for ensuring that Member States’ borrowing is undertaken in a sustainable fashion."
"Of course, you will be aware that we are seeking to enhance the Pact still further."
"Among the elements of revision of the Pact that have been discussed, there is the need to increase the focus on long-term aspects of public finances, and to take increasingly into account government risks that can lead to increased debt in the future."
"Specifically on public-private partnerships, the Commission has provided more detailed statistical guidance for recording them in public accounts and has stressed the importance of demonstrating their value for money."
"The Commission acknowledges the good work undertaken by the EIB in recent years to improve its transparency and corporate governance."
"The new EIB corporate governance statement provides a useful summary of its policies across a range of corporate governance aspects."
"The Commission encourages the EIB to listen closely to the comments received during the forthcoming public consultation exercise on its public information policies."
"In conclusion, the Commission welcomes Parliament’s report and hopes that the fruitful policy dialogue between the European Investment Bank and Parliament will continue."
". Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Lipietz for his report, because it is balanced and at the same time positive about the EIB’s result."
"This is wholly justified because, compared to previous years, the EIB has undergone some positive developments, especially in terms of transparency and openness."
"I should also like, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, to congratulate the EIB and particularly its President, Mr Maystadt, even though we recognise that some changes need to be made where supervision is concerned."
"The issue of the EIB’s prudential control is therefore – and with good reason – one of the key subjects in the annual report, and it is one to which, unfortunately, an adequate solution has not yet been found."
"The question is how prudential control can be best guaranteed in future."
"I should like to ask the EIB and the Commission to present a view on prudential control by the next annual report."
"Can that be done?"
"I would now like to turn to the objectives."
"The emphasis should indeed be on the role which the EIB can play in the Lisbon strategy, in strengthening innovation, as well as research and development."
"More synergy between the EIB’s and the Commission’s programmes can help considerably, as can cofinancing from the Commission’s programmes for projects, for example, in the framework of the Innovation 2010 initiative, but also vice versa."
"If the Commission has approved projects and cofinancing is required, it would be good if the EIB were able to contribute financially."
"I should therefore like to ask the EIB to develop a suitable instrument for this, so that, for example, companies are able to take part in programmes such as CRAFT and Collective Research more quickly."
"SMEs must be given an even more enhanced role where the use of loans is concerned, because the differences between Member States are significant."
"I would therefore urge the EIB, during promotion, to involve the SMEs directly and promote credits not only via banks in the Member States, because there appear to be too many differences between the Member States, especially between the new ones."
"I would like to congratulate you again, and we are happy to support Mr Lipietz’s report in tomorrow’s vote."
". – Mr President, whilst I feel that there is relative consensus on this report, this must not stop us from taking a look at some key issues that go beyond the report and beyond the activities of the European Investment Bank (EIB)."
"The high level of cooperation between Parliament and the EIB during the last five years has been mentioned in this debate."
"As we know – and the report mentions this – the EIB has been in existence for a long time, indeed since the Communities were founded."
"Yet it has only been working in collaboration with Parliament for five years and this cooperation, as mentioned by the rapporteur, has been very fruitful and has led to some highly significant developments."
"I would therefore say that this story of relative success is worthy of praise, inasmuch as the EIB is one of Europe’s major financial institutions, created by the Member States with the aim of financing investments and the policies needed to implement the main objectives laid down in the Treaties, either directly or by leveraging private funding."
"The report before us naturally points this out, painting the bank’s activities in a wholly positive light, acknowledging that the more it participates in dialogue with Parliament, the greater the effectiveness and transparency of its activities."
"It must therefore be acknowledged that the Bank’s activities have gradually adapted to the reality of the European economic climate and that the Bank has managed to achieve this adaptation whilst complying in full with its original mandate."
"It is therefore easy to identify a number of principles, rules, or, if you prefer, suggestions, which the Bank should follow in order to enhance its activities and which will aid understanding of its activities, thereby, without any doubt, helping it to improve its work in the future."
"The first of these ideas is that the Bank can and must play an increasingly prominent role in the development of the European economy, particularly during times of recession, focusing its resources and policies on economic growth and cohesion."
"The second principle is that the EIB should play an important role as a multiplier effect in mobilising private or almost-public funding, encouraging the involvement of all economic operators with acceptable risk levels, either by means of risk capital operations or the granting of guarantees."
"The third idea is that the Bank must assess the real contribution of its policy on the Lisbon Strategy, which means that the Bank must quantify the results of its actions and immediately disclose those results to the public."
"The fourth principle is that the Bank’s activities should have a visible and quantifiable effect on job creation and a positive impact on the economic climate, which hinders the full development of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The fifth idea is that, given that the Bank must support the European economy as a whole, special emphasis must be placed on scientific research and on high-technology industries."
"The sixth principle is that all of this is perfectly compatible with the EIB’s firm commitment in its activities to transparency and accountability, which the public demands and which has been consolidated in dialogue with Parliament."
"Mr President, Mr Lipietz has tabled a very sensible initial proposal, which prepares the groundwork for a high quality final report and a broad consensus, and which, to my mind, deserves this House’s support."
"Mr President, it is evident that there is considerable consensus about this subject, and so I would, first of all, like to thank the rapporteur for a sterling report that is supported from all quarters."
"We are right behind the European Investment Bank in the positive course that it has been steering for some years now."
"Various Members have already commented that the EIB is policy-driven and contributes to achieving the EU’s objectives as enshrined in Lisbon and Gothenburg and elsewhere."
"This is something we wholeheartedly endorse."
"I should like to emphasise, though, that the EIB’s independence must be maintained and that the EIB must focus on areas where it has added value."
"It must, above all, help boost developments."
"I should also like to draw your attention to a few minor points."
"Needless to say, the EIB’s activities must be consistent and not undermine each other."
"Accordingly, it is on the one hand to be welcomed that ever more resources are being set aside for environmental projects, for example involving renewable energy sources – that is excellent – but we should make sure that other projects which have a detrimental effect on the environment are not funded at the same time, for one action would cancel out the other."
"Various Members have already underlined the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises as Europe’s job generators."
"I could not agree more, and in that connection, I would like to urge the EIB to concentrate its attention on innovation."
"A minor detail, and one on which I myself am satisfied, is the Year of Microcredit being mentioned, and on World Women’s Day, it may also be worth adding that investments in small enterprises run by women have proven particularly profitable in other parts of the world."
"This is something we should make a point of mentioning."
"Finally, as some Members have already pointed out, good progress has been made in the areas of transparency and governance."
"There are, however, still a few points of criticism, including the criticism levelled by Bank Watch and, in fact, by the rapporteur."
"I can only advise the EIB to take this criticism seriously and continue on this positive course."
"If that is the case, then we will undoubtedly have even more reason to praise the EIB next year."
". Mr President, I am rapporteur for European Investment Bank loans and guarantees on the Committee on Budgets and I would therefore like to present our committee’s point of view with regard to this issue."
"EIB credits are an easy way to aid the financial development of countries outside the European Union."
"With that purpose in mind, every year we effect a transfer of funds from the Union’s budget to a special Guarantee Fund, which serves as a guarantee to the EIB in case of defaults on loans."
"Defaults have been minimal."
"This being the case, there would be grounds for lowering that share of EIB loans that the Union guarantees by means of the Guarantee Fund."
"The European Investment Bank itself does not even ask for a 100% guarantee for all the loans it grants."
"There would be grounds, furthermore, for lowering the percentage figure the transfer of funds from the EU budget to the Guarantee Fund is based on."
"If we imposed these changes, we could increase the share of EIB lending that can be called development aid to countries not in the Union."
"We expect the Commission to propose an amendment to the conditions of use of the Guarantee Fund and I would ask the President of the European Investment Bank, Mr Maystadt, to confirm, on the Bank’s behalf, that these changes could be justified and that the Bank would have nothing against them."
"When global authorisation for granting loans was last changed as a result of EU enlargement, the Union’s neighbouring regions in the north and east did not receive equal treatment."
"Instead, the Bank leant more in the direction of the Mediterranean region, under the influence of some countries in the south."
"This kind of situation should be rectified in the future."
"We cannot accept a situation where Member States do not consider all the Union’s neighbouring regions impartially, but instead, try to favour their own neighbours."
"The European Investment Bank too should make it possible for all the Union’s neighbours to receive credit in this respect."
". Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank Mr Lipietz for his report on the European Investment Bank’s activities."
"We saw last year in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs with Mrs Ridruejo’s draft report that it is not easy to draft a report on the EIB’s activities."
"Thinking about European institutions to such extremes is unproductive and does not do any justice to the situation in which the institution has to work."
"The concise report we are discussing today, however, is balanced, and I have a few remarks to make about it."
"What I find regrettable about Mr Lipietz’ report is the lack of attention given to the impact that the granting of credit has on the environment."
"The EIB’s environmental report is, in my view, too restricted."
"The granting of credits to businesses must also be assessed in terms of its environmental effect, and that is why I would argue in favour of including an environmental impact report in credit assessments."
"The rapporteur is right to conclude, in paragraph 20, that greater attention should be paid to improving the auditing to which the EIB is subject."
"In addition to assessing the credits and the conditions under which they are granted, the EIB’s organisation should also be assessed."
"Questions should be raised about the organisation’s efficacy and the way it accounts for the resources that have been spent."
"The EIB is a financial EU institution that has been set up by treaty, and should therefore also be subject to scrutiny by the European Court of Auditors."
"A good relationship with the Court of Auditors and OLAF can contribute to growing confidence."
"Thirdly, I should like to draw your attention to the ethical aspects of granting credits."
"Are the credits granted by the EIB consistent with the ethical standards that we in this House uphold?"
"Examples that spring to mind are the funding of scientific research and investments in technological development."
"Are credits granted for research and development for which there is no political or moral support in Parliament?"
"I hope to have these questions answered during this debate."
"Finally, we particularly welcome the reference to microcredits in paragraph 6."
"When small-scale initiatives are supported, it is possible to deliver a custom-made service and it is gratifying to see that this instrument receives the recognition that it deserves."
"In this respect, I would call for stress to be laid on the quality of the projects themselves and of the credits granted."
"The sudden increase in this type of credit involves the risk that the quality of the projects and of the credits is insufficiently questioned."
"Since careful thought should be given to the type of projects that are eligible, I would call for a firm approach, involving cooperation with institutions that have experience of microcredits."
"To avoid the instrument becoming a victim of its own success, the EIB must actively commit to a permanently high quality of microcredits."
"Mr President, as the President of this House has now for the third time in succession prevented me from stating my position in a one-minute speech, I would like to give very brief consideration to an issue that I have been wanting to address for a long time."
"At this very moment this House’s bureau is convening, and item 8 on the agenda for its meeting is a highly problematic one."
"They are planning an assault on the freedom of the press."
"In a House that claims to the outside world that it defends transparency, its bureau, without negotiating with the Members and without publicising it in any way, intends to enact rules that are a mockery of press freedom and are intended to permit nothing but obsequious and uncritical reporting."
"I just want to point that out to the public, and I have previously asked the President to prevent this happening."
"The same can be said of item 7 on the meeting’s agenda."
"There is a direct connection between all this and the topic we are discussing now: the annual report of an EU institution, in this instance that of the European Investment Bank."
"We have seen in past years that its lack of transparency made possible the practice of a very large number of things that have to be done away with."
"I very much welcome paragraph 21 of this report, which gives voice to concern about the potential conflicts of interest among the EIB’s management, to which there have been repeated references in the press."
"I note with interest that an amendment has already been tabled to remove this."
"I still have a very clear recollection of the reports on this subject last summer, for example in the 19 August issue of the ."
"I can see no evidence of these conflicts of interest having been done away with, nor of there being any transparency about them, and I do not think that we can, at this early stage, be so generous with our praise of the Investment Bank."
"Generally important though I regard the Bank as being, we can see that the absence of transparency excludes the possibility of trust and democracy, in this House as much as in the EIB."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it comes as a surprise to hear Members speak in this debate – the previous speaker, who has missed the point, being one of them – while not having been present for the vote on the report in the committee of which they are members."
"Let me make it quite plain that the reason why this House is debating the report on the EIB today is that it lives out democracy, transparency and parliamentary oversight, and our cooperation with the EIB shows how dialogue with us has led not only to improvements and changes in the dialogue itself, but also in the work that is done."
"You are doing a good job, and I would like to thank not only you for that, but also departing Vice-Chairman of the EIB’s Management Committee, Professor Ewald Nowotny, who is also Vice-Rector of Vienna’s University of Economics and Business Administration, for the outstanding work he has done."
"What is the EIB?"
"It is a public bank, created by the Treaty on the European Communities to be the most important financial institution for the purpose of realising the European Union’s objectives through its own investments and those promoted by it."
"It is to be hoped, then, that it is no accident of fate that this week finds us debating, along with the EIB, the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy and the preparations for the Spring Summit."
"I regard you as a channel of communication for the Lisbon Strategy, with the task of supporting these very objectives of growth, employment, competitiveness, social cohesion and sustainability, and so I ask you also, in future, to present your reports in line with the Commission’s new Lisbon Strategy and the Member States’ plans of action, taking, in particular, even greater account of our paragraphs 5, 8 and 10, relating to small and medium-sized enterprises, which are at the heart of the European economy and play a central role in job creation."
"Mr President, I too wish to dissociate myself from the remarks made by Mr Martin."
"Point 21 of this resolution does not in any way indicate dissatisfaction on our part with the EIB’s transparency."
"Moreover, the facts to which Mr Martin refers – the riots and the uproar that people tried to create last year in response to a report about the Investment Bank – appeared to be fabricated."
"In this speech, my primary aim is to emphasise the relationship between the EIB’s activities and the Lisbon strategy."
"I think that as a variant to the title of the Kok II report ‘Jobs, jobs, jobs,’ the slogan ‘Investments, investments, investments’ should be one of the key phrases for the Lisbon strategy."
"The EIB plays a crucial role in this."
"I would, for example, mention the EUR 7.1 billion that was invested in 2004 within the context of the Innovation initiative."
"These investments are exactly what we need, namely investments in research and development, in education and training, and in ICT developments."
"In the memo that was presented to the ECOFIN Council on 2 February, I noticed that an innovative approach had been adopted with regard to the financial instruments as well."
"This memo contains a list of ideas which have partly been implemented but are partly still in development."
"Those ideas intend to guarantee that a number of options at the EIB’s disposal can be deployed and can be used as effectively as possible for microcredits, for small and medium-sized enterprises, for precisely those innovative investments that are needed."
"I would particularly like to make a point of mentioning -technology, assessment centres, and cooperation between different activities under the research framework programme."
"I also hope that the ECOFIN ministers will establish a connection between investing and the way in which they deal with spending and investments in the Stability and Growth Pact."
"I also hope that this discussion will be continued."
"Mr President, this report spells out the important role that the European Investment Bank plays in the EU’s development policies."
"I think it needs to play an even more active part in realising the Millennium Development Goals in particular, and to show evidence of greater commitment to them."
"While I am thinking here of the war on poverty in particular, I might add that too little has been said, among the topics addressed by the report, about investments within the EU."
"Something also has to be said about current capacity for giving aid in rebuilding the regions devastated by the tsunami and the disastrous floods."
"Effective though it was in media terms for Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission, to announce up to EUR 1 billion’s worth of aid, to be arranged through the EIB, I would like to take this opportunity to ram the point home that the money will not flow if conditions remain as they are."
"The EIB itself has pointed out on several occasions that it does not possess the mandate it needs to apply these funds in the region in question, and the cost of borrowing would be too high in the absence of co-funding from the Commission."
"To requests for such co-funding, then, I ask the House not to turn a deaf ear."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Investment Bank must and should cooperate closely with the European Central Bank and the European Commission, but at the same time its priorities need to be clear."
"If genuine integration is to take place in the EU, and not only political integration, but also practical and logistical integration, then funding must be provided for the Trans-European Networks."
"If the European economy is to develop, then the European Investment Bank must step up its support for the SME sector, for the social economy sector and for what are known as local services, as this is particularly important from a demographic point of view."
"It is absolutely crucial for there to be a level playing field when it comes to granting loans."
"Certain Member States receive a relatively small volume of loans and their SME sector should receive more."
"To this end, the European Investment Bank must improve its administrative procedures and increase access for local funding partners and SMEs."
"It is essential that all EU-related institutions, in particular financial institutions, be transparent."
"Unfortunately, however, it has come to our notice that there are conflicts of interest between those at the helm of the EIB."
"I refer you to paragraph 21 of the motion for a resolution, for example."
"This is extremely bad news."
"Conflicts of this kind must not be allowed to continue, as they convey a negative image of the EIB."
"I thank you."
"– Mr President, as one of the basic financing institutions of the European Union, I consider the importance of the role of the European Investment Bank in achieving the objectives of the Lisbon strategy to be self-evident."
"Within these frameworks, I commend the effort of the European Investment Bank to guide the investments of the European Union on the basis of the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy."
"Secondly, I should like to emphasise the need to maintain a balance as regards the financing of the various sectors of the European economy, a balance which also reflects Lisbon: development, employment, cohesion and environment."
"That is why I welcome the increase in loans for small businesses."
"I think it is important to extend loans to the social economy and local service sector as well as reducing high administrative costs."
"I support the bank's efforts to date to help finance tangible and intangible investments in new technologies."
"I think that financing of investments in infrastructures, especially the financing of the trans-European networks, should be stepped up."
"I should like to close by emphasising the need to coordinate the activities of the European Investment Bank with all the policies of the European Union at national and European level."
"To close, I should also like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Lipietz, for his excellent report."
"Mr President, may I first of all thank you for continuing the tradition that began in the previous legislative period."
"As Mr Lipietz mentioned just now, it is only five years since the European Investment Bank was invited to engage in dialogue with the European Parliament."
"For my part, I am delighted about it."
"It is true that the European Investment Bank is not formally an institution of the European Union."
"Its shareholders are the Member States and we are answerable to our shareholders, that is to say the national governments and parliaments; on the other hand, however, the European Investment Bank was created by the Treaty and, as we have mentioned, its task is to support the European Union’s political objectives financially."
"I think it is therefore only right that the bank should be asked to give account of itself before the elected representatives of Europe’s citizens and I can confirm, as Mr Lipietz said at the beginning, that this is a productive dialogue."
"Indisputably, Parliament is now able to take a more positive view of the EIB in a number of areas, because several recommendations made by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and adopted by this House have been implemented and progress has been made as a result, especially in the matters of governance, transparency and the quality of supervision."
"Last week I took part in the annual meeting of presidents of multilateral development banks and I was pleased to find that in several respects the EIB now serves as a model for other international financial institutions."
"This is a productive dialogue."
"I think it should be continued with different committees."
"I will not enlarge any further on the questions of governance and transparency that I have just mentioned."
"I will simply say to Mrs Wortmann-Kool that we remain open on the question of prudential supervision."
"There is a very simple reason why no other international financial body is subject to this kind of supervision: the main purpose of prudential supervision is to protect depositors."
"International financial institutions have no depositors, however."
"Nevertheless, we remain open."
"Parliament suggested that the European Central Bank might supervise the EIB."
"The Member States did not want to give the ECB such powers."
"In any case, I can tell you that we have decided to apply the new Basel II rules on a voluntary basis."
"If one day we do come under supervision, we will therefore be in a position to show the competent authority that we have applied the relevant rules."
"A word about our activities in the European Union."
"I have noted the particular stress several Members of this House placed on our contribution to the Lisbon strategy."
"In Lisbon, the European Council in fact asked the EIB to make a contribution to funding in a number of areas that were considered absolute priorities for that strategy."
"You know how essential a part increasing investment in research and education clearly plays in the Lisbon strategy."
"After Lisbon, we therefore launched a programme that we call ‘i2i’: the Innovation 2010 Initiative."
"We have already agreed loans amounting to 24 billion euros for this programme."
"To be more precise: 7 billion for training, 10 billion for research and development and 7 billion for the diffusion of new technologies."
"We fully intend to continue along that road and, as Mr Lipietz said, make a contribution that goes beyond words and declarations of principle, one that extends to funding some very specific projects, while at the same time trying, as Mrs van den Burg stressed, to deploy new financial instruments."
"As part of this i2i programme, we have already adopted new types of loan, with risk sharing."
"In cooperation with the Commission, we are now working on formulae that would allow us to go even further down that route, to take more risks, since these are areas which, by their very nature, require the funding provider to agree to assume part of the risk."
"I have also noted the stress some of you place on small and medium-sized businesses."
"I can see that my time is running out, so I will respond very briefly."
"I can confirm that, so far as global loans are concerned – a subject which has already been discussed in committee – we are renegotiating the contracts with the intermediary banks to ensure that they really do pass on to the final beneficiary the financial advantage we are giving them."
"I also note the emphasis on microcredit."
"I note the concerns about the environment and I can assure you that the report we present to the Board of Directors on all the projects we are asked to finance includes a section – sometimes a very detailed section if the project requires this – on the environmental impact of the project we are being asked to finance."
"Finally, a word about our activities outside the European Union."
"These must in fact be placed in the context of the European Union’s new approach to external policy."
"As Mrs Zimmer briefly mentioned, the aim is to combine the resources of the Commission, the Member States and the European Investment Bank better in order to make our development assistance more effective and involve us more directly in the pursuit of the Millennium Goals."
"To Mr Seppänen I will simply say that we agree entirely with his suggestion concerning the guarantee fund."
"As to the rebalancing and the chart, that is not for us to decide, but the Council, which gives us mandates concerning different regions."
"Mr President, please forgive me for having gone over my allotted time;"
"I would simply like to conclude by restating our desire to continue this dialogue with Parliament."
"We are in dialogue with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and we have just begun to engage in dialogue with the Committee on Development."
"We are at the disposal of Parliament’s different committees to examine these issues in greater depth."
"I thank you, Mr Maystadt, and your institution for the work that it does."
"Mr President, I refer to Rule 145 of the Rules of Procedure as they stand."
"A lady Member has addressed me directly, and I do not know whether she or I have been misinterpreted."
"I wanted, in any case, to reiterate, for the sake of clarity, that what I said related specifically to Article 21 of this report, which expresses precisely these concerns."
"If, then, representatives of the two main parties in this House – forming a sort of Great Coalition – tell us that everything is all right, it must consequently be all right for someone who does not belong to that Great Coalition to say that things are not all right, and that brings me to my second point."
"An honourable Member made reference to my absence from the vote on this report."
"This has to do with the fact that I sit on three committees, the meetings of which clash with regrettable frequency, and I can hardly be in three places at one and the same time."
"On a point of information, and for the sake of what is termed objectivity, let me point out that Ewald Nowotny – to whom the honourable gentleman referred – was one of the main sources of information for this critical report, so it is an unfortunate fact that we will have to carry on grappling with all these problems if we are to achieve the clarity and transparency that we do not as yet have."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at noon."
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A6-0012/2005) from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the Council common position for adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on conditions for access to the natural gas transmission networks (Rapporteur: Esko Seppänen)."
". Mr President, Commissioner, we have submitted this proposal for a regulation concerning access to the natural gas transmission networks for second reading by Parliament."
"Our two readings have spanned approximately a year, and in that respect we might say that Parliament has worked as fast as it has been able to, given the current arrangement."
"We have achieved a satisfactory end result, and that is due to the excellent levels of cooperation shown by the various political groups."
"As rapporteur, I would have liked the regulation to include two important issues, which are now absent from it."
"When access to the natural gas networks is discussed at the Madrid Forum among all the stakeholders, I would have liked the Commission to continue to listen to all parties involved in the future when a proposal for a regulation is being amended or added to."
"The inclusion of such an article in the text did not succeed for legal reasons."
"The judicial services of all three Institutions, the Council, the Commission and Parliament, were of the opinion that the drafting of legislation should take place by means of the comitology procedure, and no hearing of any external agency can be written into the legal text itself."
"A wise Commission, having a monopoly in the presentation of laws compared to the Council and Parliament, will surely allow the Madrid Forum to remain a cohesive entity and will listen intently to all its interested parties."
"I therefore expect the Commission representative to assure us of this in this debate."
"The other matter regarding which I would have liked to add my own article to the regulation concerns the storage of gas."
"Preserving the storage monopolies will prevent the full-scale use of the networks for the benefit of all stakeholders and weaken competition in the market."
"As transmission networks are needed to carry gas from one country to another, the gas market can only operate effectively if the same pipelines can carry gas sold by a large number of producers and purchased by a large number of consumers."
"The shared use of the networks, which is to say access to the networks, is therefore important."
"As the price of gas has risen in some Member States this winter in a way that is out of proportion with trends in other countries, the Commission should explain what is at issue here."
"In Parliament we are pleased that in the final stage of the second reading we have been able to present some proposals for the improvement of the Council’s common position, which we expect the Council to adopt."
"Our objective in Parliament has been that this regulation should enter into force as quickly as possible."
"Hopefully, it will help to persuade certain Member States to honour the commitments that, on the one hand, they have made to safeguard access to gas networks, but which, on the other, they have not put into effect."
"We think it is important that this regulation should enter into force as speedily as possible."
". Mr President, the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on conditions for access to the gas transmission networks is a good example of fruitful cooperation between the institutions and therefore a success story."
"Thanks to the constructive approach of the rapporteur, Mr Seppänen, and his colleagues in all the political groups in Parliament, we arrived at a text that will bring about the desired results."
"For this, I would like to thank you all."
"Your commitment to this legislative proposal has ensured not only the quality of the text but also rapid and efficient treatment."
"The regulation, once effective, will provide a level playing field for conditions for access to the gas transmission networks across the whole European market, hence completing a crucial element of the Internal Gas Market Directive."
"Non-discriminatory and transparent conditions for access to the grid are essential if competition is to develop."
"The European Parliament has played a crucial role in the whole process."
"Most of the amendments adopted at first reading have been accepted by both the Council and the Commission."
"It is, therefore, safe to say that the European Parliament has already made its mark on the text."
"Now we are close to finalising the legislative process, again with a recommendation amending the text of the common position."
"The Commission can fully accept the outcome of the compromise between the European Parliament and the Council."
"Its results finally pave the way for adoption of the regulation by the Council and thus add an important piece of legislation to the legal framework establishing the internal market for gas."
"I am aware that some of you would have liked to go further by including access to storage in the scope of the regulation."
"Like Parliament, the Commission attaches great importance to this issue."
"However, I am absolutely sure that this regulation would not be the right place to address such an important topic."
"Discussions on a voluntary agreement on guidelines for non-discriminatory conditions for access to storage facilities are nearing a successful conclusion."
"Such an agreement would be the most efficient way to bring about rapid improvements to the market from 1 April 2005, on condition that the industry sticks to the provisions of the agreement."
"It goes without saying that both the regulators and the Commission will closely monitor the implementation of these guidelines."
"Further action will be taken in due course if appropriate."
"I would encourage you to adopt the recommendation submitted by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, as this represents the best way to promote our common objectives: a well-functioning internal market for gas, to the benefit of the consumers and the competitiveness of Europe."
"I should add that the Commission will continue to consult all the stakeholders and the experience we have had with the Madrid Forum has been extremely successful."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start with warm thanks to the rapporteur, who has worked outstandingly well with us, so that we have managed, in a short time, to bring a long-standing project to a successful conclusion."
"The object has been to give people in Europe the opportunity to exercise free choice as regards access to gas suppliers, with a wide range of services on offer, and to open up the market."
"We have attempted to define the framework conditions that will be required if this is to be achieved: the calculations of rates to be made public, the calculation of costs to be transparent, and wide-ranging requirements for information on the part of the network operators."
"All these things will play a quite central role."
"On the other hand, there must of course be balance, and that is what we have endeavoured to bring about."
"Those who run the networks must be able to see that their interests are being safeguarded."
"There is no point in imposing conditions so stringent that all the network operators lose interest."
"Here, I think we have been smart in striking a balance by opening up the market and offering consumers new opportunities, while also, at the same time, keeping the operation of gas networks economically interesting."
"Who else is meant to do it?"
"We took as the basis for our deliberations the voluntary agreements and guidelines for best practice agreed on in Madrid in 2003."
"I think it was astute of us to build on a consensus of this kind, and so I agree with Mr Seppänen that it will be helpful to bear that in mind when voting on subsequent developments."
"Like the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats as a whole, I take the view that this means it was a good thing that we did not have this Regulation make reference to the storage of gas, on which there was as yet no consensus, and I am not persuaded either that there are any compelling reasons for there to be a legal regime on this."
"Voluntary agreements are preferable where they are in place."
"Not everything has to be adopted and made binding in law, and we should wait and see how this process progresses from now on in."
"I would add that the gas market should be allowed a certain amount of time in which to develop."
"This presupposes that the national governments transpose what we specify into law."
"Only after a period of time has elapsed will it be possible to assess the regulation’s effectiveness, and so I ask that we, once we have adopted it today, allow that to happen and then review the way the situation develops."
"Mr President, Commissioner, let me start by expressing my heartfelt thanks to the rapporteur, something that I do not normally do, believing as I do that the function of a rapporteur is to deliver a proper job of work and that thanks are not called for when things are done as a matter of course."
"This has, though, indeed been a really complex business, and one that Mr Seppänen has handled outstandingly well."
"The debate has not, of course, only just started; we and a number of other Members already know each other from the previous Parliament and were there for the first reading, which was already complicated enough."
"The Council has now joined Parliament in adopting many of the things that we debated at first reading stage – initially with some acrimony – and then accepted, and we can actually be content with that."
"It just so happens, though, that new parliaments bring with them new people, with new ideas and new proposals."
"Our new Members did, of course, have new ideas, and the fact that a compromise had very largely already been reached with the Council meant that it was very difficult to take these on board."
"I know that Mr Seppänen was already in favour of our adopting the Commission proposal and the Council position without significant amendment, and so he has done a good job of getting Parliament’s interests across and successfully negotiating their acceptance by the Council."
"I will come to the point, though: neither on the energy market nor any other do we want competition for the sake of it, but we are well aware that competition is in fact a suitable means whereby a common market’s efficiency gains really can be maximised."
"This common market and the exploitation of these efficiency gains demand that we open up the national market segments and turn them into a single internal market in energy, and hence require transparent and discrimination-free access to the networks."
"We see this Regulation as making provision for the enactment of more specific, detailed and binding guidelines, thereby complementing the 2003 internal market directive on the complete opening-up of the gas markets."
"Among other things, this Regulation is meant to bring in more explicit requirements with regard to transparency, also requiring network operators to offer third parties services providing access to the network and, in particular, less ambiguous structures for tariffs."
"It is this tariff structure that is essential if competitors are to enjoy transparent and discrimination-free access when using the networks, for such networks are monopolistic by nature, and it is only by regulating access to them that we will be able to get them under control and make them transparent and non-discriminatory."
"That is why it was important, in one instance that I want to draw to your particular attention, for us to again tighten up the common position on the tariff structure, having already got many other points accepted."
"The fact is that it is not sufficient to ensure that the tariffs laid down include relatively abstract efficiency incentives."
"Tariffs must be measured against the benchmark of the costs of an efficient network operator with a comparable structure; this is what this House devised and got accepted for cross-border trade in electricity, and it is also suited to the gas networks."
"That being so, it should be generally supported in the House."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too am grateful to Mr Seppänen for the detailed work that he has enabled us to carry out."
"I also thank Mr Piebalgs for being here."
"I wish to underline the importance of the directive concerning the completion of the internal market for gas."
"The directive, which was adopted last year, lays down fair and detailed rules for access to Member States’ gas transmission networks by third parties, taking account of the individual nature of national and regional markets."
"As has already been mentioned, the directive is analogous to the one on grid access for cross-border trade in electricity."
"It is important to bear in mind that the proposal has been drawn up on the basis of voluntary agreements made within the European Gas Regulatory Forum, which will become binding through this regulation."
"The main changes introduced by the Council concern the guidelines referred to in Article 9, which have been reduced in scope, and the removal of the Commission’s power to adopt new guidelines through the committee procedure and its power to amend the guidelines laid down in the annexes."
"The guidelines concern third party access services, principles of capacity allocation mechanisms, congestion management procedures and transparency requirements."
"The Council has also inserted a new paragraph in Article 9 clarifying the differences between national gas networks, which must be reflected in the guidelines, in their implementation and in future amendments."
"I should also like to point out that the Council has put back the date for the regulation to enter into force from 1 July 2005 to 1 July 2006, except for Article 9(2), which will enter into force six months later."
"On behalf of my group, I should like to express our satisfaction at the agreement reached with the Council, even though at a personal level I should have preferred it if the Council and Commission regulation had also covered the need to regulate access to storage facilities."
"Ten per cent of our reserves have been used up in Italy during this very cold spell, and I therefore think it appropriate to mention this aspect as well, and also the cushioning effect that storage has on prices."
"In any case, I trust the Commission will also be willing to regulate this area soon."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, liberalisation is, in principle, a good thing."
"Where gas is concerned, though, it will have scarcely any effect."
"Why is this so?"
"There are two main reasons."
"For a start, let us consider the producers, who, as far as we are concerned, at present comprise only Russia, Norway and Algeria, an oligopoly which determines what goes on in the gas market, and a market force which, for example, allows 90% of the price of gas in Europe to be tied to oil."
"Economically speaking, there is no reason why this should be so; it is about pure market clout, or, to put it with brutal frankness, it is nothing more than a rip-off."
"There is no sign of the producers competing among themselves; what is the use of regulating what happens down-stream, if, upstream, there is nothing more than an oligopoly made up of the Big Three."
"The situation is similar to that at a weekly market, where, if there are more strawberries, the price drops, and so, taking that as an example, the Russians ought to bring more gas onto the world market and start to compete with the Norwegians, thereby bringing the price down, but they will not do that of their own free will and accord."
"This is where the Council and the Commission must act!"
"It is the major national and international distributors who constitute the second obstacle, while our present measures affect mainly the small ones."
"Who, for example, supplies gas to a medium-sized town’s power network in Germany?"
"The Russians would laugh themselves to death if a German town wanted to buy power directly from Gazprom and have the stuff delivered straight to it."
"This is where it is cause for concern that Europe’s major electricity providers are now also the main suppliers of gas."
"If we want competition and liberalisation, then the industry must not be structured vertically, with everything, from extraction to the last distributor, being in the same pair of hands."
"We have to be active in preventing, for example, the Big Four in Germany forming themselves into a vertical and even broader structure and buying out all the smaller and medium-sized distributors."
"Both in Italy, with its ENEL and ENI, and in France with GDF and EDF, exactly the same thing happens."
"In a business defined by network pipelines, there must be distributors who are independent of the major producers."
"Nothing else makes any sense in a field like this, in which capital links are detrimental to competition."
"As good as they may be, our efforts today will, unfortunately, be largely without effect if we do not face up to these challenges."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the guidelines agreed previously for the gas markets are being followed unsatisfactorily, and that is creating uncertainty."
"There are also big differences in the conditions for access among the transmission system operators."
"Unfair conditions of access to the gas network are a hindrance to the market’s function in this sector."
"The internal market will not function without minimum standards regarding third party access to the network."
"We have to create non-discriminatory conditions for competition and make sure that everyone complies with the new guidelines."
"I would like to congratulate my colleague, Mr Seppänen, who has done much hard work to get this regulation through as quickly as possible, which was our objective."
"This regulation will test how willing the Member States really are to give priority to the Lisbon objectives."
"It is no wonder that the rapporteur had to engage in long and arduous debate with the Council."
"Now one aspect of opening up the energy markets to competition that would benefit consumers in many Member States hangs in the balance, at least for the time being."
"Moreover, for too long certain big Member States have been ignoring internal market rules."
"As a result, their energy giants, protected from competition as they are, have been able to charge consumers higher prices and use the extra profits, for example, to buy out smaller competitors that are in a more difficult situation owing to the competition than those which evade it."
"The Union needs to show determination and open up all areas of the energy sector to fair competition, and that includes the natural gas transmission networks."
". Mr President, I see from the discussion in Parliament that there is broad consensus on the scope and spirit of this regulation."
"It is a very important piece of legislation which I hope will be adopted. This crucial piece of legislation on conditions for access to natural gas transmission networks is needed for the internal market to function."
"As regards access to storage facilities, I would again like to draw to your attention that we will soon have a voluntary agreement on guidelines for non-discriminatory access conditions to storage facilities, and if necessary further action will be taken."
"Mr Caspary touched on some important issues."
"This regulation represents one of the steps needed to create the right conditions for the internal market in energy."
"The Commission is doing a lot in this respect."
"We are trying to diversify sources and this will definitely make for changes as regards price policies."
"By the end of this year the Commission will produce a report analysing the situation in the energy market, which will be prepared in conjunction with the competition authorities."
"This will enable us to address the questions you have raised."
"I would again like to stress that the major progress made on this regulation can be attributed to the way in which it was prepared."
"The Madrid Forum has proved to be extremely successful, which is why access to storage should be handled in the same way."
"I wish to thank Parliament and the rapporteur for the good work done in preparing this piece of legislation on the energy market."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the oral question to the Commission (B6-0018/2005) by Mechtild Rothe, Reino Paasilinna and Hannes Swoboda, on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, and by Dimitrios Papadimoulis, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on alternative forms of energy, the oral question to the Commission (B6-0157/2005) by Rebecca Harms and Claude Turmes, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on alternative forms of energy and the oral question to the Commission (B6-0158/2005) by Lena Ek, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, on alternative forms of energy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if one is to believe the media – and, in this instance, one might well – 2004 saw the five largest oil groups achieve net profits of EUR 65 billion, EUR 37 billion of which were attributable to the three ‘European’ groups, that is, Shell, BP and Total."
"If you consider the current situation and track the developments in demand, it can be assumed that this result is certain to be surpassed in 2005."
"Far from this being merely a short-term fluctuation in growth, the need for energy in many major countries, such as China and India, means that these profits will increase still further."
"Some of these increases in profit amount, in 2004 alone, to 20, 30, 40, or 50% over against 2003."
"What are the companies doing with these great profits?"
"It is interesting to have a look at their balance sheets on the Internet; most of these profits go to the shareholders, and a substantial chunk of them is used to buy back shares;"
"Shell, for example, in the fourth quarter of 2004 alone, spent EUR 1.6 billion on doing that and is planning to spend between EUR 2.3 billion and EUR 3.9 billion in 2005."
"BP did likewise, and is indeed setting aside even more for next year – EUR 6 billion for share withdrawal, for stabilisation, for the avoidance of excessive influence on the part of its shareholders, and so on."
"On the other hand, though, we have a situation – one about which you, Commissioner, have had a lot of positive things to say – in which the European Union is endeavouring to develop sustainable energy systems and to spend money on research."
"Unless I am wrong, EUR 900 million have been set aside for Community research in these various areas between 2003 and 2006."
"The fact is that that is a fraction of what the big oil companies – I am not talking about the medium-sized or small ones – operating in Europe and elsewhere, have earned."
"It is a fraction of what the big oil companies use to buy up their own shares and make themselves rather less liable to the influence of their own shareholders."
"There is a great discrepancy here."
"I do not begrudge anyone their profits, but we know perfectly well that what the oil firms are receiving are mainly windfall profits, resulting not from their own investments or efforts, but from the state of the market, that is to say, from increases in supply and demand."
"I therefore think it really is time that these profits also yielded up something for the development and application of alternative, renewable energies, in other words for sustainable energy systems in general."
"In the ordinary way of things, we would do that with taxes, but that is not possible."
"The industry itself has always expressed great interest in voluntary agreements, and would like to make a public show of its sense of responsibility."
"What, for the international oil companies, could be better than to show their responsibility by being willing to do as the Commission wishes – which I hope it does – and discuss this with it, in order that we may together come to a voluntary agreement to use at least some of these windfall profits for research into, and development of, sustainable energy systems."
"With this in mind, I would ask the Commission – and you too, Commissioner – to give this proposal some serious thought and to talk to the big groups in the hope of getting something for this purpose."
"This would enable us to apply funds to other important research tasks."
"The oil companies would be well advised to show themselves to be socially responsible and to develop alternative energy systems."
"– Mr President, given the important advantages of alternative forms of energy to the environment, public health and citizens’ quality of life, the question to which neither the Commission nor the European Parliament has given an effective answer is: how can we promote the further development of alternative forms of energy, so that the citizens can enjoy their advantages?"
"We have before us the recent Commission report, which notes a serious delay in relation to the objectives set in Directive 2001/77."
"Consequently, we need to do more."
"I personally believe that this endeavour needs to be supported along three lines of approach."
"The first line of approach is to create a more beneficial political environment in which to promote alternative forms of energy."
"Here, the role of governments is decisive, given that the large multinational companies in the energy sector are still investing primarily in oil and it will not be easy for them to abandon this unilateral approach."
"What is needed, therefore, is a package of government incentives to encourage investments in alternative forms of energy and create profitable markets for alternative forms of energy."
"The second line of approach is to create a suitable legal framework which supports alternative forms of energy."
"In other words, we need to protect these markets from the shackles of an energy system built – together with its legal bases – at a time when alternative forms of energy were almost unheard of."
"The third and most important line of approach, and it is on this that the question focuses which I and my honourable friends have submitted to the European Commission, is to rapidly develop public and private investment in research, in order to develop better and cheaper technologies in connection with alternative forms of energy."
"Developing alternative forms of energy depends first and foremost on research into the development of new technologies and now is our opportunity, now that the large companies which trade in oil are amassing a fortune in excessive profits made by taking advantage of rises in stock exchange prices, now that, as we have all realised, the framework programme for research and development is inadequate with the resources at its disposal; this is our opportunity to promote the idea of imposing a clean energy tax on the oil industry, which can be used to finance the development of alternative forms of energy."
"It might, for example, be no more than 1% of companies’ net profits, in order to safeguard their competitiveness."
"I await the Commission’s response and – more importantly – the next steps with interest."
"Mr President, people in Iraq are dying in the war for oil."
"The European economy is slowing down as a result of high and volatile oil prices."
"Third World countries are crumbling under debts created by oil imports."
"Is everyone a loser?"
"No, there are some winners: six of the ‘Seven Sisters’ – including Exxon, Total, Shell, BP, – have earned scandalous amounts of money over the past two to three years."
"Today, in the EU, they have no obligation whatsoever as regards either research or even mixing in some renewables with what they sell to motorists."
"When will this change, Commissioner?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to begin by carrying out a quick analysis of the surrounding world to show how matters stand in the Europe for which we are together responsible."
"We have the very large oil-producing countries in the Middle East, where there is unrest and where oil resources are limited."
"On the other side of us, we have a very large country, Russia, where Putin has seen that energy is power and where he is accumulating more and more of this power, in the form of the various energy companies in Russia, in his own hands, that is to say literally in the Kremlin."
"We have ten new Member States that are very dependent indeed upon energy imports from Russia."
"In addition, we have old Member States, for example Germany, where half of gas imports come from Russia."
"Seen from the point of view of security policy, all this means, then, a very unbalanced and unsettled situation."
"What is more, we have huge environmental problems, which we are all agreed must be solved, together with very ambitious environmental objectives."
"At the same time, energy prices are rising."
"Consumption is rising."
"European industry constantly needs more energy, as do households and transport."
"As I have already mentioned, certain countries are hugely dependent upon imports."
"We have enormous problems with energy networks."
"In Sweden, we had a storm which meant that getting on for 50 000 households, together of course with industry and small enterprises in the areas affected, were without electricity for more than two months after this storm, something that is completely unacceptable."
"We also remember when the whole of Italy was plunged into darkness for many hours."
"We thus have an instability in the energy networks that is not acceptable."
"The European Union has described what are known as the TEN projects as being incredibly important, but we see how, in area after area, they come to a standstill and do not develop at the rate anticipated in the original decisions."
"All in all, we are thus in an extremely worrying situation."
"When it comes to energy policy in Europe, we must stabilise access to energy."
"We must ensure that the transmission networks operate and are stable and that the companies invest in new technology so that simple storms or similar events do not entail protracted power failures."
"We must ensure that the TEN projects work."
"My first question is therefore as follows: how will the Commission ensure that the energy supply is stabilised?"
"In addition, we must transform the energy supply in Europe, that is to say we must obtain the environmentally friendly energy that we are agreed is needed."
"This means that the Commission has a very great responsibility."
"It is not usual for there to be cooperation between policy areas, but we have an agricultural reform whereby biomass could be produced on portions of agricultural land in Europe that are at present unused."
"We have industry that requires energy."
"We also have both environmental and employment objectives that must be complied with."
"I therefore want, secondly, to know how different parts of the Commission cooperate in order to achieve solutions to these problems."
"Thirdly, we need to give new impetus to the energy supply, that is to say produce more energy."
"My question concerns what is being done to ensure that, through district heating, co-generation etc., Europe’s basic industry also produces more energy."
"Mr President, energy is power."
"The thing is, to ensure that this power is used in the right way."
". Mr President, I agree with the sentiment underlying these questions: how to find solutions to the challenges as a response to our Kyoto obligations, to high oil and gas prices, and how to deal with Europe’s increasing reliance on imported hydrocarbon."
"These are key issues for the new Commission, as I have already indicated to Parliament."
"The whole point of a coherent energy policy is to develop a package of mutually reinforcing policies that together achieve the three core objectives: competitiveness, sustainable development and security of supply."
"Let me first of all address the issue of our external dependency on oil."
"The latest oil price increases are a strong reminder that the oil market remains volatile."
"It is clear that the current and future competition for hydrocarbons resources does and will continue to affect the global security of supply and economic growth."
"My concern is even higher when we look at energy forecasts."
"If nothing is done, energy imports by 2030 could amount to 70% of total needs."
"We should of course continue our policy of diversification and our dialogue with the producer countries."
"However, because of the degree of dependency, the European Union has little room for manoeuvre to influence energy supply."
"In addition, our own energy sources are either low or, in certain cases, less competitive."
"It is therefore essentially on the demand side that the EU can and should intervene."
"That is why I believe that the Union should concentrate on guiding and steering demand."
"Against this backdrop, the European Commission has already committed itself to actions designed to diversify the different energy sources, to promote energy efficiency and support renewables."
"All those actions point to a reduction in the use of hydrocarbons in our society and a decrease in their share of the energy mix."
"As I have already announced, I will continue and strengthen the EU’s actions in these fields."
"I will make a special effort on energy efficiency."
"Stronger action on energy efficiency will not only benefit our security of supply, but also other key objectives including those linked to the Lisbon Agenda."
"This spring I will present a green paper on energy efficiency to outline my ideas."
"Although I understand the intention of honourable Members to cross-subsidise renewable energy, I am afraid that it will be difficult to judge what ‘windfall’ profits are, or what ‘too much involvement in enterprise policy’ is."
"It will also be difficult to tell companies how to spend their profits."
"At the same time I am following the advice of honourable Members."
"I have also to point out that major oil companies, such as BP, Shell, Repsol and Total, have already started substantial research, development and deployment activities in renewable energies and CO2 capture and storage."
"In my discussions with them I always stress the importance of their playing an increasingly active role in this area."
"In my further contacts with the oil companies active in the European Union area I will, therefore, strongly encourage their commitment to research into and development of renewable energies and CO2 capture and storage."
"Having said that, I have to stress that the European Union has in recent years established a framework for the promotion of renewables that is unique in the world, with directives on the promotion of green electricity and biofuels."
"A spin-off from these directives has been the development of support systems in most Member States and a continuation of the leading role of the EU in eco-technology."
"Moreover, the Commission has been actively supporting research into and the demonstration and use of alternative forms of energy."
"This is expected to continue in the coming years."
"In this respect, I have to mention in particular the co-financing of the research and development activities, in particular the financial support for the research and technological development phases, and for the demonstration of large-scale installations and the penetration of these new technologies into the market."
"Such financial support is currently made available under the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development."
"In this context, the proposal of the Commission regarding the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, which is planned to be adopted in April 2005, will open the interinstitutional debate on the key European Union priorities for research and technological development for the coming years."
"Now I would like to come to the issue of environmental goals and competitiveness."
"The European commitments, not least those related to climate change, have been translated into a number of operational targets in energy policy that at the same time promote the competitiveness of our industry."
"Therefore, the environmental goals are fully integrated into the energy policy objectives and instruments."
"One good example is Directive 2001/77/EC on green electricity, which has generated an extra effort with regard to the production and installation of windmills."
"A significant number of jobs has been created in this new and rapidly growing industry, where some European countries are now world market leaders."
"Another example is the directive on biofuels."
"The production of these fuels not only contributes to meeting our Kyoto targets, but also has a positive effect on rural development and therefore on our global economy."
"I think that the most important direct effect on our economy will, however, come from strong policy action to increase energy efficiency throughout our society."
"It is estimated that 20% of our total energy use could be saved in a cost-efficient way."
"Not only would energy efficiency save money, it will also create jobs in Europe and be of benefit to the environment."
"That is why the Commission has made eco-technologies one of the political priorities in the Lisbon Agenda."
"It is my conviction that environmental goals, security of supply and competitiveness go very well together."
"The Commission has proved in the past that it is ready to take action in this field."
"I certainly intend to make a real effort to reinforce these policies."
". Mr President, in this debate I am only too happy to declare an interest in shareholdings in several oil and gas companies."
"Profits are good, as a measure of the success of enterprises and as a means of investment in the future in research and development and replacement capacity."
"Higher oil prices make more money for governments, not oil companies, as tax is the biggest component in road fuel costs to the consumer."
"So perhaps this question should be addressed to the Member States instead."
"We should beware of directing investment and interfering in companies’ decisions on investment."
"Governments and public bodies are not very successful at picking winners."
"I wonder whether those who seek to tell companies what to do with their profits would be as quick to offer to share losses in the future."
"This is knocking on an open door, because the companies are already investing very substantial sums in alternative and successor technologies in researching a whole range of different technologies."
"They are doing it for obvious supply and commercial reasons."
"When oil and gas run out, these companies want to be supplying alternative and successor fuels."
"Shell and BP are investing huge sums of money in photovoltaics and wind and a whole range of synthetic fuel technologies."
"Perhaps colleagues should take comfort from the Labour minister who says that windfall taxes are not on the agenda."
"They are not a sound way of proceeding."
"Let market mechanisms be the way to encourage renewable and alternative sources of energy."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are asking the Commission whether it would be prepared to negotiate a voluntary agreement with oil companies based in the European Union, in which some of the unexpectedly high profits that have resulted from rising oil prices would be invested in research and development with regard to alternative forms of energy."
"I have not received a clear answer to this."
"Whether this would even be sensible is something to be considered."
"It has been mentioned that companies are already doing just this, albeit on a small scale compared to the huge importance of these issues we are speaking about."
"National oil companies have always been profitable, not by accident and not just last year, but for decades."
"The more than EUR 60 billion profit made last year is so incredible that it even exceeds many countries’ budgets."
"In the case of my country, it is double."
"This then is more about countries than just companies."
"The huge earnings are of course due to China’s growth, and, in particular, the situation in the Middle East, which is to say the war there."
"It is public knowledge that oil companies have even sometimes contributed to the outbreak of war or insurrection, with oil prices rising as a consequence."
"We know that the industry also has cartels and that it is not a very gentlemanly business."
"War has been waged over oil on many occasions in the Middle East."
"In other words people have got their hands dirty with this substance of such great importance to us all."
"High oil prices are obviously very harmful to the economy and now the question is whether these profits will be used for any sensible purpose, and how sensible."
"We are insisting that they should be spent on research into alternative energies, which, ultimately, as Mr Chichester said, is of benefit to the companies themselves."
"In this way we would at the same time be fulfilling our own share of our environmental targets."
"The Commissioner said that it is difficult to interfere in the business of companies."
"It is difficult because they are bigger than states, but I would urge you to be courageous, because we have a responsibility to the citizens of Europe and, in fact, the future of all humanity."
"These are, therefore, not trifling matters."
"There are actually two alternatives: increase research or raise taxes."
"One or perhaps both."
"Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for his clear words on energy efficiency; reducing demand in both the energy and transport sectors will be one of the important answers."
"This weekend I was in Wels, Austria, attending one of the biggest renewable energy fairs."
"What has been done in Upper Austria could be done in other regions of Europe, because in Upper Austria today only 7% of all new houses are heated with oil."
"20% of oil use in Europe is for heating houses."
"In Upper Austria they have more or less completely switched to wood pellets and other renewables."
"So we definitely need a directive to promote the use of renewables in the heat and cooling sector, in other words low-temperature energy uses."
"Commissioner, I hope that your colleague, Mr Barrot, will contribute to your efforts to bring more efficiency to the transport sector."
"We are not efficient enough when it comes to standards for cars."
"We need a better modal shift in transport."
"Another issue brings me to what oil companies could really do."
"We have a directive on biofuel."
"We have to finance the implementation of these directives from our limited public budgets."
"What if we obliged the oil companies that sell fuel in Europe gradually to increase the minimum amounts of green fuels available at the pumps?"
"Then the payment would no longer have to come from scarce public resources, but from the huge profits of oil companies."
"This would be a very clear signal to the oil companies that they have to invest in alternatives and do more to promote them."
"Mr President, it is a good thing that this newly-elected Parliament should discuss renewable energies, something we have not done since the election."
"Admittedly, there will be a report from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, but I am sure we will be waiting another few months for it."
"For that reason, it is a good thing that it is on the agenda today."
"The reason, though, why the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats did not put its name to the question was that we have certain doubts about the way in which this is now being articulated."
"I share the misgivings that Commissioner Piebalgs has expressed."
"Another issue is that there are a number of companies that are already doing a very great deal in the field of renewable energies, and others that are not yet doing so, and there is a lack of nuance in treating them both the same."
"We have to do something."
"Politicians like ourselves, at the European and national levels, have to create the right framework conditions, so that those who invest a great deal in renewable energies receive an additional incentive to do so by finding the right conditions."
"I am grateful to Commissioner Piebalgs for stating the fundamental principles so clearly."
"I agree that renewable energies play an important part in a strategy for reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and helping us to achieve the Kyoto objective."
"Energy efficiency is another important area, and we believe that nuclear power, too, should make its contribution."
"I would, though, like to leave the Commissioner and the House with a final thought."
"Among renewable energies, I believe, we have to prioritise in a new way."
"A very great deal has been done in the fields of wind power and photovoltaic electricity, but we know that there are problems inherent in both these forms."
"Photovoltaic electricity still requires the spending of a very considerable amount of money in order to save a tonne of CO2."
"There is a good deal more potential with biomass, and also in the use of heat, that is, solar energy for heating purposes."
"The Commission will be heading in the right direction if it addresses this issue and improves the framework conditions in Europe for use of solar energy for heating purposes and for the use of biomass as a whole."
"Where that is concerned, I think all the groups in this House are behind you."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I listened to what the Commissioner said, and it seemed clear to me."
"However, I do not think his answer was a sufficient response to the question put to him."
"The request that was made has a strength, validity and coherence of its own."
"We have a number of serious problems to face in Europe, as you well know. The first concerns the fact that the European Union is consuming more and more energy and importing more and more energy products; the second concerns the relationship between energy development and the environment, particularly after the Kyoto Protocol is implemented; and the third concerns the quality of life in our cities from the perspective of energy pollution."
"These points increasingly lead to the conclusion that we must think about the energy of the future, renewable energies in particular, and about constant research into alternative forms of energy."
"By promoting renewables, I believe we can help to achieve the targets of our general energy policy, security of supply and competitiveness, as well as improving and strengthening environmental protection and sustainable development."
"There is a general awareness and belief that to achieve all that we need not just coherent political choices, but also huge public and private resources."
"In this specific case, I find it perfectly natural to call on businesses such as the oil companies – which have been able to enjoy special market conditions and make sizeable profits – to play their part alongside others with appropriate funding for plans and projects relating to alternative, renewable forms of energy."
"By adopting this approach we would be genuinely encouraging not a restriction on companies’ freedom to make profits, which should be left unaltered, but what is commonly called ‘corporate social responsibility’."
"Of the possible actions already brought up in the debate, one that I regard as extremely important is taking action in our major cities and large towns by investing resources to improve them from an energy and environmental point of view."
"We need to send out a clear signal that this is a turning point, and to do that it is absolutely essential to have everybody, including the oil companies, on board."
"That would be a useful answer that the Commission could give to every European citizen."
"Mr President, I listened to the Commissioner with increasing hope that this debate would lead to something more than the warm words and hot air that we have seen on this subject so far."
"Coming from Scotland, I have a vested interest in this subject."
"We have just over 5 million people and yet, with all our natural assets, the University of Scotland has calculated that we could contribute 1% of the world’s renewable energy needs."
"That would be worth some GBP 14 billion or EUR 20 billion per annum."
"Green energy is not a loss leader."
"To achieve this, we need leadership, which, sadly, the Scottish Government is not providing."
"We in Scotland and in Europe need a coherent energy plan."
"The European Commission is in an ideal position to provide the leadership and structure that these emerging technologies need."
"We heard last week that the European renewables organisations are asking to be allocated EUR 250 million in the Seventh Framework Programme for Research."
"I challenge the Commission to achieve and surpass that."
"Mr President, I am very much obliged to the Commissioner for his factual responses to the questions from the Communists and Socialists."
"The fact is that their ideological …"
"Yes, Mr Swoboda, now just listen to me."
"The ideological baggage you packed into your question defies description."
"The Commissioner gave a factual answer; he used the opportunity to set out a number of starting points relating to his prospects for a proper energy policy."
"I think it erroneous to take the energy and oil firms’ windfall profits as a pretext for distracting from one’s own responsibility for renewable energies, and for that error the Socialists and Communists in this House must bear responsibility."
"We have just heard the figures: EUR 60 billion in profits!"
"Let me remind Mr Turmes that oil prices are driven up not only by the oil-producing countries and the crude oil companies, but also and primarily by states, through taxation."
"In my own Member State, Germany, alone, approximate calculations indicate that the public become liable to over EUR 30 billion in additional taxes every year."
"This is a problem from which this sort of question should not divert attention, and I am grateful to the Greens and Liberals for having broadened the issue and enabled us to have a proper and wide-ranging debate today."
"What we can do is, I think, plain to see."
"We all remember well the debate we had on biofuels; it was not this House, but the unwillingness of the Member States, that prevented the inclusion of mandatory blending, and now Mr Swoboda wants to impose on the Commission an obligation it will never be able to discharge."
"We have to keep our feet on the ground and stick to the areas where we are in a position to do something – security of energy supply, the development of alternative forms of energy, promoting research, the overall framework."
"That is where we have to discharge this responsibility, but not by taking the excessive profits of oil companies as our starting point."
"In 1973, it was estimated that the oil reserves would last for another 30 years."
"The reason why they will now last for far longer is that these profits were used to seek out new stocks of crude oil."
"We rely on that being where the responsibility for the security of our energy supply is discharged."
"Mr President, about three months ago, on 10 and 11 December, I, on behalf of this House, took part in the trilateral energy conference of the Nordic Council, the Baltic Assembly and the Benelux Interparliamentary Consultative Council, which was concerned with the promotion of renewable energy, as well as with the future of nuclear sources."
"An outstanding document, entitled ‘Sustainable and Secure Energy Supplies’ was presented which will also be discussed at the end of this month in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy."
"The parliamentary delegations at the conference once again established that we failed to complete the tasks laid down in Gothenburg and Lisbon."
"We are unable to increase the renewable energy percentage from 6% to 12%."
"Given that fossil energy sources are finite, we must work towards intensifying research programmes."
"That is what we in this House will also be doing next Wednesday when we discuss the Locatelli report."
"The combination of private and public means is the perfect formula for the Lisbon agenda."
"The need for new investment variants and new forms – public private partnership, if you like – is also at issue."
"Within the priorities of this Parliament and on a voluntary basis – except for ‘stealth taxes’ on energy, which are unacceptable – but within these pre-conditions, Commissioner Piebalgs can certainly enter into dialogue without any problem."
"The European investments in hydrogen technology, for example, as argued by the High Level Group, are necessary."
"We realise that the oil companies have a lot of freedom at the moment."
"They are significant partners and they are already doing a great deal, but it is impossible to get them to cross this line on a voluntary basis."
"I would like to find out from the Commissioner how he tackles the discussions he referred to in practice."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to put the question of alternative forms of energy into the context of the Lisbon Strategy and the approach to climate change taken in the Kyoto protocol."
"There are two advantages and one disadvantage to applying the protocol."
"The advantages are a) protection of the environment and human health and b) the pressure for technological innovation."
"The disadvantage is that, until innovation is marketable, there remains the question of the adverse impact in industry, such as a reduction in exports by 3.8 to 5.1%."
"Without doubt, renewable sources of energy can contribute to a secure energy supply in Europe; however, they can also contribute to the Lisbon Strategy via technological development, technology exports, job creation and environmental protection."
"However, there appears to be a gulf between the successful demonstration of innovative technologies and their actual penetration of the market and I think that it is a that this gulf be bridged as quickly as possible."
"What measures do you, as Commissioner, intend to take in this direction, apart from the promotion – and/or the possibility – of concluding voluntary agreements with the energy industry?"
"There is no doubt today that, in view of climate change and the safety of energy supplies, we must make progress in using renewable energy resources."
"Even if part of the profits of oil companies were spent on this, I am not convinced it would be enough."
"For this we have to, at the very least, advance on two other fronts, those being commitments by Member States, and centralised research and development."
"Let us look at the first: commitments and approaches by Member States."
"According to the Commission report before the European Parliament ‘several countries have still not taken practical steps in the interests of reaching stated objectives’, and at Community level the target of 22.1% (of energy) by 2010 (coming from renewable sources) is in danger, and a figure of only 18 to 19% looks realistic."
"Huge differences appear between the performances of individual Member States, with, for example, my own country of Hungary in last place, only undertaking to reach 3.6% by 2010, even though it is the site of Europe’s greatest geothermal energy resource, and which to this day has not generated a single watt of electricity."
"Because of this I support the creation of a conference on renewable sources of energy, which would deal with the differing situations of the Member States, and would aim at reaching agreement.It is essential, in addition, that Member States are responsible for ensuring that environmentally friendly electricity can obtain a share of the market, and take into account the administrative, legal, technical, and grid-access obstacles."
"Greater aid and joint financing is necessary not only from the Union, but also from Member States."
"The Commission should do everything to ensure that Member States have greater financial access to development, and also that external costs should appear in the price of energy used."
"It is definitely worrying to note that in the last twenty years spending on research and development in the field of renewable energy has typically reduced at the national and European level."
"I suggest in the interests of aid that in the 7th EU technology research and development framework programme starting in 2007, research and development programmes on renewable energy should appear as a separate spending item."
". I wish to begin by thanking the honourable Members of the European Parliament for this debate."
"Energy policy has not been sufficiently debated either in this House or in the European Union."
"I would not like the public to view energy policy purely from the perspective of climate change."
"Energy policy is so important that it needs to be debated properly."
"Today’s debate shows that we can encourage markets by creating the right conditions."
"The European Union has achieved remarkable success."
"The very fact that we are asking ourselves how we can achieve the target of 22% for green electricity, when the current forecast is for an insufficient 19%, is already a success in itself."
"We must continue to provide specific requirements to encourage the markets to respond."
"The Commission will bring forward concrete new proposals concerning renewables, biomass and clean vehicles, and is working on new proposals."
"In this way we can encourage the market to respond to the needs of society."
"At the same time, the biggest challenge is to foster concerted efforts to create new technologies."
"CO2 capture and storage and other new environmental technologies are now on the agenda."
"That is one of the areas where the Commission’s actions should be strengthened by actions by the Members States and industry."
"I look forward to working with the European Parliament with a view to achieving such energy policy priorities."
"Mr President, those of us who remained silent while Mr Swoboda was making his contribution to the debate would have been grateful if he had kept his remarks to himself, or perhaps made them afterwards."
"It is a discourtesy to Members of this House to interrupt others’ speaking time."
"Mr President, I do think it is permissible to defend oneself when a Member of this House, for demagogic reasons, consistently lumps Social Democrats in with Communists."
"I think you too would defend yourself if you found yourself mentioned in the same breath as the UK Independence Party orother parties even further to the Right."
"Members of this House are perfectly entitled to defend themselves against slanders of that sort."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the report (A6-0038/2005) by Ingo Schmitt, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on a Community Air Traffic Controller Licence [COM(2004)0473 C6-0076/2004 2004/0146(COD)]."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, during conciliation on the ‘Single European Sky’ package, Parliament stressed the need to balance the various parts of the package so as to tackle the institutional, economic and technical aspects while developing a genuine social side."
"The Commission agreed to provide a proposal for a Community air traffic controller licence quickly."
"You are debating that Community licence today."
"This Commission proposal for a directive has three objectives."
"First, like Parliament, the Commission believes it is very important that the various elements of the ‘single sky’ package should be developed in a balanced manner."
"This proposal is a key part of the social pillar."
"That is why the social partners were closely involved in preparing the directive."
"The second objective, the reason why we proposed introducing a Community controller licence, has to do with safety."
"This common licence will make it possible to improve the safety of air traffic management by raising the standards of controller training."
"Moreover, the proposal also allows us to identify and, if appropriate, adopt the Eurocontrol safety regulatory requirements concerning the training of controllers in order to transpose them into Community law."
"The third objective is that the ‘single sky’ legislation will establish cross-border functional airspace blocks in order to reduce the fragmentation of air space."
"The licence will make it easier to organise these services either side of the borders and will contribute to labour mobility in the field of air traffic control."
"Let us turn now to the means used to meet these three objectives."
"To put an end to the present diversity of national rules, the proposal for a directive introduces high Community standards for the full range of skills that are essential for safety."
"This means in particular the conditions for entry to the profession, the structure of qualifications, the endorsements, the content of initial controller training and linguistic ability, both in English and in the mother tongue."
"This problem of language rules was certainly one of the most sensitive points during the talks in the Council."
"The Commission has based itself on already accepted international standards."
"The proposal’s added value is therefore not so much the drawing up of those standards as their introduction into a Community framework that will enable them to be applied in a truly harmonised manner."
"I am in particular expecting a lot from the certification of training providers, which offers a sound guarantee for the issue of a high level licence."
"As I am sure you know, the Council’s work has made good progress and a general approach was adopted at the ‘Transport’ Council on 9 December last."
"That approach respects the logic of our proposal and I will say that it clarifies our proposal in a number of places or else strengthens it, especially where the practicalities of management are concerned, with a view to the better management of mutual recognition, for example, or to applying the directive to current licence holders."
"Incidentally, Mr Schmitt, I note that most of your amendments relate to the same subjects as those raised by the Council."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the adoption of this report is a step towards convergence between the positions of Parliament and the Council."
"I have the impression that the Council is ready to examine with you the reconciliations necessary in order to facilitate the early adoption of this text, and I confirm to you that the report is very much on the same wavelength concerning the most delicate point, namely the language rules."
"The proposals in Mr Schmitt’s report are a balanced reconciliation between legitimate safety concerns and the mobility and free movement of controllers."
"That is why, Mr President, the Commission is awaiting Parliament’s position on this matter with confidence."
"I would like to thank Mr Schmitt again and to say how much this air traffic controller licence will enable us to move forwards into a single sky that is safer for all Europeans."
"That is why I am confident that Parliament will help us to take this constructive measure."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for what you have said, which has in fact made it even clearer that this proposal from the Commission is to a large degree accepted by this House, and, in the final analysis, wanted by the Council, as it stands."
"For that reason we should try to complete work, as soon as possible, on a joint directive that can then enter into force."
"It is still a characteristic of the European situation that European airspace belongs to those who are most overburdened on a global scale."
"On the one hand, the high level of traffic occurs, not in a flexible space, but rather in a fragmented European sky; the Member States’ air traffic control systems are still often not mutually compatible."
"Individual states often retain their own rules, regulations, procedures and performance standards."
"It was this, just over two years ago, that led the Commission and Parliament, under the slogan of the ‘Single European Sky’, to introduce four packages of measures aimed at doing away, once and for all, with this fragmentation in the sky above Europe."
"At the time, my response to all this was rather cautious, for it was unfortunately impossible for the Council to fully implement all the things in this package of measures that Parliament had thought up and asked for."
"Right now, though, we can be confident that the Member States – at least where the issue of cross-border blocks of airspace is concerned – are evidently prepared to accommodate each other, so that it may well be possible to create a single airspace in Europe within the foreseeable future."
"At that time, we also – as you said – put on the agenda more things that we wanted the four regulations to do, it having become apparent from discussions at the time that there were many incompatibilities in the field of air traffic control, whether the hardware, the technology, or even the actual services performed by air traffic controllers."
"That is all the more astonishing when one considers that many of the preconditions and standards have been made the subject of international rules by the ICAO or by Eurocontrol."
"Despite that, there exists in almost all the Member States a variety of regulations, with the consequence that individual air traffic controllers’ licences are not compatible."
"That is why I believe this harmonisation to be urgently necessary, and that there are three things it will enable us to achieve."
"Even greater safety is, in any case, worth working towards, and that we will achieve by standardising training and in-service training – with high standards, of course."
"As you yourself said, one fundamental issue in this is language skills, which are not, at present, guaranteed in every area."
"You also stressed a second point, that being the issue of who is to provide the training, of how people are to be tested and certified; in future, an independent body will be able to examine their performance in terms of how good the training is and how well it enables the air traffic controllers learning there to do their jobs later on."
"A third point, and one that I regard as far from secondary, is that air traffic controllers are, to this day, as a rule barred from pursuing their occupation if they were trained in another Member State."
"I regard all three of these points as important, and we should therefore implement them as soon as possible."
"If I am right in my judgment, this is not a matter of dispute."
"Such was, in any case, the impression I got from the competent specialist committee, which adopted my report by a large majority."
"It is also clear from conversations with Members that there is scarcely dissent, except – as always – on minor points with the Council, but I am confident that we will agree on a joint regulation as soon as possible."
"I would like to thank all the Members of the House who have contributed helpful proposals, suggestions, or criticisms to this or that aspect of this report, enabling us, overall, to come to a result with which we, together in this House, will be able to take a positive decision."
". Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, as a rule, our group, that of the European People’s Party and European Democrats, entrusts Mr Ingo Schmitt with matters relating to air transport and safety in the air, past experience having shown that we can generally follow where his proposals lead."
"It is therefore hardly surprising that we can identify wholeheartedly with the work he has done as rapporteur for what we have before us today."
"We are grateful to him for his essential contribution to making what we hope is a further improved text out of one from the Commission that was already good."
"According to what we have heard, there are actually very good indications that the Council will go along with it, so that all three institutions will be in this together."
"In the committee, as has already been pointed out, we were largely unanimous in favouring a high level of awareness of responsibility and competence, and in stating more precisely what these general requirements would mean in a range of specific applications."
"Reference has already been made to one important aspect of this topic, that being the issue of language skills, particularly where English is concerned."
"In the past, there have been all too many tragic instances of deficient communications being the actual cause of grave calamities."
"Both the rapporteur and – indirectly – the Commission have already observed that the outcome in the committee was almost unanimous."
"This was not so much an expression of our not regarding this report as important as of our having indeed having come to what was largely a consensus – a consensus that we want to see emphasised by as solidly united a vote as possible in the plenary, which will enable us to take a substantial step closer to the single European sky about which we hear so much said."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by thanking the rapporteur."
"The directive on the air traffic controllers’ licence is a significant step towards the realisation of our great goal of a single European sky."
"For a start, the creation of functional airspace blocks across borders is dependent on it."
"Secondly, there is now a presumption of harmonised licensing and training at a high level in this area, which also makes air traffic controllers more mobile, something that is urgently needed in view of the fact that Europe is short of some 1 500 of them."
"Thirdly, standardised rules and regulations at a high level help to improve safety to a marked degree."
"Let me say at this point how glad I am that the rapporteur has taken on board my idea of implementing harmonised training in crisis management techniques."
"This will make us better prepared for extreme and dangerous situations such as the hijacking of aircraft."
"What we see as important as regards increased mobility is that we should be able to reduce excessively stringent requirements as regards local languages – and here I am not talking about English – to justifiable individual instances."
"This is the only way in which we will be able to prevent market foreclosure through the back door."
"We Social Democrats also take the trade unions’ concerns seriously, and that is why we want explicit mention in the directive of social dialogue."
"Particularly in view of the heated debate on the services directive, we also see it as important that the host country principle should apply to air traffic controllers; firstly, as a means of preventing social dumping, and secondly, in order to enable the controllers to work together as a team without that being undermined."
"Now more than ever, being an air traffic controller is an attractive career, and one that can take you all over Europe, and I hope that it will be one on which even more young people will decide than they have done in the past."
". Mr President, warm thanks particularly to the rapporteur, who has managed – in the committee, at any rate – to bring this topic to a conclusion with a high degree of consensus, in a very agreeable atmosphere, and with a great deal of concentration on the matter in hand."
"There are a few more points, of great importance to me in this context, that I would like to mention."
"One is the issue of how we prevent social dumping; it has been apparent from the dialogue as a whole that we agree that this is something we cannot afford in an area in which the safety requirements are so stringent."
"Secondly, we all attach great importance to training and safety, and here there is a need for more training on how to deal with extraordinary situations, such as hijacks and the like, in a job where people can be under extreme pressure."
"My third point is that I too thought it important that the follow-up to this directive must cover, step by step, the staff right down the safety chain with any involvement in the decision-making process, for this is where there must be harmonisation across the board and where mobility must be ensured."
"Above all, I would like to say something else about languages, one of the most interesting and most vigorously debated issues, where the impression was sometimes created that what it was about was not so much the mastery of the host state’s language, but rather the establishment of obstacles by way of the back door."
"To that I would say that creating obstacles of this sort in this area would be to set up the wrong benchmark."
"We have to ensure excellence in the use of the English language, and that is what this directive ensures."
"I thank all Members of the House for their good cooperation."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group voted in favour of Mr Schmitt’s report in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, even though we are, of course, rather sad that our amendment on the treatment of flight controllers as a public service was not accepted."
"On the whole, though, one has to be honest and say that harmonisation, Mr Schmitt’s chosen approach, is entirely in line with our thinking, for, at the end of the day, harmonisation can be an overall goal for the European Union, no matter in what area."
"If harmonisation proves successful in certain political fields, if we manage to bring about the same conditions, that cannot do other than improve social standards and safety in every instance, and consequently bring about fairer competition among ourselves."
"It is down this road that the rapporteur has gone, while of course incorporating certain other things, two of which I would like to highlight."
"The first – and as the previous speaker has already said – has to do with the flight controllers, where we said ‘no’ and contended that the law of the country in which the flight controllers perform their services must apply."
"I have come to know Mrs Lichtenberger too well to be surprised by what she said to the effect that social dumping must not be allowed under any circumstances to gain a foothold in this area."
"There must be no place for social dumping anywhere!"
"If we make that the principle for this directive, we also have a good chance of making general changes to the services directive, and of doing away with the country of origin principle, which really does lead to social dumping and the erosion of the law."
"A second point that is of course of equal interest to me as rapporteur on the monitoring of road transport is Mr Schmitt’s proposal for a mandatory and standardised or harmonised list of penalties."
"I very much hope that we can get this past the Council, for that is precisely what we need on the roads."
"It is not acceptable that different Member States should, to some degree, treat different offences as more or less significant."
"This is where I regard harmonisation within the European Union as urgently necessary, and so I hope you manage to get it accepted."
"I will get my turn a bit later with the second reading of my report, and that of course increases the likelihood that I will achieve it too with my report."
"Once again, then, many thanks to the rapporteur."
". Mr President, this part-session includes discussion of a directive stating that air controllers will have to speak and understand English to a satisfactory level in all Member States."
"English is already the language of air control."
"One of the entry requirements to train at Eurocontrol is a good knowledge of English, the international language of aviation."
"These proposals lessen the requirement to speak English across air traffic control."
"Amendment 17 says: ‘Member States require level 5 of the ICAO proficiency test in English and/or the local language’."
"‘Or’ means ‘or’ in any language."
"That threatens safety."
"The report contains phrases such as: ‘the right of Member States to develop national endorsements should only apply in exceptional cases’."
"That is not English, it is EU gobbledegook."
"World airlines fear the EU’s costly desire to switch air control from radar to Galileo, but the EU’s air control agenda is not really about airways, it is about EU control and control for the sake of it."
". Mr President, members of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the issues dealt with in the Parliament and Council directive on a Community air traffic controller licence are key issues in the field of civil aviation safety."
"We cannot afford to be indifferent or to allow any slackness in procedures and measures in this field, given that any problem could pose a threat to human life and health."
"I therefore believe that this directive is necessary, and indeed essential."
"If the sky above us is to be treated as a Single European Sky, then precise and clear legal regulations are needed."
"These regulations must also cover air traffic controller licences, because the work of air traffic controllers must meet the highest possible standards of responsibility and professionalism."
"As well as specialised training for work under normal conditions, which we all hope will always prevail, it is important that training be provided for any exceptional situations or crises that could arise."
"Air traffic controllers must therefore be people with a great deal of theoretical knowledge and extensive practical skills."
"They must be in excellent physical and mental health, which means that regular check-ups are necessary, and they must be people who can remain calm and in control even in exceptional situations, such as crashes and terrorist attacks, as mentioned by the previous speakers."
"With regard to knowledge of languages, air traffic controllers obviously need a very good knowledge of English, the common language, yet they should also be fluent in the local language, as this would be particularly important in a crisis."
"I believe that these regulations should also provide for some kind of feedback, or systematic monitoring of the impact of the legislation, as well as for the adoption of any amendments that become necessary, particularly with regard to developments in electronic and digital technology."
"Finally, I should like to extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to the rapporteur, Mr Schmitt, for the effort he has put into dealing with this issue."
"I say thisas someone who has helped train Polish civil pilots, as until recently this was my job at the Rzeszow University of Technology."
"I also believe it would be a good idea if EU legislation on such an important matter were to be adopted and respected outside the European Union."
"There are no artificial borders in the sky, and the laws of aeromechanics apply everywhere."
"The principles of aviation safety should therefore be enforced throughout the world, and the European Union may well be able to help ensure that this is the case."
"Many thanks."
"– Mr President, all of us – at least those of us who attended the parliamentary debates during the last legislature on this issue – remember the emphasis placed on initiatives aimed at improving the organisation, punctuality and safety of navigation and air traffic control services and, on a practical level, at creating a single European sky and related regulations."
"Mindful that managing a complex air transport system and air traffic control system must be seen from a broader global perspective, which encompasses not only air traffic management systems (ATM) but also airlines and airports, we note that this directive will complete an important aspect of the single European sky, namely the harmonisation of rules relating to the issuing of training licences for air traffic controllers in the European area."
"This will in turn improve their mobility and facilitate the work of cross-border airspace control services."
"It is also important to clarify the legal situation as regards licences issued by the Member States under national law prior to the new directive’s entry into force; the necessary legal certainty must be provided and the directive must not be applied retrospectively."
"Hence the importance of the adoption in committee of an amendment covering this aspect, which will hopefully be adopted in plenary with the adoption of this report."
"We are also pleased about the reference made by the rapporteur, whom I take this opportunity to congratulate on his excellent report, to the fact that, following discussions with interest groups, he was able to conclude that both workers and the industry – the Commissioner referred to this – not only consent to the introduction of a harmonised Community air traffic controller licence, but even welcome it."
"This also confirms that neither the economic aspects, nor, more importantly, the social aspects of the European single sky, including vocational training, have been overlooked by the Commission or by Parliament."
"Mr President, I now hope that, when it is put into practice by the Member States, this initiative fully achieves all the objectives for which it was created and that it constitutes a practical opportunity to enhance the effectiveness of ATM services and of air transport safety for the benefit of its users, which, ultimately, we all are."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like first to congratulate Mr Schmitt on the extremely full and balanced nature of his work."
"At last we have a text of very great quality, and the work of amendment done in committee makes an important parliamentary contribution."
"It is a text that flows naturally from the work we did during the last parliamentary term, that is to say on the establishment of the single European sky, and this social dimension was absolutely essential because we are dealing with a public safety service that is first of all a manpower service."
"The quality of air traffic control and of air navigation depends on the men and their qualifications, and its quality is of course its high level of safety."
"I believe the text meets all these requirements."
"I do not know what the outcome of the vote will be tomorrow, but it seems to me that it represents rather the anti-Bolkestein approach."
"It is an exercise in Community regulation."
"It is an exercise in harmonised regulation."
"It is an exercise in mutual recognition, with extremely detailed work on certification, endorsements and mutual recognition."
"From that point of view, I am very pleased with it."
"From this perspective, Amendment 20, which wants it made clear that air traffic controllers will be subject to the social jurisdiction of the country where they work, is quite crucial."
"It will be the explicit confirmation of what we all want, that is to say harmonisation, not social dumping."
"Secondly, we are again presenting Amendment 22 on the sectoral social dialogue."
"I know that some of our fellow Members say that goes without saying."
"However, we think it is even better to say it, especially since the Single Sky Committee has not agreed to include workers’ representatives, which is quite crucial for the quality of the service in this field."
"Mr President, the Commission looks forward to the position Parliament will take on this dossier with confidence and I would like to thank the speakers who have all stressed the excellent work Parliament has done and paid tribute to the rapporteur, Mr Schmitt."
"I do in fact believe this report is a very encouraging report and, once again, I want to add my voice to the praise and thanks that have been addressed to the rapporteur of the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"I now have to speak on the amendments."
"I am not going to review them individually, Mr President."
"With your permission, I would prefer to take them in groups."
"Most of the amendments seek to clarify the text of the proposal for a directive and to highlight safety, because safety really is this text’s absolute priority, or to introduce continuation training in the realm of safety."
"Such is the case with Amendments 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13 and 15."
"The Commission is therefore able to accept all these amendments."
"The same goes for Amendment 16, which tightens the conditions for the introduction of national endorsements, and for Amendment 18, which seeks to simplify administrative burdens."
"The Commission will be able to back your position on the language rules, which in a balanced way reconciles legitimate safety concerns and the rights of free movement of controllers; your Amendments 10 and 17 bring about genuine convergence between the positions of Parliament and the Council."
"A number of other amendments are acceptable in principle provided their wording is amended slightly."
"The Commission fully supports the principle of Amendment 6 concerning monitoring by the social partners and involving and consulting them."
"I have already stressed this point in my first speech."
"So far as Amendment 14 is concerned, the Commission accepts the idea of greater training in safety, but believes it would be better to deal with this in Annex I, which specifies the content of training."
"Then there is the amendment that introduces the reference to the law of the place of work in the case of mobility."
"I fully understand the logic behind Amendment 20."
"The legal basis for such a proposal is nevertheless safety, and that objective is pursued through the establishment of standards for the essential conditions in the matter."
"As Mr Savary has pointed out, there is already Community law on this subject."
"The Worker Secondment Directive does in fact provide that the conditions of the place of work shall apply in the case of secondment."
"That is why, instead of an article that is alien to the purpose of the text, the Commission would be willing to accept a recital making explicit reference to relevant Community law, as you have asked for."
"As I have just said, to confirm the importance of involving the social partners in implementing and monitoring this directive, especially in support of Amendment 6, I propose that such a reference to the social law applicable be included in a recital."
"In other words, this text, which is essentially about safety, is located in the context of a Community social law that can well be referred to in the recitals."
"That leaves us with three amendments that the Commission is not able to support, for formal reasons in particular."
"Firstly, the Commission believes it is unnecessary to retain the requirement for accounts complying with international standards, as Amendment 19 asks for."
"The providers of continuation training, that is the suppliers of air traffic control services, are already covered by other Community regulations, and such a requirement seems to us to be excessive for small training providers."
"The Commission is therefore able to agree to a complete deletion of the paragraph concerned, your concern for sound management already being covered by other sources of Community law."
"On Amendment 21 on the structure of penalties, the Commission prefers to keep the standard formula as it also appears in the general approach adopted by the Council."
"There is also Amendment 4, which touches on a very important aspect of the introduction of a licence: what should be done with holders of national licences?"
"In our view, the solution is not to defer the introduction of the new harmonised standards or to have two parallel standards of competence existing side by side."
"Quite honestly, that would not be good for safety."
"That is why the Commission is unable to back this proposed amendment."
"Having said that, it is open to any solution that is conducive to the rapid introduction of the standards of competence, while of course respecting the obligations of legal certainty for current licence holders."
"Amendment 22 was tabled just before the plenary session."
"As I mentioned earlier, the Commission supports the consultation and involvement of the social partners; they are essential."
"To be more precise, however, it does not believe it is essential for such an obligation to appear in this text."
"There we are, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is in broad agreement with your work."
"The Commission is genuinely able to give its full support to Mr Schmitt’s report and I would like to add that the Commission’s and Parliament’s positions are really very close."
"The constructive nature of Mr Schmitt’s report really must be emphasised and, as I believe Mr Rack said just now, while the initial proposal was a good one, the text is even better."
"Yes, it is true, the text is even better, proving once again the importance of Parliament’s work as co-legislator."
"If you validate this approach in tomorrow’s vote, I therefore believe we will have made progress towards achieving the objectives we have all set ourselves: that is, seeking even greater safety in the field of air traffic control."
"That is what Europe’s citizens are expecting of us, and it is all the more necessary if we want air traffic to develop in the direction of a very high service quality, with, in particular, a level of safety that should make the European sky probably the safest sky in the world."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A6-0003/2005), on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Council common position for adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons, to self-employed persons and to members of their families moving within the Community and Regulation (EEC) No 574/72 laying down the procedure for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 [(12062/3/2004 C6-0189/2004 2003/0184(COD)] (rapporteur: Proinsias De Rossa)."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by expressing my regret that the rapporteur, Mr De Rossa cannot be present."
"He is the MEP who has worked on this matter and who is most familiar of all with it, but he is unfortunately ill at home in Ireland and cannot participate in this debate."
"I am therefore replacing him, which is not difficult because both my political group and I have the same view as Mr De Rossa when it comes to adopting a position at Parliament’s second reading."
"We think we have to say yes."
"Allow me to begin by saying something about the significance of Regulation 1408/71."
"It is fundamental to free movement in the EU to make it easier for people to move between different Member States and, at the same time, be able to collect various social benefits."
"Since this Regulation came into force in the 1970s, it has been fundamentally revised."
"Moreover, improvements have been made along the way."
"Improvements have been made now too, which is also the reason for the rapporteur’s adopting the position he has."
"When we debated the matter in the committee, there was a large majority in favour of our approving the Council’s common position."
"The result of the vote was 30 votes in favour and one against."
"If I remember rightly, this ‘no’ vote was from someone who, in quite general terms, has a poor opinion of free movement and cooperation within the EU."
"There was, then, considerable unanimity when it came to the debate in the committee and to approving the rapporteur’s position."
"Since then, a change has taken place in relation to the original position, namely in connection with paragraph 2, which has to do with the fact that, as early as during the discussion in the committee, we knew that there was disagreement between the Commission and the Council when it came to some specific benefits."
"Since the discussion in the committee, we have found that the wording we used before gives rise to legal uncertainty."
"We have therefore been advised by Parliament’s legal service to alter paragraph 2."
"With the support of his political group and of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, Mr De Rossa has thus tabled an amendment that eliminates this legal uncertainty."
"Otherwise, the rapporteur’s position is the same."
"There is, furthermore, an amendment designed to have us reject the common position."
"I wish, however, to argue in favour of our following the rapporteur’s recommendation."
"Firstly, we should not delay this process any further."
"We know about there having been a parallel overhaul of the Regulation itself."
"Now, the implementing Regulation must also be revised."
"It would not benefit this process if Parliament were to reject the common position."
"Secondly, and if we look at the matter as a whole and at what we said at first reading, the Council has in actual fact taken a great deal of account, even a great deal of account, of the views expressed by Parliament."
"The two views I am now discussing, that is to say firstly that we must not delay the process and, secondly, that we have to a large extent had our opinions taken into consideration, mean that we should approve the common position, but with the amendment that has been tabled so as to avoid legal uncertainty."
"When it comes to the benefits of which the Commission and the Council have different perceptions, these matters should, with the Commission’s consent, be decided by legal bodies."
"We must not, therefore, pre-empt the decision that may be taken by legal bodies."
"I cannot see that it is in anyone’s interest to delay this process or to reject the common position."
"It is in neither the Commission’s, nor the Council’s nor Parliament’s interests, and it is definitely not in the interests of the people."
"Mr President, I want to begin by thanking Mr Andersson for standing in for Mr De Rossa like this and by sending Mr De Rossa my best wishes for his recovery."
"I am very pleased with the considerable progress that has been made on this proposal, both in the Council and in the European Parliament, progress which means it can now finally be adopted."
"The Commission proposal before us today seeks to update the Community regulations on the coordination of the Member States’ social security schemes in order to take account of changing national legislation, to clarify the legal position regarding certain articles of those regulations and to take account of recent developments in the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, especially as concerns Annex IIa of Regulation 1408/71."
"I would like to concentrate particularly on Annex IIa."
"This Annex contains a list of special non-contributory benefits which are specifically coordinated in the Regulation I have just mentioned."
"This coordination, which has been upheld by the Court of Justice, is based on the principle of residence."
"It provides on the one hand that the benefits concerned are not exportable, but on the other hand that the new State of residence is required, on its territory, to grant the benefits provided by its national legislation."
"Following recent case law of the Court of Justice, it seemed necessary to review the list of benefits in Annex IIa and to check that it contains only benefits satisfying the following criteria: firstly, the benefits must be non-contributory, that is to say paid for out of taxation, and secondly they must be special."
"A special benefit is half way between social security and social assistance."
"It is special when its main purpose is to guarantee a minimum subsistence income or when it is intended solely for the specific protection of the disabled."
"I want to emphasise the major step forward made in the Council, since as a result of the Member States’ spirit of compromise, the review of Annex IIa resulted in a large number of benefits currently included there being removed."
"This mainly involves benefits which, although intended for the disabled, are intended mainly to make them less dependent by improving their state of health and their lives."
"That makes them special and they can therefore no longer appear in Annex IIa."
"I therefore want to congratulate your rapporteur, Mr De Rossa, on his excellent report and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on its work."
"The rapporteur and the committee rightly drew attention to the major improvements this regulation will be able to bring to the citizen and, consequently, the necessity of accepting the Council common position if the progress made is not to be jeopardised."
"It is true that, as you know, three Member States thought that some of their benefits had particular characteristics that distinguished them from other benefits and that those benefits, five in all, therefore fulfilled the criteria for retention in Annex IIa."
"Not wishing to prevent the regulation being adopted, since it also brings considerable improvements, the Council agreed to keep those five benefits in Annex IIa pending clarification by the Court of Justice of its case law."
"The Commission has however reserved the right to ask the Court of Justice to make every necessary clarification concerning those five benefits in the light of the criteria set by the regulation."
"On the basis of those clarifications and findings of the Court of Justice, the Commission will if appropriate present a proposal revising the list contained in Annex IIa."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to make real social progress."
"It is no doubt regrettable that it has not all been completely finalised, but the progress is such that I believe Parliament has every reason to accept it, thus giving our European fellow citizens a further opportunity to experience the mobility people in the European Union should have without losing entitlement to benefits they need in order to cope with the risks of life."
"I therefore thank Parliament for its work, Mr President, and, I hope, for adopting this text."
". Mr President, in the Netherlands, we have a saying which, roughly translated, means that you should not crack a walnut with a sledgehammer."
"The amendment I have tabled can be understood in that sense, and, moreover, when I consider the efforts being made by a number of Member States to convince people that what the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has presented is poor, then I think that analogy of the walnut and the sledgehammer is true to life."
"What is this debate about?"
"That is something about which I should like to see some clarity."
"Today, we are debating the annual amendment of Regulation 1408/71 to take account of changes in social legislation and social security schemes in the Member States."
"This involves incorporation of the ECJ’s case law, and checking whether the elements that accompany those modifications meet the general criteria for mobility and freedom of movement, but also for those of Regulation 1408/71, the Member States’ proposals having therefore been verified beforehand."
"We are also discussing Annex IIa, which involves verification of certain specific qualities."
"It is examined whether the proposals contain elements in respect of which certain benefits should be exportable or not."
"I would mention Dutch social security by way of example, which need not be exported."
"In Spain, there is assistance or remuneration, as well as benefits for mobility which need not be exported."
"We have all established this and we are all agreed on this."
"Every Member State has made some contribution or other to those listings."
"What I do not understand, though, is that we, although we have laid down principles in the new coordination regulation, still manage to allow a number of Member States to get away with things of which we have said beforehand that they should actually be exportable."
"Normally speaking, I would have left it to the Commission to solve this problem."
"That is also the reason why we as a group have agreed to this change."
"Then, however, the Legal Service came on the scene and told us that we in this House cannot approve something that the ECJ has not accepted."
"We cannot adopt a legislative text containing elements that are unlawful."
"That is when the problem started."
"What escapes me is why we allow the Finns not to have to export their childcare benefit, the Swedes their benefit for disabled children and care or the British their nursing and care allowance – in respect of which, in fact, a petition has been adopted – while at the same time, we are asking 22 other Member States which are forced to backpedal – including the Luxembourgers, the Greeks and the Spanish – to export those benefits."
"When the Legal Service said that we should not accept this, I asked why the Council had done so."
"It is on account of unanimity that a number of Member States do not adhere to the rules."
"Is this something that we in this House should be condoning?"
"I wonder whether this should not be the last time, and I think that we should simply send a clear and straightforward message, which should also be incorporated in the implementing regulation that we are also still awaiting."
". Mr President, it is late in the evening, so of course it is time to talk about Regulation 1408: we always get the best slots for our discussions!"
"I should like to thank the rapporteur for the work that he has done on this."
"It is with a certain amount of reluctance that my Group has signed up to the amendment because we fully understand the frustration that Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has just expressed."
"We feel, once again, that a number of Member States are obeying what they believe to be the letter of the law rather than the spirit of the law."
"However, my Group will not delay the implementation of the other changes that are important and positive for people in order to await suitable cases and the ECJ timetable, since that may not happen particularly fast."
"We are concerned about the number of exclusions, not least from the UK, because they particularly affect the lives of the disabled and elderly people."
"The Department of Work and Pensions’ website describes the disability living allowance and the attendance allowance as two of the most important social security benefits in the UK."
"The wording is important."
"Many Members will find that they receive letters about the importance of these payments for students studying abroad."
"While it is true that they can apply to be recognised for particular allowances in other Member States, this is not particularly helpful at times when, for example, in the UK they have to have been resident for 26 out of the previous 52 weeks before being eligible for disability allowance."
"This is not particularly helpful if they have been a student during the period of October to June."
"We only have to do the maths."
"We also get letters from people wanting to retire abroad, where the difference in the monies paid makes a considerable difference as to whether they can move to a climate that has a more positive effect on their health and quality of life."
"Therefore I deeply regret the decision of the UK Government not to include those social security benefits."
"I believe that its decisions are discriminatory in their effect, a barrier to equal opportunities and do not fit in with the concept of social inclusion as it crosses boundaries."
"I hope that we will see some rapid action from the Commission, even if we could not express this in writing."
". Mr President, in his article in the current issue of Parliament’s magazine, Mr De Rossa stated that his resolution was carried unanimously in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"But the record shows that one Member voted against."
"That was me, and I intend to do so again this week with my UKIP colleagues."
"Let me explain."
"At the centre of Mr De Rossa’s report is a stand-off between the Commission and the Council over the exportability of five benefits, three from the United Kingdom."
"Mr De Rossa suggests that the report should be adopted without delay, so that Regulation 1408/71 can be tidied up."
"Then he proposes that the European Court of Justice resolve the dispute over the five benefits."
"We believe that the decision on the United Kingdom benefit should be left to Her Majesty’s Government, which does not want them to be exportable."
"Indeed, the Council’s previously stated common position upholds that of Her Majesty’s Government."
"We therefore deplore the Commission’s change of mind."
"We believe that it should be for each Member State to define the basis on which its benefits are to be paid and to whom."
"We absolutely oppose the notion that the deadlock should be resolved by the European Court of Justice."
"Benefits are part of taxation systems."
"They are dual systems: taking from and giving back."
"To interfere in either is to interfere in the taxation system as a whole."
"Since the EU likes to keep up the pretence that it has no competence for issues of taxation, it should not therefore interfere at all in the benefits system."
"To return, finally, to Mr De Rossa’s article, it is noted that Finland and Sweden also contest the listing of two allowances."
"We respect their stance."
"The article shows that the Commission has exempted the Irish carers’ allowance, as the Irish Government wished."
"It is wrong and iniquitous that the United Kingdom carers’ allowance has not been exempted."
"As regards the three United Kingdom benefits, let me say unequivocally that Her Majesty’s elected government should be treated like its Irish counterparts in that respect and that should be the end of the matter."
"Social security is a value which we espouse in the Member States of the European Union."
"It is a matter of even greater importance to all those who are incapacitated as a result of disability, sickness or old age."
"Increased mobility within the countries of the European Union has been accompanied by an increasing number of problems, which must be resolved in as non-discriminatory a manner as possible."
"For this reason social security systems in the Member States of the European Union must be harmonised so that all cases can receive equal treatment."
"I support the proposal of rapporteur De Rossa and I will be voting for the report."
"In the present situation it is more beneficial to support the amendment to Regulation 1408 and, within this framework, to Annex 2A, rather than continuing with fruitless negotiations, since adopting a joint position has involved the Council in protracted negotiations."
"Time will tell which cases cannot be included in the list of supplements, so I therefore suggest that such cases be resolved individually, impartially and in people’s interests."
"I am pleased that the Council has adopted the proposal of Parliament on the mobility supplement, which covers travel expenses for people with disability, and which is exclusively aimed at providing special protection for people with disability."
"I also welcome the oral amendments adopted by Parliament, whereby Member States should adopt measures which will help to mitigate any unwelcome consequences for those people who will be most affected by the regulation."
"Mr President, the Commission welcomes the support expressed for the common position."
"I want to emphasise once again that this common position seeks to improve in several respects the rights of European citizens moving within the European Union."
"May I say that European citizens are really fortunate to be able to move within the Union in this way while being assured in a number of cases of the solidarity they need."
"That is a real step forward."
"Under these circumstances of course – Mrs Oomen-Ruijten will take no offence – the Commission does not support her amendment rejecting the common position because that amendment would jeopardise all the progress made by the Community legislator up until now in the matter of special non-contributory benefits."
"The proposal in question will result in dozens of benefits that have not been exportable up until now being exportable."
"There are however still five benefits at issue that have not been accepted as having to be exportable."
"The effect of Amendment 2 will be that all those benefits will remain in Annex IIa and will therefore continue to be non-exportable."
"I honestly believe that, even if the fate of those five benefits is still uncertain, the agreement reached in the Council and the support, which I believed to be quite broad, in Parliament should enable us to make significant social progress for all European citizens where the remainder of the benefits is concerned."
"That is why the Commission is keen to see this text adopted."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon."
"I declare the 2004/2005 session of the European Parliament closed."
"I declare the session of the European Parliament 2005-2006 open."
"The sitting is open."
"I would like to welcome Mr Solomon Passy, Bulgarian Foreign Affairs Minister, who is visiting Parliament today and who is in the official gallery."
"This visit, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, represents an important step in the process of accession and in strengthening the links between Bulgaria and the European Parliament."
"We are all aware that on 13 April we will give our opinion here, in Strasbourg, on Bulgaria's accession."
"If Parliament expresses a favourable opinion, and if the accession treaty is signed on 25 April in Luxembourg, as scheduled, we will have the great pleasure of receiving amongst us, firstly, the Bulgarian observers, and then the Members who will sit in this House."
"Minister, I wish you a happy stay in the European Parliament."
"Today, ladies and gentlemen, we are celebrating International Women’s Day."
"We have been doing so for more than 90 years, but, despite this celebration, every day millions of women throughout the world still suffer discrimination on the grounds of gender and abuse of all kinds, both in times of peace and in times of war."
"They are still the victims of physical, psychological, sexual and economic violence, violence which sometimes comes from within their closest family environment."
"Just a few days ago we saw horrific images of Turkish riot police putting down a demonstration of women ahead of today’s Women’s Day."
"I had the opportunity to condemn these actions yesterday in plenary."
"I have asked the Turkish Government to punish the perpetrators of these indescribable actions and I would like to point out that they do not, of course, send the best possible message in terms of Turkey’s possible accession."
"Ladies and gentlemen, at the moment and until 11 March, the United Nations are hosting a World Conference on gender equality to review the progress made since the Beijing Conference of 1995, ten years ago now."
"As you know, a Delegation from our Parliament is participating very actively in this Conference, as was also the case in 1995."
"There is no question that progress has been made since then."
"Kofi Annan acknowledged this in his speech at the opening of the Beijing + 10 Conference, but there are still enormous problems, immense challenges, which must not be considered without proposing solutions, just as we must not treat today as simply a symbolic day which merely serves to satisfy our guilty conscience."
"This afternoon we will hold a debate on ‘Cultural and domestic violence’ involving specialised media and personalities."
"I would like to invite all of you to this seminar/debate, and when I say everybody, I mean everybody, men and women, because when we hold these events relating to the problems of women, we men are usually conspicuous by our absence."
"We must be aware that the problem of gender equality is not just a problem for women, it is a problem for both women and for society as a whole, and we men must be more involved in the task of resolving it."
"Today in Europe, one in every five women claim to have been victims of abuse, one in every five."
"And unfortunately this proportion is increasing in many countries."
"In the rich, democratic, developed and cohesive European Union, poverty is becoming increasingly feminised."
"There are worrying signs of a feminisation of poverty."
"Women today still receive, on average, 16% less pay than their male colleagues for the same work."
"This point must also be dealt with within the Lisbon Strategy, which does not offer very positive figures in this regard either."
"For this reason, during this term in office, we have introduced into each parliamentary committee a Member responsible for monitoring gender issues, which cannot be dealt with in an isolated fashion, in a kind of conceptual ghetto, but which must affect all policies horizontally."
"This term in office will also be marked by the ratification of the Constitution, which includes, very rightly, gender equality amongst the Union’s objectives and values."
"But we must go beyond texts and words and be aware that equality will not become a reality until the mindset of men changes radically, overcoming an anthropological heritage that is sometimes deeply ingrained in our customs and consciences, until employers start offering equal salaries, until specific advantages are offered with a view to helping women to carry out their professional activities and to prevent or compensate for the disadvantages they have to face in their professional careers as a result of fulfilling a role that only they can play, human reproduction."
"We will not resolve Europe’s demographic problems unless we resolve the problems of equality for women."
"When the day comes when all the Member States apply the Declaration relating to Article III-116 of the Constitution and adopt the necessary measures to punish criminal acts, because we are talking about criminal violence against women, we will have taken a great step forward."
"I would like there to be complete gender parity in this Parliament."
"But I would like this to come about, not because a rule imposes it, but because the equal distribution of capacities between men and women is reflected in our social and political practices."
"Neither should we believe that the best yardstick for measuring equality between men and women is the percentage of women members of the parliaments of the different countries."
"Inequality manifests itself in the cruellest and hardest way in the lowest strata of society, where a combination of dreadful working conditions and family burdens makes life hardest for women."
"I would therefore like once again to invite you to take part in the events that are going to be held today in the European Parliament, which is participating in today’s celebration with the greatest of enthusiasm."
"The next item is the debate on the oral questions to the Council (B6-0015/2005) and to the Commission (B6-0016/2005) on the follow-up to the Fourth World Conference on Women – Platform for Action (Beijing + 10)."
"– Mr President, today being International Women’s Day, it is an important opportunity to draw attention to the fact that women around the world are insufficiently involved in decision-making."
"I am glad that the Commission, too, will now be joining in our debate, as the questions raised will focus on how the evaluation of the platform for action at Beijing ten years ago has developed as our most important foundation for measures in connection with women’s rights around the world."
"As I speak, the UN is in session in New York, assessing the outcomes of the Platform for Action, and in this the European Union has a very important part to play."
"As a rapporteur in Beijing, I did of course follow closely what the European Union was doing and the action it was taking; I did so again five years later at ‘Beijing + 5’ in New York, and now, with a delegation from the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, I am doing the same with ‘Beijing + 10’."
"We see it as an important step, and one on which I congratulate the Luxembourg Presidency, to use good and adroit negotiation as a means of defending women’s rights there."
"The United States of America has pushed hard for the platform for action to be renegotiated in order to spark renewed controversy and gain renewed influence, particularly in matters affecting twelve critical areas – prime among them being reproductive and sexual rights, which, in practical terms, means abortion."
"The negotiating skills of the Luxembourg Presidency, among others, made it possible to prevent this, but I find it regrettable that the Commission did not put on much of a show in New York, being represented only by one Commissioner, or, perhaps on one occasion, by Mr Barroso."
"The questions that we are putting today to the Commission and the Council in those twelve different areas must serve to evaluate progress and, of course, also to highlight the deficiencies in these areas that have yet to be made good."
"Here in the EU, we have had one report from each Member State; the Luxembourg Presidency has held a conference to collate them and to undertake an assessment."
"Progress has certainly been made."
"Where political participation is concerned, we have been successful in raising consciousness."
"In some countries, there have been breakthroughs; in your country, Mr President, that being Spain, the government is establishing parity between men and women."
"In the last elections to the European Parliament, we did not experience the invasion we had dreaded and expected after the ten new Member States sent observers of whom only 14% were women."
"Here, then, things really have been moving."
"European countries have performed very well in the Inter-Parliamentary Union’s assessment of participation in governments, even though women’s participation stands at only 10% in France and Italy."
"For that reason, women, and the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, are still calling for quotas, which are necessary if women are to have a share in political decision-making processes."
"To that our European anti-discrimination policy has given a great deal of impetus, even though its implementation in the Member States still leaves much to be desired."
"Our various actions against violence, such as the Daphne and STOP programmes, have highlighted the need for violence to be curtailed."
"We have afforded ample consideration to trafficking in women, thereby making it clear that we cannot accept a situation in which up to 500 000 women are smuggled into the European Union in order to be sexually exploited."
"We find it completely unacceptable that practically one woman in five in Europe should be at least once in her life, the victim of some form of violence."
"What we want is a Gender Institute to underpin our work and supply us with statistical data to help combat various forms of discrimination in even more practical and tangible ways."
"Alongside the integration of women in the labour market, the encouragement of women in time-tested ways, and gender mainstreaming as a framework policy, we want an equal opportunities programme."
"Something that we certainly want, and on which neither the Commission nor the Council have budged, is a European Year for Combating Violence, which ought to be announced in 2006."
"Nothing has happened so far; we do not even have practical proposals as to what form the Gender Institute should now take, and so this is where the Commission and the Council still have a great deal of work to do on implementation."
"Goodwill is not enough on its own; what we need is action."
"Symbolism is fine on one day – International Women’s Day; we now have 365 of them, full of work to be done."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I should like to thank those Members who have just launched this debate on the follow-up to the Beijing Platform for Action and its review ten years on."
"As you know, this issue is currently under consideration at the 49th Session of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women."
"The Presidency has already delivered a message, a robust one I hope, giving an indication of the Union’s commitment to seeing the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action implemented properly and in full."
"However, since the session is still in progress, I am not yet able to report on its results."
"Today, the European Union considers equality between women and men to be a fundamental principle and the rights of women and girls to be an inalienable, integral and indivisible part of universal human rights."
"The ‘Beijing + 10’ review comes at an important time, because it will not only enable the Union to strengthen its programme and its commitment to achieving the objectives of the Beijing Platform for Action, but will also provide an opportunity to identify the areas where progress has been made and those where concerted action needs to be further stepped up."
"The report published recently as part of ‘Beijing + 10’ on the progress made within the European Union, which was drafted by the Luxembourg Presidency, sets out clearly the major results achieved by the European Union institutions, as well as the progress made in terms of institutional mechanisms in the Member States."
"Nevertheless, in its report, the Presidency also lists the challenges that remain to be addressed, and Mrs Gröner has just cited several relating to the 12 critical areas of concern identified at the Fourth World Conference on Women, which was held in Beijing in 1995."
"As Members have said, it is important to endeavour to ascertain why obstacles still stand in the way of achieving equality between women and men and to find out how they can be overcome."
"Allow me also to refer you to the Commission’s Annual Report on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men in the European Union, which was adopted on 14 February."
"Before addressing more directly the issues raised by Members, I should like briefly to set out some of the positive initiatives taken at European Union level to promote gender equality."
"Our work to promote gender equality has been marked by three significant milestones in the last ten years: firstly, the adoption of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which created new competences relating to the principle of gender equality; secondly, the setting up of a European Employment Strategy, which has made equal opportunities an essential priority; and finally, the mainstreaming of gender-equality issues into different policy areas, in particular the process of social inclusion and the Structural Funds, by means of mechanisms such as annual work programmes or national action plans including targeted actions to promote gender equality."
"The European Union’s legislative framework on equal treatment has expanded unremittingly over the years."
"The latest development was the adoption, in December of last year, of a Council directive extending the principle of equal treatment beyond the field of employment and professional training for the first time and applying it to public goods and services."
"Nevertheless, despite the progress made on establishing equality between women and men, there is a discrepancy between equality in law and equality in real life, and there are significant disparities between women and men in many sectors, as the Presidency’s report also shows."
"Let us now take a look at the critical areas of concern identified in the Beijing Platform for Action to which you referred in your question."
"I should like to start with employment."
"The good news is that women’s employment rates have increased at a greater rate than men’s over the last ten years, but the bad news is that the difference between the two is still very high, at 17.2 %, and that the wage gap between men and women remains practically the same."
"This is worrying not only for women but also for the European economy as a whole."
"If the European Union wishes to achieve the ambitious objectives of the Lisbon strategy, it will have to meet the objective of an employment rate of 60% by 2010."
"In accordance with the European Employment Strategy, the Member States have put mechanisms in place for meeting this objective as part of their national action plans."
"The Barcelona European Council set a target for the provision of childcare services, the purpose of which was to make it easier for women to enter or return to the paid labour market."
"It is also part of the strategy to reconcile work and family life."
"Considerable progress has already been made in this respect in many Member States, even though the traditional division of childcare and paid work between women and men persists, and this in spite of the efforts made by certain Member States to implement policies seeking to encourage fathers to take parental leave."
"This year’s draft Joint Employment Report, which will be sent to the Spring European Council, also clearly shows that more concerted action is needed to increase women’s participation in the labour market, and in particular to address the pay gaps between women and men."
"With a view to responding to these concerns, the ministers responsible for gender equality policy in the 25 Member States undertook, in a declaration adopted on 4 February 2005, to develop strategies to increase the number of women in employment and in quality jobs, to guarantee and protect the rights of women workers and to remove structural, legal and psychological barriers to gender equality at work."
"The aim is also to promote policies enabling women and men to strike a balance between their professional and private lives, including their family responsibilities."
"The joint indicators identified by the European Union for the area, ‘Women and the economy’, that is the sixth critical area of concern in the Beijing Platform for Action, will make it possible to monitor progress."
"The structural indicators developed as part of the European Employment Strategy will also be extremely useful in this process."
"Violence against women: despite the considerable progress made in this area since the initial Daphne programme was launched in 1997, unfortunately further measures urgently need to be taken to prevent violence towards women and children and to combat this phenomenon."
"We hope that the present Daphne programme, which will be in force until the end of 2008, will remain an essential programming instrument to combat violence."
"The projects carried out under this programme over the years have made it possible to create many effective networks and to develop good methodologies."
"A number of presidencies have tackled this problem, the most recent initiative being the adoption of indicators drafted by the Dutch Presidency on sexual harassment in the workplace."
"In the aforementioned declaration, the ministers of the European Union responsible for gender equality policy agreed to develop preventative methods to combat gender-based violence and trafficking in human beings and to monitor their implementation."
"They also decided to intensify actions to prevent and combat all forms of trafficking in women and girls through a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary and coordinated anti-trafficking strategy."
"This strategy will include measures to address all of the factors that encourage trafficking, by strengthening existing legislation with a view to providing better protection of the rights of women and girls and to prosecuting and punishing the perpetrators through both criminal and civil measures."
"As regards your request to make 2006 the European Year against Violence towards Women, I cannot deny that such an initiative could help to raise public awareness of this issue, but, according to my information, the Commission intends to declare 2006 the ‘European Year of Mobility for Workers’."
"It has also announced that, as part of its drive to promote diversity and non-discrimination, 2007 will be the ‘European Year of Equal Opportunities’ and it would seem that 2010 is to be declared the ‘European Year of the Fight against Exclusion and Poverty’."
"You will perhaps be interested to know that the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe has recommended to the Committee of Ministers that 2006 be declared the ‘European Year against Domestic Violence’ as part of a pan-European campaign run in cooperation with the European Commission and the European Parliament, as well as with national associations and NGOs."
"Women and poverty: in the ministerial declaration of 4 February, the Member States also agreed to strengthen efforts to combat social exclusion and to remove obstacles to women’s participation in the labour market, on the basis that a good job is one of the best ways of escaping poverty."
"Although there are not yet any gender-specific indicators at European Union level for the feminisation of poverty, certain structural indicators, broken down by gender and produced as part of the processes of inclusion and social cohesion, are presented each year to the Spring European Council."
"It is nevertheless true that a great deal remains to be done and that most of the Member States’ national action plans hardly mention questions of gender equality outside the world of work."
"The issue of gender-specific indicators could be addressed in the future."
"Women and the environment: as regards the measures currently being taken by the European Union to take account of gender in its development cooperation policy, I should like to remind you that last April the European Parliament and the Council adopted a regulation on promoting gender equality in the Community’s policies, strategies and interventions in development cooperation."
"A financial framework of EUR 9 million has been agreed for the period 2004 to 2006 for the purpose of implementing this regulation."
"This follows the 1998 regulation, which recognised that actions in support of development have rarely taken proper account of the differences between the situations, roles, opportunities and priorities of men and women, and that correcting the inequalities between men and women and strengthening the role of women are vital to achieving social justice and ensuring that our development work is effective."
"May I also stress that the regulation was adopted in the context of the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations, the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women, as well as the Beijing Platform for Action and the outcome document of the special session of the General Assembly entitled, ‘Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for the twenty-first century’."
"During the 49th Session of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, the Presidency stated, on behalf of the European Union, that it recognised that gender equality and women’s empowerment were essential for sustainable development and poverty eradication."
"Girls: I have already addressed the issue of trafficking, but I should like to add that, in a recent declaration, the European Union ministers responsible for gender equality policy agreed to mainstream a gender perspective into national immigration and asylum policies, regulations and practices, as appropriate in order to promote and protect the rights of all women and girls, including by considering steps to recognise gender-related persecution and violence when assessing grounds for granting refugee status and asylum."
"I should also like to stress that in April 2004 the Council adopted a directive seeking to have residence permits issued to third-country nationals who are victims of trafficking in human beings."
"Women’s rights are human rights: before the Commission on the Status of Women, the Presidency reaffirmed, on behalf of the Member States, its view that full respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms is essential to empowering women and girls and to establishing a genuine democracy."
"This point of view should continue to prevail when the Council negotiates the forthcoming Commission proposal to establish an Agency on Fundamental Rights."
"I should also add that the European Union’s statement in New York also mentioned the need to eradicate harmful customary or traditional practices, including female genital mutilation, early and forced marriage and crimes committed in the name of honour, which are obstacles to the full enjoyment by women and girls of their human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"Women and armed conflicts: the Council has taken note of the European Parliament’s resolution recommending that women should constitute at least 40% of the staff of reconciliation, peace-keeping and conflict-prevention operations."
"Discussions have indeed been held in the European Union on the importance of having women in peace-keeping forces, and on the need to provide all of those involved with training on the particular problems faced by civilian women in conflict zones."
"Nevertheless, in the absence of approved indicators and relevant statistical data on women and armed conflicts, I am unfortunately not able to say whether the 40% quota has been respected or not."
"In their declaration of 4 February, the European Union ministers agreed to implement and encourage initiatives, policies and programmes following the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 concerning women, peace and security, which does not set quotas as such, but does recommend greater female participation."
"They also decided to act in accordance with the Council of Europe Declaration, Programme of Action and Resolution on democratisation, conflict prevention and peace-building."
"During the first week of the work of the Commission on the Status of Women, the European Union outlined its commitment to promoting the role of women in conflict prevention and resolution, peace-building and democratic processes after conflicts, as well as after natural disasters and during reconstruction."
"The European Union also stressed that it is important to ensure that the needs of women in post-disaster relief and reconstruction situations are properly understood and are addressed in programmes, and that it is also important to ensure that women have equal access to information on disaster reduction by means of formal and non-formal education, including through gender-sensitive early-warning systems."
"I should now like to conclude by thanking you for allowing me, on this International Women’s Day, to give voice to the European Union’s determination to achieve gender equality and its commitment to meeting the objectives set out in the Beijing Platform for Action and the follow-up documents from the 55th Session of the General Assembly in 2000, which have lost none of their relevance today."
"I am convinced that the European Parliament and the Commission will continue to work towards these same objectives and that by also involving civil society and the NGOs as far as possible, we will be able to take other measures to promote equality."
"Finally, I could not finish without telling you how pleased I am to see that today the Commission is going to table its proposal on the European Institute for Gender Equality, as it was invited to do by the European Council in June 2004."
"Such an institute will provide the means and the robust structure necessary to find a response at European level to issues such as the pay gap between men and women, increased access for women to the labour market, their participation in decision-making and the balance between work and family life."
", Madam Chairman, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen."
"I am pleased to have this opportunity of discussing with you, on a day we commemorate as International Women’s Day, the implementation of the Beijing Platform and the results that have been achieved."
"The celebration of this tenth anniversary is also a significant opportunity for the European Union to continue the remaining tasks."
"First, I would like to thank Mrs Gröner and the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities for this extensive and complex question."
"Thanks to the support of your committee, we have made, and continue to make, considerable progress in reconfirming the obligations of the Beijing Platform."
"I am pleased that the United Nations has reached an agreement on a political declaration in this context; it is no coincidence that the European Union has made a significant contribution to this decision."
"I would like to thank the Luxembourg Presidency, because this issue has not been easy; it has taken a lot of effort and has required the force of a united Europe."
"The European Commission played an active role in the coordination of positions for the preparation and continuation of the Beijing Platform for Action within the United Nations."
"The conference held by the Luxembourg Presidency on 2 and 3 February on the theme of ‘Beijing + 10’ presented a report on the implementation of twelve areas of the Beijing Platform for Action in the European Union, and also highlighted the shortcomings and tasks which need to be resolved."
"The report is based on indicators on which the Member States agreed."
"Your first question concerns two central problems."
"One is the participation of women in the labour market, and I would like to stress that efforts to eliminate the inequality between men and women are and will remain a fundamental prerequisite in achieving the Lisbon objectives."
"It is true that the disparities in the salaries and wages of women and men are very great and remain too great."
"The Commission will strive to ensure that European legal regulations in the field of the equality of remuneration are applied."
"Within the framework of the European Employment Strategy, it will make recommendations to Member States where the differences are relatively large."
"It is also necessary to underline the fact that the role of the social partners in this field is important and, in some respects, crucial."
"One of the European Union’s tasks that still needs to be resolved is the difficult reconciliation of family and working life."
"Therefore, in its new social agenda, the Commission proposed a communication on future developments in policies concerning the equality of women and men."
"Reconciliation remains the central issue here."
"I would also like to mention the fact that, in this respect, the review of the Working Time Directive will be highly significant."
"In the programme for the equality of women and men, projects and conferences have been funded within the framework of the Presidency, and we are now analysing the results."
"It is important to continue presenting initiatives intended to increase awareness in this field."
"We must also have the necessary data at our fingertips."
"Therefore the Commission has set up a database on women and men involved in the socio-economic and political decision-making process, which is available on the website of the Directorate-General for Employment."
"Ten years after Beijing, women remain, unfortunately, the victims of the dramatic phenomenon of trafficking in women."
"The Commission is currently preparing a communication on trafficking in human beings, in order to present possibilities for an improvement in EU policy against this crime."
"The Commission plans to publish this communication by the end of the first half of the year."
"I am well acquainted with your proposal of a European Year Against Violence Against Women."
"The Commission considers the fight against violence against women to be a matter of paramount importance, and has studied the request from the European Parliament that 2006 be declared the European Year against this form of violence."
"However, the Commission notes that 2004 was the subject of a global campaign by Amnesty International on the same theme, and therefore, while there is no doubt about the significance of the initiative brought up by Parliament, the Commission is reserved as regards the opportunity of proposing this event at a European level as early as 2006 when it took place on a global level in 2004."
"It is also important for gender issues to be incorporated into policies related to health."
"This is happening at European level via the public health programme, out of which projects for the development of strategies and for the appointment of best practice have been financed (for example, in the field of birth control among adolescent girls, family planning, and the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases)."
"Special attention is paid to HIV prevention in relation to mothers and children."
"Efforts in the field of education should continue to prevent a situation where segregation begins at school and is carried through into the world of work."
"On several occasions, the European Council and the Commission have highlighted the lesser participation of girls in subjects connected with the natural sciences and in technical subjects."
"Therefore it is important for the Council for Education to set itself the target of increasing the number of graduates of mathematical, scientific, and technical subjects by 15% by 2010 and of reducing the imbalance between men and women."
"The mainstay of the European Union’s policy for audiovisual media is Directive 97/36/EC, Television without Frontiers."
"Within the framework of the review of this Directive in 2005, the Commission will present a proposal that takes account of the rules related to human dignity, especially rules against discrimination."
"Another important instrument in the field of the media is the recent proposal of a recommendation concerning the protection of minors and human dignity and the right to reply, with regard to competitiveness in the audiovisual sphere and the European industry of information services."
"It is important for media operators to assume greater responsibility for excluding discrimination from the content of the work they produce."
"In our conditions of developmental assistance, we propose a strategy for the equality of women and men as a goal in itself, and we acknowledge the leading role of equality in developmental policies as we seek to reduce poverty and improve government, and in human rights."
"Modern society, which is based on creativity, on the ability to tap the human potential of all its members, is not capable of holding its ground if it does not make full use of the potential offered by women."
"I think that this is one of the fundamental reasons for poverty in some parts of the world."
"In the summary report on progress made by the Union and its Member States in achieving the millennium development targets, the cooperation between the platform and the millennium targets is taken into consideration."
"I would like to stress that women’s rights are fundamental human rights; the issue of the equality of men and women in the European Union goes beyond the framework of respecting a fundamental right."
"It is a special Community policy, a priority, a well-established policy established in treaties and agreements which can draw on a solid base of legal regulations."
"As you know, the Commission is preparing a proposal for an expansion in the responsibilities of the monitoring centre in Vienna to include the protection of fundamental rights, and although it is too early to express an opinion on the activities of the future agency, this agency will clearly handle the protection of the fundamental rights of both men and women."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in the previous speech it was mentioned that today the Commission will discuss the proposal to set up an institute for equal opportunities between men and women, a gender institute, and I am pleased that we have made progress in this issue."
"I think it will be a step that will reinforce the policies of equal opportunities, that will result in something I hold in high importance – a solid base, and I believe it will give us more room to take action armed with knowledge and free of prejudices."
"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you."
"Mr President, Mrs Jacobs, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this year the international day of 8 March sees the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the World Conference on Women, but do the world’s women today all view the progress announced in Beijing in the same way?"
"Beijing + 10 is a new departure today and I am especially grateful to those of you who helped to table this oral question."
"Today my thoughts are with all those women who have devoted their lives to defending the dignity of women by winning fundamental social, economic and political rights."
"Their commitment was sometimes seen as an act of transgression, a sign of a lack of femininity or even a display of exhibitionism."
"True equality of human rights, equal pay for equal work, protection for working mothers, fair career advancement and the equality of spouses in family life are matters of urgency."
"The social presence of women calls into question a society based on efficiency and productivity alone."
"Abuses against women must be strongly condemned as a matter of urgency, women and girls defended against all forms of violence that turn them into objects or commodities."
"In such conditions, before being the responsibility of women, the choice of abortion is the responsibility of the man, with the complicity of the environment in which they live."
"Being a woman and being a mother should not entail any discrimination or penalisation because the survival of humanity depends on it."
"A woman who is able to express her creative genius becomes truly revolutionary because she knows how to resolve conflicts, to make and restore peace."
"Peace is not only the absence of war; it is a state of justice, a matter of urgency that affects us all, men and women, today."
"Let us women therefore wish ourselves a happy anniversary!"
"– Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I was also fortunate enough to be part of Parliament’s delegation to the Fourth World Conference on the Beijing Platform and I should like to congratulate the Luxembourg Presidency on the firm and correct stance that it has taken."
"The United Nations Secretary-General gave warning that 201 million women are still without access to contraception and pointed out that one third of deaths during pregnancy and childbirth are caused by a lack of reproductive and sexual health services."
"Furthermore, new types of discrimination have come to light."
"When a woman has to choose between breast-feeding her child and keeping her job in management; when a woman has to choose between looking after her sick children and the risk of being sacked; when a woman finds that the people at work are more understanding if she asks to leave early in order to take the car in for a service than in order to pick up her child at the kindergarten; all of this tells you everything about the mentality of those who hold economic power and about the undervaluation of jobs traditionally allocated to women."
"I welcome the good intentions expressed here, by both the Council and the Commission, but I should like to see those words translated into action and should like to hear what practical measures the Commission and the Council are going to take to remedy this state of affairs, and I am not talking here about the situation of women in poor countries, of Muslim women, of women in a poor country in Africa or Asia at the mercy of a corrupt despot or of fanatical terrorists, where people do not live but die slowly, as we have seen – and already mentioned in this debate – with the situation of women in Turkey, with whom I should like to express my solidarity."
". Mr President, the United Nations declaration adopted in New York two days ago is an important victory for all women."
"It has reaffirmed the Beijing Platform for Action and women’s reproductive rights."
"That is something I warmly welcome."
"Nevertheless, it is not the only important issue today."
"A large number of women suffer violence at the hands of the men with whom they have or have had a relationship."
"It is said that considerable progress has been made, but in fact there has been no progress, because we have not yet realised the full extent of the problem."
"In terms of figures, we are talking about at least one-fifth of all women in the EU, with some studies currently putting the true figure as high as one-third."
"This is an epidemic in our society."
"As rapporteur on this matter, I am finalising a report in which I urge all Member States to carry out accurate studies on prevalence."
"We need correct figures on a Europe-wide scale."
"I will also propose a ‘name and fame’ list of the countries, regions and cities dealing with this issue in the right way."
"It is clear, for example, that Spain is one country doing much to change this sad state of affairs, and I take this opportunity to say"
"Finally, I want to highlight the most extreme form of violence against women."
"On our continent, women and girls are being sold like cattle."
"We all know about this."
"It is the most devastating of human rights crises, currently affecting hundreds of thousands of women in Europe alone, and it is happening right now as we commemorate International Women’s Day."
"It is modern slavery."
"Where there is demand, there will be supply."
"Consequently, from now on I will end all my speeches in this House with a phrase borrowed from a famous Roman politician: –‘I therefore maintain that prostitution must be abolished’."
". Mr President, the Beijing Platform for Action was a milestone, and the Commission’s past policies often a beacon, in terms of policy on women’s issues."
"I hope that will continue to be the case, and that the equal opportunities policy for women will not come to a standstill."
"Today, Commissioner Špidla, I have been very disappointed by what you have said; you had a lot to say about what had happened in the past, but I heard little about what you want to do in the future."
"We have waited a long time for this Gender Institute, yet you had not one word to say about the topic of gender budgeting."
"I heard nothing from you about how we are meant to do away with the wage gap, which really is a cause for concern to us, not to mention the day for the elimination of violence against women."
"The President-in-Office of the Council said it would be next year; you said that Amnesty International had already held one."
"If so, so what?"
"We heard nothing about it."
"I hope that a policy of equal opportunities will not be something just for today, but for 365 days in the year."
"I would have liked to hear more about the prospects for one; what is the Commission thinking of doing now?"
"What I heard was actually no more than empty phrases."
"As Mrs Carlshamre said a minute or two ago, the EU, too, is the scene of genital mutilations, honour killings and forced marriages."
"I call on its Member States and on the Commission to do real work to coordinate action against these things, for what I believe we have to do today is to send out a message."
"Mr President, over the years, the subordination of women, which we know exists in all areas of society, has been emphasised and debated on this day in particular."
"Each year, we have pinned great hope on all the words being translated into practical action."
"Certainly, progress has been made, but the basic patriarchal power system still exists."
"It would certainly have made it easier to follow up the Fourth World Conference on Women if the President of the Commission had appointed a Commissioner for Gender Equality."
"The significance and scope of equality issues in all political areas required a Commissioner for Equality concentrating exclusively on equality issues."
"In spite of the fact that, unfortunately, there is at present no Commissioner responsible for equality issues, I would call upon the Commission in future to prioritise the work in pursuit of gender equality to the same degree as the work involving the internal market, goods, services, industry etc."
"Part of the evidence of women’s subordination is male violence against women."
"The World Bank has estimated that violence against women is as frequent a cause of death as cancer."
"It is the cause of more ill health than malaria and road accidents combined."
"Most of us condemn such violence, but we must also get to grips with those values that facilitate the violence. We must tackle the culture that says that women must be accessible to men and that men are entitled to control women’s lives and bodies; the culture that identifies women’s bodies as goods that can be bought and sold."
"These assumptions underlie the everyday experience of many women and girls in Europe today."
"The names for that experience are traffickingand prostitution, but it can also be called sexual slavery."
"That it is able to continue to exist is due to an unholy alliance between financial profit and a sexist and racist world view."
"On behalf of women in the Member States, I also regret the neo-liberal economic policy, with its deregulation and privatisation, which makes women’s situation still more difficult where both job opportunities and access to childcare and care of the elderly are concerned."
"It is high time that the Platform for Action from Beijing were converted into practical policy."
"On the day that we have achieved these objectives, we shall hopefully be living in a society that does not need special women’s days."
"Then, every day will belong to women, men and children."
". Mr President, it is hard to know what to say about women’s issues within the one minute of speaking time available to me in this debate."
"As a woman and a doctor, however, I should like to protest most strongly in this House against the tendency to treat women as objects, to subject women to aggressive masculinisation and to use the phrase ‘reproductive health’ to refer to motherhood."
"This is clearly a phrase that should be used in relation to animals, not people."
"A woman’s dignity and mystery are revealed through her role as a mother, which need not be understood in a strictly physical sense."
"Emotionally healthy women who have not been corrupted are full of warmth."
"They are by nature emotionally sensitive, they care about other people and they are prepared to make sacrifices."
"Their vocation includes the home, the family, marriage, children and work, but it does not include a power struggle with men."
"I would especially call on feminist organisations to respect women’s dignity and femininity, which is an expression of their spiritual wealth."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what we should really be doing today is paying tribute to women and expressing our respect for them, as this is what women deserve for their efforts as mothers, wives, active members of society and active politicians."
"Now is not the time, however, to make use of the phrase ‘reproductive health’, which amounts to nothing more than thinly-disguised support for abortion."
"We are well acquainted nowadays with the consequences of abortion."
"As well as the consequences it quite clearly holds for physical health, which can include infertility, abortion also has psychological consequences, which doctors have named post-abortion syndrome."
"It is simply not the case that the Beijing Conference introduced pro-abortion provisions into international law."
"This is entirely untrue."
"The Union for Europe of the Nations Group will vote against this resolution because of its use of the phrase ‘reproductive health’, and it will make every effort to ensure that this phrase is deleted, as it is inappropriate and insults the dignity of women."
"Thank you very much, Mr President."
"Mr President, 8 March is an internationally recognised holiday, International Women’s Day."
"However, we regard this day above all as an occasion to appreciate the work of women for society."
"We appreciate women as mothers in families on Mothering Sunday."
"Sometimes, I do have the feeling that we serve simply as a reminder of certain terrible acts, such as, for example, the current violence toward women in Turkey, when violations of women’s rights have not been taken seriously even immediately around us."
"Physical violence in the family is the consequence of the inadequate work of institutions that fail to enforce the legal rights of women."
"Let us see, then, how we enforce political rights and social rights."
"Many governments, even the governments of the Member States of the European Union, and, unfortunately, I must say, even my government, have no women on them at all."
"How, then, should we see the role of women in public institutions from a European point of view?"
"Thank you."
"On the occasion of International Women’s Day, I would like warmly to greet those here, and at the same time to draw your attention to another day, not yet well-known, which is to occur on 8 April every year, and which this year falls exactly one month from now, International Roma Day."
"The UN’s 4th World Conference on Women in 1995 in Beijing first highlighted the issue of discrimination by race and sex."
"Contrary to the challenge issued in Beijing, discrimination has not been examined more deeply or in more detail either at an international or a domestic level."
"Because of this very little is also said about ethnic discrimination not affecting women and men equally."
"The Roma woman suffers greater prejudice when she is discriminated against not just on ethnic grounds but on sex grounds also."
"The Roma woman faces numerous social barriers within the European context."
"At the same time, within narrower communities the barriers of sexual discrimination hold her back."
"The Roma woman, as a member of the Roma community, is in most cases pushed to the margins of society where she must face material insecurity, social exclusion, negative discrimination, the anti-Gypsy atmosphere around her and her family, and in some cases even physical danger on a daily basis."
"Discrimination on an ethnic basis in health is banned by several European laws."
"Yet despite this, Roma women endure numerous incidents which contradict these principles."
"Separate Gypsy rooms, forced sterilisation, verbal abuse and lower standards of service are all current problems."
"Roma women live on the crossroads of sexual and ethnic prejudice, but it is not possible to reduce their problems to merely cultural or ethnic dimensions."
"They struggle with the same problems as non-Roma women who are often equally excluded and impoverished, and have worse employment opportunities than men, lower rates of pay, and consistently experience shortcomings in child-care services such as nursery care, kindergarten or schooling."
"In my opinion, one of the most important elements in our struggle for equality of opportunities for women is that we recognise, accept, increase awareness and cure the multiple discriminations burdening women who live in minorities, including Roma women."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is now ten years since the United Nations Beijing Conference, whose platform established the rights of women."
"In Beijing, it was said that women’s rights are human rights."
"There can certainly be no turning back from that position, despite the fact that the world’s more conservative countries have been attempting to do so for some years now."
"This was the case, in particular, with the United States last week during the proceedings of the UN Commission on women’s rights."
"The attempt was foiled, largely thanks to the European delegation, and in particular to the intelligent and vital work of the Luxembourg Minister, Mrs Jacob, who led our delegation and to whom I should like to express heartfelt thanks."
"There can certainly be no turning back from Beijing, but a mere statement of intent is not enough; we need to speed up the process of implementing the platform."
"One of the topics covered is that of political power, still predominantly in male hands."
"Women still represent only 15 percent of the world’s parliamentarians, and only 15 countries out of approximately 200 have achieved a level defined as the ‘critical mass of 30%’."
"When the presence of women in the institutions reaches critical mass, there is more likelihood that women’s points of view and experiences will be taken into consideration, that priority will be given to the issues important to women and that action will become possible."
"Of the 15 countries to which I referred earlier, eight are in Europe – in other words, less than one third of the 25 States making up the European Union."
"We need determination, commitment and action if these eight countries are to increase to 25 – and this is what we are requesting from the Commission and Council. Above all, we need people to be convinced that an increase in the parliamentary representation of women is beneficial to both men and women."
"Spain, with its government consisting of equal numbers of women and men, is the example to be followed."
"Spain, with its socialist Prime Minister Zapatero, has proved that democracy with equality can be achieved."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the last conference, which was held in Beijing in 1995, clearly identified a number of factors in female poverty and recognised the gender-specific dimension in the way governments deal with poverty."
"The chain of events that lead to poverty is always the same: unemployment, sickness, humiliation and then social exclusion."
"It is a vicious circle where women are more vulnerable than men."
"Indeed, they are constantly in a situation of inequality relative to men, in all areas of society."
"The number of women living below the poverty line has risen by 50% since the 1970s, while that of men has grown by 30%."
"What is behind what sociologists call the feminisation of poverty?"
"No one can deny that poverty is fertile ground for prostitution."
"Moreover, the AIDS virus spreads more quickly in environments where women are kept in a state of sexual slavery."
"Europe cannot be indifferent to all that."
"It must continue to play a shrewd and uncompromising role in ensuring that all the underlying causes of poverty are dealt with and that the most degrading of its consequences, the trafficking of women for profit in a parallel market which reduces them to nothing more than a commodity, is eliminated."
"Mr President, the status of women in society is not just a matter of whether society is just and agreeable."
"Improving the status of women is one of the most effective ways of developing society as a whole and making it more stable."
"Moreover, the position of women in the developing countries is connected with our security."
"The Central Intelligence Agency in the United States made a study of countries torn apart by genocide and violence, and discovered that a high child mortality rate is the clearest indicator that a society is caught up in a spiral of internal violence."
"A high child mortality rate is of course the connection with the status of women."
"It has also been found that terrorist groups, which we now fear so much, recruit members from areas where there are a lot of unemployed young men with no good prospects for the future."
"These young, unemployed groups form in countries with high birth rates."
"The birth rate, on the other hand, goes down when the social position of women improves, when they receive an education and information on birth control, and when they have their own means of earning a livelihood."
"With regard to development cooperation policy it therefore has to be understood that improving the status of women is one of the most effective ways of promoting development in general; not only that, but it can help to promote stability and prevent new hotbeds of conflict from springing up."
"– Mr President, women continue to be the main victims of discrimination, unemployment, violence, poverty and social exclusion and are barred from holding key positions in decision-making bodies and political authorities."
"Against this backdrop, the fact that we celebrate International Women’s Day, 8 March, a day on which we fight for women’s human rights, an integral, inalienable and indivisible part of universal human rights, continues to irk many politicians and governments. Such was the case in Turkey, when police acted with violence against a women’s demonstration – all the more appalling given that this is a country seeking membership of the EU."
"It is unacceptable that unemployment continues to rise in Member States as a result of increasingly neoliberal policies, that insecure work is spreading in the name of flexible work and competitiveness, that there continues to be salary discrimination, that the trafficking of human beings and prostitution persist and that violence is a day-to-day reality for millions of women in the EU and appropriate measures are not being taken to remedy this state of affairs."
"It is also unacceptable that health and sexual and reproductive rights, guaranteed by the Beijing Platform for Action, continue to be undermined in countries such as Portugal, where women accused of backstreet abortions have been subjected to humiliation in court cases and threatened with up to three years’ imprisonment, due to the continued existence of an unjust and iniquitous law that is tantamount to an attack on the dignity of women."
"This debate will hopefully contribute towards fresh progress in the fight for women’s rights, which is pursued in a spirit of solidarity."
"It is true that, in historical terms, not much time has passed since the first country legislated on women’s equal right to vote, which according to the history books was New Zealand in 1893, and within Europe Finland in 1906."
"From a historical perspective it is not long either since universities first opened to women."
"On the other hand, if anyone looks impartially at the proposed introduction to the text of the resolution, they can verify that while mountains of paper have been consumed, and earnest bodies have filled weeks and months formulating dozens of documents, in practice little progress has been made."
"Today’s proposed text could be a cry of despair, for times have speeded up tremendously and unfortunately there is a cynical attitude around that we do not need to change the world because it is good for at least half of society the way it is."
"The principle of equal work for equal pay, which in 1975 became a part of European law, is a good example of how a statute can be in force for 30 years, but life still goes its own way, and today again we can establish that the differences between women’s and men’s pay have not diminished."
"Indeed, in several countries this difference rather shows a tendency to increase, what the legal experts call a difference between the andstates of affairs."
"However, there is also a much more disturbing form of tolerating this situation, violence committed against women."
"It is true that in Europe rarely happen, but they do happen."
"In the countries of Central-Eastern Europe a woman dies every week as a victim of violence within the family."
"We cannot always be effective against such practices and customs, which have no place among human dignity or laws."
"Recent events in Istanbul show that institutionalised violence against women is part of life today, right on the doorstep of the European Union."
"From the resolution what emerges is that we should solve what can be solved and talk about what cannot yet be solved."
"Mr President, last Friday in New York we agreed on a declaration on the ten-year review of the Platform for Action agreed in Beijing ten years ago."
"The EU delegation — both governments and civil society — gave strong messages of commitment to further progress."
"Thanks to the great cooperation with Mrs Jacobs, the Minister, there has been some progress over this period."
"However, poverty still has a female face and violence against women is pervasive: one in four women in the world is subject to violence, a significant number of them in their own homes."
"I also take this opportunity to condemn yesterday's horrific events in Turkey."
"I condemn the violence used by the police against women involved in peaceful demonstration."
"I am also disappointed with the negotiations last week in New York."
"As a result of intense international pressure, the US Administration reluctantly accepted the internationally backed declaration because it contained the word 'abortion'."
"We in Europe have an honest and meaningful debate about those issues."
"European socialist women are ready to fight with all their energy against this conservative backlash in the US."
"This is the right time for action."
"Let us use the New York meeting to inject new energy and commitment at EU and national level: legislation, evaluation and accountability."
"In its declaration, the Luxembourg Government advocated the reinforcement of its institutional mechanisms and the integration of gender into all its actions and policies."
"Today, European socialist women have launched a pledge card with five priorities, the most important of which is more and better jobs for women."
"We cannot hope to achieve our economic and social objectives set in Lisbon without more women in work."
"This is not about women fighting for women, but about a common battle, fighting for a better EU for women."
"Mr President, in my speech I will focus just on equality and equal pay in the EU countries."
"Unfortunately, the European Union has barely made any progress in matters of equal pay."
"I cannot think of any single case in recent years in which there has been any genuine success in promoting gender equality in matters of equal pay."
"The representative of the Council spoke just now and said that the ministers responsible for equality in the EU countries are committed to the development of strategies to promote women’s employment and skills."
"It is as if we women had no skills."
"Perhaps we do not have the skill to catch up in the equal pay stakes, and that is where our skills should be developed."
"President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, now is the time to take action to prevent us from losing our credibility completely and to enable us to fulfil the promises that have been given to women, children and men."
"In ten years the EU could set itself the objective of achieving equal pay for women and men once and for all."
"Finally, I would like to say that equality is not something to reflect on just one day a year."
"International Women’s Day should not be a day on which women are humiliated by being eulogised."
"Mr President, this year, too, 8 March, which is International Women’s Day, gives us the opportunity to draw attention to the situation of women, which continues to be unjust and unworthy of them."
"Women continue to be disadvantaged and discriminated against in every area of life."
"We are still far from achieving equality of opportunity in such areas as education and careers."
"Women are often denied higher education."
"The lack of childcare opportunities often makes it impossible for women to reconcile work and family life."
"Even though the work they involve is demanding, typical women’s jobs are badly paid."
"Women are continually on the receiving end of violence and victims of sexual assaults, often committed by those close to them."
"There has recently been a renewed rise in the number of reports of honour killings and stonings."
"A State of the World Population Report study published by the UN indicates that around 5 000 girls and women, in at least fourteen countries – Pakistan and Turkey among them – are murdered in the name of honour, although the number of such killings that go unreported is much higher."
"In areas hit by crisis and war, in refugee camps and everywhere where public order has broken down, conditions are often catastrophic."
"Around the world, 150 million women and girls suffer genital mutilation; it is estimated that at least 24 000 of them live in Germany alone."
"In South Africa, a woman is shot dead by her partner or ex-partner every six hours."
"I protest against the violence meted out by the police to the women who demonstrated in Istanbul at the weekend."
"We all have to do much more for women’s rights."
"I call on the governments to implement women’s rights and make them a reality once and for all."
"There is an urgent need for women’s quality of life to be improved. Women must be accorded the same rights as men."
"There must be no violence against them!"
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the issues we are debating today are not new, nor are they being heard for the first time."
"The European Parliament is rich in debates and resolutions referring to the participation of women in economic and public life and to particular problems and discrimination which they face in their lives."
"However, it is particularly important that we are debating them again today, 8 March, on International Women's Day because, in this way, we all – men and women – have a greater realisation that these problems are centuries old and cut across the ages and remain unresolved and topical."
"They also have a global character, in that they relate to every society in every country."
"This year, 8 March also coincides with the tenth anniversary of the Beijing conference and the adoption of the platform on a strategy to combat these problems."
"It is a good opportunity, therefore, to review and evaluate the work which has been done and its results."
"As European men and women, we have a heightened awareness of this global endeavour, because our historical experience convinces us that combating women's problems and achieving real equality are necessary prerequisites to growth, the quality of democracy and peace."
"What I would like to emphasise today is that we need to remain faithful to the global nature of this platform, by which I mean to the monitoring of the twelve crucial sectors which interact: efforts on employment, education, health, combating violence and participation in political life are directly connected."
"At the same time, however, we also need to monitor developments taking place around us and to adjust our policies to the new reality circumstances – social, demographic and technological – because only thus shall we be able to express women's real aspirations and make our policies effective."
"Mr President, there can be no doubt that, since the approval of the Beijing Platform for Action, there has been considerable progress with regard to women's rights, laws have been changed, equality policies have been created and feminist discourse is increasingly being assimilated by society."
"But it is also the case, unfortunately, that the reality in many fields is still a long way from matching what is laid down in our laws and what we have stated in our declarations."
"Furthermore, ladies and gentlemen, as we have seen in recent days in New York, if we had not been careful, the progress we have worked so hard to make could have been reversed through the negative influence of ultra-conservative forces and religious fundamentalism, particularly with regard to human rights and the sexual and reproductive rights of women."
"Fortunately, the final declaration of Beijing + 10 reaffirms the Beijing Platform for Action in full."
"This achievement has undoubtedly also been a success for those people who have negotiated on behalf of the European Union, and I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the good work of the Luxembourg Presidency."
"Simply ensuring that we do not move backwards is no great achievement, however."
"It is urgent that we make much faster progress in the direction we have set."
"We have the tools; all we need is political will and the European Union must lead this progress."
"Commissioner, Minister, our framework strategy on equality between men and women and the associated programme ends this year."
"I would like to insist that, without a new framework strategy, it will be much more difficult for us to move forward."
"We must also urge our Member States to adopt new measures in the fields that fall within their competence."
"In this regard, I would like to mention today in particular the 53 measures approved last Friday by my country’s – Spain’s - Socialist government, aimed at promoting equality between men and women."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me, on this World Women’s Day, take up the issue of violence against women, which, everywhere, is on the increase."
"The rise in the incidence of crimes against women, particularly the trafficking of them and forced prostitution, has risen so much in recent years."
"Let me say, while I am on this subject, how profoundly shocked I am by recent events in Turkey, with women being brutally beaten up for demonstrating peacefully to draw attention to their concerns."
"Let us turn from Turkey to Germany."
"A young Turkish woman in Berlin, who had left her husband, was executed by her brothers on the open street with a shot to the head."
"Her brothers seek to justify this brutal murder by reference to their family’s honour."
"This honour killing was the sixth in four months in Germany."
"Where is the outrage against these murders?"
"Why is society not more up in arms about them?"
"Violence against women goes on everywhere, even in families."
"It is estimated that one woman in five is the victim of violence at least once in her life."
"Such a state of affairs is intolerable."
"Violence against women must at last find its way onto the political agenda, and not just on World Women’s Day."
"Women who have been mistreated must not be shamed out of going public and drawing attention to their situation."
"It is because they are victims, and have not committed any crime, that I am in favour of 2006 being declared the Year against Violence against Women, which is what the joint resolution on World Women’s Day calls for."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 10 years after the Beijing conference, reality continues to be implacable for millions of women in the European Union."
"Unemployment is three percentage points higher for women than for men; 33% of women are forced to work part time compared with 6% of men."
"Pay differentials vary from 6 to 30% for the same work."
"One woman in five in the EU is a victim of domestic violence, which is a serious human rights violation and one that must now be brought into the public domain."
"The recorded number of prostitutes has increased 10 fold in 20 years and 90% of them suffer violence at the hands of their pimps and their clients."
"Commissioner, it would seem to be a matter of urgent necessity to set in motion aggressive policies to provide information on rights and to enforce existing laws in the Member States as well as to implement an effective policy of controls and penalties, because it is not enough to set ambitious targets and then see nothing change over 10, 20 or 30 years."
"It is not enough – and this applies to us here – to salve our consciences one day a year and then despise women the rest of the time."
"The enlarged, reunified Europe, the land of freedom, the land of human rights, has the duty to comply with its future Constitution."
"Mr President, we are marking this day, 8 March, this year with the continuing follow-up to the Beijing Platform, following the meeting in New York."
"But we feel positive and also ambitious and, therefore, we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats want actions to deal with the problem of inequality of opportunities for women, in work, for example."
"We want a European Union that supports women effectively, that encourages the Member States to make working hours more flexible and to provide equal pay for equal work, we want parental leave to be enjoyed according to the choice of the parents, we want measures such as the current assistance Spain gives for children to be extended and become the general rule, and we want to promote the construction of nurseries, with deductions for companies, and greater benefits to be received by companies that act responsibly from the point of view of families."
"We are distressed and appalled by violence against women, prostitution, trafficking in women and people-trafficking in general."
"We believe it to be morally unacceptable and socially shameful."
"The rights of women are human rights."
"We are in favour of the development of States and we recognise the progress being made."
"We believe that such regrettable scenes as those in Istanbul in recent days should be condemned."
"The woman is the basis of the family and any affront to women is a direct affront to the family, the basis of our society."
"Mr President, I wish to congratulate all women today on International Women’s Day by sending them greetings from Sweden’s Social Democrats who, in 2001, became a feminist party."
"I hope that, during my time here in the European Parliament, I shall also see Parliament become feminist, whereupon there will be a requirement for every other Member of this House to be a woman, for male violence against women to be higher on the agenda and for its no longer to be possible for men to buy women for money through the agency of prostitution; in other words, there will be a law prohibiting the purchase of sex in EU countries, as there is in Sweden."
"Full employment and cooperation on a national basis will be required, together with developed child care and care for the elderly."
"Paid parental insurance is necessary if women are to be able to work and fathers of small children are to be able to share responsibility for family and home."
"Gender equality demands unity of purpose on the part of women and men."
"Mr President, it is ten years since I was in Beijing representing the Irish Government as a Minister of State and I am happy to be here today to reaffirm the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action."
"Yes, gender equality is one of the major values the EU stands for and it would be very helpful, in selling the new Constitutional Treaty, if we stressed that it is reinforced in the Treaty."
"Huge differences also exist between the theory, or the rhetoric, and practice on the ground in relation to women's equality, the and situations."
"We must ensure, however, that we bring men, particularly young men, into this debate."
"Their role models might have dominated women and not understood the concept of equality and so might not have been of the type we want our sons to become today."
"We are talking equality and not dominance here."
"They might have been brought up in religious fundamentalism and other cultures, where there was serious oppression of women and physical and sexual violence against women."
"This is about choice."
"Since we have been able to control our fertility, women can now choose to have one child, no children or ten children."
"This is all about ensuring that women have the freedom to choose."
"That is what the debate must be about."
"But we must structure society so that, if women wish to become mothers, they can actually do that and bring up their children without economic pressures that drive them out of the house when the baby is six weeks old."
"We must structure society and family life today in such a way that it allows women to have a second child."
"The pressures on young women today in my country, for all its economic success, are such that they cannot afford a second child."
"They cannot afford not to work; they need the two salaries to pay the mortgage."
"They cannot afford childcare or care for elderly parents."
"The traditional roles of women in childcare and care for the elderly are all part of this wider debate and it is not possible to do justice to the subject in two minutes."
"Mothers cannot be fathers and fathers cannot be mothers."
"Ideally our children should have both."
"That will not always be possible, but let us have a broader and balanced debate and restore choice for women."
"Then they can be properly liberated."
"Mr President, today is about applying Beijing + 10 to the European Union, of which Turkey is not yet, however, a member."
"As rapporteur for women’s rights in Turkey, I can say that, on paper, the situation of women’s rights is comparable to that of the European Member States, although practice leaves a great deal to be desired."
"Violence perpetrated against women, and the relative lack of participation by them in the labour market, in education and in politics, are still major areas of concern in which change is possible only if women acquire the right to be able to speak out and to demonstrate."
"The sixth of March in Istanbul, when a demonstration to mark women’s day was broken up brutally, illustrated how important it is still to have 8 March as International Women’s Day."
"If Turkey wants to be a modern democracy and to join the EU, it should prove that it can handle protests as an adult democracy."
"The European Union has an important role to play in this too, in that it must show that it will give the situation of women’s rights a prominent place on the negotiating agenda, closely monitor progress, and take immediate action in the event of violations."
"Exceptionally, I am not addressing you, Mr President, but the women who are listening to us."
"If European policy is moving further and further away from the citizen, that is not true for women’s rights."
"Women are here and are placing hopes in us that we cannot disappoint."
"Today I am proud of the European Union and proud of its opposition to the United States’ amendment, when it tried to restrict the right to abortion at the UN last week."
"My thoughts go particularly to Simone Veil, who was president of this Parliament and who gave France a law allowing the voluntary termination of pregnancy."
"Thank you, Madam, for your courage because you had a lot of mud thrown at you."
"Today there are people who march through the streets shouting about your law: ‘Thirty years is enough’."
"For all the women who have known the distress of an unwanted pregnancy I say: 30 years is too little, because abortion is becoming taboo again!"
"Thank you, Madam."
"All of us women together, whatever our political parties and convictions, will continue your battle to drive back fundamentalism."
"And I will say to Mr Libicki, who was worried about post-abortion depression, that he should look at post-natal depression."
"That is the advice of a woman and a psychologist!"
"Although as President I consider your comments wholly pertinent, I will hand over to Mrs Batzeli, who is the last person scheduled to speak."
"– Mr President, the European Union, living in the constellation of the Lisbon strategy, has set high objectives for increasing the employment rate among women and improving their position in society, a policy which must be implemented directly."
"However, what comes first for the European Union is also to help third countries – developing countries – reach a level which will allow women to be treated with dignity."
"Development aid and development cooperation must be evaluated and based on issues such as:"
"First, safeguarding women's rights as the core of human rights in a country."
"Secondly, promoting special economic and social incentives for integration into the job market, effective dissuasive actions so that women's lives are not downgraded, wiping out violence, as occurred in Turkey over the last few days, and the participation of women with quotas in political parties and central and local government."
"The intention to provide justice, an extended education, culture and equality are everyday acts, not just the subject of International Women's Day."
"I would like to begin by thanking all those who have spoken this morning and also the Chairman and members of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality who were present in New York for their efforts and their support for the Presidency."
"I would also like to thank the Commission for its support."
"As I have already exceeded my allotted time a little while ago, I will be very brief."
"So far as equal pay is concerned, we need more good examples that we can exchange."
"We also need indicators to measure both progress and lost ground."
"Poverty and social inclusion must remain one of the pillars of the Lisbon strategy in the same way as equality between men and women."
"I am in complete agreement with the European Parliament’s very committed fight against violence against women and children and, of course, the fight against human trafficking."
"I think we have an obligation to keep both men and boys better informed and educated if we want the differences between men and women to be respected."
"In my opinion, we will only really be able to respect human rights if we agree to consider and respect each other just as we are."
", Thank you for the debate, I think it was very profound."
"The fundamental fact remains that the European Union considers equal opportunities between men and women, and equality between men and women, to be one of the key political values that it upholds."
"We have made considerable headway in this field, but we cannot afford to stop now."
"The legislative base is relatively solid."
"This does not mean it cannot be developed further, but the key problem can actually be found in insufficient implementation."
"This is a matter we must focus on."
"It is quite clear that at one end of the scale of disparity between the pay of men and women, there are countries where this gap is 6%, while at the other end of the scale there are countries where the difference is 27%."
"These are absolutely unwarranted disparities, and it is up to us to make the corresponding effort to combat this situation."
"It is absolutely clear that special issues are violence against women and trafficking in human beings."
"The group of Commissioners for human rights considers this issue to be one of its most fundamental tasks, and I expect that we will be able to make progress in this respect."
"It is a palpable matter, a challenge for us, and there is no time to lose."
"Several times in the discussion the brutal intervention by the police against demonstrators in Istanbul, Turkey, has been mentioned."
"The European Commission responded immediately; it rejected the use of undue coercion, and I noted with a certain satisfaction (although we must reserve judgment at this point in time) that the Turkish side decided to launch an investigation into this action."
"I believe that this is an important illustration of how influential the European Union is, and that it is an important example of a case where our efforts have helped the position of women in a context broader than the confines of Europe."
"There can be no doubting the fact that mainstreaming remains a key issue, and it must be applied thoroughly; it is also clearly correct to continue a policy of developing the concept of gender budgeting, which, while still in its infancy, has already made gratifying advances in certain countries."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the role of women in the success of the European project in general, and for the success of the Lisbon Strategy in particular, is indispensable."
"I have clearly spoken about the fact that a society which does not make full use of the potential of all its members is unable to hold its ground in the face of global competition, so let us go back to my opening words, that is, the issue of equality is a profound matter and we must strive for this equality even if we were not to derive any secondary, perhaps economic, benefit from it."
"The establishment of a new institution will ensure transparency and will also provide professional answers to a whole number of questions which have been asked but which have not yet been adequately resolved."
"It will also evaluate and assess the techniques and procedures we have chosen that have often resulted in a certain progress but which have not provided a complete climax."
"The situation of women on the labour market has been debated. There is no doubt that the proportion of women actively involved in the labour market has increased during the monitoring of the Lisbon Strategy."
"On the other hand, it is also evident that the total proportion is insufficient for us to achieve the Lisbon objectives."
"Ladies and gentlemen, equality between men and women is a concept; it is a political concept, a concept of values."
"It is a concept which has been observed for decades; International Women’s Day did not start ten years ago, it did not start today."
"It is part of the conscious efforts by people to achieve a certain value that we consider to be profound and self-evident."
"These efforts must not end, we can never be satisfied with the progress we have made, because as the world changes the problems will change, and we will be faced with new challenges."
"One of them is the demographic ageing of society, another is the balance between family life and working life, yet another, mentioned by several others here, is a deeper understanding on the part of our men within the framework of ordinary social customs."
"There has also been a debate on a European Day Against Violence Against Women."
"Again, I stress that violence against any human being is repulsive and it is the obligation of the European project and the European Union to seek out effective ways of preventing such violence."
"Violence against women is violence which truly exists on an enormous scale in our society, and we cannot remain indifferent; we must use all means available to us."
"One issue in the debate was whether it was more effective to declare a European Year Against Violence in 2006, considering that 2004 was a global year against violence, or to declare it at a time which is still open to discussion and which would ensure it carried greater weight and greater conclusiveness."
"This is the question; the point is not violence as such, because, as I have said, this is one of the key agendas which has been adopted by the current Commission and which it believes to be important, and which, I hope, we can fulfil as we strive to make progress."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to return to 8 March once more."
"This day highlights the decades of efforts which, in the face of difficulty, have resulted in progress at least in some areas of the world, in fact I am sure that in all areas of the world, but by different means."
"It is a symbol of the efforts we are now making and which we will experience in the future, because it is a symbol of the effort to achieve an ideal, and an ideal is always very difficult to achieve."
"We can but do our best to come closer to the ideal, and this Commission has five years to take action, which must be quantifiable."
"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"In accordance with Rule 108 of the Rules of Procedure, I have received six proposals for resolutions(1) in conclusion of this debate."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday."
"The next item is the report (A6-0035/2005) by Mrs Figueiredo, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the social situation in the European Union."
". – Mr President, the time has come to pay closer attention to the social impact of the reduction in economic growth of more than 50% in the last three years and to the enlargement of the EU."
"The social situation, as we know, is deteriorating, and worrying signs are already coming to light, notably the fact that 20 million people are unemployed and around 70 million people are subsisting below the poverty line, and these problems particularly affect women, the elderly and children."
"Unemployment, which averages around 9% - although that figure rises to 10% among women and more than 18% among young people – is particularly rife in Poland, where the unemployment rate is pushing 19%, with Slovakia, Lithuania and Spain not far behind."
"In other countries, however, such as Portugal, there are regions in which the unemployment rate is very high due to growing de-industrialisation, to the relocation of multinationals and to the privatisation of public sectors and services."
"At the same time, existing employment is increasingly insecure and women are the main victims of that insecurity."
"On average in the EU, only one in three permanent full-time jobs is held by a woman, and it is women who continue to suffer from direct and indirect wage discrimination, with wage differences ranging from 16% to 30% on average, and even higher in some countries."
"It is clear from these figures that the strategies for creating more quality jobs accompanied by workers’ rights are falling short of what is required, because, in the name of competitiveness, emphasis has been placed on the neoliberal doctrine, on the European Central Bank, on the irrational implementation of the criteria for nominal convergence of the Stability and Growth Pact, on accelerating liberalisations and privatisations and on the flexibility and deregulation of work."
"It is therefore essential that we scrap the Stability Pact and replace it with a genuine development and employment pact that gives priority to creating more quality jobs accompanied by workers’ rights, a pact that commits us to a root and branch revision of the Lisbon Strategy, thereby eliminating the liberalisation and deregulation of work and placing all of the emphasis on jobs with rights and social inclusion."
"In order to achieve the 70% employment target set in Lisbon, 22 million more jobs will have to be created."
"Otherwise, instead of progressing towards economic, social and territorial cohesion, inequality will deepen, be it inequality between countries or inequality between different sections of the population."
"At the moment, indeed, the average per capita income in various Member States is below 51% of the Community average, whereas in 10 countries the figure is over 100% of the EU average."
"Furthermore, 20% of the population with the highest income was almost five times better off than the 20% with the lowest income, although this indicator varied from 3% in Denmark to 6.5% in Portugal and the situation has worsened in recent years."
"Such inequality must not be allowed to continue, when 15% of the EU population is at risk of poverty, a figure that in some countries rises to 20% or more, as in Portugal, Greece and Ireland."
"Welfare and social security benefits are vital to reduce the risk of poverty."
"Without social transfers, including pensions and other forms of support, the risk of poverty would affect, on average, 30% of the population in Finland, 37% in Portugal, 40% in France and the United Kingdom and 42% in Italy."
"With the rise in unemployment in recent years and benefit cuts in some Member States, poverty and social exclusion are now in reality probably even more widespread than these statistics suggest. This points to the need to place emphasis on social inclusion within the Community’s various policies, especially monetary policy and internal market policy, with a view to defending the concept of high-quality public services."
"The Commission must therefore withdraw its proposal for a directive on the completion of the internal market in services and must not push through new regulations on the organisation of working time."
"Measures must be put in place aimed at restricting company mergers and multinational relocations, at supporting productive sectors and micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, at combating existing discrimination, at promoting equality and participatory democracy and at reducing working hours without loss of earnings, in order to facilitate the creation of more jobs, to reconcile work with family life and to provide lifelong training and education."
"The new social policy agenda must not be a mere collection of words and statements without practical content."
"I therefore hope that there will be a debate in this House on these issues."
"I should like to thank those people who helped me to draw up this report, which will hopefully be adopted without the amendments contained in certain proposals tabled by members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and by the liberals. This is because what we need is more jobs and greater social inclusion, so that, when the EU speaks about economic and social cohesion, it will not simply be uttering words but will actually be taking steps towards greater well-being for all."
", Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Figueiredo, and the members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for this report on the social situation in the European Union."
"During the debates with Members of the European Parliament in the preparation of the new social agenda, which was adopted by the Commission on 9 February, I emphasised the significance of your bill."
"I am using my participation in today’s session to remind us that the preparation of this standpoint, including the debate held by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs with representatives of social partners and civil society, has helped create a new social agenda."
"Parliament’s position offers a cohesive overview of the set of problems in this field, of which there are many."
"Unemployment, uncertainty, poverty, inequality, discrimination."
"These are genuine, specific problems which cause grave suffering to our citizens."
"They have the legitimate expectation that the European Union will tackle these problems and help to find appropriate solutions."
"In addition to this, there are issues such as the impacts of globalisation, economic restructuring, demographic upheaval, and greater diversity in the European Union as a result of the latest wave of enlargement."
"The European Parliament asks that the Commission draw up and publish studies and indicators focusing on all these main tasks and their mutual effects."
"I would like to point out that the Commission regularly publishes analyses and statistics in its political documents, and especially in regular reports, covering issues such as the social situation in Europe, employment in Europe, and industrial relations in Europe."
"These are documents which always arouse keen interest among journalists and entities involved in social issues."
"I can confirm that I fully intend to continue this approach."
"These reports provide a very good cohesive overview of social problems, offer a summary of statistics, and present detailed analyses concentrating on specific themes such as the protection of health, the quality of work, restructuring, discrimination and equality."
". Many thanks, Mr President, Commissioner."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has an extremely negative opinion of the report we are debating today."
"We believe that from the outset this report relied too heavily on an ideological approach to social problems in the European Union."
"At the same time, it ignores a number of key practical aspects relating to the real social situation in the European Union and the real problems we face."
"It would perhaps be best if I focus just on two issues to which I should like to draw the attention of the House."
"Firstly, I come from a post-Communist country that for over 50 years enjoyed ‘blessings’ such as a planned economy, the abolition of private property rights and restrictions on competition."
"I can therefore state quite categorically that the rapporteur has failed to make any allowance in her assessments for the significant influence of Communist regimes on the social situation in the new Member States."
"Our past experiences lead us to believe that the European Union should not place excessive restrictions on the freedom to pursue economic activities."
"The critical assessments in the report are used as a basis to put forward proposals to increase the administrative burden on entrepreneurs, as well as to widen the tax base and create new employment pacts, yet new pacts and new legislative solutions are not what we need."
"Any debate we hold on unemployment should also focus on employers, as the only effective way to create new jobs is to make it possible for them to pursue their activities."
"This would then solve the problem of unemployment in an extremely practical manner."
"We will not create new jobs by imposing additional administrative burdens on entrepreneurs, raising taxes and placing restrictions on competition."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has therefore tabled a great many amendments."
"We would stress that in order for the group to vote in favour of the report, the very least that would be necessary would be for all the amendments to be adopted."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on this women’s day the long debate we have just had on the situation of women would not be out of place in this debate on the social situation in Europe, because the questions are very much related and women are often the first victims of a much more general situation."
"The social situation in the European Union in 2004, which we are looking at today and which is the subject of the report we have before us, is alarming."
"Mass unemployment, social inequalities, instability and insecurity have grown over the last 20 years."
"Although social development and the fight against poverty are the common objectives of the Member States, we are obliged to note that the laws of the market are today working against the interests of individuals and that more than 70 million European citizens are today at great risk of poverty and insecurity."
"The question we have to answer is a simple one: are we going to promote social equality and development equality, or are we going to allow free competition to make the social situation in Europe even worse?"
"We must answer that question by adopting a social agenda that takes concrete measures to deal with the problem."
"I do not have the time to go into details, but I would like to suggest at least two priorities: we must move towards an upward harmonisation of social situations and not use directives to introduce social dumping; we need a sharing of wealth that allows solidarity, not competition between poor regions and rich ones."
". Mr President, Commissioner, the ALDE Group would like to thank Mrs Figueiredo for all the work she did to produce such a comprehensive report and, in particular, for her willingness to compromise in committee."
"There is a great deal that we can support in the resolution, especially concerning lifelong learning, SMEs, corporate social responsibility, disadvantaged regions and the fight against discrimination."
"However, we have some serious concerns, more specifically with regard to paragraph 1, paragraph 5, indent 5, and recital E. Meeting these concerns is crucial to our decision on the final vote."
"We have two difficulties with paragraph 1."
"Firstly, we appreciate the need for adjustments to be made to financial and economic policies over time, but the use of ‘revision’ implies a fundamental departure from them, as Mrs Figueiredo effectively acknowledges in her speech."
"Secondly, the paragraph is too diffuse."
"We prefer the emphasis that our own amendment places on how the Lisbon Strategy should address deficiencies in the current social situation."
"In the other two cases, our concern is not with the whole content of the indent or recital involved, but with infelicitous phrases found there."
"Those are covered by appropriate amendments or requests for split votes."
"This is true for various other improvements that we would prefer to see made to the text."
"Finally, on recital M, there have been some translation problems. We would specify that this must be understood as asking only for Member States to consider introducing the concept of a minimum income as the basis of social protection when they do not currently have such a system."
"It is not an attempt to move toward some kind of Europe-wide minimum wage."
"Mr President, Mrs Figueiredo deserves a great deal of congratulation for putting together a very large number of arguments and writing a densely-packed report."
"After listening to the constant talk about competition, economic growth, the free movement of capital, services and goods and so on, it does one good to see Europe, of whose being the ‘Christian West’ we hear so much, setting limits to neo-capitalism and focusing attention on our fellow-creatures, our environment and those who will come after us."
"We cannot be indifferent to the fact that, in a Europe that is generally rich, one person in seven faces the threat of poverty."
"We cannot keep on increasing working times – expressed in weeks or over a lifetime – when we know that some 20 million people, most of them women, are out of work in the EU."
"There should be more solidarity expressed in the way we share out work and wages."
"We surely cannot look away when conglomerates, often having received subsidies for their businesses, simply move them to where they can make the greatest profits and where they find the most propitious conditions in terms of wages, taxes, social security contributions, mandatory environmental requirements, controls and so on."
"Businesses also bear social responsibilities."
"Social peace is dependent upon justice."
"Solidarity is the best network for combating poverty and counteracting social exclusion."
"Social security contributions are often akin to a handout, a humiliation for the recipients, particularly when they are in need through no fault of their own."
"I hope that a broad majority in the House will support this report and that the Council and the Commission will take up as many as possible of the issues it raises, for we cannot sit idly by while the few rich people in Europe get even richer and the number of poor people rises."
"What is needed is a push in a different direction, and the one this report will give will be a big one, and in the right direction."
"I would also like to thank Commissioner Špidla for his understanding of social policy issues and for his commitment."
". My group wholeheartedly endorses this report."
"In the European Union at present, 68 million people are living in poverty and excluded from society, a state into which the unemployed, lone parents, and migrants are at particularly high risk of falling."
"It is therefore not surprising that children from such households are at particularly high risk of falling into poverty as well."
"In Germany alone, which is considered a rich country by EU standards, the number of children living in poverty is said by Unicef to have risen to 1.5 million."
"There are three key factors that determine the proportion of poor children in rich countries: social policy, social trends and the way in which the labour market develops."
"So it is that falling wages for the bottom 10% of the income scale has reduced family incomes in Germany by 23%."
"Let me then, again call for this report to be adopted, and for the Council meeting in March to devote all its energies to the social situation in Europe."
"Mr President, the social situation is dependent on employment."
"There is a certain difference in outlook between Mrs Figueiredo's report and the Barroso Commission."
"The report, if adopted, would lead to further initiatives and pressure to press on with the Lisbon agenda."
"The Commission seems to be heading the other way, towards a freer structure."
"Recently it proposed that 80% of resources be managed in a decentralised way."
"If competencies were indeed to be restored to the nation state, the UK Independence Party might be persuaded to support the Commission."
"This is because the UK was drawn into what was then the EC on the promise that it was not leading to a federal state, but that it was simply about trade."
"If only that were so."
"One thing is certain: the UK has half the average unemployment rate of the EU as a whole."
"Along with Sweden and Denmark we have the lowest levels of unemployment."
"Governments do not produce that."
"They simply make the conditions right for employment to flourish."
"The single most important factor is the common currency."
"Sweden, Denmark and the UK have not adopted the single currency, so they are not saddled with a single interest rate."
"Even in the UK there is a disparity of economies."
"The Bank of England cannot set an interest rate suitable for the whole country."
"How then can the European Central Bank set a common interest rate suitable for a Europe with widely varying economies arising from such great geographical diversity and widely differing ways of life?"
"Along with my colleagues, I shall vote against this report."
"Mr President, I too would like to thank Mrs Figueiredo for her work on this report."
"I agree with the general content and can support it."
"When we speak about a social Europe, the most important aspect of that is our responsibility to those who are most vulnerable within our society."
"In particular we must protect those suffering from handicap, from disability, from a lack of advantage."
"The European Union has proven in the past that it can be a force for good by creating equality and providing greater social protection and standing for those most in need."
"However, this is not, nor should it be, a one-size-fits-all policy."
"There is no one single method that has been proven to work in any one area."
"It is a combination of what is best from each of the ideologies, each of the methods, to achieve the greatest success."
"So I would caution people against restricting the amount of investment that private industry and business put into creating new jobs, new employment opportunities."
"I would also call on Members to ensure that they do not unnecessarily harness negative taxation policies that restrict the room for movement of governments and, most importantly of all, to ensure that we invest in the future of our people through education and life-long learning."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Figueiredo for her report, which is both extremely interesting and much-needed."
"As a Pole, I should also like to thank her for the thorough consideration given in the report to the situation in the new Member States."
"The motion for a resolution raises a number of important issues, but the problem I should like to highlight is that of poverty."
"This is discussed towards the end of the report, but data on the new Member States is lacking."
"It should be noted that those who lose their jobs in Poland are not entitled to long-term unemployment benefits, no matter how low, and that the lowest rate of welfare benefits is around EUR 60 per person per month."
"I propose that a minimum welfare benefit be introduced for EU citizens, which could for example be equivalent to half the highest rate of benefits paid in an EU Member State."
"Even if this only amounted to EUR 250 per month, it would provide our citizens with a basic feeling of security, and encourage them to lead a more active life."
"I thank you."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report before us on the social situation in Europe is a glaring distortion of reality."
"I therefore feel it is an unbalanced report."
"The text focuses on all of the negative aspects, which we acknowledge still exist, such as social exclusion, unemployment and the existence of pockets of poverty, yet chooses to ignore all of the aspects highlighted by the Commission. In those areas in which the Commission highlights positive aspects, progress has been made in the social situation in Europe."
"I shall now cite five omissions that I consider very serious; firstly, the report leaves out the fact that during the past decade progress has been made on employment, output growth and cohesion in most of the 25 Member States; secondly, it deliberately ignores the fact that, according to the Commission, the social problems in eight of the ten new Member States are mainly due to the totalitarian regimes that were previously in power; thirdly, there is not a single word on the opportunities available to the new Member States following accession to the EU; fourthly, the report disregards all of the complexity arising from the phenomenon of globalisation; and fifthly the report emphasises an outlook – an erroneous one in our view – that economic dynamism is the enemy of social development."
"We take the opposite view, namely that economic dynamism, price stability and cost reduction are not enemies but allies of the development of the European social model."
"To sum up, the report before us offers a highly simplistic view of European social reality, with smatterings of a certain demagogy."
"Symptomatic of the ideological influence pervading the report, moreover, is the fact that nowhere does it mention the proven superiority of the social market economy over planned economic models."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to take this opportunity to underline the importance of the European social model, which is under threat from the Working Hours Directive or the Directive on Services, while the problems of poverty, social exclusion and quality of life are even more acute today in a Europe of 25."
"A European Union of 25 Member States obviously shows greater economic and social disparities than when there were only 15."
"That is why it is even more important now than it was then to promote real social cohesion on our continent."
"To defend a European social model that would bear witness to a Europe of excellence is not to defend the ."
"On the contrary, we must take advantage of enlargement to reaffirm social and employment policies that can characterise the European Union and also serve as an example to other regions of the world."
"What would greater competitiveness mean without a just social policy?"
"What would greater growth mean if it did not benefit the largest number?"
"The answer is obvious: everyone knows that policies that encourage social cohesion are determining factors in economic dynamism."
"On the forthcoming 22 and 23 March, the Heads of Government will be taking a crucial decision for the future of Europe when they adopt a strategy that will set the economic development agenda for five years."
"They cannot be unaware that a winning economic perspective must include high social standards, because these are also essential to a Europe of nations."
"Mr President, the Figueiredo report relates to a matter of supreme importance, namely the social situation in the European Union."
"I should like to highlight four issues."
"Firstly, paragraph 18 refers to solidarity with the new Member States."
"I believe the concept of solidarity should appear in the opening lines of the report, as it is one of the fundamental concepts upon which the European Union is based."
"Secondly, paragraph 22 refers to the European social model, and I believe that this should also have been given greater weight."
"It is not enough to preserve and consolidate this model."
"It should also be adapted to the needs of today and the anticipated needs of tomorrow."
"Thirdly, the report notes, and rightly so, that too little attention has been paid to social aspects in the Lisbon strategy."
"Finally, paragraph 4 states that social and integration policies are central to citizens’ rights and also to economic development, which is entirely correct."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, social cohesion can be said to have been successfully achieved when there is no section of society left to be simply written off."
"This applies in particular to older workers, particularly to the women among them."
"No longer must it be tolerated that, as has happened in Germany, the head of the state employment service can get away with calling for jobcentres to stop providing services for older workers in East Germany."
"No longer must it be tolerated that thousands of unemployed people aged over 55 are simply, and officially, kicked out of society and their experiences of life and work consigned to the rubbish dump."
"Any successful economy must build on the knowledge, and particularly the experience, of older people, and is in fact dependent on them if we are not to fall into the demographic trap."
"It so happens that, although this was the line endorsed by the Commission in its communication at the beginning of this year, now, at the time of the mid-term review of Lisbon, nothing more is being said about real support for older workers."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European social model has not developed out of nowhere nor is it the result of pure chance, but is, in fact, based on our economic history."
"This model was made possible by a social and market economy whose economic basis was productivity and efficiency, and therefore a successful system of small and medium-sized enterprises, which we must strive to re-invigorate."
"The tragedy of unemployment will not be overcome with demagogy or with hollow and politically correct rhetoric in support of the world’s poor and underprivileged."
"If we have imported people unable to play a role in our economic development because they lack the necessary skills, then we have committed a serious political error and should admit it."
"Otherwise, the excessive presence of immigrants in Europe, with no prospect of finding work, will provoke a war among the deprived population and will fuel racism, created by those who supported this type of immigration."
"We should reflect before talking about immigrants’ rights to work while ignoring our own unemployed."
"Mr President, I will begin by saying that, in innumerable areas, the report contains congenial positions, and there is no doubt that it is incredibly well intentioned."
"However, the problem with it, of course, is that it completely skates over what are the real problems in the European economy, and I am puzzled that no questions at all are asked as to why things are really going so badly."
"Why does the United States have, on average, a 40.5% higher gross national product per inhabitant than we have in even the richest part of the EU - 15?"
"The answer is very clear."
"The European economy is moving too slowly because we engage too little in research and development."
"We do not work for very many years of our lives. Only 63% of all people of working age are in the labour market."
"We do not work for very many hours per week and do so using antiquated technology."
"It is no good sharing out poverty, as this report proposes we do."
"The thing is, to increase growth so that there is enough for distribution to everyone."
"Try looking at the figures for my own country, Denmark, and you will see that it has succeeded both in implementing a socially aware policy and in creating growth."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I support Mrs Figueiredo’s report, but feel there is a contradiction to which attention must be drawn."
"In recital L, after referring to the worrying situation of unemployment within the Union, the claim is made that immigration is needed in order to tackle the direct implications for the current labour market."
"I fundamentally disagree."
"What we need, in my view, is more stability and fewer stop-gap measures, more certainty and continuity of employment and less public support for major companies, particularly multinationals, which benefit from incentives and tax breaks from the European Union and its Member States, often repaying this by relocating and committing fraud which adversely affects savers."
"In point five following Recital M, a reference is very properly made to participatory democracy."
"In this context, we should be continuing to pursue the goal of direct participation in the life of companies, as already stated in the never-applied article 46 of the Italian Constitution – borrowed, moreover, from the Labour Charter of the Italian Social Republic – which recognises the right of workers to collaborate in the management of companies, in the manner and within the limits established by law."
"This is an example of a legal expedient which, had it been incorporated in the European Constitution and thereafter implemented, would have enhanced the acceptability of a document which is instead an intrusive instrument for the coercion of the destiny of the European population – or which, at the very least, would have enhanced its social value."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen."
"We are discussing a report on the social situation in the European Union; this report states that the social situation is not good."
"However, the report fails to name the actual causes of failure."
"The true reasons for the slump in economic growth and employment are the restrictions in the freedom to engage in business, the rising cost of labour, mushrooming regulation, bureaucracy, increasing redistribution and the influence of the state."
"The cause of the problem is that personal initiative, responsibility, and effort are kept separate from social and economic appraisal."
"Redistribution breaks the bond between success and affluence."
"The more we redistribute in favour of those who, through their own fault, are unsuccessful, the more unsuccessful people we will have."
"If we continue to confuse equal opportunities with egalitarianism and mediocrity, the more mediocre people we will have."
"The correct and only genuine way to improve the social situation is through economic growth."
"Only a wealthy society can afford to spend more on social programmes."
"We need to cut taxes, clamp down on regulation, and defend the freedom to engage in business."
"The rights of employees must be balanced with the rights of employers; education must be connected with success."
"The rights of diverse groups of citizens must not be allowed to overshadow universal rights, the rights of us all; support for one group must not result in restrictions for another."
"I have found none of these solutions or proposals in the report; in fact, the opposite is true."
"The report, as drafted, does not benefit the European Parliament, the European Union, its Member States, or their citizens."
"And therefore I call on you, ladies and gentlemen, to vote against the proposed report."
"Thank you."
"Ladies and gentlemen, a much-frequented theme in the new Member States is the reform of the pension system."
"In most of these countries, the main pillar continues to be a single pay-as-you-go scheme."
"I believe that this system, once the necessary modifications have been made, the retirement age has been extended, and contributions have been raised, is the only system capable of guaranteeing a decent pension for future pensioners."
"At the same time, this would make it possible to respect the relevant conventions of the International Labour Organization that most of the new countries have ratified."
"The conservative parties in most of these countries are mooting a reduction in the pensions guaranteed by the state to a level under the limit guaranteed by the conventions, and the setting-up of another pillar based on mandatory insurance."
"In my opinion, this solution is risky and offers no guarantee of a sufficient income in old age, because the legislation required to make this pillar work is very patchy."
"What is more, the administrative costs of private institutions are several times higher than the costs reported by state-controlled institutions."
"If employees are to pay mandatory contributions to private insurance in addition to contributions to a state pension, then I think a better solution would be to increase the contribution to guarantee the first pillar."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that contending with unemployment, which is a cause of social exclusion and poverty, is one of the most important tasks for the European Union’s social policy."
"If you look, though, at the unemployment figures not only in Germany, but also in my own country of Austria, it would appear that these efforts have already proved fruitless, for the point has to be made that, at the same time as jobs have migrated from them to low-wage countries, illegal immigration has created a new underclass at home."
"When, for example, as we see from the German visa scandal, hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Ukrainians enter the EU in the guise of tourists in order to provide cheap labour, this means in real terms that jobs in the EU Member States are being wiped out."
"The war on unemployment must therefore also be a war on illegal immigrants and on illegal migrant labour."
"It is self-evident that dubious organisations or firms must be prevented from bringing cheap labour into the EU under cover of the freedom to provide services."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by expressing my generally negative view of the report presented by Mrs Figueiredo, since its content runs counter to the economic and social policy advocated by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"Though it is true that the text has been improved in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, it is also the case that it retains a tone which is clearly in favour of interventionism, and all the factors that mean economic and social development in the European Union, such as private initiative, the market or competition policy, are forgotten and relegated to second place."
"In short, this report defends policies and formulas that have traditionally been advocated by the European left."
"Our first amendment, therefore, is intended to highlight the important role of private initiative in the Union’s development."
"With regard to paragraph 1, as other rapporteurs have mentioned, I believe that its wording is particularly inappropriate. A reading of it would suggest that the European Union’s unemployment problems are due to the Stability Pact, the Lisbon Strategy, the internal market or competition policy."
"It is precisely these factors, I believe, that need to be strengthened if we want to ensure that the Union grows, creates employment and enjoys greater social cohesion."
"And this is the case, for example, in my country, Spain, as has been demonstrated, where over recent years, an economic policy based on the balance of public accounts, tax reductions and the implementation of liberalising reforms in key sectors has led to the creation of five million jobs."
"As the High-Level Group chaired by Wim Kok has recognised, the problem stems from the lack of commitment on the part of some Member States to the reforms necessary for implementing strategies, rather than the strategy itself."
"Finally, our only intention with the rest of the amendments is for this Parliament to reflect the concern at the problems faced by young people in terms of accessing the labour market, as well as the need to remove the fiscal and administrative barriers faced by European entrepreneurs."
"Mr President, the rise in unemployment in the EU, which has now reached nearly 20 million, affects in particular women, people with disabilities and workers who, being over the age of 50, are discriminated against as being too old."
"The constantly decreasing number of people in work has resulted in drastic cutbacks in social security systems."
"Any pro-active policy for the social market economy must have a particular concern for society’s outsiders, for young people without adequate education, for people who are poorly integrated into society."
"Mr Silva Peneda is absolutely right; this draft report is permeated by an ideological bias."
"Even over 100 amendments have done little to improve it."
"We have in any case got shot of the demand for mergers and relocations to be made conditional upon the retention of jobs."
"Such an idea would occur only to a central authority with the right to give or withhold permission, and is fatally reminiscent of the state control that characterised the socialism that is now defunct."
"What we favour is the involvement of the social partners and European social dialogue."
"I would like to see the report ‘The state of corporate social responsibility’ made compulsory reading for managers."
"Our Commissioner Špidla is on the receiving end of Mrs Figueiredo continuing assertions to the effect that the Lisbon strategy gives too little weight to the social dimension."
"Welfare is every bit as significant as stable prices, reduced costs and smaller budget deficits."
"What we need is growth that achieves a balance between economic considerations and the need for job creation, thus making successful social integration possible."
"She is still calling for the financial perspective and the Structural Funds to be topped up. Where, though, is the money supposed to come from?"
"My proposal for burdens to be shared out fairly between the Member States, thus guaranteeing planning and funding, was of course rejected."
"Far from being a mish-mash of every kind of desirable thing, a new social policy agenda should concentrate on practically achievable actions, primarily investments in education, training and lifelong learning, with a marked rise in employment and a consequent reduction in unemployment, which is the basic cause of social exclusion."
"Mr President, this is not a legislative report, and might therefore be regarded as unimportant."
"However, I agree with Mr Kułakowski that it is an important report, for two reasons."
"The first reason is the subject matter itself: the fact that growth across the EU has halved in the past three years, and that unemployment now affects 20 million people, constitutes not just an economic disaster but also a gigantic social disaster."
"As so often when unemployment rises, the hardest hit are the vulnerable: young people trying to enter the employment market for the first time; young mothers trying to re-enter it; older people trying to stay in it."
"Those are some of the groups who suffer most, as was so eloquently pointed out by my colleague Mr Crowley and emphasised by his constituents in the visitors’ gallery."
"This subject calls for debate, but above all it calls for action."
"The second reason this issue is so important is the difference in views over the action required."
"Some political parties want to drive real change, whereas others are determined to block it."
"The rapporteur believes that we need more, rather than less, of the failed policies of the past: that more public sector jobs are one answer; that harmonised labour regulations are another; that more targets are another; that more legislation can produce more jobs; that the Services Directive should be dropped when it should be embraced; that the European social model should be preserved when it should be reformed."
"The former would be a recipe for more unemployment and greater social injustice."
"The question now is whether, as in committee, the Socialists and Communists will vote as one to keep the old, failed agenda intact."
"On our side, we believe that it should not be voted through without fundamental amendment."
"We will vote to deliver the Lisbon Agenda, which means voting against the report as it stands."
"– Mr President, the European Union's objectives, according to the European Constitution, are to achieve full employment and social progress, combat social exclusion and discrimination and promote social justice and protection."
"Just how far away we are from these objectives is illustrated by the information set out in the Commission report: twenty million European citizens are unemployed and seventy million are on the verge of poverty."
"Violence against women and inequality between men and women have not disappeared."
"For the rest, we are celebrating Women's Day today."
"What are we actually doing to wipe out violence against women and the family, when the results of research under the Daphne I programme have yet to be applied?"
"When there are such social deficits, we cannot in fact talk about social protection and justice."
"Unfortunately, the Lisbon strategy has proven so far to be inadequate in drastically tackling the deficits in the social sector in the Union."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union places man at the heart of its action."
"The Council and the Commission talk about progress and increasing averages in the various social sectors."
"However, the minimum levels of civil and social rights of each citizen defined in the charter are evaluated not by averages, but by personal criteria."
"Sustainable development and social justice make sense not only when the general indicator of the economy and of human prosperity increases, but when social cohesion also progresses."
"Consequently, the main objective of the Union should not only be how to improve the life of the majority of citizens, it should basically be how to make the bad life of any minority into a good life at least."
"The time has come for radical decisions and effective action."
"The responsibility lies with the Commission and each Member State of the European Union."
"The roadmap of the Lisbon strategy should be adjusted to the new circumstances."
"The objective is a dignified life for every European citizen, for every European citizen without exception."
", I would like to make a brief intervention in this debate."
"The problems that have been formulated are clearly problems which are discussed in texts and documents presented by the European Commission."
"These are texts in which we seek solutions to the problems that genuinely exist in Europe."
"I am sure that the reformulated Lisbon Agenda, connected with the social agenda, contains solutions which are capable of leading us forward."
"It is abundantly clear that Europe needs to grow, just as it is absolutely self-evident that Europe needs social responsibility, and it is quite clear that there are indivisible links between these two elements and therefore neither of them should be taken out of context."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A6-0045/2005) by Mr Sánchez Presedo, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the proposal for a Council regulation applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences."
"I am giving the floor straight away to Mr Mandelson on behalf of the Commission."
". Mr President, thank you for inviting me to address Parliament on the subject of the generalised system of preferences and its reform."
"The GSP is a key instrument to put trade at the service of development by helping stimulate developing country exports to the European Union."
"The current system will be improved in four principal ways."
"First, the GSP will be simplified."
"Second, the product coverage will be expanded."
"Third, the benefits will be focused on those developing countries that are most in need."
"Fourth, additional GSP benefits – GSP+ – will be available for the first time to those countries that encourage sustainable development."
"The new GSP scheme is simpler to comprehend."
"It comes in only three forms: the general arrangement; everything but arms for less-developed countries, which remains unchanged; and a new special arrangement to promote sustainable development and good governance."
"The graduation process will be clearer, simpler and fairer."
"Graduation – the exclusion of competitive products from GSP benefits – will not be applied annually any more, but over the three-and-a-half year period of the regulation."
"This will bring greater stability and much more predictability."
"The new GSP scheme is a clear example of an integrated approach to trade policy and sustainable development and I am sure will be welcomed by Members here for that reason."
"The new incentive for sustainable development and governance will support our commitment to core human and labour rights and environmental protection in the framework of our existing trade policy."
"The reformed GSP will be a more effective tool to foster export diversification and economic growth for countries most in need: for example, vulnerable countries like Honduras; poorly diversified economies like Georgia; small islands like Sri Lanka; and landlocked countries like Mongolia."
"My aim is to get this simpler, better scheme into force more rapidly."
"Following the tsunami, the Commission has been keen to act quickly to provide relief for the countries affected in the Indian Ocean."
"The new GSP will provide better access for some of the countries worst affected by the tsunami, and we want to accelerate its entry into force on 1 April."
"The countries that bore the brunt of the tsunami disaster will benefit most from the new scheme."
"Sri Lanka will receive duty-free access to the EU for almost all its exports, including vital textile and clothing exports."
"India, Indonesia and Thailand will benefit from reduced duties and wider product coverage, especially on crucial seafood exports."
"In parallel, the Commission is working on simplifying and, where appropriate, relaxing the rules of origin in order to make GSP preferences provide the poorest with more benefit."
"The Commission will complete the revision of the GSP rules of origin as soon as possible."
"Let me turn to the amendments proposed by Parliament(1)."
"Overall, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Sánchez Presedo, and the Committee on International Trade, for the excellent work done in a tight timeframe."
"I welcome the fact that the conclusions in the report adopted by that committee on 22 February are broadly supportive of the Commission proposal."
"More specifically, the committee has highlighted the need for an evaluation of the functioning and impact of the current GSP scheme."
"The Commission is currently working on an impact assessment of the GSP on beneficiary countries during the five-year period from 1999 to 2003 and we should deliver a final report to Parliament by the end of the summer."
"Furthermore, I am also ready to report to the European Parliament annually on the impact assessment of the new GSP."
"Let me turn to some detailed points."
"The Commission is ready to accept Amendment 47, tabled by the Committee on International Trade, according to which ‘the Commission shall, in close cooperation with Member States, monitor the imports of [some sensitive tuna] products’."
"However, I am not persuaded by the committee’s proposal to lower the graduation threshold for textiles and clothing products."
"This would exclude India from the GSP for those products."
"India is one of the countries that bore the brunt of the Indian Ocean tsunami disaster and where 300 million people still live on a dollar a day or less."
"The time and circumstances are not right to make this change, as it would adversely affect India."
"In this context, therefore, a decision such as this does not seem justified."
"Member States are divided on the issue: some wish to decrease this threshold, others support a higher one."
"The Commission proposal for a 12.5% threshold is a fair compromise between these two positions."
"Then there are proposals that affect the eligibility of specific countries. The committee proposes a specific clause for El Salvador."
"This would imply granting GSP+ to a country that has not ratified a maximum of two ILO Conventions due to constitutional constraints, but undertakes to ratify and implement them as quickly as possible."
"I think you will agree that any ad hoc clause which downgrades two ILO Conventions runs counter to the EU policy of promoting core labour standards."
"On 4 March this year the Council adopted its conclusions on the social dimension of globalisation, which ‘recall its commitment to promote core labour standards and note the importance of the revision of the GSP in this context’."
"Furthermore, up to now, El Salvador has not shown any movement towards the ratification and implementation of the two missing ILO Conventions – on freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining."
"The committee also recommends a revised definition of the GSP+ vulnerability criterion, which would make Pakistan eligible."
"Let me remind Members of this House of some of the history of this."
"In the wake of 9/11 we decided to grant the benefits of the GSP drug regime to Pakistan."
"Following the WTO panel launched by India against the GSP drug regime, additional tariff preferences can only be granted to countries facing specific trade, financial, or development needs."
"Accordingly, the selection of GSP+ beneficiaries is to be based on clear, transparent and non-discriminatory criteria."
"Any specific clause for Pakistan would represent a discrimination."
"It would therefore make us vulnerable to challenge and I do not want to risk triggering another WTO case against the new GSP scheme that would not only affect Pakistan, but every other developing country that was a beneficiary of GSP+."
"We should also bear in mind that Pakistan is one of the largest GSP beneficiaries, whereas GSP+ is targeted at the most vulnerable countries, in particular the smallest ones which represent less than 1% of GSP-covered trade flows."
"But I would like to stress that Pakistan will not be disadvantaged."
"It will enjoy favourable treatment in the new scheme, as it will benefit from reduced duties for all its exports to the EU market."
"In conclusion, I believe that the new GSP scheme opens good market access opportunities for developing countries."
"It is simpler, it is more predictable and covers a broader range of products."
"By ensuring its WTO compatibility, it will provide legal security to our trading partners and on that basis I commend it to this House."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has been the pioneer in the establishment of the generalised system of preferences (GSP)."
"Since 1971, following the Recommendation of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, non-reciprocal preferential treatment has been granted to developing countries, currently benefiting 177 countries, 50 of which are amongst the least-developed countries."
"The European Union imports more products covered by the GSP than all the other developed countries put together and three times more than the second largest importer."
"The first GSP regulation of the 21st Century must re-affirm the European Union’s leading role in promoting sustainable development and trade in the world."
"The Declaration of the Fourth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation, held in Doha in 2001, recognised that international trade could play a more important role in the promotion of economic development and the reduction of poverty."
"The new regulation is the first to be adopted by the European Union of 25."
"It provides access to a market larger than the 450 million people who live in it, which may become even larger with the incorporation of two new Member States."
"It is necessary because of the need to review the special drugs system, taking on board the requirements of the World Trade Organisation’s ruling of April 2004, which must come into effect on 1 July of this year."
"The rapporteur takes a positive view of the Council’s consultation of Parliament within a procedure in which codecision is not yet applied."
"He believes that the new initiative should have been preceded by a study on the impact of the system on the beneficiary countries and more time for hearing experts, specialist organisations, beneficiary countries and representatives of civil society."
"That would have allowed the report of the Committee on Development to be linked with those of other parliamentary committees."
"The report proposes that the review of the system in the future should be better organised and more participatory and that Parliament’s role should be enhanced, without changing the balance of powers, although it improves good European governance."
"We support Commissioner Mandelson’s initiative to present a revised proposal to bring the application of the Regulation forward to 1 April so that the countries affected by the tsunami can benefit from it as soon as possible."
"Even though its method for producing a provisional list for application of GSP + seems appropriate, the truth is that it only includes six countries and leaves out the majority of those that were benefiting from its preferences, and their exclusion is not compensated for by the increase of more than 200 products in the general GSP."
"For reasons of legal certainty, good administration and legitimate confidence, it appears appropriate to guarantee that the countries not included on the list can continue temporarily to enjoy the advantages they had been receiving, until the end of the present year."
"I would like to stress that compliance with the requirements for benefiting from the new incentive must conform to the requirements of the rule of law and the case of El Salvador will demonstrate this."
"An end to violence and the pacification of El Salvador have been encouraged and supported through the granting of a preferential system by the Union."
"Though the current El Salvador Constitution, which has promoted a delicate balance of agreement, does not conform immediately and entirely to the new requirements, though it does fulfil its fundamental objectives, this should not prevent us from seeking formulae such as the one proposed in the report on compliance by equivalence."
"An excessively restrictive definition of the vulnerability requirement for accessing the special incentive arrangement must also be avoided."
"The report proposes the provision of technical assistance, in order to create the institutional and regulatory capacity necessary to allow the beneficiary countries to increase the level of utilisation of the system, which is currently low."
"From the sectoral point of view, I would like to highlight the acceptance of the compromise amendment, presented with the rapporteur for the Committee on Development, in order to link the timescales for the liberalisation of sugar with those established in the reform of the common organisation of the markets, as well as the amendments in the field of textiles and fisheries products."
"Rules of origin, even when they are not part of the new regulation, are a key aspect and the rapporteur advocates that their form, substance and procedures should be reformed as soon as possible."
"The report has dealt with other future aspects, such as the preservation of the basis for calculation, the extension of sensitive products and taking account of the interests of the ACP countries that are not capable of concluding an EPA."
"I shall end by pointing out that the new GSP +, by making human development the central nucleus of any development strategy, must become the backbone of the future SGP and I would like to thank you for your attention and thank everybody who has participated in the result of my report for their cooperation."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the sitting service informs me that we are running very late and suggests that we continue this debate for around 10 minutes, until all who are speaking on behalf of their groups have spoken."
"I am therefore going to ask you for 10 minutes’ patience and attentive listening."
"Thank you in advance for the respect you are going to show to those who will be speaking."
". Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development, I should first of all like to thank Commissioner Mandelson for the words he has just spoken."
"I can very much identify, and indeed agree, with the different elements he listed."
"Trade and development cooperation are very closely interwoven."
"The scheme of generalised tariff preferences – the subject of our debate today – is a prime example of this."
"The amount we spend via this scheme of trade benefits is higher than the total European budget for development cooperation."
"A review of the system was critical as it was simply being underused and the excessively complex structure did not comply with the rules of the WTO."
"It follows that a simplification, an improvement, can yield extra benefits, and this is very significant, certainly if the countries in question adhere to the international standards for good governance and working conditions."
"However, in order to make the system effective, the Commission must review the rules of origin promptly, because that will dictate whether we can actually make it more effective for the countries."
"It is of great importance for the benefits to be generous and for us not to try to reintroduce protectionism via the backdoor by excluding all kinds of products, as the Commissioner referred to a moment ago."
"We support the new scheme’s proposal for prompt implementation on 1 April for the countries affected by the tsunami, but we are also arguing in favour of a transitional period for the countries that are not yet ready."
"It is also a question of trust."
"Finally, I should like to mention the relationship between the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) and the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs), about which the European Commission is currently negotiating with the ACP countries."
"As the Commissioner is aware, the trade agreements are not uncontroversial; they are reported to involve trade liberalisation that is too rapid and too rigorous."
"It is therefore of the utmost importance that the ACP countries and, above all, those that are not among the least developed countries, should have alternatives if they do not want to join the EPAs."
"The review in 2008 of the GSP plus could prove to be a sound alternative for this."
"I would advise the Commissioner to really get down to business in this respect."
". Mr President, we are debating the reform of the generalised system of preferences – the GSP – for developing countries."
"As has already been said, this system is one of the most important instruments for bringing about economic development in developing countries and, as such, a fairer distribution in the world."
"It offers trade benefits to the countries that are most in need of them."
"In addition, the countries that perform well in terms of human rights, good governance, labour legislation and sustainable development, are given even more benefits through what is termed the GSP plus programme, intended as an extra incentive for governments to carry out serious and sustainable work in further stabilising and developing their countries."
"The existing GSP scheme is being reviewed, as was long overdue."
"To date, very little use has been made of the opportunities which this scheme offers, and that is why attempts have been made to simplify it and to make it more transparent and more objective."
"That will not be a guarantee that this scheme, or the additional opportunities, will be used more often."
"We therefore call for reform of the rules of origin and, above all, for adequate technical assistance to help countries examine how they can meet the conditions."
"GSP plus should give governments extra incentives to practise good governance, respect human rights and so on, but the Commission only wants to grant the scheme to countries which already comply with it."
"In that way, it takes away the incentive for countries which could comply with it in the next ten years, that being the period for which the scheme will run."
"That is a missed opportunity."
"The report therefore argues that countries which will comply with the conditions for GSP plus in the next few years will be able to make use of the extra benefits as soon as they meet the criteria."
"Our group backs this report as now amended."
"The subject matter is complex, and I am pleased to have been able to reach a compromise with the other groups and the different disciplines."
"I hope that the report will be adopted in this form and that the Council and the Commission can accept the recommendations."
"The Commission wanted to discuss this report earlier for the benefit of the countries that were hit by the tsunami disaster."
"I hope that those countries will also actually benefit from this scheme."
"The good news is that the assessment which we were waiting for has finally been completed."
". – I should like to begin by greeting Mr Mandelson."
"The generalised system of preferences has been an important tool for supporting developing countries by encouraging them to participate in world trade."
"This openness arises from the EU’s responsibility as the biggest trading bloc in the world, and is in line with the positions adopted by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and the Doha Process."
"Since January, within the scope of the WTO, imports mainly from China have entered the European area unhindered, and perhaps too aggressively."
"I say ‘perhaps’ because I must take this opportunity to express my disappointment that there are neither guidelines nor effective systems for gauging import levels, despite this being a Commission commitment for 2004."
"At the same time, I applaud the EU’s rapid response to the tragic impact of the tsunami."
"The present amendment to the rules of origin will further open up the European market to textile exports from developing countries."
"There is a strong possibility that subjecting the poorest countries in the world to the simultaneous combined effect of the liberalisation of textile exports from China and the insufficiently selective treatment of the major textile powers such as India, within the framework of preferential treatment, will ultimately destroy these economies and regions."
"I am sorry to hear that Mr Mandelson is not sensitive to this problem."
"We must examine the perverse phenomenon whereby the strongest countries crush the weakest under the very instrument set up to support their development."
"It is essential that in Europe, too, the opening up of the textile market to imports from low cost countries should be reciprocated by the countries benefiting and should be accompanied by the gradual adoption of fairer trade rules in social and environmental terms and as regards intellectual property, as proposed by the High Level Group on textiles."
"Let us be clear: if it is true that European textile rules must be adapted rapidly, it is crucial that we prevent that adaptation from turning into the sudden collapse of the economic and social structure in European textile regions, with dire consequences, particularly in terms of job losses."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the generalised system of preferences, by means of which reduced import tariffs are granted to developing countries for the export of their products to Europe, is the most concrete application of the ‘development by trade’ principle."
"Last year, this system accounted for more than EUR 500 billion worth of exports from developing countries to Europe."
"This report lays down the basic principles for the next ten years."
"I remain convinced, though, that this proposal for a regulation is too narrow in its interpretation of the objectives that were prescribed by the Commission in the past."
"After all, provision was made for a more effective system, which better accommodates the needs of the beneficiary countries and, above all, the poorest countries, which really need this system for their trade and development."
"A commitment was made to offer more clarity, more flexibility and, above all, more transparency, including a procedure for swift reviews, if necessary."
"I do not believe that those objectives have been fully met."
"A step is being made in the right direction, but the reform is clearly not far-reaching enough."
"That is why the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe abstained during the final vote in the Committee on International Trade and tabled another five amendments today."
"These amendments have deliberately been kept to a minimum."
"They are reasonable and, above all, intended to put in place more guarantees that the priority objectives will actually be met."
"Our group would like the system, on the one hand, to benefit the countries that really need it and, on the other, to protect our own industry against unjust or unfair competition."
"What we are hoping to achieve with our amendments is simply to combat the inappropriate or wrongful use of the system, and so I do indeed hope that the rapporteur and the Members of this House will be able to accommodate our concerns, thus enabling us to vote in favour of this report."
"Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance welcomes the GSP Agreement, but still has major concerns."
"Allow me to point out the two most serious of these."
"Regrettably, the majority rejected a number of the NGOs’ amendments – which the Greens supported – with a view to extending the number of countries entitled to aid."
"The agreement means, unfortunately, that Indonesia and India are excluded, even though they have significantly lower average incomes than many countries covered by the agreement."
"This means that EU taxes to the tune of more than EUR 200 million per year are now imposed upon the tsunami-hit country of Indonesia."
"In actual fact, it looks as if the great spirit of self-sacrifice in the EU countries has been converted into old-style EU protectionism."
"We want this agreement to be extended to all the countries that comply with the sustainable development criteria, irrespective of their size."
"Furthermore, it is disappointing that we continually have to wait for the Commission when it comes to a badly needed reform of the rules of origin."
"Will the Commission please tell us when we are to obtain the proposal?"
"Without it, the new GSP rules will not work for the benefit of those for whom they were intended."
"For example, another country hit by the tsunami, namely Sri Lanka, is affected because its clothes production only constitutes one link in the manufacturing chain."
"The idea is presumably not that the help we provide should, in reality, harm those who genuinely need the most help of all."
". Mr President, these trade debates are always very complex and generalised tariff preferences are no exception to that rule."
"So perhaps we are lucky to have Mr Mandelson as the Trade Commissioner; after all, he is rather more competent than the rest of the shower in the European Commission."
"If we go back to first principles, the United Kingdom is the fourth largest economy in the world, the third largest trading nation in the world and the head of a Commonwealth with 30% of the world’s population in it."
"London is the world’s leading financial centre and English is the common business language of the world."
"Why then, in view of all these things, have we been represented since 1973 by the EEC, the EC, the EU and no doubt, if the Constitution is adopted, the United States of Europe?"
"Surely it would be better for the United Kingdom to sit at the WTO in its own right."
"Not only do we have a better relationship with our former colonies than most other European countries, but we are not dominated by the same protectionist imperative as the European Union."
"That is why Oxfam has awarded the European Union its Double Standards Award for rank hypocrisy."
"We want a British voice."
"We want real British influence and perhaps then we can give the Third World a real sporting chance."
"The debate on Mr Sánchez Presedo’s report will resume at 9 p.m. this evening, because at 3 p.m. we will be continuing our work with Council and Commission statements on the Non-proliferation Treaty and nuclear arms in North Korea and Iran."
"The Commission can accept Amendments 1, 4, 7, 34, 43, 45 and 47; and Amendments 3, 4, 16 and 21 from the Committee on Development."
"The Commission would find it difficult to accept Amendments 3, 15 and 18."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendments 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 44, 46, 48, 49, 50, 51 or 52; nor can it accept Amendments 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22 or 23 from the Committee on Development."
"As announced yesterday, I have received from the Council a corrigendum to the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending the directives establishing a new organisational structure for financial services committees."
"In her letter dated today, the chairwoman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has announced that the committee voted in favour of adopting the corrigendum."
"Free movement of persons in the internal market is one of the EU’s greatest successes and advantages, and this naturally presupposes a properly functioning common labour market. At the same time, the right of the Member States to choose their own welfare models must, however, be respected."
"Certain Member States select a combination of high taxes, comprehensive public services and generous subsidies, while others go for low taxes and a more rudimentary welfare model."
"It is not possible, then, to allow Europeans to opt for low taxes in one country and, at the same time, claim the right to generous subsidies and support from another country. If that is allowed, the Member States will be forced to introduce the same welfare model."
"The June List wants to see a proper review of the growing influence of EU rules within social and labour market policy."
"We therefore choose to vote against the report, which calls for further limitation upon the Member States’ room for manoeuvre in some of the most central areas of democratic economic policy."
"We regret that this report was rejected by the right-wing majority in Parliament, which is uncomfortable debating social problems, which does not accept the causes of those problems being highlighted and which rejects any attempt at changing neoliberal policies."
"From the outset, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, along with the liberals at various points, attempted to water down some of the key elements of the report. As it did not manage this in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, it did so in plenary."
"- Removing criticism of the Lisbon Strategy’s contribution towards accelerating liberalisations/privatisations, the flexibility of labour and job insecurity;"
"- Emphasising that, despite current problems of unemployment and social exclusion, the Lisbon Strategy, without any revision, is important to the future;"
"- Removing references to the need to review current economic and financial policies, in particular those of the Stability and Growth Pact, the Lisbon Strategy, the internal market and competition policy, and the emphasis on achieving a high employment rate and long-term quality jobs backed up by workers’ rights;"
"- Rejecting, along with the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, our request to the Commission to remove the proposal for a directive on completing the internal market for services ..."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"Five years on, ahead of the Treaty Review Conference, the outlook is starkly different. The United States has shifted its position away from the commitments it made and the current administration has even announced that it will develop new nuclear weapons technology, costing astronomical amounts of money."
"The upshot of which is that other states party to the Treaty do not feel they have a binding commitment to comply with the NPT following the invasion of Iraq on the false pretext of the existence of weapons of mass destruction. Possessing – or pretending to possess – nuclear weapons has come to have a certain status, and has in fact come to be perceived as a deterrent or a means of self-defence."
"Countries such as Israel, India and Pakistan, which also have nuclear weapons, remain outside the Treaty and feel neither encouraged, nor under any pressure whatsoever, to sign up to it."
"More worryingly still, North Korea is trying to withdraw from the Treaty and is blackmailing the international community. We have reached the point where applicants to join the permanent Security Council cite this status to support their candidature."
"The United Nations’ High Level Panel on dangers, threats and challenges says that the stage has been reached where the process of eroding the non-proliferation regime could have passed the point of no return and could result in galloping proliferation. Additionally, we know that there is a high risk of nuclear materials falling into the hands of terrorists, often completely out of state control."
"The EU must play a key role in making the Treaty work as a permanent bureau, which would entail coordination with EU nuclear weapon states if there is to be genuinely coordinated action within the terms of the foreign and security policy and the security and defence policy. Given the urgency of the situation, Parliament should send a mission to the conference to monitor European intervention, to monitor what the Member States do and to encourage action on the Treaty, in line …"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, nuclear proliferation in North Korea is a source of great concern. We are dealing with a country which has concealed its production of nuclear weapons from the international community."
"These arsenals therefore have to be dismantled and North Korea must sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty at once and allow IAEA inspectors from Vienna to carry out the appropriate inspections."
"However, we believe that the diplomatic route is the only viable one in that region. North Korea must return to the negotiating table for the six-party talks with the USA, South Korea, Japan, Russia and China."
"Against this backdrop, aggressive statements from Washington are not helpful."
"Instead of the Bush administration’s recent sabre-rattling, I believe North Korea should be offered a political and diplomatic agreement as a for monitoring of its nuclear arsenal."
"Moreover, I believe that when debating nuclear weapons, we cannot avoid the issue of who should cast the first stone."
"For example, we cannot avoid emphasising the recent revelation in Italy that, in certain NATO bases on Italian soil, nuclear weapons belonging to the US are being stockpiled, unknown to residents in the vicinity."
"In my view, therefore, the issue of nuclear disarmament is everyone’s business and does not merely concern the two countries now under discussion."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party."
"Next May in New York, at the conference on the non-proliferation treaty, no further concessions or compromises can or should be made."
"In particular, the possibility of reactionary and in many ways obscurantist regimes, such as those of Iran and North Korea, coming into possession of nuclear weapons must be prevented. This concern is only heightened by the risk of plutonium being stolen by terrorist groups which, alas, are increasingly active."
"In 1945 in Japan, the atomic bomb wiped out two cities, with consequences which even today are having an impact on the lives of millions of citizens and the surrounding environment."
"In 2005, the mayors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the two cities destroyed 60 years ago, are launching an international campaign for nuclear disarmament via their programme, which calls for the elimination of all nuclear weapons within 15 years."
"Europe, which has every interest in promoting international security and strategic stability, must ensure its voice is heard in the international community, setting out in clear terms the way ahead towards a gradual reduction in nuclear arms deployment and a consequent progressive disarmament."
"Mr President, on Sunday, Iran admitted that it had achieved proficiency in the full range of activities for enriching uranium."
"Several top Iranian nuclear negotiators had previously admitted that the clerical regime was not at such a point in October 2003 when a nuclear agreement was signed with Europe’s big three."
"The loophole-laden agreement has left lots of wiggle room for Tehran, effectively providing perfect diplomatic cover for the mullahs to gain the most precious thing they needed to advance their weapons programme: time."
"When it comes to ideologically-driven regimes, the bitter truth is that appeasement is an exercise in futility."
"We should be thankful to the National Council of Resistance of Iran for blowing the cover off Iran’s clandestine nuclear programme. Were it not for them, Iran would have acquired the A-bomb by now."
"In this light, serious consideration must be given to the notion that Iran’s nuclear threat and its sponsorship of terror can only be halted through the toppling of this regime by Iranians and democratic opposition groups such as the National Council of Resistance of Iran."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"While we are debating problems relating to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and the Non-Proliferation Treaty, I think it would not be out of place to alert this House to the existence of new military technologies that render the situation even more complex."
"It is already possible to manufacture what are known as suitcase bombs."
"These bombs are light and easily transportable, and could therefore easily fall into the wrong hands, for example those of terrorist groups."
"Very low-intensity bombs are a further example of a new military technology, and their existence completely blurs the clear distinction previously made between traditional weapons and nuclear weapons."
"The emergence of such weapons, the purpose of which would appear to be to allow attacks on heavily defended and fortified locations, could result in their use in countries that are not signatories to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons."
"This would then trigger, or rather it might and should trigger, corresponding reactions from the international community, as every country that has signed the Treaty has the assurance of other countries that nuclear weapons will not be used on its territory. I thank you."
"I have received seven motions for resolutions, pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.(1)"
"The debate is closed."
"Voting will take place on Thursday."
"."
"Mr President, that Syria is playing a game in Lebanon with the international community is evident from both President Assad’s parliamentary speech last Saturday and his agreements yesterday with his Lebanese counterpart, Mr Lahud."
"The Security Council’s Resolution 1559 is not yet applicable to Damascus. It clearly demands the total and immediate withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanese territory."
"Ominously, at the end of last week, the Syrian Head of State did not breathe a word about the influential presence, within Lebanese territory, of his secret services, which would appear not to form part of the Syrian troop movements there."
"This is consistent with the recent Israeli observation that Syria is currently preoccupied with strengthening its secret presence in the land of the cedar, something of which the UN Secretary-General was officially informed yesterday by the Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs."
"There is yet another way in which Damascus is brazenly flouting resolution 1559."
"The resolution stipulates the disbanding of all militias in Lebanon."
"This would involve the dismantling of the Shiite terror movement Hezbollah, pawn of both Syria and Iran against the Jewish state, as well as the forced departure of dozens of officers of the Iranian revolutionary guard, who train Hezbollah and Palestinian terror groups within Lebanon’s borders."
"Given the seriousness of the situation in Lebanon, I hope that the Council and the Commission will deliberately obstruct those forces in Syria, Lebanon and Iran that do not want to know of a fully-fledged Lebanese state sovereignty, or like any political settlement between Israel and its closest Arab neighbours."
"Damascus, Teheran and their Lebanese satellites should stop their sinister game once and for all. It is up to the Council and the Commission to do something practical to bring this about."
"They would, for example, do well to start by placing Hezbollah on the European list of terror organisations."
"– Mr President, listening to most of the speakers, I had the impression that I was listening to Mrs Condoleeza Rice, and reading most of the resolutions, I thought that they were communications from the White House."
"The truth is that Lebanon, following the war and the occupation of Iraq by the Americans, is becoming the field of application of the Greater Middle East plan announced by the United States and adopted by ΝΑΤΟ and the European Union. This plan reinforces the role of Israel, sets its sights on the fight of the Palestinians for a free, independent state and exerts pressure on Syria and Iran."
"You only want them to be independent under your control and it is in this direction that resolution 1559 has been raised again. Why has it been raised now, I wonder, and what are you hoping for?"
"And now efforts are being made to create the preconditions so that there can be a new military intervention in the area and overall attack on the peoples. The assassination of the former prime minister of Lebanon is operating as huge provocation with multiple objectives."
"We consider that the peoples and the political forces in the area must resolve their problems and do not need protectors. Finally, we ask you: how much hypocrisy is there?"
"What about the 40 000 occupying troops in Cyprus? Why do you not ask about them – now, immediately, tomorrow – and why do you not lobby for them to withdraw from the island?"
"Why two sets of standards? That is why we say that the European Union and the United States of America have a different objective."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we are all still reeling here from the shock of the barbaric murder of the former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, which also took 18 lives and injured hundreds of people."
"We are certainly unanimous in calling for a united response based on a combination of principles and action."
"President Bashar al-Assad announced last Saturday that his troops would be withdrawn from Lebanon in two phases. This came in response to demands by France and the United States in particular, but also reflected the pressure of international opinion and that of the Lebanese people."
"We should take account of this first step, but remain firm and unyielding in our demands for the future. Our road map here is Resolution 1559 as a whole, and we must first and foremost ensure that it is implemented rapidly and in its entirety."
"That means Syria totally withdrawing from Lebanon, to allow that country to regain its sovereignty and rapidly organise free and democratic elections, in response to the unanimous aspirations of the Lebanese people, whose concerted action and desire for freedom are most impressive."
"On the other hand, even if a date for the parliamentary elections has not yet been set, it would be advisable for them to be held in the presence of international observers, particularly observers from Europe. What is more, we need to maintain pressure on the Lebanese authorities to continue to cooperate fully with the UN commission of inquiry, so as to investigate thoroughly the circumstances surrounding the attack on 15 February."
"Mr President, one minute is very little for such a complicated issue and one with which we are largely unfamiliar."
"I shall restrict myself to asking one question: why is only Syria in the dock?"
"Syria may of course be guilty here, but that is only a hypothesis, and I am surprised and disappointed that there is a universal view that only Syria can be considered as the culprit, whereas Syria’s involvement is a complex issue in itself."
"This applies to both the media and also, unfortunately, to Europe’s political classes, which seem to have taken up the refrain, from the extreme left to the extreme right."
"There are other possibilities. There is Iran – Iran certainly has an interest in diverting attention to Syria – and there is the United States, which certainly has an interest in splitting the Middle East into numerous religious and ethnic communities."
"Why not look at them too?"
"Who has a vested interest in renewed conflict in Lebanon?"
"Not necessarily Syria, and certainly not Europe, and, with respect to Mr Moscovici and Mrs Le Pen, not France, which, in any event, needs Lebanon, a Christian and multi-faith country which in some ways sets an example for the entire region."
"Mr President, this is the moment of historic hope for the Middle East. A huge number of people are valiantly moving towards better times: Palestinians who tackle people who attack Israeli citizens, Israelis who hand back huge regions to the Palestinians as a first step towards two states, but above all, the Lebanese, who are fighting on the streets for better times without Syrian interference."
"These courageous people, along with all peace-loving people in the Middle East, deserve our support."
"The biggest threat to the peace process is now Hezbollah, to which organisation we in Europe adopt a naïve and implausible attitude, drawing a distinction between the military Hezbollah and the political Hezbollah."
"This distinction is not realistic, for they are both run by one and the same leader, namely Mr Nasrallah. He himself admits that there is no distinction, and his second-in-command recently stated on television, and I quote : ‘We believe that the political activity is integrated in the military operations, because they are inextricably linked to the political activity’."
"Then there are those people in the Lebanese Parliament, with whom some in this Chamber would like to do business, and their leader, Hussein Hay Hassan, who himself says: ‘Hezbollah is an organisation in which all fighters are politicians and military at the same time."
"This is coming from the people of Hezbollah themselves."
"It is high time we had the courage to send a clear message to an organisation which has links with Syria and Iran, which attacks innocent citizens and speaks out in no uncertain terms against the peace process and against Syria’s withdrawal from Lebanon."
"Two weeks ago, the Council’s representative stated: ‘We are keeping an eye on Hezbollah."
"If they adopt a bad attitude, we will consider extra measures’. If we now see what is happening, namely protests and threatening language in Beirut which goes against the process, then I think that it is time for action."
"Many fine words are spoken here about the protesters, but what these courageous people now need is not fine words, but clear action and unambiguous decisions. The time has come to say how matters really stand."
"Hezbollah is a terrorist organisation and must be placed on the European list of terror organisations. The courageous people in the Middle East deserve us finally having the courage to speak this clear language."
"Mr President, the death – the murder – of Rafik Hariri was a tragedy not only for his family, but also for the Lebanon."
"I was myself able to meet him on many occasions and came to value the greatness of his vision."
"We now have to ensure that there are no more such tragic developments in Lebanon, and one thing, we have to concede, is clear: it was Syria that originally helped to establish peace and to stabilise the country, but, as happens so often in this life, failure to discern the signs of the times can mean that, instead of stability, new conflicts are sparked off and peace is in check."
"That is why Syria must leave, taking its armed forces and its secret services with it."
"It should also read the signs from the interior: the old guard in Syria is still in fact standing in the way of development in its own country."
"Secondly, here are a few plain truths about Hezbollah. Hezbollah also helped to drive the Israeli forces out, to restore the country’s autonomy and to give it a stable peace."
"Here, too, though, the same is true: if Hezbollah does not see the way the wind is blowing and is unwilling to help establish peace and stability, then there is no helping it, for nobody in this House will be willing to support it."
"The last thing I want to say in this debate is that Syria, too, is entitled to peace, stability and territorial integrity, but it must be prepared to conclude real peace with Israel, to acknowledge not only its own right to security but also Israel’s, and to help Israel to live in peace and security in the region."
"If Syria does that, we will be able to support it in that, but this is a clear and unequivocal demand that we must make of it."
"Mr President, Lebanon has a recent history of civil war and a complex ethnic and religious balance. It has never been fully recognised as independent by neighbouring Syria, which has not even bothered to open an embassy there, claiming Beirut is too near Damascus."
"Instead, Syria has promoted through its pan-Arab Ba’athist doctrine a ‘greater Syria’ concept."
"Pressure is now mounting on Syria from Saudi Arabia, Russia, the US and Israel to withdraw its troops from Lebanon."
"However, President al-Assad has only agreed to implement the terms of the Taif Accord of 1989, which obliges Syria to redeploy its 14 000-strong army to the eastern Bekaa Valley, because he is buying time, and he has so far ignored the more comprehensive UN Security Council Resolution 1559."
"But the heat is now on, following the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, with the so-called cedar revolutionaries on the streets of Beirut."
"These mainly Druze and Maronite Christians are blaming the one-party Syrian dictatorship for their country’s problems."
"If the Lebanese demonstrators have their way in the May election, their victory at the polls could signal the end of 30 years of economic and political co-dependence, but it would also make al-Assad’s position a lot shakier."
"Hizbollah, the international terrorist executive arm of Iran and Syria, which is based in Lebanon but increasingly working to undermine the Palestinian Authority and peace with Israel, is threatened by its Syrian protector’s withdrawal."
"Hizbollah has 12 MPs in the Lebanese Parliament and the EU Council of Ministers is therefore reluctant to ban it, claiming there is a difference between its civilian political activities and its military wing."
"Hizbollah itself makes no such distinction."
"France, a traditional friend of the Arab world, is leading this resistance in the Council, with Belgian, Swedish, Irish and Spanish backing."
"The latter is being particularly hypocritical as the Spanish Government was quite happy to ban Herri Batasuna and eject its MPs from the Spanish Parliament."
"Why, then, is Hizbollah not banned by the EU until it renounces the use of suicide bombers against innocent civilians and recognises the State of Israel’s right to exist?"
"– Mr President, developments in Lebanon should be seen within the framework of wider regional equilibrium and stability."
"The application of resolution 1559 on the withdrawal of Syrian forces from Lebanese territory is the first, but not the only dynamic element in this global approach."
"At the same time, an international initiative needs to be taken to restart the peace process between Israel and Syria."
"The European Union has a strategic responsibility to take a specific initiative, within the framework of the Quartet, either by preparing a parallel roadmap, or by extending the current roadmap, so that it includes the Israeli-Syrian aspect of the peace process."
"The Council of Ministers and the Commission should speed up the procedures to complete the action plan for Lebanon within the framework of the European neighbourhood strategy, just as they should oppose the connection being attempted between the signature of the association agreement with Syria and prior completion of the withdrawal of the Syrian army."
"It is in our interest to keep our options open with Syria if we want to help democratise the country and bring stability to the area."
"The withdrawal of the Syrian forces, as agreed, is a first positive step. Our objective is respect for the international legality and the application of resolution 1559."
"However, this objective should not be selective. It should bind all the countries in the area, including Israel."
"If we are to be effective, we need first to be a credible European Union."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, this evening we can celebrate a minor miracle, because in Lebanon, in times past, after the murder of an ex-Prime Minister we would have seen a fresh outbreak of civil war, whereas, on this occasion, Lebanese society has responded with peaceful indignation."
"For the first time we have seen Druse, Sunni, Shia and Christians demonstrating together."
"Now, what has been termed ‘the spring of Lebanon’ needs political support, pressure and assistance."
"It is not sufficient to refer back to dignified or dutiful United Nations resolutions, but instead we need a commitment from these institutions, first and foremost to make President Assad of Syria aware that he has to find the courage to go beyond half-measures."
"Repositioning a few thousand soldiers in the Bekaa valley, 30 kilometres from Beirut, is not a withdrawal and merely looks like a charade."
"Commissioner, we know that there will be no peace between Palestine and Israel, or in the Middle East, as long as the Syrian occupation of Lebanon – an offence to the principle of legitimate sovereignty – persists."
"Since we are convinced that peace, if it is to be genuine, must be based on pluralism, we believe that there must be greater passion and political engagement in support of the peace process and of the restoration of full sovereignty in Lebanon."
"Mr President, the majority of speakers have reflected the very strong sentiments of friendship that exist in this House towards the Lebanese people, combined with support for that people’s desire for greater democracy and full sovereignty. The message is that the European Union should spare no efforts to allow this country, which has been scarred by decades of violence and which has suffered so much from the conflicts in the region, to regain its full sovereignty, recover its stability and construct a truly democratic society through free elections."
"It is for that reason that we cannot accept Lebanon being used by those who want to derail the Middle East peace process."
"Those who are undermining the development of democracy in Lebanon, those who are letting themselves be used to prevent Lebanon from regaining its full sovereignty, cannot expect the slightest sympathy for their position from the European Union."
"I believe that on that point, too, your message is very clear."
"That naturally also applies to Hezbollah, which has to choose between either taking part in the democratic life of a new, democratic Lebanon, or serving external forces that have no desire for peace either in Lebanon or in the region as a whole."
"I support what Mr Moscovici said: there can be only one road map for the European Union, and that is immediate and full implementation of Resolution 1559."
"We must support all those democratic forces in Lebanon who seek change and who desire sovereignty for their country. It is for that reason that free elections in Lebanon are so important."
"I have received six motions for resolutions(1) tabled pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.15 p.m."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we listened carefully to what you had to say, and also liked what we heard, because you intend to allow Parliament to play its legislative role, and you can rely on us to do just that."
"For the sake of clarity, could I ask you once again whether we will really be able to count on you when we amend the directive to such an extent that we modify some of the architecture of the country of origin principle, when we clearly specify the exclusion of services of general interest, as well as public health and social services? In particular, I would like to know whether we could count on your support if we were to launch the idea of working with a positive list when using the country of origin principle, possibly also in terms of the area of application."
"Thirdly, what will you do with health services? Will the Commission draft a new proposal or will you plan something different for the longer term?"
"Mr President, I am happy to say that I agree with what the previous speaker had to say about the services directive, but, Commissioner, when it comes to the software patent directive, everything becomes incomprehensible."
"How can you defend it as you have just done at a time when the Lisbon Strategy is again being lifted high?"
"Do you not see how, by taking this course of action on software patents, you are in fact hamstringing the European project in defence of which you have just spoken?"
"How do you propose, by means of these patents, to protect the small and medium-sized businesses, whom you have described as being gravely concerned? They cannot afford lawyers."
"What is going on here is a stitch-up."
"For years, thousands of people with innovative minds and smart intellects, people who could help move Europe forward, have been protesting against this software patent directive, and that with good reason."
"Meanwhile, you act as if the thing were even in their interests, whilst avoiding mentioning those who really did guide you in drafting it, namely big businesses, in an attempt to deny small businesses the freedom that sets us apart from the American market and to prepare the way for a flattened field in which enormous profits will be achieved only by the very few."
"That is not the Europe for us!"
"– Mr President, the proposal for a directive on services is a proposal of ill repute. It has caused tremendous reaction and concern both in the European Parliament and in numerous Member States and, mainly, through citizens, because it promotes brutal social dumping."
"If you do not want us to talk of social dumping, Commissioner, withdraw your proposal, which causes this social dumping."
"Withdraw the dangerous principle of the country of origin and make full exceptions for sensitive sectors, such as health and public utility services."
"Mr McCreevy, take the Bolkenstein proposal away and bring us a proposal of your own, a McCreevy proposal; do not confine yourself to the role of making minor corrections to the Bolkenstein proposal."
"In your statement to the Conference of Presidents on 3 March, you were more daring and clearer. Once you had spoken with Mr Barroso, you put a great deal of water in your wine."
"Mr President, I can tell you, Commissioner, that everyone is talking about your directive in France."
"It is the only thing that is talked about during the current debates on the referendum on the Constitutional Treaty."
"You might say that this is a good sign: people are interested in our work."
"It is safe to say that the whole of France is opposed to this directive and in particular the country of origin principle."
"As you have just told us, by maintaining this principle, you are well aware that you are dragging Europe down and that, at the end of the day, you are increasing mistrust amongst our fellow citizens, who trusted us after the European elections to create a socially aware Europe."
"You are increasing mistrust and, even worse, you are going to be responsible for making France swing towards a no vote, which would be even more serious."
"I therefore also ask you to withdraw your proposal, Commissioner."
"Mr President, Commissioner, like everyone here, I listened to you very carefully."
"This directive is a major first in the history of civilisation, as it is the first time in the existence of the law (strength is sufficient for the strong, the law is made for the weak) that a brutal departure has been made from the principle of territoriality of the law."
"You enter a country, and when you are on its soil, you adopt its law."
"You said: ‘the directive will not be withdrawn’."
"Mr President, Commissioner, an internal market for services needs to be created, but the directive that you are proposing needs to be significantly changed, and we congratulate you for understanding this."
"What we want now is, first of all, for the scope of application to be reduced, and in particular for everything connected with cultural diversity and social rights to be excluded from it."
"We want the Community method to be applied, in other words harmonisation above all other principles."
"Finally, we want existing Community laws to take precedence over the new directive, in particular private international law for contractual and extra-contractual obligations and everything connected with workers rights."
"This, Commissioner, is how you can regain the confidence of the European Parliament."
"Work with us!"
"You said yourself that we are going to amend your proposal."
"We are going to significantly change it. I challenge you to accept what we are going to propose."
"That is your mission if you really want an internal market for services."
"Mr President, I should like to ask about the matter of software."
"Stories are circulating in the Danish press to the effect that, despite vigorous protests from the Danish Government and others, the choice was made to keep the point as an A point."
"Are you able, Commissioner, to confirm that it was not just a question of lying down and accepting the reference to the procedure, but that vigorous protests were made? That is the first issue."
"Are you able, secondly, to confirm that you yourself were contacted by, for example, the Danish Government with a view to your supporting the Danish Government’s desire to have the software patent down as a B point?"
"Have you been subject to approaches from the Danish Government, designed to obtain support for this point of view?"
"This is something I should like to have clarified."
"Mr President, Commissioner, as co-rapporteur for the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment, it was with great attention and interest that I read the points where you feel the directive is indeed missing the mark. I would go so far as to say that we all, of course, want to construct an internal market, but this directive contains many tricky points."
"First of all, you claim that this directive’s scope is probably too wide and in your speaking notes for the Conference of Presidents you mentionpublic funded services of general interest. A moment ago, you mentioned only social services."
"Could you explain exactly what you mean? After all, services of general interest are far more comprehensive than just social services."
"Secondly, it is not at all clear in which direction you would like to take the country of origin principle."
"Do you share our view that the country of origin principle can work only if there is a sufficient level of harmonisation and mutual recognition – if, in other words, there is a real basis for trust?"
"Let me say, Commissioner, that I believe constructive cooperation to be a real option only if you more clearly clarify, for our benefit, exactly what you mean."
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to make a comment on the process. I have to say that I am extremely annoyed about finding out that, unknown to Parliament, negotiations are being held with certain Member States or that, in the case of software, Parliament’s view is simply being ignored."
"My second comment concerns the content."
"There has been much talk about the Lisbon strategy and the need for innovation and promoting the European services market."
"I am one of the advocates of the services directive, and it goes without saying that we need clarification and improvement on a number of points, provided this is based on facts and not based on media reports which are full of false information, or with Chirac, Schröder and others."
"As for the software, the quality of legislation must not be made subordinate to the power struggle between the institutions."
"The innovation that we need must not be stifled by misguided legislation."
"In short, Mr McCreevy, I would argue in favour of paying more than lip service to the Lisbon strategy and also of respect for the democratic process and for the elected representatives of Europe’s people."
"Mr President, there are many in this House today who have come out against the Services Directive."
"I therefore think it important to state that it is the most significant individual reform we now have for European integration and for giving new impetus to the Lisbon process. It is not only a Services Directive that we need, but a directive that provides increased trade in services across European borders."
"The services sector corresponds to 70% of the European economy."
"We shall never obtain the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world if we do not open up the services sector."
"It is against that background that there are reasons for being concerned about what the Commissioner has said, because large parts of the services sector are exempt."
"It is important to analyse the issue: how much will be left of the European services sector subsequent to the exemptions now being granted?"
"Another part of Europe has other competitive advantages. How will the Commissioner guarantee that all European countries have competitive advantages through the country of origin principle and through a free and open trade in services?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, I am amazed at the lack of self-awareness and of self-respect on the part of many Members in the Chamber, and that for one simple reason."
"Who makes the laws?"
"Does the Commission do it, or do we ourselves?"
"The services directive is at first reading stages, while the software patent directive, due to the Council’s problematic way of handling it, is unfortunately being read a second time. It is we who make the laws; both directives have to be amended."
"The Common Position on the software patent directive is unacceptable, and we will be amending both directives to take account of the public interest and of the objectives of the European Union. We want both of them."
"I therefore welcome the Commission’s statement, in that it achieves clarity."
"Let us also get back to the practical work that parliaments do; let us have no more hysteria and misinformation, and let us appeal to the ETUC to support us in the lawmaking process rather than holding demonstrations next week."
"We expect the same of the Commission."
"Mr President, with regard to the speakers to whom you have given the floor during this debate, I object to the lack of balance among the different Member States."
"I indicated very early on that I wanted to speak; yet, with respect to my French colleagues, you took almost a dozen French contributions and none from Members from other countries."
"I think you should be more balanced and should observe the order that people indicate. I know I indicated that I wished to speak before other colleagues who spoke – good luck to them."
"But you should watch and be fair, Mr President. Fair play is all we ask."
"We have divergent views on this matter."
"The services will later distribute a breakdown of speakers by nationality."
"That way, we shall be able to see if it was done in a balanced manner or not."
"With a view to helping to alert the public to the widespread successes of organised criminal gangs who cross the internal borders of the Union with impunity, trafficking and smuggling, while our law enforcement agencies are national and cannot cross the same borders to make arrests, and in order to reinforce the message to the public that the Union needs to work cohesively, would the Commission be willing to encourage the regular publication, perhaps by Europol, of a list of ‘the Union's Top Ten Wanted Criminals’?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, accession negotiations with Croatia are due to start on 17 March."
"Do you believe that the Commission will be able – through the offices of Interpol or Europol – to track down General Gotovina?"
"He is reported to hold a French passport."
"Are there any indications as to whether he is still in Croatia, or any information as to how he might be handed over to the court?"
"To follow up on Mr Newton Dunn’s question, it seems clear to me that the public are now well aware that criminal activity is international and that criminals move freely across EU frontiers."
"What they are not so aware of is the coordination that takes place to try and counteract that."
"I therefore urge the Commission to look into bringing the different information together on a regular basis, whether through Europol, Schengen, or the chiefs of police; and look into making public what can be safely be made public, in order to demonstrate that we are acting as a Community to tackle international crime."
"There is another very important pass in the Pyrenees, the Biriatou pass, which I imagine you will know well and which carries the greatest density of traffic on the Franco-Spanish border. Every holiday period — and it will soon be Easter — there are enormous traffic jams, because within 25 km on the French side and 25 km on the Spanish side there are six obligatory stops for motorway tolls."
"Commissioner, do you not believe that we should take some measure in this regard, in order to prevent drivers from having to stop six times and kilometres of queues at this Biriatou pass?"
"What action will the Commission take to reduce the flow of counterfeit products from Russia and China?"
"– Mr President, Commissioner, now that these shortcomings in customs cooperation with China have been identified, now that there are these mass imports of counterfeit products, why does the Commission and, by extension the European Union, not take measures to suspend the abolition of quotas on textile products?"
"And why does it not activate the safety clause for which provision is made in China's WTO accession protocol?"
"Mr President, I agree with the Commissioner that the European Union must remain active in this field, and I should like to ask if he can assure the House that the European Union will make a renewed offer to China: for example, to provide it with customs officers at the EU’s own expense."
"On Friday, I visited an enterprise in my electoral district, where I learned that China is now producing copies of truck cranes – hi-tech equipment, in other words – that are indistinguishable from cranes built here."
"I think that we need to act on this issue in the interests of the competitiveness of our enterprises, and an offer of manpower such as this may be a means to do so."
"Questions Nos 24 and 25 will be replied to in writing."
"Should the role of the Court of Auditors as the ‘financial conscience of Europe’ not presuppose on the part of OLAF an unexceptionable rigour and willingness to investigate when it is informed of cases of mismanagement, fraud or any other illegal activity within that institution?"
"Does the Commission share the view that the special position of the Court of Auditors as arbiter of the misdeeds of others must not cause officials, either of the Court itself or of other institutions, to hide cases of mismanagement, fraud or any other illegal activity which come to their attention in an attempt to safeguard the unimpeachable image of the Court?"
"It is known that a former member of the Court of Auditors who was implicated in the inquiry carried out in the Court by OLAF has instituted legal proceedings in Greece against a former Court of Auditors official who testified in the case. The institutions have adopted measures to protect any official from unfair or discriminatory treatment arising from the disclosure of illegal acts or serious breaches of conduct within the institutions."
"."
"I can confirm the invitation from Vice-President Kallas for a meeting with Mr van Buitenen to discuss this question and the action to be taken in more detail."
"To what extent is the enlarged EU dependent on oil and gas supplies from Russia, and what action is being planned by the Commission to reduce that one-sided dependence?"
". We are pursuing an EU-Russia energy dialogue and we also have an EU-Russia dialogue."
"Certainly the dialogue could produce much better results, but I would say that Russia should adopt legislation that allows real competition in the market and offers scope for investments."
"Russia needs to make its own decisions; our role is to encourage Russia in this and that is what the EU is doing. So I expect the Russian energy sector to develop healthily."
"Russia will, for the foreseeable future, remain our partner in buying energy resources."
"Despite political developments, with the Baltic States' accession to the EU, those countries' energy systems still form part of the Russian energy system."
"The alternative to this unsatisfactory situation is a project linking the electricity networks between Lithuania and Poland. However, positive initiatives in connection with this project are few and far between."
"Does the fact that this project appears on the list of priority EU projects imply that the Commission is looking to complete specific stages of the project within the given schedule?"
"(If so, would it be possible to submit the matter to the countries concerned, that is, Poland and the Baltic States?)."
"Is it possible for the Commission to intervene with those responsible for the project who are to blame for its lack of progress?"
"Is the Commission examining, more generally, the need to establish a link between the energy systems in the former eastern bloc and western Europe?"
"Different energy laws apply in practice in the EU Member States."
"This makes it difficult to set up a single European energy market with a free flow of services in this area, as well as at an international level."
"What does the Commission intend to do in the near future to change this situation?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to congratulate our rapporteur Mr Antolin Sánchez Presedo on his excellent work, which aims at greater transparency, clarity and above all efficiency in the generalised system of preferences."
"I would also like to highlight the considerable steps forward made in this new regulation, not only in terms of simplification, with the reduction in the number of systems, while concentrating the benefits of the GSP in the countries that need them most, or in terms of encouraging compliance with practices that are in line with sustainable development and good governance, but also in terms of the quick adoption of the new regulation, in order to provide additional commercial support as soon as possible for the countries affected by the tsunami."
"On this last point, I am, however, concerned about the capacity of the beneficiary countries, and particularly those affected by the tidal wave, to take the necessary administrative steps quickly in order to benefit from the new system. Will the Commission have enough time to correctly evaluate the needs of the countries concerned?"
"I think that the rapporteur’s proposal of a transitional period until January 2006 is the most reasonable, especially as we know that these long and complex procedures have always limited the use of the scheme by poor countries."
"Also, with regard to rules of origin, although I welcome the greater flexibility in the text, it should be a priority for the European Union to harmonise these rules at international level, in particular within the WTO."
"Developing countries have to adapt to the specific rules of origin of each country that grants them a system of preferences, which makes the process very complicated and costly, to the point that sometimes it loses all commercial value. I would also like to stress that Parliament asks the Commission to closely monitor the application of the new system, in order to determine whether it achieves its objectives, country by country."
"I would like to finish by saying that the GSP is not an instrument that can promote development in the poorest countries and their full integration into international trade."
"If we really want to help poor countries to benefit from globalisation, we need to rethink world trade rules as a whole so that they are fairer, linking trade with sustainable development."
"Mr President, there is something highly obnoxious about any trade in human body parts or tissue."
"Therefore, any trade in human egg cells that may be going on from Romania to the United Kingdom is utterly reprehensible and must be condemned."
"I trust the Commission will be more forthcoming as to whether or not it believes such a trade is actually going on."
"The harvesting of egg cells poses serious risks to the health of the women involved, owing to hyper-stimulation of the ovaries."
"It is therefore offensive and utterly wrong that women in economic need in poor countries are being offered financial incentives to become paid donors."
"I would support any moves to stamp out this disgraceful trade."
"The understandable desire of childless couples to have children must not override the human dignity and health of the donors being exploited."
"As the UN General Assembly said today when adopting its declaration against the cloning of human beings, measures need to be taken to prevent the exploitation of women in the application of life sciences."
"This is just such a case."
"Mr President, we are discussing this topic here today, partly because the European Union makes funds available for research into embryonic stem cells."
"I have on a previous occasion expressed my surprise at this in this House, because this research is banned in some Member States and is incompatible with the resolution against all forms of human cloning which was adopted in the General Assembly today."
"The Commission would, however, do well to examine whether or not it is itself partly responsible for this, because it uses European funds to promote research which is punishable in some Member States. It appears to me that the subsidiarity principle is being ignored, because this is not a problem that cannot be resolved at Member State level."
"Commissioner, can you share your view on this trade and can you confirm that research is only funded if this research is permitted in all the Union’s Member States?"
"Are you prepared to adhere to the resolution adopted today in the UN’s General Assembly in which an appeal is made to take measures in order to prevent the exploitation of women?"
"Commissioner, you have made many references to the Directive on tissues and cells, but the question has also been put as to whether this violates the Charter of Fundamental Rights. I do not believe that the Charter of Fundamental Rights can be described as a matter of subsidiarity."
"."
"In order to answer every single question on related and unrelated issues I would need about 45 minutes, which is not possible."
"However, we will answer in writing the question on the legal implications of the violation of fundamental rights and the position we can take on that."
"I am not from the Legal Service and so cannot give a legal opinion here."
"Therefore we will respond in writing, at a later stage. Otherwise, I believe that the main points raised have been answered."
"The next item is the debate on the Council and Commission statements regarding the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy."
"We have with us Mr Schmit representing the Council on this item and Mr Verheugen representing the Commission."
"A number of MEPs will be speaking on behalf of Parliament: they are just taking their seats."
"Mr Schmit, on behalf of the Council, you have the floor."
"Mr President, five years after its adoption, the European Council is to be asked to debate once again the relaunching of the Lisbon strategy, on the occasion of the mid-term review thereof."
"As the Commission has proposed, we must give this strategy a new start, by concentrating our action on achieving stronger and more sustainable growth and on creating more better-quality jobs."
"The European Council will therefore be able to confirm the relevance of the strategy by clarifying its purpose as well as what is at stake."
"The objectives of growth and employment must be pursued via a process of synergy which must be developed between the three dimensions of the strategy, namely the economic, social and environmental dimensions."
"In this context the European Council will also set the priorities which should guide the Union’s action in the social sphere."
"A re-examination of the social agenda must, in fact, supplement and support the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy, particularly as regards the promotion of the social dimension of economic growth."
"As far as the environment is concerned, the European Council should emphasise the contribution to growth and employment made by environmental policy, and should confirm the need to integrate environmental considerations into the Lisbon process."
"Moreover, the European Council will also be examining the Commission’s communication on the sustainable development strategy, but I shall come back to that later because this is an issue which forms an entirely separate item on the Council’s agenda."
"The European Council will also be examining the question of how to improve the governance of the strategy, both Union-wide and at the level of the Member States."
"The question of governance really lies at the heart of the mid-term review."
"It will be a crucial factor in the success of the strategy."
"As far as the Presidency is concerned, this complex issue can be boiled down to a few essential points."
"Firstly, there is the adoption of a set of integrated guidelines making it possible to synchronise and rationalise the various processes which exist at present."
"The fact that there are so many processes and reports is actually responsible, to a large extent, for the lack of transparency of the strategy as perceived by the public, and prevents it from being effectively implemented."
"In the light of the broad guidelines provided by the European Council, the Commission should now submit proposals for guidelines comprising the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines and the Employment Guidelines, and should combine them in a single coherent text."
"Those integrated guidelines would then be endorsed by the European Council and, where required by the Treaty, would be formally adopted by the Council."
"It goes without saying that, within this process, the views of Parliament will be fully taken into consideration."
"Secondly, there is the introduction of the three-year national action programmes."
"This gives Member States greater flexibility in choosing the priorities and methods of action which they use in order to implement the strategy, within the framework laid down by the integrated guidelines to which I have just referred."
"It is proposed that, on the basis of these integrated guidelines, Member States should work out in detail their national action programmes, following the broadest possible consultation between all those involved."
"In order to facilitate consultation and coordination, and the implementation of what is decided upon, each Member State would be able to appoint one public figure who would be responsible for the implementation of the Lisbon strategy."
"Thirdly, there is a monitoring procedure based on a regular assessment of implementation at intermediate meetings."
"The idea is that, each autumn with effect from 2006, Member States should submit a single report on the implementation of their national action programme."
"On that basis the Commission will submit, in January of each year, an assessment report, where necessary accompanied by certain proposals for adjustments, but without that being able to lead to the total reshaping of the integrated guidelines, which will be valid for a period of three years."
"The European Council will then give its opinion on those adjustments."
"The Council, in its various formations, is continuing its work on all the issues linked to the review of the Lisbon strategy, and the General Affairs Council will return to this matter on 16 March, just before the European Council meeting."
"These, then, are the major proposals which are currently being discussed and prepared with a view to the European Council meeting on 22 March."
"Mr President, honourable Members, a month ago, at the Conference of Presidents, I put forward our ideas for a partnership for sustainable growth and employment, thus giving new impetus to the Lisbon Strategy."
"Our objective for this partnership is simple: we have to modernise and invigorate our economy and our social model, and we must improve our quality of life through truly ambitious reforms."
"We have to realise that appropriate environmental policies can result in twin benefits, in terms of employment and ensuring lasting growth; and, in the context of economic stability, we have to improve the ability of our businesses – from the very largest to our small and medium-sized enterprises – to create more and better jobs."
"We also have to enhance productivity through greater investment in knowledge, innovation and people."
"Today is the first opportunity for one of the partners with whom we want to work – one of the most important partners, the European Parliament – to express its views and establish its priorities."
"Both I and the other members of the Commission welcome this debate."
"We want to thank you for the political investment that you have made in order to table a global motion for a resolution that reflects the vast spectrum of opinions within this House."
"We share many of your priorities, and we are sensitive to your concerns."
"Later today we will debate the forthcoming European Council."
"That summit will be the start, and not the end, of the journey as far as the renewed Lisbon Strategy is concerned."
"I fully support the remarks made by the distinguished representative of the Luxembourg presidency."
"We will only succeed if everyone feels that they have a stake in Europe’s success."
"That success depends on presenting a vision that mobilises popular support, gives a real sense of ownership and, above all, leads to real action at a national, regional and local level."
"However, to mobilise support it must be clear why these reforms matter and that they are part of our wider vision."
"They are about people and the issues that matter most to them: the chance to work, a decent start for their children, security in retirement or ill-health, and quality public services."
"They are about a better quality of life and a better standard of living in every part of an enlarged Union, from our city centres to the heart of our rural and coastal communities."
"They are about binding the Union together through 21st-century infrastructure and regional investment."
"They are about making the most of European excellence in our business community – addressing, in particular, the concerns of small- and medium-sized enterprises – and in all areas of creativity, but also in science and technology and in our unique model for society."
"They are also about achieving all this in a way that guarantees future generations the same or better possibilities than we ourselves enjoy."
"This goal of sustainable development underpins the Lisbon Strategy as it does the action of the Union in every area."
"These are broad economic, social and environmental objectives."
"They were at the heart of the Lisbon Strategy when it was launched and remain at its heart today."
"I can promise you that this Commission will fight to ensure that they do so tomorrow, not least as we discuss the future financial perspectives over the months ahead."
"Then and there we will test the real commitment to cohesion and solidarity of those who are today – at least in their political discourse – on the frontline of defence of the European social model."
"Nevertheless, we need to face facts."
"The first five years of the Lisbon Strategy have not delivered the desired results."
"There has been insufficient delivery, little ownership at national level and even less among society at large."
"In key areas, from productivity to research and education spending, early school-leavers or poverty, we have barely made an impression on closing the gaps that existed five years ago."
"We can add to this the challenge of intense global competition and an ageing population."
"These are no longer challenges for the future, but the day-to-day reality for our businesses and workers."
"This is why Lisbon needs a new start, with fresh ambition."
"This is why we propose a new focus on growth and jobs in order to meet those challenges."
"A dynamic and innovative Europe offers us the best chance to do this."
"Vice-President Verheugen will set out in more detail how this new focus translates into concrete action and results."
"This does not mean downgrading action in other areas."
"Our new social agenda, our review of sustainable development and our action on climate change show the Commission’s commitment to moving ahead across a wide range of areas."
"Let me turn to two specific concerns that your resolution addresses."
"The first is the balance within the Lisbon Strategy."
"I know a variety of concerns have been raised about the new focus on actions to promote growth and jobs."
"This is not at all in contradiction with our social and environmental policy."
"Growth is a necessary precondition for an effective and more ambitious programme in terms of solidarity, just as fighting unemployment is the best protection against exclusion and poverty."
"Without growth, without a dynamic economy, there will be no sustainable development; we will not foster convergence between regions and our social and environmental goals will slip out of reach."
"However, I fully accept that lasting growth relies, in turn, on parallel progress on cohesion, our social agenda and addressing unsustainable and damaging environmental trends."
"With regard to the services directive, we need an open and thriving internal market for services in the Union, as well as high-quality, accessible public services."
"They are key factors for a successful society."
"Yet we have identified a number of areas where changes will be required for the broad consensus that we would like to see to emerge."
"We have said that we are ready to work pragmatically with you, the Parliament, and with the presidency, in preparation for your first reading."
"In particular we need to ensure a framework that removes the risk of social dumping, has a broad coverage – but does not necessarily cover healthcare or services of general interest – and addresses genuine concerns about the operation of the country of origin principle."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me end by saying a few words about the governance of the Lisbon strategy."
"I do not think that it is necessary for us to rewrite the Lisbon strategy completely in the course of the next few weeks."
"Having said that, however, a certain number of innovations have been suggested by the Commission and – let us not forget – by Parliament too."
"We proposed that a European Institute of Technology should be created, that greater priority should be given to improving the regulations, particularly in favour of small and medium-sized enterprises, that there should be a greater emphasis on re-examining existing proposals, that the rules on State aid and taxation should be used in a way that would encourage the spirit of enterprise, innovation and research, that employment market reforms should concentrate on measures to help women, young people and older workers to find and keep jobs, and that a European Pact for Youth should be concluded."
"In reality, I think we can say that people have a pretty clear idea of what needs to be done."
"The political challenge this time around lies in finding out how, at Community level, we can help them to do it in reality."
"It is all a matter of ownership."
"It is primarily because Member States – and society in general – have not made the structural reforms their own that a number of those reforms have produced disappointing results over the past five years."
"In response to this situation, we have made the following proposals, which you seem to approve of, if your motions for resolutions are to be believed."
"First of all, we are proposing the formulation of integrated guidelines at European Union level, combining the current Broad Economic Policy Guidelines and the Employment Guidelines, so as to give Member States a clearer idea of what action they are committing themselves to."
"For the first time, micro-economic reforms will be dealt with in detail."
"This will therefore be an integrated vision encompassing macro-economic policies, micro-economic reforms and employment policy, so that Lisbon will not have a purely decorative role, but will really lie at the heart of our economic policy."
"Secondly, we are proposing the development of national Lisbon programmes adapted to fit national situations."
"Of course, the initiative will lie with Member States, but we have already prepared, at the same time, a European Union programme on the Lisbon strategy, which offers initiatives at Community level and thus explains in detail what needs to be done at Community level and what needs to be done at national level."
"Thirdly, we are proposing the simplification of the compulsory provision of information, at both Community and national level, so that Member States can devote more time to implementing the reforms and less time to writing reports about them which most people will ignore."
"Therefore less importance should be attached to reports than to an integrated vision of the reforms currently taking place."
"It is our ambition to develop active participation in these reforms, and to put them at the heart of national political debates."
"The European Council taking place this spring will not be the end of the road: on the contrary, it will give political impetus to the new approach."
"However, in order to be entirely consistent, the broad policy guidelines defined in March will have to guide the financial decisions to be taken in June."
"The Union must not be content with being ambitious."
"If it wants to succeed, it will also have to mobilise resources to match its ambitions."
"In this respect, a proactive agreement on the financial perspective, placing the proper emphasis on cohesion, would be a crucial factor in strengthening and developing our social model over the next few years."
"At the same time, the European Council will also be opening the way for debates at national and regional level on the action programmes which Member States have been asked to submit this autumn."
"I personally expect a great deal from these debates."
"The Lisbon strategy must take its inspiration from the partnerships and dialogues which the cohesion policy has put in place in recent years between the various people involved at national, local and social level."
"Unless this happens, it will not be possible to mobilise those partners who are affected by its implementation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me just say that, following my meetings with the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, I find it very encouraging that those institutions have, generally speaking, warmly welcomed our review of the Lisbon strategy."
"I am also particularly pleased to see the joint declaration issued recently by the two major European trade-union and employers’ organisations."
"It is, therefore, possible to reach a balanced consensus on ambitious reforms."
"It goes without saying that within this partnership the Members of the European Parliament will play a major role if we really want to implement these reforms."
"This is why I am asking you to make your contribution each year to the work of the spring European Council which, in accordance with the Treaty, lays down the guidelines which will direct the process, and also, of course, to take the lead in the political discussions which will mobilise support at national, regional and local level."
"This is our conception of the partnership which this Commission wishes to establish with you."
"We believe that, on that basis, and with that commitment, it will be possible to do much more for our Europe."
". Mr President, honourable Members, the great growth and employment initiative that we are discussing in this House today is the Commission’s most important project for the coming five years, by the success of which we – and not we alone – will, we know, be judged."
"All European institutions will be judged by whether or not this growth and employment initiative is a success, for the people of Europe expect us to really reverse a trend and keep Europe up to the mark in global, and ever more acute, competition at a high level – and I emphasise ‘at a high level’."
"The prescriptions that we sometimes hear for how to deal with the perils of an ageing society, with the dangers of increasing globalisation, with the ever-more complicated ways in which work is shared out around the world, the prescriptions that we sometimes hear to the effect that competitiveness must be achieved by cutting wages and downgrading social and environmental standards – such prescriptions are wrong."
"Instead of being able to indulge in downward competition, we will have to hold fast to the fact that Europe’s ability to compete is dependent on the quality of its goods and services and on the leading position that they occupy, and we should not be too abashed to say loud and clear that something made and sold in Europe can not only claim to be ‘number one’ in terms of technology and quality, but also that it embodies certain European values, such as the idea that our products and services cannot come into being by dint of the ruthless exploitation of the environment or ruthless trampling on people’s rights."
"I am firmly convinced that, in the long term, such a European philosophy of economic policy gains us a competitive advantage, for the other dynamic regions of the world cannot get away from the fact that people want higher environmental and social standards."
"I want to explicitly stress that the growth and employment initiative, the new Lisbon agenda, is a project that can work only if it is understood as being founded on partnership."
"People may well think, ‘right, let that lot in Strasbourg and Brussels get on with it, and we’ll watch them fail yet again’, but it can only work if the European institutions and the Member States regard this project as a shared responsibility."
"The President has just had something to say about the doubts expressed by some Member States about the way we intend to implement this strategy, and it is they whom I am addressing when I say that we have no intention of building up a ponderous mechanism of reporting, recommendations and sanctions; what we want is a model in which we, together, set out and analyse the policy’s outcomes."
"We do, however, need to have these summarised in a progress report, and that has to be based on progress reports from the Member States."
"These are nothing for anyone to be afraid of, for, even now, the Member States have to submit detailed reports; indeed, what we are now proposing reduces the burden on them."
"Nobody need have any fear that the Commission plans to draw up rankings, or, as one says, to ‘name and shame’ anyone, but we must be able to see clearly what we have achieved in a year and what we have yet to achieve."
"Secondly, the Commission is pressing hard for the governments of the Member States to appoint members – ministers – who will have responsibility for coordinating the Lisbon strategy in their countries."
"This strategy must have faces associated with it."
"The most natural solution would be for this function to be taken on by the ministers who sit on the Competitiveness Council, whose remit includes the Lisbon Strategy in any case."
"That would also enable this Council, which is currently looking for a new role, to find one and be much more effective in playing it."
"The Commission is very, very emphatic in recommending this option."
"The last point I want to make is that I will, in the course of this year, be producing a series of important initiatives to flesh out the project’s European dimension."
"Everything that the Commission presents will be subject to prior approval, judged in terms of what contribution a particular project or initiative makes to growth and employment in Europe."
"That is the question that must be answered in all cases, and answer it we will."
"We will very soon be presenting to you major policy initiatives in my own area of responsibility, and the order in which I shall now list them is a matter of deliberate choice."
"First of all comes better lawmaking."
"The ‘Better Lawmaking’ project has, to put it tactfully, been trundling along for some considerable time."
"It needs a clear political direction."
"It has to be clear that improved lawmaking is something that has an immediate and direct effect on the productivity and quality of the European economy."
"It is another thing that we cannot work for unless we do it together."
"Parliament has a great part to play in this, as does the Council, as do the Member States and the Commission."
"It is not just about future lawmaking and how we ensure that it improves competitiveness; it is also about the as it stands at present and examining it to see whether we really do still need all the things we have enacted over the past decades or whether a considerable degree of simplification is possible in this area."
"Secondly, Europe possesses vast and virtually unused potential in terms of economic performance; it is there, before our very eyes, we often talk about it, and yet little is done about it."
"I am talking about the 25 million small and medium-sized businesses in Europe, which provide two-thirds of our total workforce."
"Let us not be content with telling those 25 million that they are the backbone of the European economy, and then do nothing beyond that."
"Instead, we need a policy that makes use of the sector’s enormous potential in terms of innovation, investment capacity, and creativity, and turns it into jobs."
"I will shortly be putting before you proposals for the comprehensive modernisation and upgrading – I stress ‘upgrading’ – of Europe’s policy on small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Thirdly, there is industrial policy; the word itself calls forth fear in some Member States."
"We need a modern definition of industrial policy for the twenty-first century."
"It can no longer be what it was in the past, with protective fences being put up around certain industries; here, too, the only thing to do is to maintain competitiveness and enhance it, but we need to be aware that Europe needs a strong and long-term industrial base, and so it will be necessary to consider European industry sector by sector and to discuss with all the stakeholders – companies, trade unions, legislatures and governments – which framework conditions are the best for the sector under consideration, enabling it to make the maximum use of its potential for growth."
"The last topic I want to mention is that of innovation."
"Here, too, the Commission will be coming up with new and far-reaching proposals."
"Innovation is the link in the chain between research, development and production, and it is where Europe is not strong enough."
"We need to improve our capacity for turning what comes out of research into innovation, and to do so everywhere."
"The Americans, among others, are much better at it."
"The present Commission is firmly convinced that Europe is strong enough to face up to the challenges of global competition."
"In almost every sector of the economy, there is at least one European company or country that leads the world."
"To put it another way, we can do it."
"We can learn from one another."
"We can support each other making use of the potential that exists in our societies, but we will need to give the European institutions the capacities to implement a policy along these lines, and so, before I conclude my speech, I cannot do other than observe that growth and employment policy is a powerful instrument for achieving these long-term policy goals of ours, but the figures in the next Financial Perspective must reflect it."
"I think the only thing I can say on this is that it would do serious damage to the success of our growth and employment policy if the uncertainty about the next Financial Perspective were to persist for some time."
"As a matter of urgency, I appeal to the Member States to take to heart the fact that great projects need time for preparation."
"Time is not on our side."
"It is also an issue of Europe’s credibility in the eyes of the public; we must be prepared to demonstrate that what we say will be backed up by what we do."
"It is also a fact that action costs money – there is nothing I can do about that."
"Without a Budget that produces the goods, without a clear Financial Perspective, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve what we aim to do."
". Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start this very, very, important debate with very warm thanks to both the rapporteurs, Mr Lehne and Mr Désir, for the work they have done."
"While extending thanks to the chairman of the steering committee, Mr Daul, and our group’s coordinator, Mrs Thyssen, whose work has been outstanding, I also would like to thank those, not all of whom I can name, have played their part in enabling us – it is to be hoped – to get a broad majority in a good cause when we vote at midday."
"The Commission – whose President and Vice-President we welcome here today – has set the right priorities for its five-year term of office: growth and employment."
"Our group is very definitely behind them in this, and we are also glad to see the Commission represented here not only by such important members, but also in such numbers."
"What is at stake is the European Union’s ability to compete."
"Let us just look at a few figures and compare ourselves with our main competitors, our partners and friends in the United States."
"If we take the standard in the fifteen-Member State EU as 100, the enlargement to 25 Member States reduced our productivity per worker to 93, while work productivity in the USA stands at 121."
"That shows the competitive advantage that the United States of America enjoy."
"In itself, the fact that our people are living longer is very much cause for rejoicing, but it is one of the great challenges we face, in that the question arises of how we make use of older people’s experience."
"In the Europe of 25, the employment rate stands at 40%, while it is 59.9% in the United States."
"Ought we not to be giving thought to how to enhance older people’s potential and experience, and improve their work opportunities?"
"If we turn to research and development, we see that the European Union’s 25 Member States spend 1.9% of GNP on it, as against the USA’s 2.8%."
"It is clear from that what a massive effort we have to make."
"Our group very much welcomes the substance of two amendments that speak of the need for us to strengthen the spirit of entrepreneurship."
"Vice-President Verheugen was right to stress the role of small and medium-sized enterprises, the need for us to create a culture of risk-taking, the need for us to encourage personal initiative and personal responsibility, and, above all, for economic legislation that is unbureaucratic and that businesses, particularly small and medium-sized ones, can comprehend, with a simple and fair tax system and the predictability that we need in economic policy."
"What that means is that we have to make it possible for those who work in business to have confidence in those who hold political office."
"It is crucial that we should develop a growth-oriented macro-economic environment, that we should have a stable currency and dynamic development in our economy and labour market, and that we should reduce state debt."
"I cannot therefore do other than encourage all the actors to reform the Stability Pact in such a way that – assuming they succeed in this – the Pact ends up being at the heart of our shared efforts."
"What we need is reform, flexibility, the acceptance of responsibility, less red tape, and if we succeed in all these things, that will also facilitate solidarity – in the shape of a very rational and far-sighted social policy – with those people in our community, in our Member States, who are in need of it."
"What we demand of the Member States is that they should make their contribution to a Europe that is capable of development and that fosters growth, a Europe with a growing economy."
"That is not, however, an end in itself; rather, the object is the creation of jobs, enabling people to get involved and make use of their options in Europe."
"Such is now our common task."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with Commissioner Verheugen that the realisation of the Lisbon strategy will, over the coming five years, be the most important of the Commission’s projects."
"I also share the view – taken not only by the Commission, but also by all the European institutions and all the Member States of the European Union – that the project is complete in itself, and that, in order for it to succeed, all alike must play their parts in it."
"I want to join in thanking the members of the ad hoc committee – my colleagues Mr Désir and Mr Goebbels, as well as Mr Klaus-Heiner Lehne – and of my own group, for all of them did very intensive work and made a very constructive contribution to the broad and consensual text that we have before us today."
"We spent a long time discussing what we should emphasise when talking about the achievement of the Lisbon goals."
"What I hear said today echoes in a positive way the messages we sent out from our debate."
"I agree that Lisbon will fail if people come to feel that it aims to recast the European social model, and if possible to downgrade it, but if, as a project, it enhances Europe’s prosperity by making it a more competitive continent, while at the same time maintaining the social framework conditions that can make it possible for every person in this Union to live decently, by creating jobs and social security for young and old: if that is what Lisbon leads them to feel, then it is a project that the people will accept."
"It is on that that its success depends – on whether a project gains popular acceptance or not."
"For forty or fifty years, the whole point of the European Union was that it kept the peace in Europe, achieving a balance between the poor and the rich, bringing a divided continent together and overcoming division."
"All these things we have achieved."
"For as long as it was a success, the people regarded Europe as their project, but that period of history is coming to its end and people are asking more and more what the point of Europe is."
"For more and more of them, this is a very personal question."
"People want to know, not only about Europe’s values, but also about the European Union’s economic benefits, and the European Union is of economic benefit in that, being an integrated Europe and an internal market with the capacity to unleash its own economic and social power, it is this continent’s organised answer to the challenge of globalisation; making social and economic sense of it is precisely what the Lisbon strategy is about, and that is what made it a good start and a good decision."
"The fact that we have been engaged in this process for a number of years now, and are not satisfied, must not prompt us to give up; instead we must muster our courage and press on."
"I think the text we will be adopting today shows that a broad majority in this House will join the other institutions – the Commission and, I hope, the Council, as well as the individual Member States – in their efforts, for what both Commissioner Verheugen and the President of the Commission have said today is crucial: it is not we alone, nor the institutions of the EU alone, but, above all, the Member States must pull their weight."
"I am very much in agreement with Commissioner Verheugen’s view, and would like to make that clear on behalf of my group."
"I was also delighted to see the President of the Commission smile with pleasure when Commissioner Verheugen pointed out the connection between the Financial Perspective and the Lisbon process."
"If this project is going to succeed, it will not do so on the basis of ever more tasks with ever fewer financial resources; that will not work."
"Those who want this project to succeed while leaving the resources unchanged must not be left without an answer when they want to reallocate them for the benefit of the Lisbon goals."
"People may say that we are capping; fair enough, but if an upper limit is imposed when no more money is available, a qualitative decision will have to be taken as to which investments under the Lisbon strategy will have to be stopped, and to the detriment of which other tasks."
"So far, the Council and the Member States have maintained a dignified silence as to what these might be, but, at some point, they will have to be put to the test."
"I expect from the Commission the sort of commitment we have heard today from Commissioner Verheugen and from the President of the Commission."
"Let the Heads of State or Government be told that the point of the Financial Perspective must be none other than to help achieve the Lisbon objectives, where these are taken seriously."
"This connection is, in our view, important, as are their three points: better regulation, the strengthening of small and medium-sized enterprises and a pro-active industrial policy to secure both industrial jobs and the environmental standards and quality of our products, thereby making us better able to compete in export markets."
"Yes, we, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, are all in favour of that, for all these things, above all else, create one thing, and that is work, which, in its turn, creates social security."
"That, for us, is the starting point."
"I am grateful to all those on the ad hoc committee who helped to bring about a broad majority in this House on this crucial issue."
"As we see it, one thing is clear: if this House adopts resolutions that bear the stamp of the Right, the Left will have no part in them."
"If this House adopts resolutions reflecting what we Social Democrats think, then they will enjoy our support."
". Mr President, for the President of the Commission to succeed in his Lisbon Agenda he needs the Member States to take it seriously."
"The Council presidency’s plea this morning for somebody in each Member State to take responsibility is well judged."
"Moreover, President Barroso, you will need political will in the Council and support in this House for your reforms, neither of which is yet fully evident."
"Europe’s right-wing parties have still not yet embraced the central fact of globalisation that the nation-state and the free market are no longer compatible."
"Free movement of goods and capital without similarly free movement of services and labour is economic nonsense."
"And the left is still riven by dissent over the role of the state in managing the economy."
"President Barroso, Europe’s Liberals and Democrats will remain steadfast and united in support of your agenda, provided you recognise that the forces which spur growth and create new jobs lie in entrepreneurship and in the determination to make a great product or provide a great new service."
"The real competition in the global economy is to attract investment capital to back new ideas and create new jobs."
"Unless the single market can be made to work properly, we will lose that battle."
"Liberals and Democrats do not deny that government has a role in economic management."
"When a better educated, wealthier, more assertive public has developed ethical concerns and a higher sensitivity to risk, and when companies value intangible assets like corporate reputation, there is a demand for active and responsible government."
"For that reason we welcome your REACH proposals, for example, or a commitment to bringing aircraft emissions into the emissions trading system."
"Government too has a role in protecting citizens from fraud or market failure and levelling the playing field not only between businesses, but also between business and the citizen."
"That is why my Group supported the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive in the last mandate and will support proposals for greater legal certainty in cross-border transactions in this Parliament."
"To us, getting the balance of economic policy right seems fundamental."
"We therefore have serious reservations about, for example, a poorly prepared software patents directive, which seems of more benefit to multinationals than to smaller inventors."
"Greater intellectual rigour needs to be applied if Mr McCreevy’s proposal is to secure a majority at second reading."
"Patents should protect innovation, rather than stifle competition."
"Without a coherent intellectual property regime across the European Union, we will create few new European companies."
"Finally, a single market in services must be the centrepiece of the Lisbon Agenda, to provide growth and jobs."
"But Liberals and Democrats recognise a big difference between the functioning of a market and the discharge of a public service, and the Services Directive will need some changes to reflect that."
"President Barroso, you recognise that if Europe’s growth rates continue to lag, we will not provide the same degree of security, prosperity and opportunity for our citizens as others enjoy."
"We will support your efforts to kick-start Europe’s economy but we are not blind to the weakness of measuring economic progress only in quantitative terms."
"For example, cars that are safer, more fuel efficient and easier to dismantle after use reduce economic growth in classical terms but create another type of good."
"We will expect your Commission to be open to such ideas."
"To improve the economic vitality and the social and environmental health of our continent simultaneously, the Lisbon Agenda must combine flexibility, fairness and farsightedness."
"If it does, the Burghers of Lisbon will be proud to have lent their name to Europe’s success."
"Just as Henry the Navigator guided Europe’s pioneers in the discovery of new lands and great wealth, so you can guide us in the discovery of similar economic success."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if we compare this morning’s speeches and the resolution on the review of the Lisbon Strategy, which we are about to put to the vote, with Mr Barroso’s speech of a few weeks ago, we cannot help feeling pleased that there is now broad agreement, at least in principle, on the fact that relaunching the Lisbon and Gothenburg Strategy depends on finding an essential new balance among the three dimensions of the strategy, that is to say its environmental, economic and social dimensions."
"Nonetheless, we do not feel that that is enough, at least in its current form, for us to take part in the political compromise that is taking shape."
"We are obviously pleased that some of our proposals have been included in the joint resolution, but we believe there are still gaps in the text."
"It lacks a clear choice as to the instruments that we should have at our disposal to achieve our goals, and it lacks guarantees that the Commission – and Parliament as well – will be willing and able to stand up to those who do not believe in the need for European control of the economy and are pressing for renationalisation of the cohesion policies, a backward reform of the labour market and a further cut in the Union’s budget."
"Because of the concern to reach a compromise, contradictory elements have been included in the resolution, leaving the message confused instead of more convincing."
"We have picked out a number of incongruities in the text."
"It is a fact that nobody likes paying taxes, but we do not share the aim of indiscriminately cutting taxes to a minimum, because that would only lead to greater social inequalities."
"Europe needs a tax reform that reduces labour costs and taxes other sectors."
"Jacques Delors said as much very many years ago, but nothing has been done since then and instead the subject has dropped out of the European debate."
"Secondly, the resolution retains a remarkably moderate and even ambiguous stance on three extremely important topics, which are going to be the subject of some hard legislative wrangling over the coming months; they are the services directive, the REACH regulation and the software patents directive."
"The outcome of the wrangling will show whether the Lisbon Strategy is just a return to old Thatcherite formulas or the beginning of a genuine New Deal for Europe."
"Mr President, Mr McCreevy, we think that the Bolkestein directive should be withdrawn so that we can start off again on the right foot, in other words with a directive on services of public interest."
"Mr Verheugen, we believe that the REACH regulation in its current form is already just enough of a compromise between the undoubtedly important arguments of industry and the priorities of health and the environment."
"It is a compromise that the Commission and Parliament too should defend tooth and nail against the aggressive lobbying of the chemical industry, which does not understand that organising an efficient and credible control system is the best way to ensure its competitiveness."
"Lastly, I think that coming out explicitly against the patentability of software means affirming that innovation ‘made in Europe’ is fostered through the freedom and dissemination of knowledge and not by protecting the large multinationals and their monopolies."
"Mr President, a basic ambiguity hangs over this text in relation to the true added value of the Union compared with action taken by national governments."
"In our view, such added value derives from the ability to invest in instruments for growth, which cannot be reduced just to GDP percentages, and in sectors that are not strictly tangible, such as education and culture. That is done by making use of renewable resources and sustainable solutions and gradually abandoning sectors that use up and waste resources, such as major infrastructure works and intensive agriculture, and those that create major health and environmental risks, such as nuclear energy, GM organisms and harmful chemical products."
"Mr President, we shall be on your side in making these choices when that is possible, but we shall be against you and on the side of the people of Europe when it is not."
"Mr President, in March 2000 the Heads of State or Government of the Union, as well as the Commission, wanted to prove that social action was possible via liberal means."
"Their decisive objective of moving towards full employment by 2010 gave rise, here and there, to real hopes."
"Five years later, the situation is a cruel disappointment."
"Unemployment remains, on average, about 9% in Europe, where lack of job security is increasing rapidly."
"In the Union’s premier economy, that of Germany, which holds the absolute record for exports, unemployment has nevertheless exceeded the five-million mark."
"In order to achieve the Lisbon objective, that is to say a 70% employment rate by 2010, it would be necessary to create 22 million more jobs than the present rate over the next five years."
"This is hard to imagine at a time when the European Central Bank has just revised its growth forecast for the euro zone, reducing it to 1.6% for this year, and when countries such as Italy and the Netherlands are on the verge of recession."
"However, things are not going badly for everybody. observes that there has been an explosion in the profits of the big companies."
"Their share in the GDP of Europe and of Asia, as the British journal points out, has achieved a level which is without precedent in the last 25 years."
"The workers, it explains, are the major losers."
"Yet who is talking about the workers here?"
"For its part, the organisation ATD Fourth World regrets the fact that nowhere in its communication of 2 February does the Commission mention the objective of eliminating poverty, which currently affects 68 million people in the Union."
"Do you not think that such a radical separation between the objectives announced yesterday and the results obtained today justifies our asking some serious questions about the relevance of the liberal dogmas which have served, from the start, as the basis for the Lisbon process? ."
"Yet what are the messages from Brussels which our fellow citizens are hearing day after day?"
"Mrs Danuta Hübner, Commissioner for Regional Policy, wants to facilitate delocalisations in Europe."
"For Mr Špidla, Commissioner for Employment and Social Affairs, our objective is, above all, flexibility."
"The Vice-President responsible for industry, Mr Verheugen, hits the nail on the head in the French press, when he says that, with the Lisbon strategy, there were so many priorities that there were none, and that this time we want an action plan which is specific and which concentrates on competitiveness."
"For her part, Mrs Nellie Kroes, Commissioner for Competition, has declared that she wants to do away with State aids of a regional nature in the 15 older Member States of the Union."
"As for Mr Mandelson, Commissioner for Trade, he has reminded Member States of their duty to continue to reform their labour markets and their welfare systems."
"Finally, Mr McCreevy, the Commissioner responsible for the internal market, deserves special mention."
"He brought to an end the long-running saga on the withdrawal, revision or retention of the Bolkestein Directive, explaining that there is no question of withdrawing this text, despite the fact that it had been rejected on all sides."
"He immediately followed that by refusing, in collaboration with the Council, to re-examine the directive on software patenting, despite the fact that this had been unanimously demanded by the parliamentary groups."
"Finally, at the European Policy Forum in London, he revealed his true opinion, with Anglo-Saxon bluntness, by saying, and I quote Mr McCreevy,"
"‘We should remember that the internal market programme is by far the greatest deregulatory exercise in recent history.’"
"This is what Mr Barroso calls ‘a new focus on growth and jobs’."
"Do you not sense, therefore, that people feel that they are moving irresistibly closer to the liberalism-overdose threshold, and that the rejection of this model will, sooner or later, return like a boomerang to rebound on the Union’s governing bodies in one form or another?"
"My group is campaigning precisely in order to help this opinion to be expressed, not against Europe – and there is a danger of that happening – but in favour of its profound transformation."
"That is why we obviously cannot give our backing to the compromise resolution which has been tabled today, and that is why we have submitted an alternative version."
"– Mr President, the Kok report, as it is known, argues that there are synergistic effects and states that every euro spent on development projects by the EU may be worth considerably more than the same amount spent by the individual Member States."
"EU projects may, then, reduce the need for state appropriations to the individual Member States."
"Increased EU funding need not, therefore, result in an increased tax burden."
"In the case of large projects such as space initiatives and those involving nuclear power, there may be economies of scale to be gained from carrying on projects at EU level."
"Otherwise I believe that the Lisbon Process should primarily be funded by the Member States themselves."
"The Lisbon Process must not be allowed to become the jumping-off point for a large number of new projects at EU level that require funding by the Member States."
"In general, I think that the issue of whether national initiatives can be replaced by EU projects is an important one."
"I wonder whether there is any empirical evidence of the existence of synergistic effects."
"My experience tends to suggest the opposite: the more the EU invests in expanding its bureaucracy and the more legislation and directives it adopts, the more the public sector in the Member States grows."
"For each new official in Brussels, the total number of officials in the Member States increases by a factor of five, ten or twenty-five."
"According to what is known as public choice theory, it is to be expected that each national bureaucracy will seek to maximise its influence and role."
"The more the EU takes over power from the bureaucracies in the Member States, the more these bureaucracies expand."
"There are many reasons for this. The new directives have to be implemented, monitoring must be tightened up."
"Moreover, the politicians who have lost their right of initiative seek out new areas in which to act and tell us that more resources are needed in order to strengthen their negotiating position in Brussels."
"As an example of this, we only need to look at what happened on the launch of the euro."
"As the national central banks lost their real function – that of conducting monetary policy – the number of their service staff increased substantially."
"This same phenomenon can be observed in a number of areas."
"In my opinion, the Commission should take the initiative and allow independent researchers, economists and political scientists to study the operation of the bureaucratic multiplier within the EU."
"It is important to stop this process, and one of the ways of doing this is by having fewer legislative directives and more voluntary agreements."
"If this is not done, it is likely that the biggest growth sector will prove to be public bureaucracy."
"Through our ambitions to harmonise, legislate and become involved in every conceivable issue, we run the risk of putting a brake on growth. The EU should, therefore, instead make more use of the institutional competition that resides in diversity."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it will be impossible to achieve the objectives laid down by the Lisbon Strategy unless the European Union radically changes the way it addresses the economic and social problems that characterise contemporary society in Europe and the rest of the world."
"We live in a globalised market economy, which only appears to support free competition."
"A prerequisite for free competition, in fact, is starting off on the same footing, or at least on a comparable footing, based on negotiated trade-offs."
"That prerequisite does not exist in practice, just as there is also no mobility policy in the various sectors that might help to revitalise competitiveness and hence employment."
"Politics, finance and the economy have to find new rules for running the system imposed by the global market, to replace the rules that governed the market before globalisation."
"Europe’s institutions must be short-sighted and unable to grasp the consequences of globalised information over the Internet if they still believe that getting together and announcing a series of intentions is enough to make them actually materialise."
"It is not sufficient to make long-term plans which are handed down from on high."
"History shows that during the last century a great power’s economy collapsed under the weight of reality because of centralised plans that were splendid only in theory."
"Reality does not depend on plans; on the contrary, plans have to take account of reality."
"At this stage in our society it cannot be enough to have an economy still based exclusively on unbridled consumerism."
"At the Lisbon European Council, when the knowledge-based society was first defined, a few issues were overlooked, such as making rules to ensure that knowledge is genuine and not manipulated or used for illicit ends."
"In addition, the Lisbon strategy will not be able to take off if the Union’s objectives do not include identifying and implementing measures to provide developing countries with effective help, leading them to democracy and respect for human rights and the rights of workers and children."
"It is essential to think in terms of social economics in parallel with development economics."
"To achieve this aim, Europe has to change its relations with those countries where workers do not enjoy social security or legal protection and where children cannot play but are forced to work."
"Environmental protection and the creation of a European social model are goals that must be pursued."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the aim of the Lisbon strategy is to safeguard the prosperity and cohesion of European society, and to ensure it continues to develop."
"It is essential to establish sources of funding that make it possible to achieve these goals, yet at the same time it is crucial that the cost of living be as low as possible."
"Cheap services and products are particularly important for the poorest groups in society."
"Developments in research allowing wider access to modern technologies, and production methods enabling us to compete with countries outside the EU, are examples of ways in which it will be possible to achieve the Lisbon goals."
"Priority should also be given to the effective implementation of modern production methods thanks to which jobs can be created that are both modern and secure."
"Modern, cheap and high-quality production makes it possible to compete on external markets, which in practice then results in new jobs in the production and services sectors."
"Implementation of the Lisbon strategy entails the analysis of a number of areas of activity involving both the European Union and its Member States."
"One of the main problems we face as far as the Lisbon strategy is concerned is ensuring that the appropriateness of the goals set for research and for implementation programmes."
"The current system for laying down guidelines on research and for channelling funds towards individual research projects is heavily exploited by those Member States that are largest in economic terms."
"Over the past few decades, leading research and development centres have been established in Europe, for example in Finland or Saxony."
"Over the next five years, a great many new centres of this kind should be set up, in order to close the gap between the EU and the global leaders in this field."
"We must increase expenditure on research to at least 3% of GDP, as well as employing at least one million more people in science and research and putting in place procedures to guarantee funds are spent effectively."
"Major organisational changes must be made to the present set-up in order to ensure the cohesion of measures."
"For example, an appropriate number of research centres should be established in accordance with planned developments in technology and production, with the aim of bringing together local research units."
"The latter should be established in order to exploit the intellectual potential of countries that could not afford to build modern research facilities, and therefore to carry out research on their own."
"In addition to research, both the local units and the research centres should carry out teaching and take on talented young PhD students, thus creating a new cadre of researchers."
"An action plan of this kind would help to fill the gap left by those researchers who have been poached by countries outside the EU."
"The primary aim of science and technology as a whole should be to promote small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The development of the latter would eliminate unemployment, yet they cannot afford to carry out research or to implement progressive and modern production methods."
"Three programmes should be set up relating to research, the employment of researchers and the cohesion of such measures in the EU Member States."
"These should comprise a programme laying down guidelines for regional development and the specialisation of production in European countries, a programme aimed at setting up a European system for research and the training of researchers, plus a programme designed to provide information, facilitate the introduction of new technologies and products and ensure that they are applied in production."
"The aim of these programmes should be to reduce any negative economic impact caused by the planned introduction of the REACH programme to a minimum."
"The system according to which research measures are carried out ought to be simple, easy-to-understand and based on the principle of competitiveness, which will ensure it is effective and encourage investment by the private sector."
"In order to gain public and political support, the system must promote cohesion …"
"Mr President, we in Europe are facing a historic challenge, one to which the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is prepared to rise, because we want future generations to prosper and be enabled to enjoy our social model, have jobs and claim a reasonable pension afterwards."
"This is impossible without economic growth or jobs. We must achieve these with an ageing population and against the background of the aggressive globalisation of the economy."
"In order to succeed, we need insight and vision, but also the right decisions, which, above all, we need to carry out."
"A European stick behind national doors in the shape of a new form of governance will certainly prove useful."
"We appreciate the fact that the Barroso Commission has taken the brave decision to revive and breathe new life into the Lisbon strategy and, on the recommendation of the Kok working party, has opted to give priority to growth and jobs in a balanced social and ecological context."
"It testifies to honesty and is also in keeping with our approach of a citizens’ Europe founded upon values."
"We have given our wholehearted support to the steering committee’s recommendation, and to that made by the Conference of Presidents, and indeed, although the formulation is general, it is up to the Member States to make specific choices."
"We will indicate the way and have made our basic position quite clear."
"We must opt in favour of competitiveness, a positive business climate – definitely also including SMEs – and economic growth and jobs."
"The three initiatives announced by the Commission will certainly have a place in those."
"We must provide the means in order to achieve these ends."
"The Member States must plan and deliver."
"We will encourage the national parliaments to galvanise their governments into action."
"Reforms need to be carried out now in order to allow for sustainable development in all respects."
"Finally, all of us, including all institutions and all social partners at European, local and national level, must all do our level best."
"I am therefore pleased to find out that the Socialist Group in this House takes a positive view of the resolution."
"This once again throws open the possibility of a constructive dialogue, which will benefit Parliament’s work and responsibilities."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr Vice-President, first of all I should like to thank my co-rapporteur, Mr Klaus-Heiner Lehne, for the work which we did together on the preparation of the motion for a resolution on which Parliament will be voting today."
"I am also pleased to have heard already, in the remarks of the President and the Vice-President of the Commission, an echo of what our resolution expresses."
"In recent years the European Union has acquired a currency of its own, has been enlarged, and has adopted a draft Constitution; in other words, broadly speaking, it has established its framework."
"Now, however, the substance of its policies does not match up to its citizens’ expectations."
"That is why it has to concentrate on growth, on employment, on social and territorial cohesion, not only because these are the very objectives of this process of building Europe – now that peace is assured – but also because they are the prerequisites for the public’s support for the political plans for the construction of Europe, as Mr Martin Schulz has reminded us."
"That is why we believe that it is important to state that the Lisbon strategy must be the Union’s priority over the next five years."
"We believe that this strategy is the right one, provided that it is taken seriously, in other words provided that it is effectively implemented in the Member States in the three dimensions defined at the 2000 Summit under the Portuguese Presidency."
"Our objective must be to put our money on European competitiveness and growth, by basing them on the elements of the European model and not – as we sometimes have the impression that you are doing, Mr President, when you mention your three threads – by setting one of those three threads against the other two."
"We think that we can only properly serve the interests of economic competitiveness by looking after the social and environmental aspects equally well."
"We do not believe that Europe has a future as a low-cost competitor."
"I am delighted to hear you mention the need to put our money on excellence, high-quality training for the labour force, human capital, research, and the quality of infrastructures and public services."
"These are advantages which will ensure that investors back the European Union."
"It is because the European Union’s products will be based to a greater extent on technology, know-how and eco-innovation that they will find their place in the world markets."
"It is because we are relaunching growth on that basis that we shall have the resources to finance effectively a high level of training, distribution and social cohesion within the Union and in particular the enlarged Union."
"There is therefore a battle to be fought, and clarifications to be made."
"In fact – and I welcome the fact that in this Parliament, essentially, by means of our motion for a resolution, we have managed to avoid these pitfalls – there are a certain number of people who would like to see the Lisbon strategy reduced to a sort of magic formula, a programme of wholesale liberalisation: liberalisation of the services market, liberalisation of the employment market, and liberalisation of pension schemes, as if that was enough in itself to ensure the relaunching of European growth and of competitiveness."
"In my view, not only is that rather limited, but it is also completely beside the point."
"Europe needs reforms, and we are all agreed on that."
"It needs to adapt and to have a more dynamic economy, but it also needs investment, it needs to restimulate internal demand, and it needs to coordinate its efforts and to concentrate them on what can, in future, constitute its wealth and its opportunity in international competition."
"That is why our resolution puts the emphasis on a financial perspective which is consistent with the Lisbon strategy, in other words the doubling of the European research budget and constant effort as regards the major trans-European networks, social cohesion and regional policy."
"That is why our resolution puts the emphasis on an ambitious social agenda which must be integrated into this overall strategy, and on the fact that the road map which you have presented to us – the legislative and budgetary action plan – must relate to the three dimensions of the Lisbon strategy."
"At the moment we have the feeling that there is still a lack of balance, that most of the specific proposals concentrate on competitiveness, the economy and structural reforms, and that there is a lack of incentives, information and legislative initiatives in the area of social cohesion and on environmental issues."
"For example, we now want to see a real draft framework directive on services of general interest."
"We would like to see a reform of the European Works Councils, in order to enable us to say that the quality of employer-employee relations in Europe is part of our development strategy."
"In the area of eco-innovations, we should like to see more specific initiatives, and we are pleased to note that, finally, industrial policy linked to innovation and aid for small and medium-sized enterprises has been included in the Commission’s programme."
"That is the essence of the message which will be expressed by the European Parliament."
"I am delighted that we have achieved very broad agreement once again thanks to the work of Mr Daul, Mr Lehne and Mrs Thyssen."
"I am sorry that a certain number of other groups on the Left feel unable to join us, on the basis of the content of this resolution."
"I can understand that there are still differences, but I can quite honestly say that I believe we have managed to come up with a clear, strong message which is in line with a Lisbon strategy which contributes to the European social model."
"Mr President, five years after the launch of the Lisbon Strategy it is clear that we need to give it a fresh start."
"This new start should not, however, follow the line of the Commission proposal."
"I am not critical about what is contained in the proposal, but rather what is not in the proposal."
"Separating economic growth from social and environmental development must be a mistake since these three areas are linked."
"When President Barroso presented the mid-term review in this Parliament more than a month ago he used the metaphor of having three children and having to pay most attention to the sick one."
"The other two, in this case environmental and social development, will have to await their turn for President Barroso’s attention."
"My conclusion is the opposite."
"To cure the EU economy we need the health of the whole family."
"Investment in environmental technology leads to more jobs, boosts innovation and creates sustainable growth."
"When the forestry and pulp industry in the Nordic countries made a major shift towards cleaner green technology, the companies concerned became even more competitive on the international market."
"New technologies for saving energy are another example of business interests being in tune with environmental concerns."
"There is a saying that competition brings out the best in products and the worst in people."
"This is definitely true of business, and it is important to create an internal market that is a level playing field."
"We need to create a competitive and sustainable economy in Europe; this also means investing in research and development."
"The Heads of State must take the situation seriously."
"We can set up ambitious goals, but if we lack the necessary political leadership we will never reach them."
"In Europe we look at the situation in the US and wonder why it has double the growth that we have."
"The US wonders why China has twice the growth it has."
"The EU has a great potential to be the world’s leading knowledge-based economy."
"The proposals from the Commission are good, but to reduce the Lisbon Strategy only to a matter of economic growth would be to take steps in the wrong direction while time is running out."
"The major groups have negotiated this resolution and the clear message is that economic growth, social cohesion and environmental development have to be seen as a whole."
"We demand the same from the Council and the Commission."
"I want to thank my fellow negotiators because it is a major achievement to table this resolution – I almost said revolution! – and to have a large majority in the Chamber."
"Mr President, we Greens do not want to write blank cheques, whether to the Commission under Mr Barroso or to this Parliament, for the fact is that we fear that, when the fog of Lisbon has cleared, we will, in the social and environmental spheres, be faced with realities that do not reflect the integration of the three pillars."
"As we have made clear in our amendments, there must be no blank cheque for Mr Bolkestein."
"Until such time as the Commission – and here I am also appealing to the Members of this House – withdraws the proposal, it can veto a progressive vote at first reading stage, and we are weakening ourselves and making this House to some extent ridiculous if we do not right now insist on the Commission withdrawing this proposal and thus enabling this House to know on what basis our debates are being conducted."
"This we have set out in our second amendment."
"I should like to welcome to Parliament Mr Hrusovsky, President of the National Council of the Slovak Republic, who is now present in the distinguished visitors’ gallery."
"His visit demonstrates the great value that Parliament attaches to dialogue with national parliaments."
"I wish Mr Hrusovsky and his delegation an enjoyable and successful visit."
"– The next item is the continuation of the debate on the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy."
"– Mr President, this debate is taking place at a particularly difficult moment for the social situation in the European Union."
"We are a long way from the economic growth and rising employment of the late 1990s, as a consequence of restrictive economic and financial policies, the Stability Pact and the rapid liberalisations and privatisations called for by the Lisbon Strategy."
"Today, with rising social and regional inequalities, unemployment affecting almost 20 million workers, growing job insecurity and almost 70 million people living in poverty, social inclusion and cohesion have to be a priority, a central concern in this mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy."
"That means not only creating secure jobs, but also sharing out the created wealth more fairly, through social policies designed to ensure human rights, better pensions and retirement provision, quality public services in health, education, research and vocational training, social security and protection, housing and family support, paying particular attention to promoting equal rights for women and taking account of suitable environmental policies."
"Instead of that, the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, has come here to state that the Lisbon Strategy is at the centre of our economic policies, following the conclusions of the Kok report, which places particular emphasis on competitiveness."
"What is required, however, as mentioned in our group’s resolution, is to call a halt to this neoliberal race, to strengthen public investment at EU and national levels, to put a stop to the privatisation of public sectors and services, to withdraw the proposal for a directive to create the internal market in services, to revoke the Stability Pact, to establish a clear distinction between current spending and investment, and to promote a development and employment pact, prioritising growth in jobs with rights, social inclusion, and economic, social and territorial cohesion, the only way to help create the 22 million secure jobs that are required to meet the 70% target by 2010 laid down in the Lisbon Strategy."
"If that does not happen, we will have a rise in social tensions among the people in our countries in protest at the policies we are implementing."
"They want greater social protection and better social policy, and that, Mr President, is the challenge."
"Just five years ago, the EU set out to make itself a rival to the United States of America within ten years."
"Now we hear the half-time whistle, but I suspect Mr Barroso is not a man to listen to whistle-blowers."
"We are asked to consider a mid-term review, but there seems little to review."
"The unemployment rate is high and rising and 101 000 regulations and directives are bleeding the life out of the wealth creators."
"Growth is worse."
"Mrs Figueiredo said in her report yesterday that 22 million jobs need to be created in the EU in the next five years."
"You do not have to be Hayek to know that cannot be done."
"It is interesting to see the panic setting in amongst the federalists at last; the cracks are really showing."
"Mr Barroso is a rampant free marketeer, according to the people over there, while his ideas went out with the Ark according to Mr Mandelson, from the right."
"In Britain, at least, people are waking up."
"I quote from this morning’s : ‘Peers tell Brussels to give back cash from EU budget’."
"We have paid in GBP 180 billion and got back GBP 105 billion."
"Where has the GBP 75 billion gone?"
"Mr Barroso, you try and keep bleeding the British taxpayer at this rate, because worse is better and on that basis this corrupt institution is doing very well indeed."
"First of all, I would like to congratulate the Commission on its realistic view of the situation and its determination."
"We have realised that ‘Lisbon 2000’ is an unachieved objective and a clear demonstration of a lack of political will."
"Although when we look at the situation realistically it is not, on the whole, a dramatic one, nevertheless the resources for implementing the strategy require radical rethinking."
"As I see it, this is what the Commission is indeed proposing."
"The objectives remain the same, which is understandable since there is no real alternative."
"The main task also remains the same — to convince the Member States’ social partners and all European citizens to accept change."
"The risk is — it so happens that at the same time as we are relaunching the implementation of the Lisbon strategy we are also discussing the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact — that we have a reform that will not promote convergence between the Eurozone states and will pass greater economic and financial risk on to the Member States."
"The Member States will need political leaders and the will to put reforms in place."
"The Services Directive too, which the Commission put forward as an essential tool for implementing the Lisbon objectives, has met with stiff opposition."
"Unfortunately, the Commission is willing to make concessions."
"On the other hand, in implementing the Lisbon strategy there is a risk of falling into the trap of excessive regulation at the European Union level, and so we must ensure that the subsidiarity principle is observed and that there is regular evaluation of the effect of the European Union’s legislative initiative, where the main goal is to guarantee the competitiveness of Europe’s businesses."
"One of the serious risks I would also mention is the ideological debate we are hearing again today, about the importance of the Lisbon agenda pillars."
"This debate is tending to return to the previous already overcharged agenda."
"Among the advantages of this period is that the European Union’s enlargement by ten new Member States is a propitious moment."
"Fears about jobs moving to the new Member States, cheap labour forces and tax competition within the European Union itself are forcing politicians to consider reforms and are making society more open to change."
"With the enlargement of the European Union the time for active competition and change has arrived."
"This is the right moment to relaunch the Lisbon strategy."
"Mr President of the Commission, your review of the Lisbon strategy contains statements that are gravely misleading, not only for this House, but also for the leaders of the 25 Member States. You state that, and I quote;"
"‘We need to avoid the type of jobless growth that has marred the performance of the US economy’."
"I am not sure whether it was dyed-in-the-wool anti-Americans, Communists or perhaps trade unionists who tricked you into including this false statement, but I should like to point out that figures from Eurostat show that the American economy is growing faster than the European economy, and that unemployment is not only lower in the USA, but dropping almost twice as fast as in the European Union."
"I would ask that you refrain from using false economic data, and I would particularly ask that you do not give in to pressure from those socialists who do not wish to admit that maximum freedom for entrepreneurs and minimum state intervention are the only way to achieve prosperity."
"I would ask you to face up to the truth and to take action."
"This is the only way in which you will make good on what you said when you took up office in the summer, namely that Europe must first earn its right to a welfare state. I thank you."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we can justifiably describe the text of the resolution before the House as balanced and as containing everything relevant to the Lisbon strategy."
"It also gives real impetus to the strategy’s revival."
"All three of its elements – growth and the labour market, welfare policy and the environment – have been addressed in a proper context, and my group has been particularly keen to stress the importance of making a clear connection between these two pillars."
"A proper environment and social policy is possible only if there is economic growth and a functioning labour market; there is a close and practical connection between the two, for the success of the one as a policy is conditional upon the other, and that this resolution makes this clear is crucially important."
"As the short time available to me prevents me from discussing all three of these points, there is one aspect to which I would like to give particular attention, and I regard it as being of fundamental importance."
"I refer to the implementation of the interinstitutional agreement of December 2003 on better lawmaking, which – as I have been observing for a year now – is not operating adequately."
"It is particularly unsatisfactory when it comes to scrutinising the impact of laws and to involving interested parties in the production of drafts within the Commission."
"One reason why we have had to have the debates we have had on, for example, the services directive and REACH is that the impact of legislation has been assessed either inadequately or not at all, and that the interested parties were not sufficiently involved in the process whereby they came into being."
"This is, I think, one of the priorities that this resolution addresses, and it is something that must change."
"Let me conclude with a couple of observations on the role played by the other groups in this House."
"I am grateful to the Socialist Group in the European Parliament for following the Liberals in now deciding to support this draft."
"They were not quite willing to do that in the Steering Group, but I am glad they have now decided to do so, for it needs a broad majority."
"It is vitally important that the Lisbon process should be supported by all."
"I do have something of a problem with the attitude of the Greens, who met separately in Luxembourg and decided to oppose it without even waiting for the result of the Steering Group’s deliberations."
"Surely, this is rather peculiar; perhaps the Greens should re-read the text and think about whether it might after all be better to vote in favour of it, or else they will find it difficult to explain their opposition."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, President Borrell’s initiative, to invite representatives of the national parliaments to a joint discussion on the economic, social and environmental future of Europe, is already bearing fruit."
"In most national parliaments, the Lisbon strategy has finally become a political subject."
"The European Parliament, in its turn, has done its utmost to produce proposals that are less ideological, more balanced, and closer to the day-to-day reality of life for our 455 million fellow citizens."
"Of course our draft resolution could be improved still further."
"There are certain deafening silences, such as the lack of any reference to the need to adjust the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Happily, the governments, whatever their political colour, have a more realistic approach than some Conservative or Liberal MEPs."
"Thus, the Ecofin Council, in spite of some difficult debates, is moving towards an adjustment of the pact."
"I am willing to bet that the spring summit will succeed in transforming a somewhat ineffectual budgetary monitoring tool into a political-economy tool in the service of growth."
"With limited inflation, interest rates which are low compared with the past, a savings surplus and businesses that are more than profitable, Europe – and above all the euro zone – is currently lacking, not in stability, but in growth."
"As a matter of priority we should stimulate internal demand, particularly in the larger countries within the euro zone, Germany, France and Italy."
"It is only by resuming public and private investment and giving new impetus to consumption that our Union will be able to increase its growth and create jobs."
"The mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy will have to result in the concentration of resources on the priority objectives, that is, investment in education, training, research and infrastructures."
"Fewer reports and more specific actions are needed in order to create that Europe of excellence which the Socialists are calling for."
"Defending a Europe of excellence, however, does not mean defending the status quo."
"High social and environmental standards can and should be included in the framework of any successful economic option."
"In a world in which capital is becoming increasingly mobile, Europe’s most precious competitive advantage remains its well-educated and trained labour force, which also has the independence necessary to enable it to react to constant change."
"It is no accident that the Scandinavian countries, which showed the greatest determination in adopting the Lisbon strategy with regard to social and environmental excellence, are now among the best performing European countries in economic terms."
"They did their utmost to ensure that they could provide the type of real job security that is based on the capacity to maintain the constant upgrading of professional skills."
"A modern competitive framework requires a re-examination of the concept of flexibility."
"In a rapidly developing global economy, the most prosperous businesses will be those that are the most flexible."
"Those businesses which rely on revolving reserve supplies of temporary workers will lose ground to those whose employees are tied to them by motivation based on job security and decent working conditions."
"Policies on the employment market and on industrial relations systems must be reoriented towards the anticipation and management of change, so as to create a dynamic European economy and persuade the European labour force that change is an opportunity rather than a threat."
"We need a modern labour organisation system and active employment market policies."
"The same logic applies to social protection policies which play a crucial role and which call for the strengthening of policies to combat poverty and social exclusion."
"I shall end, Mr President, by saying that the Europe of excellence is possible."
"Moreover, the European Union is much better than its reputation."
"Seen from the outside, the Union is the world political entity which has the highest standard of living, not only in economic terms but also in social and environmental terms."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to thank Mr Lehne and Mr Goebbels particularly, and also the other Members for their constructive cooperation."
"My warm thanks go to them all."
"Five years after the inception of the Lisbon strategy, we have now reached a fork in the road, and I would like to take this as an opportunity to reiterate something fundamental about the situation in Europe."
"The last time Europe suffered from this sort of structural mass unemployment was in the 1930s."
"In Germany, from which I come, the number of unemployed is higher than at any time in the history of the Federal Republic, having gone over the million mark in North Rhine-Westphalia, which both Commissioner Verheugen and I call home."
"At the same time, many Member States are getting deeper and deeper into debt, and science and research are going elsewhere as the intellectual, moral and political consequences of mass unemployment spread – lower turnouts at elections, general dissatisfaction with politics, burgeoning racism, and extremism from both the Right and the Left."
"We have had five wasted years in which we wanted everything and achieved nothing, and now Europe must come to a decision."
"Do we have the courage and the strength to at last go into battle against mass unemployment?"
"Do we have the courage and the strength to turn things around, and go for more jobs and more growth?"
"Do we have the courage and the strength to stop focussing on those who are still in work and at last turn our eyes upon those who want to work but cannot?"
"In response to that, I say that we must, clearly, summon up the courage and strength to do these things, and it is no less clear that they call for a combined effort by all of us and for absolute concentration on greater competitiveness."
"Let us at last come to grasp what that is: the indispensable requirement for more growth and new jobs, without which we will not achieve the ambitious social and environmental goals of which we are all in favour, as the resolution says."
"In this, the completion of the internal market as the engine of development will be crucial."
"None of us can any more be ignorant of the fact that the European internal market has created two million jobs since 1993."
"That being so, can we afford to have a European market for services that exists only on paper?"
"Ought we not, therefore, to concentrate on the sector that now accounts for 70% of the European Union’s gross domestic product?"
"There is enormous potential for growth in the reduction of obstacles to the provision of services across borders."
"If we want to put Europe on course for growth and combat mass unemployment, this is where we have to start."
"In this debate, let me add, those rabble-rousers who know nothing except how to stoke people’s fears have had a free run for far too long, and I am at present primarily referring to the unholy alliance that has been forged this week in Westphalia, on the other bank of the Rhine."
"President Chirac and Chancellor Schroeder are waging a campaign of half-truths and falsehoods that play on people’s fears, and so let me make it quite plain that it is a particularly good thing that the Commission has at last fought back against such polemics."
"I would like to congratulate Commissioner McCreevy on his passionate appeal yesterday."
"Let us muster the courage to fight mass unemployment."
"I also believe that we should be having this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me tell Mr Lehne, as he made explicit reference to it, that we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance did not find this text an easy one to deal with."
"He will recall that we, as part of our coordination on Lisbon, introduced many amendments into the debate, but, on the points where we thought it necessary to make the text more concrete, we did not hesitate to list what we saw as its potential breaking points."
"Let me remind you that, when we in the steering committee began to debate this text, we agreed that it would profit us nothing to have only general agreement, but that this House would have to make of the Lisbon process something more concrete."
"That is still the Group of the Greens’ position."
"For example, we do believe that an agreement on the freedom to provide services in the European Union is really necessary."
"If I may be frank, the impression I get is that the Bolkestein directive basically refers to the realities in the old European Union and that it fails to address the great challenges in terms of social convergence, including that of preventing social dumping, that await us following the creation of the larger European Union that we now have."
"For that reason, I take Chancellor Schroeder’s, and President Chirac’s, statements seriously."
"I believe that this directive must be withdrawn, and that the Socialists in this House will support our amendment."
"If, for example, you do not want the Poles, Czechs and Slovaks to be disappointed in their hopes that this Europe would actually bring them social progress, or if you do not want Europe to be associated, in the West, only with social decline, then you cannot vote in favour of the Bolkestein directive as it stands."
"For us, that is a breaking point in this text."
"We would have expected this House to come to an agreement on it."
"Concerning myself as I do with environmental and energy policy, I was delighted to see that many general blocks of text on sustainability have been incorporated into the draft that we are to vote on today."
"I do, though, refuse to accept that these blocks of text are fit only for pious platitudes on Lisbon and that everything will be forgotten again when, for example, we vote in the Committee on Agriculture on such things as REACH, the research Framework Programme or genetically modified organisms."
"I therefore believe that the Greens’ rejection is well founded, and we will continue, in the months to come, to debate with you on the future of social justice, a proper approach to the environment, and innovations, with reference to the actual projects concerned."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, where the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy and the conclusions to be drawn from it are concerned, the difference between the majority in this House and the group to which I belong is that the former, in principle, wants to carry on down the road we have already taken, that of supply-oriented economic policy with increased competition, whilst we say that that road is the wrong one."
"We, in this House, do indeed agree on what the Lisbon strategy’s goals are, but we have quite different views as to the ways by which to reach them."
"The main task is to create jobs, and that is something I can do only if demand for products increases and business is obliged to invest in expansion and thereby meet the increased need."
"The facts ought to prompt even those whose economic thinking is of the most neoliberal kind to accept that, in the absence of demand, cutting taxes does nothing to create new jobs, but that, on the contrary, either the consequent rationalisation wipes them out or the increase in revenue is not reinvested, or alternatively, it finds its way, via taxation, into the state’s budget."
"The Lisbon strategy must not be about competing for the biggest returns, but rather competing for highly skilled jobs, excellence in education and training, product quality, high environmental standards and a high level of consumer protection."
"That also means that the lower income groups – who, contrary to what is often asserted, are not saving more than they used to – must either have their wages increased or their taxes cut, all the more so as there is sufficient political room for manoeuvre, productivity having risen much faster than pay over recent years."
"I might add that this is also reflected in the favourable foreign trade balance enjoyed by most of the European Union’s Member States, who, despite high social transfers, were able to offer products acceptable in global markets."
"Low-paid and part-time jobs do nothing to help do away with the scourge of unemployment."
"If we want to become the world’s strongest economic region by 2010, we must devote our attention primarily to welfare and the environment in the European Union, for that is the best way in which we can promote our economy."
"Mr President, the forthcoming spring summit is being overshadowed by what the referendums on the European Constitution might bring in the coming months."
"That is detrimental to good decision-making on economic reforms."
"Alongside this, decision-making at the coming summit is also fed by the fear that the welfare state might be affected."
"That much has become clear since the autumn summit when Mr Kok’s report was discussed here."
"I would, however, like to urge you to take a different look at economic reforms."
"Is it socially acceptable for people at 58 to be taken out of the labour market?"
"Is it socially acceptable to saddle young people today with the burden of our system that has become unaffordable, while they themselves will never be able to enjoy the benefits?"
"I would therefore call on the Commission, together with the Member States, to work on the necessary structural reforms."
"Growth is needed to maintain Europe’s social model, which, at the same time, needs to be reformed."
"Whoever claims today that structural reforms are unnecessary is a dangerous demagogue."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we support Mr Barroso’s initiative, and we are delighted that the Commission is taking steps to achieve the Lisbon goals in full."
"We find it incomprehensible that Mr Barroso has been criticised over the Lisbon strategy, as after all it is not the European Commission’s fault that the Lisbon strategy has not yet been implemented."
"It is the Member States who are to blame for the fact that the Lisbon strategy continues to be a paper construct rather than a feature of Europe’s real economic life, as it is they who lacked the courage to reform the European Union’s economies."
"I come from a country in which for over 45 years attempts were made to cast a verbal spell over the economy."
"This is an impossible task, as what economies need is concrete action."
"It is precisely because the European Commission is in favour of such action that we will support it."
"I should like to make it very clear at this point that there is little chance of our commitments under the Lisbon strategy being honoured, or of real growth being achieved in Europe, if the Member States lack the necessary courage."
"This is the very courage they also lack when it comes to the services directive that is currently under debate."
"The prerequisites for growth in Europe are lower taxes, less regulation and more economic freedom."
"Reality is knocking at our door, and Europe is not alone in the world."
"We are all fully aware that Asia is experiencing very rapid growth, and that the United States is also experiencing growth."
"Sooner or later, this economic reality will come knocking at our door."
"We would therefore like to wish you courage and success, Mr President, in achieving the Lisbon goals."
"Mr Verheugen, it is important today, when we want to evaluate the progress of the Lisbon Strategy in mid-term, that we do not look for ready formulas, but that, above all, we identify possible failures."
"First and foremost, cooperation between institutions has failed."
"The European Council determined the objectives, whose fulfilment it had only to coordinate and facilitate, because in the majority of cases these objectives are subject to the national states within the framework of subsidiarity."
"I therefore call upon the national states and, the citizens of these states directly, to assume an increased responsibility in adopting the ideas of the Lisbon Strategy."
"The European Union would have to provide continuous monitoring and more consistently ensure the role of a flexible and effective centre, as it has, for example, in the verification and fulfilment of the Maastricht criteria."
"Individual Member States have not undergone the social reforms required to resolve the issue of social inclusion."
"The issue of securing greater job opportunities: the fulfilment of this objective requires an increased mobility of the work force."
"But here we lag behind in the recognition of qualifications and skills, and particularly in the streamlining of this procedure."
"The movement of the work force appears to be in an East-West direction, mainly the highly sophisticated work force, which intensifies the differences in the less developed regions even more."
"The ageing of the population: the national states have failed to pay attention to this phenomenon and, through their social reforms, have not managed to ensure the social inclusion of these citizens, that is, an entire generation."
"The main problem here is the qualitative replacement of this economically serious loss."
"Mr President, as you know, in order to succeed one must first learn the lessons of previous failures."
"The Lisbon Strategy launched in 2000 has not brought the progress we hoped for."
"We find that growth is stagnant and insufficient jobs have been created."
"The first reason seems obvious: the strategy was too confused, too fragmented and looked like a battle plan without an army."
"Even now, most people do not know what it is about."
"Europe must therefore leverage on its ability to create added value while preserving its social model; the way to do this is through priority action plans with precise timetables."
"We know that in terms of conventional competitiveness our companies are no longer a match for countries like China or India."
"Our advantages are innovation, the quality of our training, our environment and making the most of our know-how."
"Our trump card is eco-innovation and cutting-edge technologies that meet a demand for very high added-value products that our competitors are unable to satisfy."
"The EU must also avoid shooting itself in the foot by always stifling its economy, faced as it is with the challenges of an ageing population."
"That is why we have asked for an economic and social as well as environmental impact assessment for every legislative proposal."
"That constitutes ‘better law-making’."
"Reviving the economy and boosting employment means backing entrepreneurial activity by helping our large companies to become world champions and giving our SMEs the means to expand, developing a dynamic society for our fellow-citizens."
"We must mobilise to make Europe a centre of excellence, as you said, Mr Barroso."
"For that, we want a simple and fair tax system that causes as little hindrance as possible, public-private partnerships, an internal market with no social dumping, a high level of commitment to young people with the recognition of qualifications and greater use made of exchanges, the appointment of a ‘Mr or Mrs Lisbon’ in every capital and commitment by the Member States to the financial perspectives."
"The world’s cards have been re-dealt."
"Every continent has a good hand."
"Lisbon ought to be Europe’s winning number, but we must always keep in mind what Churchill said, and make it our motto: ‘However beautiful the strategy, you should occasionally look at the results’."
"Mr President, President Barroso, Commissioner Verheugen, I would like to say how pleased I am today at the positive reception given to our draft resolution on the Lisbon Process."
"I regard it, in fact, as a hand outstretched in cooperation and I see it as a manifestation of the fact that people have been listening. Although we have had fierce discussions along the way, after each fierce discussion a conclusion must be drawn, and the conclusion being drawn today is that now is the time for action."
"I would like to say that I was delighted to hear Mr Juncker’s recent comments, when he said that we should now end the debate concerning what comes first and establish that in Europe things happen at the same time; that we improve our competitiveness, carry out social reforms – including in the labour market – and implement environmental reforms all at the same time."
"I should like to say that we in Scandinavia have shown that it can be done, and that is indeed partly what we understand by the European dimension."
"We are not aiming for just any kind of combination, however."
"We need reforms, and we need investment."
"President of the Commission, I feel today that the greatest investment of all that we need is investment in human beings over the coming five years."
"The Commission and Mr Špidla talk of flexibility; we of the Group of the European Socialists in the European Parliament have nothing against flexibility."
"It depends on the type of flexibility we are talking about."
"I myself feel that we can create a reform that says that people must be able to move from an old job to a new job while maintaining social security and in the constant assurance of becoming more skilled, better qualified and more education-minded."
"If we do this, we will have an opportunity to bring about a new deal in which we say to people: ‘We shall safeguard your security in the twenty-first century in a new labour market with new jobs’."
"We shall commit ourselves to creating 1 500 new jobs in Europe each time we lose 1 000 jobs to Asia, India or the developing world."
"In other words, we shall say that we are here to create new jobs that can take the place of the old ones, and we shall ensure that people are able to take those new jobs."
"May I end by urgently saying to the Luxembourg Presidency and to the Commission that we need greater demand in Europe and that we need macroeconomic coordination of investments, for I can assure you that, without major economic growth, there will be no popular understanding for reforms, and without reforms we can have no sustainable economic growth."
"If we can agree on this in the Luxembourg Presidency’s proposal to the European Council, we shall have come a very, very long way."
"I want to wish you the best of luck with your work during the Luxembourg Presidency."
"I think great efforts are being made to secure balance, and we want to be there all the time, as Mr Schulz said today, to secure that balance that is the European identity."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the text before us is built on the necessary balance between the three facets of the Lisbon Strategy: the economic facet, of course, but also the social and environmental ones."
"That is how we will demonstrate to our fellow citizens our determination to give substance to a Europe that is, of course, competitive, but is also based on social cohesion and the restoration and preservation of a healthy environment."
"This text also sends a number of clear messages that I would like to underline."
"A message to the younger generation first, since the text encourages the joint initiative of four Member States to help young people, an initiative which appears in the Commission’s communication to the spring European Council."
"The second message confirms the role of SMEs as job creators and innovators in a proactive and balanced industrial policy, one focused on the leading corporations, but also – and perhaps primarily – on those small companies which, again, are the key to job creation in Europe."
"The third message stresses the obvious need for a major boost to research in the EU as a whole."
"Finally, the text makes a fundamental point to which you referred just now, Mr Verheugen, namely that the Lisbon Strategy’s ambitions are pointless unless sufficient resources are made available, and this means in particular, as I am sure you understand, a European budget commensurate with its objectives."
"From today, while the future of the Lisbon Strategy is indeed a matter for the European political authorities, it is just as much, and perhaps even more, a matter for the national political authorities and all those with a role to play in the economic life of the 25 Member States."
"The Lisbon Strategy’s success depends on the Member States’ ability to steer their policies in the required direction and to involve Europe’s population as widely as possible."
"It will only be possible to involve people in this way if public opinion is generally well-disposed towards the work of the European Union and its institutions."
"The Commission must understand that and respond to that expectation."
"If we bear in mind some recent statements that have been made about delocalisation, or what Mr McCreevy said here yesterday about the services directive, then I fear, Mr Barroso, that you may be continuing your work on the Treaty of Nice."
"Be careful!"
"Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union’s added value involves us making peace, bringing security, securing growth, employment and competitiveness, and guaranteeing social security and environmental sustainability."
"That is what we are working to do."
"We have a new project to work on – no longer economic and monetary union, but competitiveness, growth and employment."
"What do we have to do?"
"Firstly, we have to breathe life into the European social model of an environmentally-responsible market economy, making it tangible and implementing it, for we see the market not as an end in itself, but only as a means to an end."
"Secondly, we have to make the internal market a domestic market for all."
"Without an internal market in services, then, the new Lisbon strategy will remain unrealised."
"Thirdly, we should make real the four freedoms for all Europe’s citizens, for businesses and for research."
"Fourthly, we have to revitalise the Stability and Growth Pact."
"What does that mean?"
"It means wanting to achieve the goals we have set ourselves in a consistent way; it means allowing the Commission to exercise the prerogatives conferred upon them; it means not making judges of criminals, it means doing our work at home rather than blaming Brussels."
"The same social model applies also to the Lisbon strategy."
"Where it is concerned, we must not repeat the mistakes we made with the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Fifthly, we need more leadership from the Commission."
"We therefore need a European action plan, a European timetable, a European catalogue of measures; the Commission needs to engage in dialogue with the Member States when drawing up national action plans and it is the Commission that must monitor them."
"Mr President of the Commission, you are the trainer and captain of the Europe squad."
"The governments of the Member States are the members of your team."
"That is why all the Heads of State or Government – and not just the ministers for the internal market – must again make the Lisbon strategy for growth, competitiveness and employment, their own project."
"Listening to today’s debate, I wonder what the ETUC wants to demonstrate against in the run-up to the summit in Brussels."
"Against what you have put forward today?"
"Against competitiveness, growth and employment?"
"I call on the ETUC to call off the demonstration against growth, competitiveness and employment and do as the Socialist Group has earned our gratitude by doing – get back into the boat of growth, employment and competitiveness."
"Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, the Council, in the year 2000, set itself the ambitious objective of Europe becoming, by 2010, the strongest – in economic terms – knowledge-based society."
"It would be good if we were to manage to become, if not absolutely the strongest knowledge-based society in economic terms, but one that is strong and – for this is another objective that must be listed, has a social orientation."
"The results from the mid-term review are, alas, something other than favourable, and so we must, as a matter of urgency, implement in a consistent manner the strategies that have already been devised."
"At the heart of the Lisbon strategy, alongside social cohesion, growth, and employment, is education, which underpins everything else."
"There is a need for more investment in education, science and research, although this needs to go hand in hand with reforms in response to the changes in technology and society."
"What that means in practical terms is that we need, among other things, learning that accompanies life rather than learning that is lifelong – that has the ring of punishment about it – along with the promotion of mobility in employment, science and research, cross-border educational opportunities, the recognition of degrees – for many of them are not yet accepted everywhere – and access to education for all."
"In other words, there must be no cutbacks in education, no tuition fees, no depriving universities of resources, and no reduction in teaching hours, particularly in the natural sciences, for it is they that foster creativity and are therefore necessary both for the development of the individual, whether personal or professional."
"Any strong, and socially-responsible society must also take the gender dimension into account, and so, at its Spring Summit, the Council must devote its attention to such issues as equal pay for equal work, about which much was said on Women’s Day yesterday, and also equality of opportunity."
"Madam President, since a great deal has, of course, already been said about the Lisbon strategy in this debate, I should like to confine myself to three points."
"First of all, the Lisbon strategy must, after the euro, enlargement and the Constitution, become the EU’s next big success."
"We have no choice."
"That presumes, though, that we give the citizen the confidence and the leeway to develop new initiatives and meet new challenges."
"My neighbour in Rijswijk is perfectly capable of taking sound decisions about his future himself, and he does not need to be told what to do by the Dutch Government, let alone the European Union."
"This brings me to my second point."
"We should be more critical about the role of the government in the framework of the Lisbon strategy."
"The question presents itself whether the government should be the problem solver or if it is perhaps the problem itself."
"Needless to say, the government must keep an eye on things and prescribe certain conditions, but far too often, we notice that the government obstructs, rather than stimulates, new initiatives."
"In my view, deregulation, a reduction in the administrative burden and cutting right down on red tape must therefore be central in the Lisbon strategy if we really want to achieve this desperately needed reinforcement of Europe’s competitiveness."
"Thirdly, I do, of course, agree completely with the Members who believe that Europe should take pride in its unique model, but we should also realise that this social model can be enforced only when we generate more economic growth."
"All too often, my fellow MEPs on my left have preserved the myth that social policy and economic growth are mutually exclusive, whether the subject is the Lisbon strategy or the services directive."
"Time and again, they intimate a false contradiction between a free, innovative, dynamic knowledge economy and social policy."
"It is therefore beyond me why the Socialist Group in this House abstained during last week’s vote in the parliamentary coordination group, particularly in the light of the fact that the other groups had really done their level best to reach a widely acceptable compromise."
"I am therefore delighted that the spokespersons of that group now say that the text before us deserves broad support."
"It makes last week’s abstention of vote all the more mysterious, but let us simply put it down to progressive insight."
"There is no policy that is more social than policy that creates more and better jobs and creates space for entrepreneurship."
"It remains to be seen whether there is really a majority to back this Commission policy."
"Should this be the case, then that would be a welcome development."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, if I were asked for the two main reasons why I consider the convergence in the positions of the Council Presidency, the Commission and Parliament that we see today to be important, I would reply that my first reason is that the social and environmental aspects of development are being sincerely acknowledged not as constraints and obstacles but as factors in our competitiveness."
"My second reason is that we all agree that in order to properly relaunch the Lisbon Strategy it is essential to create a sense of ownership of the strategy that filters down to local levels, so that responsibility lies first and foremost with national governments and parliaments as well as with the public."
"I agree wholeheartedly on this point, which I hope will be transformed into tangible measures in the European Council."
"This time, however, I must disagree with what Mrs Frassoni said in her speech. Among her reasons for rejecting the proposal for a resolution – which I, on the other hand, support – she mentioned the fact that one of the paragraphs in the resolution called the REACH regulation into question."
"Madam President, you know very well how much I value that regulation and I would never risk jeopardising it by supporting the proposal for a resolution."
"I should, however, like to call on my fellow Members not to regard the regulation as a symbol of good or evil any longer, as polarisation of that kind implies that in the end there will be winners and losers."
"I believe, instead, that reaching agreement on that regulation would be a victory for us all."
"Madam President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to thank the two co-rapporteurs, Mr Lehne and Mr Harlem Désir, and above all the group of 33, including, too, those colleagues who will probably not take part in the vote."
"I am rather sorry about that, but I can tell you that the working atmosphere was excellent, that we worked in extraordinarily good conditions and that I was highly satisfied as chairman."
"It is important that the revitalisation of the Lisbon Strategy should be an indisputable priority and, for that to be the case, we must mobilise all the parties concerned."
"Parliament has therefore set up its coordinating working group, with the sole aim of helping to improve the strategy’s implementation by making Parliament a clearer and more influential partner in the process than has previously been the case."
"One of its tasks will be to prepare a recommendation for the Conference of Presidents before the spring summit."
"I hope, Mr Barroso, that you and all the commissioners will take everything that has been said into account."
"There is still a short paragraph which I have not heard, Mr Barroso, on the coordination of the three presidents."
"I believe that is very important for what lies ahead."
"So far as this draft resolution is concerned, I therefore hope there will be a very large majority today in the vote."
"That is why we also need to identify key measures like the importance of the service sector, special support for private businesses and also the need for a new regulation on chemical substances and the modernisation of the labour market."
"Another important stage will begin next week with the holding in our Parliament in Brussels, under Mr Borrell’s presidency, of the first parliamentary meeting on the Lisbon Strategy with the national parliaments."
"It is very important that we study and work much more with our national parliaments."
"Our meeting will mark the opening of a parliamentary dialogue on this Lisbon Strategy."
"The aim is to coordinate initiatives at parliamentary level so as to send a strong and consistent message to the Heads of State or Government on the eve of each European Council."
"We will also be continuing our work on the other aspects of the mandate we have been given, namely to work at interinstitutional level for better legislative programming and to improve the transposition and implementation at national level of the measures taken within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy."
"Indeed, as the Kok Report suggests, we want Parliament to play a proactive role in monitoring the results obtained from this strategy."
"Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner Verheugen, objectively speaking, the enlargement of the European Union brings us into a new era of new beginnings."
"So it is that people in other regions of the world look at us and wonder whether we, in the European Union, really are capable of competing internationally in a new age and of remaining so while maintaining and further developing high social standards."
"Are we able to take economic and technical leaps into the new age while ushering in a new generation of production with higher – the highest – environmental standards?"
"The President of the Commission and Commissioner Verheugen have presented us with very bold visions."
"Commissioner Verheugen has spoken of values – values in the way businesses are run, values in social standards, values of social participation both in enterprise and in the life of society, describing these as vehicles with which the process of modernisation travels forwards."
"While that is something I would underline, I do believe that the reality of life for many people is somewhat different."
"They fear insecurity; they fear that these objectives will not be achieved in their day-to-day lives."
"If we want to bridge this gap, our instruments must be reformed first, and then the gap must be bridged in the broad outlines of economic policy and elsewhere, where I want to hear no more of stale ideologies, but more of how people really live in society."
"If what we are working on together in this House is to become reality, it is our own instruments that must be reformed."
"Madam President, what was pompously called the Lisbon Strategy is turning into a farce."
"First of all, the aim of growth and prosperity has clearly not been achieved."
"Half way through, growth is so weak that the OECD is describing the euro zone as the black hole of world recovery; growth is stagnating at 1.7% – lower in many countries – while world growth is 5% and, irony of ironies, Europe as a whole is producing a rate of 2.9%, thanks to the relative performance of those very countries which are not foolishly shackled to the euro."
"As for prosperity, for our fellow citizens this is at present more synonymous with insecurity, loss of purchasing power and unemployment, the latter exemplified by the 8 million unemployed in the Franco-German nucleus."
"The outlook is increasingly bleak, especially in the euro zone."
"The euro has not kept its promise."
"Clearly, it is not a currency of trade, nor is it a factor of budgetary discipline but is, on the contrary, one of laxity."
"For our contemporaries it is more a factor of inflation."
"As for the Stability Pact, it is clearly in the process of breaking up."
"Moreover, I fail to understand how anyone can support the euro without supporting the Stability Pact."
"That point, at least, is a contradiction in terms, and I should like to draw the Commission’s attention to it."
"The lesson for the Commission, moreover, is simple."
"The enlargement of Euroland must be postponed so that only 12 of the 25 (soon to be 30) countries will be euro zone members."
"That is, of course, a long way from the declared objectives."
"All these are obviously arguments which will be used by the supporters of a ‘no’ vote, and we would be quite happy with that, were it not for the sad fact that what is at stake is the very notion of Europe, an idea that has unfortunately been compromised in the minds of our citizens, perhaps for a long time to come."
"Mr President, one of my first speeches when I became a Member of this Parliament five years ago was on the first Lisbon Strategy in April 2000."
"I was dismayed that the completion of the internal market was ranked well down the priorities in that original paper and there was only one page devoted to it in a voluminous document."
"I thank you, President Barroso, and your team, for elevating the internal market to the top of the agenda where it ought to be."
"If we do not complete the internal market, we will never have the basis for creating the jobs, growth, social and environmental policies we all want."
"It is absolutely clear that the next phase of the internal market has to be in services; we all know that."
"Last week I said publicly to you, President Barroso, that I thought you were wobbling over this proposal."
"You were not here last night to hear Mr McCreevy make his barnstorming speech."
"It showed how important this directive is and I thank him very much for that."
"I can assure you that this side of the House will work with you to get the measure through, because it is the most important measure for the internal market since the 1992 programme and it is crucial for jobs and employment."
"Small- and medium-sized companies are already benefiting from it."
"I was delighted to hear that Commissioner Verheugen is going to bring forward a comprehensive programme for modernising and enhancing the conditions for small businesses."
"That was a weakness in the proposal."
"I am delighted it is going to be remedied, because if every small- and medium-sized company across Europe creates one more job over the next five years, we will have met that job creation goal."
"That willonly be achieved when we have business-friendly policies and an environment in which people want to go out and start businesses, whether in services or in manufacturing and technical innovation."
"That is the key to delivery of this Lisbon Agenda."
"We stand ready, President Barroso, to work with you to achieve those goals."
"Madam President, the essential point of Parliament’s resolution is the definition of European competitiveness."
"We include social and environmental sustainability in competitiveness."
"The Commission speaks too narrowly of competition and employment."
"We Social Democrats are calling for social and environmental sustainability."
"Moreover, this is how it should be."
"In the long term, competitiveness will not be sustainable if it is not based on a social framework and the environment."
"Is that possible?"
"Yes, it is."
"For example, my country is just as competitive as the United States of America, to which we are frequently compared. At the same time we have been able to maintain social and environmental sustainability, unlike the United States."
"As a consequence, ours is a more equal, more secure and more environmentally sustainable society."
"Competition must not be allowed to merely become a benefit for the few, because at the end of that road awaits a controlled society, currently the digitalised control dictatorship."
"As a member of the Lisbon Committee, I was disappointed that the report is not insisting that the names of those Member States that have not implemented the Lisbon legislation should be repeatedly published."
"There are as many as 1 500 internal market laws that have not been implemented and the process has therefore come to a halt thanks to a certain kind of non-solidarity movement."
"I would ask the media now to publish over and over again the names of the Member States that purposely avoid implementation."
"That way, having received the information, people could encourage implementation."
"That would be one method of sustainable development."
"Lisbon is a challenge, and the most important project of the years ahead, the success of which hinges on the willingness of all of us – governments, parliaments, social partners at European, national and regional level – to join forces."
"If we want to achieve this united cooperation, but also this involvement, then we have already negotiated the most important hurdle to succeed."
"To you, President Barroso, I gladly trust the difficult, but also central, role of the pivot of this process."
"When we look at the Lisbon objective, a – to my mind absurd – contradiction is created."
"It is impossible to drive a wedge between the EU’s competitiveness, social policy and ecology, because without growth, we cannot meet the ecological obligations."
"Growth provides more jobs, employment, income and prosperity among the public."
"More people in jobs is the best guarantee for social security’s affordability and for cushioning the rising cost of care, as well as the reform of affordable and lasting pensions."
"Economy, ecology and social policy are therefore inextricably linked."
"Commissioner Verheugen has drawn attention to new initiatives: better and simpler legislation, new industrial policy and more support for innovation."
"In my view, these initiatives lack one thing, though, and that is retraining and extra training."
"Without providing permanent education to the potential workers, we cannot put the unemployed, whether they be women, minorities or the disabled, in jobs."
"So if we want to achieve this Europe , we should once again put our money where our mouth is."
"I would like to start with a question from twenty years ago: what was the coat of arms of COMECON?"
"(COMECON was the economic coordination organisation of the East European countries.)"
"The answer is: a green field with ten thin cows all milking each other.I am convinced that if the European Union does not make some crucial decisions within one or two years – decisions which the Member States will implement – then in twenty years’ time this could be the coat of arms of the EU too, only with the difference that there will be more cows, and they may be even thinner."
"So that this does not happen, a radical change of approach and a series of bold steps are needed."
"This is independent of one’s political orientation, whether one is religious or atheist, woman or man."
"According to my heart, my mind and my actions, I am left-wing."
"I believe, as a left-winger, that our only chance rests in using the opportunities of a unified internal market, breaking down all barriers to the free circulation of goods, services, labour and capital with lightning speed."
"Increasing European competitiveness is a question that will decide our future."
"If we do not change direction, we will not only fall behind others, but also our own opportunities and our dreams."
"We must forge an alliance to push ourselves and our national governments, and strive to convert public opinion to accept these changes, to subordinate their four-year electoral propaganda machines and their individual interests to Europe, and to the millions living in Europe."
"We must be able to do so: we decide the future of our children and our grandchildren."
"Whether they will have work twenty years from now."
"My youngest daughter is nine years old."
"I do not want her to say, mother, you wasted it."
"The question is not who says what, but who does what."
"– Madam President, growth is not a game where the sum total is zero."
"We do not need to dissolve our societies and destroy the environment in order to achieve high growth objectives."
"In March 2000, we decided at Lisbon to maximise the competitiveness of Europe, subject to the limitations imposed by the maintenance of cohesion and environmental protection."
"However, what we referred to at the time as the Lisbon strategy described everything we wanted, but not how we would achieve it."
"Today we worked out our priorities."
"Competitiveness is no longer the sum total of wishful thinking."
"It is a strategy of hierarchical priorities."
"Thus, the mid-term review summarises the Lisbon strategy in a simple equation:"
"Emphasis on research and technology programmes + support for small and medium-sized enterprises + construction of crucial infrastructures + improved human resources + promotion of structural changes = maintainable long-term growth and sustainable development."
"We must distinguish these objectives in the budget and we must not deny these objectives financing."
"We must also remember that we cannot achieve more growth with less money, just as we cannot achieve financial stability with less growth."
"– Madam President, this is our first opportunity to acknowledge the importance of this debate on the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament's agreement to relaunch, and above all, to take the necessary practical measures in order to create, at long last, a Europe which is genuinely more competitive and innovative, while at the same time continuing to strengthen its best and most valuable asset: the European social model, with the quality of life and social rights that it guarantees the European citizens."
"I particularly welcome Commissioner Verheugen's emphasis on innovation and funding, because efforts to give young Europeans better training, to improve training and skills among workers and employers, to increase the number of women at work with equal professional opportunities while maintaining a commitment to family life: all of these activities we are advocating today as MEPs will not be enough if we are unable to promote the public and private investment required to establish infrastructures in Europe that underpin economic development, and to make free circulation of goods, services and people a reality throughout the European Union."
"This is currently being worked out in practice through the thirty trans-European network projects, which, like the Lisbon Strategy, have until now suffered from a certain degree of apathy and from funding problems on the Member States' side."
"The European Parliament urges and encourages the Commission to redouble its efforts to convince the Member States – and would like to offer its assistance and support in doing so."
"We also call on the Commission to use all available resources to be more creative and to identify potential synergies between the three networks (transport, energy and telecommunications) in order to reduce costs and obtain adequate funding."
"We also support the amendment on a sustainable development model for transport – something we feel is essential – including modernisation and technological innovation for transport."
"Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Jacques Delors is regarded as one of the most successful Presidents that the Commission has had, for it was he who had the vision of creating and completing the internal market."
"The Lisbon strategy could be this Commission’s vision."
"One difference, though, is that Jacques Delors was dealing with Heads of Government like Chancellor Kohl and President Mitterrand, who had their own visions and goals for Europe."
"With some of the Heads of Government that we have now, one could well ask, in a critical way, where Europe ranks in their list of priorities."
"That, Mr President of the Commission, is one of the fundamental priorities for you – to overcome that obstacle and let Lisbon become a reality, so that you do not end up saying, ‘I had a dream’, whilst nothing productive came out of it for us."
"That is what is crucial, and the Commission can contribute in various ways."
"Commissioner McCreevy, whom I see here, can, in his own field, do a great deal to that end."
"I hope that you will get your own way, despite the Member States, where the cause of Europe needs to be advanced."
"People in the Member States need to be told what those States are supposed to be doing."
"Transparency and comparability are at stake here."
"We are currently seeing a failure to apply the law as it stands in the case of the Stability and Growth Pact, and that leads me to suspect that progress reports will not be enough."
"Let us make very clear comparisons here, with benchmarking, in order to establish who, in Europe, has the best labour market policy."
"When handling the Lisbon strategy in future, we will have to take care that the economy, ecology and social objectives do not act against each other, but are instead all subordinated to the goals of the Lisbon strategy."
"When nation states implement it, it is even more important to ensure that lawmaking is improved."
"There are Member States – and I am from one of them – that manage over and over again to plug the gaps as required."
"The most important thing will be to encourage people in Europe, so that the goal of the Lisbon strategy can become reality."
"Our main problem is that there are elements in Europe that do not believe that we can hold our own against the Americans."
"If we do manage to do that, then we in Europe will have achieved a great deal."
"This House is right behind you."
"Madam President, the core of the Lisbon Strategy has to be jobs."
"For that, we need active labour market policies to ensure that work is rewarded, the unemployed are helped to get work, and that training and retraining are central to everything we do."
"The three institutions must develop laws that are easy to understand and enforce and achieve their stated objectives without detrimental side effects."
"The Commission has to deliver on the areas for which it is responsible, particularly the completion of the internal market."
"I welcome Mr Barroso’s commitment to the Services Directive."
"We need it, but it must bring clear benefits and not losses."
"The starting point of the Services Directive is the screening of Member States’ laws hindering the establishment of services."
"We do not need a directive to do that."
"Member States could be doing that now; if they were really committed, they would get on with it."
"That is the key to the debate on the Lisbon Strategy: are Member States prepared to deliver on their promises?"
"The success of Lisbon rests with you, Mr Barroso."
"In your relations with Member States, are you going to be a man or a mouse?"
"The answer to that will determine the success of your Commission and of the Lisbon Strategy."
"– Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, the text of the recommendation trots out general principles that have already been accepted, precisely when a structured outline of specific measures to be adopted would be more desirable."
"One might say that everyone agrees on the goals but few know what to do to achieve them."
"A knowledge-based economy requires a high level of education, as the text states, but it makes no mention of the fact that a high level of education has to be based on schooling that is also high quality right from a child’s first years at school."
"As basic and secondary education in most countries is known to have a number of failings, it is a pity that the recommendation does not call on the Member States to examine this aspect and to seek an urgent solution to it."
"This document points to the future, and the future cannot do without such a solution."
"On another point, the text emphasises the need to mobilise European public opinion so as to convince it of the benefits of the Lisbon Strategy and to make it accept them, but there is not a single word on cultural policies at either a European or a national level."
"It talks of a culture of dialogue, but it does not even mention a dialogue of cultures."
"For the European citizen, accepting the need for the Lisbon Strategy and seeing its benefits will be a cultural process, more than anything else."
"Culture is not only an essential aspect of democracy; it is also the yardstick with which we can measure the gap between failure and success in a strategy like Lisbon, particularly if we want to preserve the European social model."
"A knowledge-based economy implies a world view that only culture can provide."
"For that very reason, we must call on the Council, the Commission and the Governments to make a special, serious commitment in the financial sphere as well – I repeat, in the financial sphere as well – to further Europe’s cultural policies."
"Without them, the Lisbon Strategy will remain little more than a nice list of good intentions."
"Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Barroso, I believe the Lisbon Strategy is really something that can embody the added value of the European Union, namely a long-term vision, a goal."
"However, we also have what is sometimes the cause of all the European Union’s failings: great ambitions but not the resources to match the targets we set ourselves."
"That is what we have just experienced over these last five years."
"We must therefore try to change things over the next five years."
"That is why, Mr Barroso, Mr Verheugen, I was pleased to hear you say this morning that we were at the beginning and not at the end of the process of reviewing that strategy and that the results of the European Council were not awaited as an end in themselves."
"After the meeting we are having today, there are, I believe, at least two essential meetings to come."
"First, the one on the adoption of the financial perspectives, and what you have just said to us seems to me to be going in the right direction."
"Then there is the reform of the Stability Pact, about which few have spoken this morning but which is facing the challenge referred to by Mr Poettering this morning when he called for stability and flexibility."
"Where, however, have we seen leadership being recreated or confidence restored by telling the citizens that nothing must change except their ability to make their employment more flexible?"
"We will not achieve the Lisbon Strategy’s objectives like that."
"If we really want to implement this strategy, a thorough reform of the Stability Pact will also be needed."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the answer to the question 'is it possible to create six million new jobs in Europe by 2010?', is yes."
"In response to the question of whether this is an overly-ambitious objective, the answer is no."
"As to whether we are capable of achieving that aim, the answer depends on what we do and do not do."
"What must we not do?"
"We cannot follow the example of those countries which have abandoned structural reforms and increased public spending."
"We need to do the very opposite: to increase growth."
"On this subject, I would like to use the example of the Aznar Government's policy in Spain – which can hardly be accused of inefficiency – to propose four practical measures."
"Firstly, let us make the labour market more flexible in order to increase labour force participation."
"Secondly, we need to ensure that the cohesion budget for the 2007-2013 period is sufficient for requirements."
"Thirdly, we need to encourage entrepreneurship by reducing fiscal and administrative burdens."
"Fourthly, we need to support measures designed to improve education and life-long learning."
"We also need to complete the single market, making the liberalisation of the communications, energy and financial services markets a priority."
"Then we need to open up the European economy to the outside world, focusing in particular on NICs."
"However, none of this will be possible, ladies and gentlemen, unless we have adequate budgetary resources – the figure of 1.24% of gross Community income set by the Commission is fine – and unless we involve the Member States directly in the process, since they are the main stakeholders in the Lisbon Strategy."
"If any of these States uses the Lisbon Strategy to propose cuts to Community policies that have been effective growth generators or in order to relax the Stability Pact, ladies and gentlemen, I bet you all a slice of Spanish and a Belgian beer that we will be on the road to disaster."
"– Madam President, I am delighted that it appears we will have a large majority for this resolution in the European Parliament."
"A broad majority is the only way for Parliament to have political influence."
"I feel that our influence consists of our having succeeded in our resolution in maintaining what is fundamental to the Lisbon Process, namely the balance between the three pillars of growth, social cohesion and environmental sustainability."
"I do not think that the original document from the Commission succeeded in doing this."
"It stated that growth was needed in order to achieve prosperity and environmental sustainability."
"That is true, but it also applies the other way around; in other words, we need social cohesion and must make long-term sustainable investments if we are to achieve long-term growth."
"What is important is for these to co-exist."
"If we in Parliament can effectively make this point to the Council and if it becomes policy in the future, then we shall have succeeded."
"Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, at a time when the European Union has just undergone enlargement and we are confronted each and every day with huge differences in the development of countries and regions, it is impossible to view the Community’s tasks in isolation from the measures and efforts undertaken by the individual EU Member States."
"The whole point of integration and the opportunities afforded by the Lisbon strategy is to act in solidarity to support less-advanced regions and to help them catch up."
"The original premise of the Lisbon strategy was to provide an answer to the internal and external challenges we currently face."
"Over the past year, however, we have not seen any evidence of new ideas or debates on how to reinvigorate the Lisbon process."
"I believe that the fundamental reason why the Lisbon strategy has not yet been a success is that both the European Commission and the Member States, which signed up to the strategy in 2000, have lacked the political ability to make changes."
"The latter are a prerequisite for the implementation of the strategy, and include in particular far-reaching liberalisation of the labour market, a lower level of welfare protection, an exhaustive review of regulatory barriers and major cuts in the amount of public money that is redistributed."
"The Lisbon strategy has fallen foul to bureaucracy, and the latter has become the greatest obstacle to the development of innovation."
"In order to achieve the goals it has set itself, Europe must forge new visions and develop common actions that unite all its Member States."
"Priority should be given to linking up the principles of the Lisbon strategy with cohesion policy instruments and the funding earmarked for these instruments."
"This funding should not resemble alms given by the wealthy to the poor."
"Instead, it should be an instrument to boost the competitiveness of regional economies and the development of human capital, and to encourage innovation and the transfer of technology from science to EU industry."
"The new Member States have brought to the EU of 25 the vitality of a liberalised market, a strong spirit of entrepreneurship, a critical approach to over-regulation, a high level of compliance with Community legislation and rapid increases in productivity, as well as the synergy and similarities that exist between the Lisbon goals and the structural changes we have undergone in recent years."
"Finally, I should like to say that the basic principle of economic development policy should be that the goals of economic growth and job creation are not designed to be achieved simultaneously."
"It is difficult to achieve the second without having achieved the first."
"Madam President, I will be backing the resolution on which we are due to vote because I agree with what President Barroso said to the effect that the three children are now being treated on an equal footing."
"The one does not follow from the other, but they should reinforce each other."
"I wholeheartedly support the policy outlined by Commissioner Verheugen to have the economy compete in terms of quality and not in terms of costs, for that would be a dead-end."
"I would like to ask for a debate on the method for achieving the objectives, because I think that, if that method ceases to be Community-oriented, the objectives cannot be achieved."
"Finally, I would ask you to consider Parliament’s question about the creation of a legal framework for services of general interest, together with a revised services directive."
"This will greatly simplify what we do here in this House."
"Madam President, I would say to President Barroso that it is true the first five years of Lisbon have delivered little and most Member States, which bear the ultimate responsibility for implementing the Lisbon Agenda, have been very slow to take ownership."
"It is also true that focusing on the economic agenda does not mean that we are downgrading other agendas, be this the environment or the social agenda."
"I would say to Commissioner Kroes that competition is the objective, not the problem."
"We cannot have a race to the back of the queue as Member States scurry to avoid attracting outside investment for fear of getting a rap on the knuckles from Brussels."
"Two high-profile examples from Ireland – Intel and Ryanair – have been highly instructive in demonstrating how unreasonably applied competition policy can militate against competition."
"I would urge Commissioner Kovács, in relation to taxation, that ‘if it ain’t broke don’t fix it’ and above all ‘don’t break it’!"
"Member States must be given the flexibility they require to implement the solutions they need to achieve their Lisbon objectives, hopefully by stimulating employment through a reduction in direct taxation, especially a reduction in labour taxes."
"I would underline to Commissioner Potočnik that it is absolutely imperative that Community funding for research be substantially increased under the Seventh Framework Programme."
"Fundamental research is essential, but equally we must facilitate the application of research and development in European businesses and foster innovation."
"I would say to Commissioner McCreevy that facilitating the free movement of services is the missing key needed to unlock the potential of the European workforce and galvanise the European economy."
"As you mentioned yesterday, Commissioner, it is always easier to find reasons not to do something."
"Services contribute 70% of European GDP, and I urge you to proceed with the Services Directive."
"It is particularly important for our new Member States, which have been denied the advantage of free movement of people, goods and services for so long."
"Please single out health services, consider the benchmark of good regulation, and deal with this specific area in a more appropriate way."
"Finally, a word to the College of Commissioners in general."
"Could we please have less regulation; better regulation; simpler regulation; thoroughly vetted regulation; risk-assessed regulation."
"We need to Lisbon-proof REACH, the Services Directive and the Nutritional and Health Claims Regulation."
"We are always an action plan away from action."
"Commissioner Barroso and colleagues, please go for it!"
"– Madam President, in the light of the shortcomings that have characterised the Lisbon Process, it should be stressed that the most important issues here are not about what we want to achieve, but about how we can achieve it."
"It is not a question of others being better in various areas, but of why they are better."
"We may take particular pride in the social model, but we are still seeing unemployment, exclusion, stagnation and conflict."
"We also have to ask ourselves why, and what decisions we must take to change this state of affairs."
"What Mrs Doyle just said is correct."
"In each area in which our actions hinder competition, the result is a deterioration in competitiveness."
"Those who are currently fighting the Services Directive with its free and open market for services are actually opposing new jobs and European growth in the future."
"There is no conflict between the internal market and people’s social security, since nothing is as crucial for social security as a job and an income."
"There is nothing so crucial to social cohesion as opportunities for new businesses and new jobs."
"The most important integration process in the European Union is happening right now while we are sitting here."
"It concerns a flow of people, goods and services that is taking knowledge and ideas across borders."
"We must therefore ask ourselves whether, in this process, we want to make it possible for every single Member State to exploit its particular competitive advantages."
"The old Member States have had the advantage of developing their social economies and their competitiveness in peace and freedom for over fifty years."
"During that time, the new Member States were suffering oppression and poverty."
"The internal market must be characterised by everyone’s being able to exploit their competitiveness."
"The Commission has a duty to realise and emphasise that what we are concerned with here are solidarity, integration and opportunities for all to create prosperity."
"That is why the Services Directive is important, and that is why it is important to remember that it is a question here of a European integration that is vital to competitiveness."
"This is something we must implement."
"– (Madam President, Members of the Commission. The Lisbon Strategy has set us a task which is not an easy one – to create new and higher quality jobs and, at the same time, to provide for the citizens of the European Union a similar or higher level of social security."
"Most countries allocate substantial resources to pay for an army of unemployed."
"Many young people spend far too long searching in vain for their first job, so that they can gain the necessary experience."
"Meanwhile, apart from their regular employment, mothers have the responsibility of maternal duties and are therefore working twice over."
"At the same time Europe has an ageing population as women are no longer prepared to bear as much responsibility for the normal reproduction of the population as they did in the past."
"Equality in the field of education has given women more opportunities in employment and vocational advancement, if, of course, they do not have children or put off having children until later."
"In this day and age we can no longer ask women to have more children for the good of society and devote themselves to motherhood, and also expect them to bear all the financial consequences on their shoulders."
"Similarly we cannot expect employers to provide extra benefits for mothers voluntarily."
"For this reason the countries of the European Union need to formulate systematically the kind of employment policy, including financial incentives and benefits, that will encourage employers to create jobs suitable for mothers, without either the employer or the mother herself suffering any negative consequences as a result."
"In this way mothers would not have to choose between a career and motherhood but could combine both in the interests of society and for their own development and benefit."
"Economising at the expense of motherhood is a poor investment for the future of society."
"– Madam President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to make a practical observation to help resolve what I think is one of the essential aspects of our problem, which is to go beyond the statements of principle and somehow get down to more concrete evaluations of our strategy."
"I take my cue from the subject of human capital, which everyone considers a strategic factor in regaining our competitiveness."
"During the last parliamentary term, when it was found that 94.5% of Europe’s schools had Internet connections but only 25% of teachers knew how to use the new technologies for teaching purposes, we spent a long time hoping that the -learning initiative would materialise."
"Parliament hoped for action from the national governments, which were supposed to make good use of resources – amounting to EUR 30 billion, or so we imagined – through a system of priorities that would enable them to solve the human capital problem."
"When it was clear that the governments would not act, it was decided that the Commission should introduce a programme."
"By that time the billions had shrunk to millions, 44 million to be precise, a derisory amount to solve the problem, and so the proposal was left as just a statement of principle and the priority remained purely theoretical without ever becoming a budget priority."
"In view of that, I ask that the Commission should be able to assign responsibility to those in power and to promote action in the area of human capital. As the Union budget quite rightly obliges us to provide for agriculture to the tune of 50%, this step would prevent Europe from remaining just a guardian of animal capital rather than the promoter of human capital."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in early February the Commission presented a revised version of the Lisbon strategy, which was approved one month later by the Member States."
"In spite of all the flowery language, however, there is no getting away from the fact that the Lisbon goals will not be achieved."
"The revised version of the Lisbon strategy sets fewer goals, while attempting to categorise these goals, and gives clear priority to economic growth and greater competitiveness."
"This is a good thing in itself, yet unfortunately this does not provide an answer to the contradiction inherent in the project, namely that the problems with which the European Union is struggling are due to the over-regulation of every area of economic activity."
"The impact of this over-regulation is quite simply devastating, and it leads to low – or, in some Member States, zero – GDP growth and high unemployment."
"The main problem Europe faces is the over-sized tax burden and excessive number of regulations with which the private sector and investors have to contend. Liberalisation in the sense of the four freedoms has always acted as the foundation of the Community, and care must therefore be taken to ensure that any legislation that is adopted serves to promote effective liberalisation and freedom instead of over-regulation."
"The Lisbon strategy also fails to mention a number of obvious problems that have arisen as a result of the EU’s enlargement to include ten new Member States."
"Such problems relate primarily to discrimination against workers from the new Member States on the labour markets of 12 of the old Member States."
"Such discrimination violates European principles and the concept of the four freedoms, and poses a major threat to the economic productivity of the European Union as a whole."
"Similarly, the Lisbon strategy does not mention the common agricultural policy in any detail, although this programme swallows up the most EU funding."
"This is another instance where double standards exist in the European Union; one rule applies to the old Member States, whose farmers receive full support, and another to the new Member States, whose farmers will not receive full support until 2013."
"The amount of money spent on this policy is also ridiculously large."
"In general terms, Europe needs less regulation, fewer grants and more freedom of movement for workers, services, firms, investments and capital. Thank you for your attention."
". Mr President, I believe the debate has adequately shown that Lisbon is crucial, while at the same time we have to realise that we are in a way faced with a paradox."
"Europe is the world’s greatest trading power, certain Member States are export champions, as Vice-President Verheugen has also said, and many European firms are world leaders in their sectors – and yet we rather have the impression that we are falling into a kind of perpetual pessimism."
"In aeronautics and space technologies, with Galileo for example, European industry has demonstrated its ability to make up lost ground."
"Note, too, that we are experiencing the success of enlargement."
"The new Member States are showing dynamism and an exemplary European momentum."
"The gap between the old and the new members of the European Union is closing: 5% growth for the new, around 2% for the old."
"This shows that Europe has tremendous creative ability."
"It also shows that Europe’s decline is neither real nor inevitable."
"At a time when we are complaining, feeling we are experiencing a period of decline, the rest of the world is concerned about the US deficits, the trade deficit and budget deficit."
"However, the US is producing growth, it is producing research, it is producing jobs."
"In the end, that is where the weakness of Europe as a whole lies."
"The question must nevertheless be approached with some caution, because when we speak of Europe the situation varies from one country to another."
"There are differences between Member States, there are States where employment is less of a problem, where there is growth."
"Overall, however, we are struggling to reach a sufficient and sufficiently sustainable rate of growth to create the jobs Europe needs if it is to cut an excessively high level of unemployment appreciably and sustainably."
"As I have already said, however, there are no grounds for pessimism provided the relaunch of the Lisbon Strategy does not stop at fine words but really does bring a fresh impetus, a fresh impetus that we need, that Europe’s citizens need and on which they are really counting."
"The revival of economic growth is certainly not synonymous with dismantling the European social model."
"The suggestion that we can achieve growth by dismantling the system of social protection does not seem credible to me."
"Nor is it synonymous with unlimited exploitation of natural resources regardless of the consequences, because in a way that would be the opposite of real quality growth."
"That is not the way that has been chosen for relaunching the reform strategy, the Lisbon Strategy, either."
"Social exclusion produces neither more growth nor more jobs."
"We must also be aware, however, that an economy that is increasingly uncompetitive and which no longer generates enough jobs, inevitably leads to social exclusion and undermines the very foundations of the European social model."
"That is why the presidency advocates growth as a way of fostering social cohesion, because social cohesion and economic growth are closely linked and in a way enrich one another."
"In this respect, I think the European Parliament’s resolution is an important contribution to the great reform project which the relaunch of the Lisbon Strategy represents."
"Your messages have been heard: more research, a better translation of research and innovation into new products and new services, better access to, and wider dissemination of, new technologies and innovation, enabling new knowledge to be better anchored in the economy and in society – a project for a knowledge-based economy that is the opposite of a society which marginalises large sections of the population – and accelerated development of the eco-technologies that can allow Europe to affirm its leadership in its future activities."
"Finally, I entirely agree with what Vice-President Verheugen said about the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are the reservoir of jobs that Europe needs."
"If that network is to develop, however, we have to think of new ways of financing it."
"It is unfortunately often too difficult to find the financial resources to establish a business."
"The bureaucratic and administrative hurdles are sometimes too much of a deterrent for young people to embark on the adventure of forming new businesses."
"We must therefore concentrate on better legislation, reduce the bureaucratic obstacles where that can be done easily and also have European laws that are more accessible and easier to understand."
"I believe we must follow that route more energetically in future."
"However, social innovation, investment in human capital and lifelong training are also ways of ensuring that flexibility, a term on which there is broad agreement, does not preclude a necessary amount of security."
"Insecurity is not a source of confidence for the future – quite the contrary."
"To some extent, the aim of the new Lisbon Strategy is a dynamic Europe which is not a victim but is a protagonist of globalisation – a genuine protagonist helping to shape that globalisation."
"We do not want a multi-speed society, we want everyone to share in growth, economic development and the expansion of knowledge."
"Knowing that these are crucial days for the EU’s economy and for its economic development, we would be deceiving ourselves if we thought we could relaunch the Lisbon Strategy successfully without being able to agree on a serious reform of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"It would be a waste of time."
"We cannot face the media saying ‘yes, we succeeded in relaunching the Lisbon Strategy but we failed to come to any agreement over the Stability Pact’."
"That is no solution."
"Europe needs structural reforms just as it needs a macroeconomic framework that will create a proper balance between stability on the one hand and growth and employment on the other."
"Uncontrolled deficits are certainly not the answer here."
"At the same time, however, future investments cannot be used to pay the price for a purely accounting approach that has nothing to do with good economic policy."
"Finally, I also agree with Mr Verheugen when he makes a direct connection between the success of the financial perspectives and the relaunch of the Lisbon Strategy."
"What credibility would the European Union have if, in March, it decided to revive research, to step up its action in support of competitiveness and to develop policies more compatible with the ecological balance only to find, scarcely three months later, that, for 0.0X% of its GNP, it was unable to agree on Community financing for its policies?"
"You must agree that is a joke."
"It is not realistic."
"People will be watching the European Union very closely over the next two weeks."
"It may create a genuine new momentum."
"It may also fail, putting at risk its future development, the confidence people have in its economy and also, perhaps even more seriously – as a number of speakers have pointed out – putting at risk the strong support it will need from its citizens if it is to succeed."
"In close cooperation with the Commission and attentive to your Parliament, the presidency wishes to make a success of this great partnership project that we are in the process of getting off the ground."
"We are counting on Parliament’s support as next week it organises a big meeting on the Lisbon Strategy with the national parliaments."
"The Lisbon Strategy is also an issue of democracy, it needs the backing and support of our societies."
"Without that support, there will be no success at the end of the road."
"I believe we now have the ability to release the energy, to release the creativity, to release the spirit of innovation and initiative with which Europe is overflowing, but we must take things in hand, open up new prospects for the people of Europe, and that gives me confidence for the future."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to offer you my sincere thanks for this very committed and, above all, very rich debate in which many of you have taken part."
"From it I conclude that Parliament is broadly in support of the new Lisbon Strategy."
"I am pleased about that."
"Our very positive exchange of views shows that the Commission can consider the European Parliament a genuine partner for the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy."
"You have responded positively to my request at the opening of the debate this morning."
"In her speech, Mrs Ek almost made a slip of the tongue: speaking of Parliament’s resolution, she almost said revolution."
"I will not go as far as that, what we are doing is not a revolution, but it is a genuine reform."
"It is also a revolution in the sense of our partnership: we are going to work together and we are all – Parliament, Commission, Council – capable of reaching a dynamic consensus, not a consensus of inaction or paralysis, but a dynamic consensus for the changes that are needed in our Europe."
"They are changes that are necessary for a reform that is proactive but has a sense of moderation and balance."
"That is why I would like to answer a specific question put to me by Mr Turmes of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance."
"You asked me, Mr Turmes, where I was when the global strategy for sustainable development was drawn up in Rio in 1992."
"Well, I was in Rio, but I was not on Ipanema or Copacabana beach!"
"I was the EU presidency’s representative, because at that time it was the Portuguese Presidency."
"I was then working with the Commission and the Member States, and it was Europe that led the debate on sustainable development at the Rio conference."
"I am telling you this to show you my personal commitment and that of the Commission to the objectives of sustainable development."
"There is no contradiction between social cohesion, sustainable development and growth and competitiveness."
"I believe that is an obvious conclusion from our debate."
"As we have always said, they are not contradictory objectives, they are objectives which can reinforce one another."
"Having said that, we are all now aware that Europe urgently needs to raise its level of growth."
"Growth and job creation are particularly urgent objectives."
"That is why we are sure we are right to concentrate our short-term objectives in that area."
"I am of course very pleased with the debate because we have shown that consensus was possible."
"However, that consensus must go beyond the European institutions, extending to the national level, to the national parliaments and governments."
"Your positive response increases our joint responsibilities."
"The Commission, for its part, will do all it can to make the new Lisbon Strategy a success."
"The Commission now knows that it can count on the European Parliament for the achievement of this objective."
"However, Parliament will have to be an active partner, taking account of the Commission’s demands."
"The Commission and the European institutions must not forget that the time for action has come."
"In this regard, I would like to highlight the support I have found in this Parliament for the priority we have given to developing the internal market."
"We will have no growth in Europe without a fully operational internal market."
"Services account for 70% of our economy."
"We have an internal market for goods, but still have 25 different markets for services."
"We therefore need to integrate the service markets, but to do so of course while taking account of the legitimate concerns put forward during the debate on the services directive."
"That is why the Commission is listening."
"It wants to work with you."
"I also want to stress our support for all that Commissioner McCreevy said about the services directive yesterday."
"We are going to work with you in that spirit."
"We believe an internal market in services must be established and that it is, at the same time, possible to resolve any problems to which the implementation of that directive might give rise."
"We are also very attentive to what has been said about human capital and the priority of human capital."
"Many of you, Mr Rasmussen in particular, have stressed the importance of human capital, education, research and innovation, and I will also add, as Mr Graça Moura said, culture."
"Indeed, our concept of human capital is not a technocratic view."
"Culture is also a part of our objectives for the knowledge economy."
"That is why we have made concrete proposals: the European technology institute, the new research programme."
"We have definite programmes to encourage a growth economy, but also a knowledge-based economy, at European level."
"In this context, I would like to answer a specific question put to me by Mr Daul – whom I would like to congratulate as chairman of the Committee of 33, together with all the rapporteurs who have made a broad consensus on your resolution possible."
"For our part, we agree to the holding of a tripartite summit of the presidents of the three institutions to discuss the Lisbon Strategy."
"I personally am willing to take part and I hope the President of Parliament and the president of the Council will back the idea."
"As you know, our medium-term objective is that the three institutions should work together."
"Having said that, the Lisbon Strategy would gain a lot if there were a greater sense that the institutions we represent were wholeheartedly behind it."
"Now we are looking to the European Council in the expectation and, if I may say so, the certainty that it will, in turn, give the necessary political impetus to the relaunch of Lisbon and the preparation of a European strategy for growth and employment."
"Many of you - Mr Karas, Mr Radwan, Mr Watson, Mr Titley, Mr Harbour – have stressed how important it now is that the Member States should be committed."
"Of course, the Commission now feels stronger due to the support which the European Parliament is giving to the new Lisbon Strategy."
"The proposals made by ourselves and the European Parliament must not now be weakened when they come to be implemented, the Member States must also be able to commit themselves and national public opinion must understand that the new Lisbon Strategy is not purely decorative but is really at the heart of the programmes for economic reform, social cohesion and sustainable development in Europe."
"In conclusion I must say that, for me, the great result of this debate is this willingness to work together, the possibility of reaching a dynamic consensus and also the broad support for the new Lisbon Strategy and, beyond that support, the fact that, for the next five years, it will be at the centre of the work done by our institutions and at the core of the reforms that will have to be undertaken by our Member States."
"The debate is closed."
"I have received three motions for resolutions(1) to end the debate pursuant to Rule 103 of the Rules of Procedure."
"The vote will take place today at 12.30 p.m."
"The next item is voting time."
"Mr President, I have an oral amendment."
"I would like the second half of paragraph 11 to read as follows: ‘stresses that inclusion of the EDF in the budget of the European Union should be accompanied by reinforcement of the political role of the JPA in monitoring the funds committed to the framework of the ACP-EU partnership’."
". Mr President, I have no problem with that and am happy to accept it."
". – Mr President, for this amendment and the next two, which are exactly the same in that they propose deleting three words, I would suggest we keep the term 'systematic'."
"Mr President, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament wishes to withdraw Amendment 32 in favour of Amendment 27 by Mr Méndez De Vigo and Mr Lehne, as the two amendments have the same aim. We would therefore ask Members to vote in favour of Amendment 27 instead."
"Amendment 32 is therefore withdrawn in favour of Amendment 27, upon which we will vote presently."
"Mr President, it is extremely kind of you to state the name of the group when you call amendments."
"I would, however, ask you to note that there is no longer a Liberal Group in this House; the group is now called the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe."
"I will be happy to bear this in mind, especially because the Sittings Service has asked me to avoid using shortened names for the groups, as I have been doing."
"I will therefore do as you ask."
"Mr President, I should like to alert you to an error in some of the language versions of Amendment 29."
"The original version, or in other words the English version, is the authentic text, which reads as follows;"
"‘Urges the Commission to come forward with an initiative to ensure … ’"
"and not ‘come forward with an initiative on liberalisation’, as stated in the French version, because one of the aims of this amendment, which was tabled by mutual agreement, was to delete these words."
"I agree with you entirely, Mr Désir, that the words ‘on liberalisation’ have been included in the French version by mistake."
"I should like to make this clear, and also to note that Amendment 29 falls."
"Although the texts will in any case be checked later, the amendment falls because one of the two parts of Amendment 5 has been adopted."
"In my opinion, the fact that the first part of Amendment 5 by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has been adopted does not mean that Amendment 29 should fall."
"The amendments relate to the same words, Mr Désir, ‘new initiative’ and ‘initiative’."
"Amendment 29 falls, but your correction was relevant and an account of the whole matter will be given to the House."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like – with the agreement of my co-rapporteur, Mr Désir – to put an oral amendment that we think covers the topic better."
"Perhaps I shall just read it out, in English: after ‘demographic situation’ it reads:"
"‘calls on the Commission and the Member States to develop the necessary comprehensive measures in order to support schemes, as a way of supplementing existing national pension systems’."
"What is new is the use of the term ‘complementary financing’ I ask the House to accept this oral amendment, which has been agreed by both the rapporteurs."
"I should like to thank my co-rapporteur, Mr Lehne, for having moved this oral amendment, and I should like to join him in asking the House to vote in favour of it."
"Mr President, a request has been made to hold a separate vote on the second part of Amendment 30, which seeks to delete two words."
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament wishes to withdraw this part, and I hope that this will make it possible for us all to vote in favour of a more sustainable transport policy."
"I will therefore put Amendment 30, which now has only one part, to the vote."
". – The relationship that has developed between the European Union and the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries deserves our recognition and our applause."
"These countries have a special significance and importance for the great majority of the Member States in particular and for the whole European Union in general, both for historical reasons and also simply out of a sense of international responsibility."
"Because this is an important and useful relationship, as reflected in the activities of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly, it must be both honest and consistent with the principles upheld and regularly demanded by the European Union."
"Good relations between the two sides are not just desirable but essential, but they are only possible – and only useful – if based on a philosophy of upholding the values in which we believe and, consequently, if the European Union does not hesitate to criticise – and to act accordingly – in cases where the countries in question do not fulfil their duties towards the international community or towards their own citizens."
"Relations have generally been like this, despite the disagreement that we have had occasion to express in cases such as Cuba or Angola."
"Even so, I voted in favour of the report."
". – The unanimous approval that this report received in committee illustrates the growing importance that all groups in Parliament, right and left alike, have been attributing to relations with African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) parliaments and their members. These relations are fundamental in a Europe that wants to be open to the world and is committed to strengthening dialogue with its strategic partners, along the lines of its historical ties."
"I am pleased to note the significant progress that was made last year in the internal organisation, external action and institutional influence of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly, and I hope it continues and grows even stronger."
"I welcome the recognition of the fact that the topic of post-conflict situations needs to be addressed as a whole, and I am grateful for the trust placed in me as co-rapporteur on this subject."
"Despite the grounds for contentment that I have mentioned, I must once again criticise the fact that the use of Portuguese and the availability of interpretation in this language – which, it must be remembered, is the third most spoken European language in world communications – are repeatedly passed over in the Joint Parliamentary Assembly sessions in favour of other languages (and very much minority languages in the ACP context), thus denying Portuguese-speaking parliamentarians a level playing field with the remaining members of the Assembly."
"I voted for the report."
"We have voted in favour of the report in its entirety because, in many areas, it contains important improvements on the Commission’s original proposal (for example, the elimination of the requirement of a double transformation process etc.). We have objections, however, to Amendment 31 (Article 13, paragraph 1), since we believe that the scheme of generalised tariff preferences is an instrument for reducing global poverty and is not to be used to protect our European textile industry."
". The system of generalised tariff preferences for developing countries is one more in a series of schemes promoting generalised preferences for foreign trade, and one more example of the way in which the European Union’s customs duties are being abolished."
"Claims are being made that this system works to the advantage of beneficiary countries, yet it is also acknowledged that the reform currently being proposed is not based on any evaluation of the way in which the previous system functions or how effective it is."
"It is, however, easy to predict the negative effects this will have on the EU’s industry and agriculture. They include the following;"
"- zero or preferential customs duties will be granted for a larger number of products, which will mean that a great many sectors, including agriculture and fisheries, will face even harsher global competition,"
"- the market share that countries will be allowed before they lose their right to benefit from customs preferences will be so large that it will bring about the downfall of entire industrial sectors."
"The textile industry will be particularly affected, as it will bear the brunt of the end of the quota system,"
"- safeguard measures are always inadequate and overly bureaucratic, and are never applied."
"As usual, however, all the Commission is concerned about is pursuing an ideology that places trade above all else."
"Impoverishing Europe and causing more Europeans to lose their jobs will not further the development of developing world countries."
"It is for this reason that we will vote against this report."
". – The current generalised system of preferences (GSP) is based on a way of thinking that embodies a contradiction: the idea that development can be promoted through the liberalisation of international trade – a model that promotes exports and is regulated at world level, with a ‘centre’ and a ‘periphery’."
"That way of thinking runs counter to fair international relations and to aid aimed at developing endogenous factors in the least economically developed countries. Without such factors, and trapped between the robbery that is external debt and the imposed interests of the major US, EU and Japanese multinationals, those countries will continue to have a peripheral and subordinate status."
"Trade is one component of development, but it is far from being the most important."
"The GSP guarantees preferential access for products from about 178 countries."
"The current proposal brings forward the scheme’s entry into force and opens up the GSP to particularly sensitive products for Portugal (tuna preserves, tomato concentrate, textiles and clothing)."
"Textiles and clothing are particularly badly affected, especially because there is a high graduation threshold for the sector."
"That and other adverse aspects need to be reversed; otherwise there will be serious consequences for the country’s manufacturing sector, with the social and economic fallout that will result from that."
". The Commission’s reform of the generalised system of preferences has been stepped up a gear, apparently because of the urgent need to support the economies of those countries hit by the tsunami of 26 December 2004."
"The plan is for the new system to come into force on 1 April."
"In the aftermath of the tsunami disaster, European citizens and States proved that their generosity could be counted upon."
"Yet the Commission intends to make sectors of European industry that are experiencing difficulties, in particular the textile industry, pay a heavy price for this generosity."
"The textile industry has been hit hard by unfair competition from China, and this competition will only get worse. Yet the industry provides a livelihood for 2.5 million people in Europe, and generates turnover of EUR 230 billion."
"The Commission intends to set a threshold of 12.5% of Community imports of these products before a country loses its entitlement to GSP, which will encourage competition from the Indian textile industry, as the latter will benefit from reduced duties. This industry is regarded as competitive under the current GSP, which sets a threshold of 10% before customs duties are introduced, or which in other words enables balanced competition despite differences in salaries and welfare conditions."
"Making one sector of the economy pay the price of state aid flies in the face of liberal thinking. Such a move, which would make hundreds of thousands of people in Europe redundant, would also be antisocial."
"The generalised system of preferences for customs duties is over 30 years old."
"The idea upon which it is based goes back even further, to the UNCTAD of 1963, which introduced the idea of compensatory differences, or what would today be called ‘positive discrimination in the field of customs duties’."
"It would appear that poor countries, such as Peru or Colombia, have benefited from being able to send us their asparagus or prawns without having to pay customs duties, even if some trade deflection has come about due to a lack of clarity over the rules of origin."
"When looked at more closely, the GSP has something in common with the entire GATT and WTO system; it owes its existence to a redundant theory, namely that customs duties should be reduced with the aim of ultimately abolishing them."
"A more innovative idea would be to introduce a system for deducting customs duties."
"The exporter would be granted a customs credit in the importing country equivalent to the customs duties that had been imposed and that would be deductible on purchases made in the importing country."
"Funding for these customs credits could be raised on a forward stock market."
"The problem of economic and social inequality would be resolved, and a balance would be achieved in global trade."
". – The scheme of generalised tariff preferences (GSP) must be understood both as an instrument of trade policy and as an instrument supporting development, since international trade is undoubtedly one of the most powerful drivers of development and growth in any economy."
"In that context, and as the rapporteur explicitly mentions in his explanatory statement, ‘the GSP therefore needs to be consistent with development policy objectives and compatible with the Doha Programme’."
"The Doha Round is, indeed, an important ongoing step towards a more open and fairer world economy and, as the rapporteur proposes, that understanding must be present in the GSP."
"Lastly, I consider that the speed with which the GSP was amended to respond to the effects of the tsunami should be applauded."
". – The graduation mechanism that has been introduced makes it possible to stop applying the generalised system of preferences (GSP) to countries that are competitive in the Community market and no longer need the preferences scheme to promote their exports."
"Furthermore, the mechanism also plays an essential role in regulating the commercial influx of textile and clothing products, and that is proving extremely important in protecting Europe’s textile industry in view of the abolition of quotas on 31 December 2004."
"I also realise that one of the areas where sustainable development is promoted is in improving the economic situation of developing countries, especially those countries that are least integrated into the international trading system."
"Consequently, the most vulnerable developing countries that take on special duties and responsibilities as a result of ratifying and applying the basic conventions on human and workers’ rights will benefit from additional tariff preferences within the GSP, something that I warmly welcome."
"Lastly, I wish to highlight the simplification achieved by cutting the number of arrangements from five to three, so that now there is a general arrangement, a special arrangement for sustainable development and good governance, and a special arrangement for the least developed countries (‘Everything but Arms’ – EBA)."
"I voted for the report."
". ‘I and my British Conservative colleagues have supported the report by Mr. Dombrovskis on the Budget Guidelines for 2006 because we believe it is a step in the right direction."
"We approve of using appropriations in a more efficient way, of demanding more clarity in the breakdown of each submitted budget proposal, and in stating that it costs more than €200 million per year to site the European Parliament in Brussels and Strasbourg."
"This is a gross waste of taxpayers' money!"
"However, reform of the EU budget is essential."
"Fraud and maladministration can only be tackled if the right structures are put in place and so far this has been slow and inadequate."
"There must be better accountability and transparency in the spending of appropriations by all the EU institutions and a commitment by Member States to account adequately for all expenditure on EU programmes.’"
". I think it is imperative we foresee sufficient expenditures in areas where political decisions require greater financial engagement, in order to make amending budgets and transfers superfluous."
"For example, the budget for the parliamentary dimension of the WTO should cover all expenditure for the European Parliament's delegations to WTO Ministerial conferences as well as expenditure relating to the organisation of the Parliamentary Conference on the WTO"
". I voted in favour of the report by Mr Dombrovskis(A6-0043/2005)on the guidelines for Sections II, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII (A) and VIII (B) and on the European Parliament's preliminary draft estimates (Section I) for the 2006 budgetary procedure, because I agree with the thrust of the evaluations and proposals before us, and, in particular, the consolidation and preparation for the next enlargement and the efficient and rational use of appropriations."
"I should also like to point out that I agree with the specific points relating to vocational training, especially in the area of translation and interpretation."
"In my opinion, it is essential that Members of this House take part actively in their mother tongue, thereby ensuring a level playing field for all Members."
"Lastly, I should like to highlight Parliament’s increased responsibility in legislative decision-making, which will obviously require better management of existing resources and the allocation of more funding to support our work."
". The report before us highlights the areas in which it is important to guarantee that available appropriations will be increased and properly used."
"The challenge of enlargement unquestionably requires renewed and determined effort, and, as such, we must accommodate new staff within the institutions’ structure as swiftly as possible – the same swiftness that we are requesting of the Secretary-General – and must allocate funding to increase the number of interpreters and to improve general working conditions in the committees by increasing the number of rooms and computers available."
"The plan to clarify the nomenclatures of the other institutions' budgets is to be welcomed."
"The transparency and intelligibility of data – as I have said on previous occasions – are essential prerequisites of accountability and efficiency as regards budgetary matters."
"I welcome the proposal to adopt ecological efficiency standards in administrative management, and the call to adopt much more ambitious information and communication policies."
"This is, indeed, one of the things that I often fight for in each budget, given that it strikes me as essential that we bring Europe – its projects, its designs and its actions – ever closer to the citizens."
"Mr President, I wish to draw the attention of the House to two matters being considered by the Committee on Petitions at the moment."
"The first concerns Mike and Ann Radford, two constituents of mine from Chipping Barnet, who bought a property in Cyprus in the 1980s and for 14 years have been trying to get redress from their builder for a faulty retaining wall."
"This is a matter which the Committee on Petitions has under consideration."
"I would urge the committee to do all it can to address the concerns of Mr and Mrs Radford, their neighbours and people who find themselves in similar situations in many parts of Europe."
"Consumer disputes of this kind are deeply problematic and painful for the people involved and I hope the Committee on Petitions can help."
"Secondly, on Equitable Life, my constituent, Arthur White, has submitted a petition highlighting the regulatory failings that occurred in relation to Equitable Life."
"Again, I would urge the Committee on Petitions to speed up its consideration of this important matter and do all it can to ensure that the petitioners get justice and redress."
". Good democracy is founded on absolute respect for the citizens’ rights, and that respect historically encompasses the citizens’ right to table petitions to parliaments."
"This practice, which might at times appear to be of little use, is above all a sign of democratic humility and readiness to listen to the citizens, which are characteristics of prime importance in a democratic society."
"Accordingly, we must publicly acknowledge the existence of the Committee on Petitions in Parliament and the work that it does."
". The most oft-heard criticism of the current state of the process of European integration is the divorce between the decision-makers and the citizens, the so-called democratic deficit."
"Given that, in parliamentary terms, the Committee on Petitions constitutes a fruitful way of strengthening contact with the populations, its work ought to be strengthened, as this would encourage people to become involved in European affairs."
"I feel that this offers the major benefit of, on the one hand, bringing to light the real concerns and anxieties of the people and, on the other, enabling politicians to show to those interested the work that they have done and to show that they are prepared to work to address the real needs of their citizens."
"In this context, I wish to express my disappointment that due attention was not paid to the petition calling for the inclusion of a reference to Europe’s Christian heritage in the preamble to the Constitutional Treaty, and that, as such, the wishes of the million-plus people throughout Europe who signed the petition were completely disregarded."
"Lastly, I feel that the Committee on Petitions would benefit from increased resources and effective and balanced support from both the Commission and the Council."
". Along with the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the large majority in this House, I voted in favour of this report, because it presents guidelines and measures that will enable us to revitalise the Lisbon Strategy, to improve its implementation and to meet the objectives set in 2000."
"As I have always advocated:"
"- It provides for greater involvement in the process of decision-making and implementation for Parliament (‘a real culture of dialogue should be developed with the Parliament’), alongside the Commission (with which a ‘strong partnership’ should be established) and the Council (it is proposed that tripartite meetings should be held between the three Institutions), and the national parliaments (with which Parliament should also establish a ‘strong partnership’), as well as ‘increased involvement of regional and local authorities’; and"
"- It calls for budgetary resources at national and Community level to be commensurate with the objectives set within the scope of the Lisbon Agenda; this must be reflected in the financial perspectives for 2007-2013 and in the Structural Funds, as reworked within the framework of the cohesion policy."
"In addition, the reviewed Lisbon Strategy will constitute the instrument used to implement the desired change to the economic and social development model that has until now been followed in the Madeira region."
". The Lisbon Strategy’s goal was to make Europe ‘the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world’ by 2010."
"It has entirely failed to do so; instead, Brussels bureaucrats have succeeded in turning the European Union into the least dynamic economy in the world."
"A special mention should also be given to the euro zone, which is performing even worse than the rest of the EU."
"Brussels will never admit that it is to blame, of course, as the EU never questions its own actions."
"Its proposals for solving these problems consist of even more Europeanisation – more market liberalisation, more regulatory constraints on firms, fewer public services, more European and global competition, less public funding and less welfare protection."
"The social and environmental goals of the Lisbon Strategy mark one have been done away with, and all-encompassing competition and productivity put in their place."
"People have become commodities, and the idea is that the market will shuffle them around and take care of unemployment."
"The Barroso Commission’s proposals are nothing short of a nightmare."
"They admittedly take a ‘soft’ approach, as all they consist of is a programme and objectives, some of which even make sense."
"Yet we are only too familiar with the actual directives which transpose programmes of this kind, and which attempt to implement their objectives; the Bolkestein directive is an excellent example."
"This draft resolution is a confused mass of text in which everything that any civilised person would want to see implemented is considered without the least regard to the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality."
"Nobody would oppose efforts to counter and eliminate poverty and unemployment as soon as possible."
"Nobody would object to having taxes that are simple and fair rather than complicated and unfair."
"Nonetheless, the principle of subsidiarity – which is supposed to be a guiding principle of EU cooperation – means that the Member States should have the right to weigh up differently the conflicting objectives that democratic government has to deal with."
"The underlying purpose of this draft is to shift even more political decisions from the Member States to the institutions of the EU."
"The June List has been mandated by its electorate to oppose such centralisation of power in Europe and therefore rejects the draft in its entirety."
"Moreover, we have opposed several amendments that we would in principle support in the Swedish Parliament, but which we oppose at EU level out of concern for democracy in the Member States."
"This applies in the case of Amendment 32, for example."
". ‘I and my Conservative colleagues' voting decision on the resolution on the mid-term review of the Lisbon agenda is based on the need for economic reform, greater labour market flexibility, more competitive taxation policies and reduced barriers to employment growth, particularly the excessive regulation that pervades many European economies."
"Of course, the US continues to out-perform Europe and the competitive challenges from Asia, particularly China and India, are increasing with no apparent urgent response from national capitals in the EU."
"The Council Presidency must not be distracted by calls for the preservation of the completely outdated ‘European Social Model’."
"It is precisely because so many governments have failed to grasp the nettle on reform that the Lisbon process has sadly, to date, failed in key areas."
"Competitive taxation policies, flexible labour markets, less red tape and a determination to tip the balance firmly in favour of the wealth creators offers the only way out of Europe's relative economic decline."
"Those things are anathema to Socialists, but vital for all of us."
"We have voted against a number of amendments that would undermine the market and enterprise driven policies that we believe a revised Lisbon agenda should champion.’"
"I fully subscribe to the Lisbon goals of strengthening employment, economic reform, enhancing competitiveness, completing the internal market, Social Cohesion and environmental protection as engines of a sustainable growth-orientated economy."
"In order to build a broad coalition for change, the Lisbon Strategy must be universally understood as a strategy whose benefits will be widely shared and developed in cooperation with all relevant socio-economic actors, which looks for labour markets which promote both dynamism and security, which seeks to modernise, but not to weaken, social security, and which sees high social and environmental standards as part of Europe's competitive model."
"I believe that to revitalise the Lisbon strategy is essential in order to address the failure of living up to the goals of March 2000."
"I welcome this opportunity to support the idea of national action plans as a way of implementing the Lisbon Strategy, with every government nominating a minister to coordinate action."
". Between the illusion that all you have to do is to state an objective and it will be met, and the reality that the European economy has not been able to deal with the current economic crisis, there lies a Union made up of different economic and social realities, a Union that repeatedly states its good intentions yet has had little success in solving its problems."
"Having said that, it cannot be denied that Europe is the best continent to live in."
"Accordingly, if Europe wants to be the most competitive economy, we need to alter the route that we have been taking. This must be done without losing our best features and our core elements, and ensuring respect for the historical and cultural diversity and the varied levels of development across the countries of Europe."
"I therefore believe that the resolution before us articulates a vision that I share: sustainable growth and employment must be the EU’s most pressing objectives and achieving those objectives will promote environmental and social progress."
"There can be no European social model without a European economy, and there is also no point in having a competitive economy that does not serve the interests of the citizens."
". The mid-term review before us is characterised by the conclusions of the last Brussels Spring European Council, which were that results have been modest in terms of the targets that were set."
"The stagnation affecting the European economy since 2000 has certainly not helped."
"Otherwise, apart from asking for greater determination on the part of the Commission, the proposed text confines itself to reiterating principles laid down in the original strategy."
"Our orientations are, and have always been, sustainable development, social cohesion, improved working conditions, more jobs, continuing or dynamic training and economic competitiveness. Unfortunately, however, those orientations continue to be held back by the alienation of many states and citizens."
"I therefore regret that another opportunity to combine financial discipline and budgetary austerity, on the one hand, with the necessary importance attached to the nature and quality of public spending, on the other, fell by the wayside at the last ECOFIN meeting."
"We must also improve the regulations and the legislative environment, by simplifying them."
"Lastly, I feel that we need a substantially more realistic outlook that is not confined to condemning failure and repeatedly justifying everything by accusing the Member States of a lack of motivation and of non-compliance."
"We need creativity, leadership and determination, which is the main thrust of this resolution and which persuaded me to vote in favour."
". Today we are to vote on the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy."
"At a time when 68 million of our fellow citizens in the European Union are still living in poverty, the only option open to us is to endorse the Lisbon Strategy adopted in 2000 and to reiterate the goal of eliminating poverty."
"Progress has been made in certain areas, such as the National Action Plans on Social Inclusion and the incorporation of the fight against poverty as a goal in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Yet we cannot stop there; we owe it to our fellow citizens to stay the course."
"They expect us to make good on our promises, and I would urge that all the necessary measures be put in place at the Spring Summit."
". I am glad to see that the Lisbon strategy also covers the use of all forms of alternative energy, which must therefore be promoted accordingly."
"While we are all aware that their use protects the environment and helps with compliance with the Kyoto Protocol, the positive effects of their use include, among many others, increased competitiveness, added regional value and the creation of jobs in rural areas."
"I am therefore glad that the European Parliament, as stated in its motion for a resolution, believes that a competitive and sustainable European economy is conditional upon the use of sustainable energy sources."
". As a result of the realistic picture painted by Mr Kok in the mid-term review, the Commission decided to take stock and table a reform of the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy."
"The priorities set in 2000 have been redefined on the basis of the ongoing concerns of European citizens, namely growth and jobs."
"In this new reality, those responsible for each measure are identified, practical deadlines are set and progress is assessed."
"The next step is a single national programme and the appointment of a ‘Lisbon Czar’ for each Member State, who will be responsible for monitoring the actions of the Lisbon Strategy and for simplifying methods of assessment."
"Given that this is an intergovernmental matter, the ‘Lisbon Strategy’ depends almost entirely on the Member States’ ability and commitment to carry out far-reaching structural reforms."
"Following the review of the Strategy, the Member States must set clearer priorities and work to a strict timetable if the Lisbon Strategy is to be a success story."
"At the moment, the Lisbon Strategy must come across as pie in the sky to most European citizens."
"EU history is replete with stories of this nature."
"In the 1980s, nobody believed that the single market and the single currency would be successful."
"I wish the ‘Lisbon Strategy’ similar success."
". – The European Parliament adopted the resolution on the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy with the vote of the PPE-DE, the social democrats, the liberals and other conservative political forces, who put any minor differences between them to one side and united on the strategic objective of the Lisbon treaty."
"In the name of the competitiveness of the economy of united Europe (in other words of its monopolies), an unprecedented attack has been unleashed on the employment and social rights of the grass-roots classes."
"I refer to the violent redistribution of workers' income for the benefit of big business, with reductions in the salaries of workers and those entering retirement, the abolition of welfare payments and reductions in benefits, privatisations and so on. The aim is to use so-called active forms of employment in order to extend flexible forms of work and push back the retirement age; in other words, to create cheap, flexible manpower which will be easy prey for exploitation by the monopolies with impunity."
"The parliamentary group of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the resolution, which accepts the full frontal attack on the working and other grass-roots classes and demonstrates the class orientation of the ΕU."
"There can be no self-delusion as to the importance of the Lisbon strategy."
"The organised resistance, disobedience and fight of the majority of the grass-roots classes in the ΕU against the Lisbon anti-labour strategy is the only way out."
"The resolution concerning the Lisbon Strategy contains much that is commendable."
"Nonetheless, I should like to have seen even greater emphasis on the importance of policy integration; that is to say the fact that growth initiatives must take place in forms in which careful consideration is given to the social and environmental consequences."
"These three dimensions of development must be mutually supportive."
"The idea of ‘growth first – we can deal with the rest afterwards’ is wrong and represents an unfortunate return to the debate that took place prior to the EU’s adoption of its sustainability strategy in Gothenburg in 2001."
"The EU faces a number of difficult challenges in the area of the environment."
"The risk of irreversible climate change is particularly serious."
"To address this problem we need to rethink our energy and transport systems in Europe, and this is something that must primarily take place through substantial investment in innovation and the development of new technology."
"Such investment would stimulate growth and create new job opportunities."
"At the same time, European countries would develop top-level expertise in an area in which the entire world is crying out for new solutions."
"Neither the Commission’s proposal nor Parliament’s resolution puts sufficient emphasis on these aspects."
"It is my hope that the European Council will pay far more attention to these issues in its sitting on 22 March."
"That concludes voting time. The sitting is suspended."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the preparation of the European Council (Brussels, 22-23 March 2005)."
". Mr President, it has been agreed that the European Council of 22 March will focus on the Lisbon Strategy, which was the subject of our debate this morning, as well as on the Stability and Growth Pact, even if there is still a chance that this issue may be settled before the European Council meets."
"The Council will also discuss the sustainable development strategy and the Kyoto Protocol."
"In view of the fact that the Lisbon Strategy was discussed in this morning’s sitting, I do not intend to return to it again now."
"Instead, I will focus on the other two or three topics."
"The first of these is the Stability and Growth Pact."
"The Council has been debating reform of the Stability and Growth Pact for some time now, and indeed there are those who probably feel that it has been debating it for too long."
"It was discussed on several occasions during the Dutch Presidency, and every Ecofin meeting under the Luxembourg Presidency has taken the issue as its central focus."
"In view of this in-depth debate and the changes requested by the finance ministers, on 8 March the Presidency presented a document to Ecofin aimed at finding a balanced solution that would meet the needs of all the Member States."
"It does so by proposing a compromise which is founded on good economic sense – an issue which was also debated by the House this morning – and which provides an answer to the real need for increased flexibility during difficult periods, as well as calling for tighter budgetary discipline during times of growth and prosperity."
"As the Ecofin Council was unable to reach an agreement on a report to the European Council during its meeting of 8 March, the Presidency will continue talks with the aim of finding a solution that is acceptable to everyone and that can be presented to the Heads of State or Government."
"Another meeting of the Ecofin Council has been called for 20 March, or in other words two days before the European Council meets."
"This morning I mentioned that a failure to reach an agreement would entail real and significant risks."
"It is an unfortunate fact that the current Pact would not simply be applied as though nothing had happened, and that failure to reach an agreement would not boost the credibility of the current Pact."
"At the same time, however, a compromise at all costs – a cut-price compromise, one could say – would be an equally poor solution."
"Furthermore, this is an area where Europe is under close observation, first and foremost by the citizens, who expect their decision-makers to be able to pursue economic and budgetary policies that sacrifice neither growth to stability, nor stability to a growth that is at best short-lived."
"We should not yet resign ourselves to failure, however, as there is still every chance that a balanced and credible solution may be reached."
"If we achieve such a solution, which we very much hope to do, the Commission will be provided with a clear mandate regarding the improvements the Member States have agreed to make to the Pact, and the procedures necessary for a formal revision of the Pact’s provisions can then be set in motion."
"Revision of either of the two regulations will entail a Commission proposal and the involvement of Parliament in accordance with the rules set out in the Treaties, which are in fact different for each of the regulations."
"I will now move on to sustainable development and the Kyoto Protocol, both of which are obviously also closely linked to the Lisbon Strategy, given that this morning we came to the conclusion that the environmental aspect of the Lisbon Strategy should be retained or even given extra weight."
"It is therefore quite natural that the European Council should also deal with issues relating to sustainable development and the Kyoto Protocol."
"The Presidency believes that sustainable development should be an overarching concept, and one of the aims of the European Council will be to clarify how changes to the sustainable development strategy should be tackled in future."
"For example, the guiding principles of sustainable development could be enshrined in a charter, one of the main components of which would be a series of relevant indicators to be used in the various policies in the future."
"The Commission could submit a proposal to this effect to the European Council to be held in June."
"Time is short, however, and in our opinion it would be a good idea if the new sustainable development strategy were to be finalised and presented before the end of the year."
"We all agree that climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing humanity, and that it has a major impact in environmental, economic and social terms."
"We were therefore delighted when the Kyoto Protocol came into force, and we are also delighted that the Russian Federation has ratified the Protocol."
"It is our firm intention to give new impetus to international negotiations."
"In order to do so, our first task will be to examine the options that exist for a UN-led post-2012 regime that would ensure that the highest possible level of cooperation was achieved from all countries."
"This week’s Environment Council will focus on this issue, and should come to some kind of conclusion."
"It will then be necessary to draft a long-term strategy for the European Union, the aim of which should be to stop emissions from exceeding the much-quoted 2ºC increase in temperature and to reduce total emissions from 30% to 15% against 1990 levels by 2020."
"Finally, a study should be drafted with the aim of achieving a good cost-benefit ratio for all of these measures."
"It should be plain to everyone that the European Council has a very full agenda; it will deal with issues that are of major significance for the future of the European Union, yet at the same time it will also reassure Europeans that this Europe of ours is concerned about their present and future problems."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this morning we discussed in detail the new strategy for growth and jobs and managed to achieve perfect convergence between Parliament and the Commission."
"I believe that, in this area too, the forthcoming European Council has a crucial role to play in implementing this ambitious strategy and we must not miss this opportunity."
"This European Council comes at a very important time, firstly because it is taking place just as a new Parliament and a new Commission are starting to find their feet and to set out their working methods for the next few years, and also because a wide-ranging debate on the ratification of the Constitution is due to take place, a debate that will focus on the type of Europe that we want and the type of Europe that we are capable of building for our fellow citizens."
"Accordingly, we must demonstrate at the forthcoming European Council that the EU is actually working and that the EU is capable of successfully launching new initiatives that produce tangible results in the lives of Europe’s citizens."
"Let me single out the two main deliverables for this European Council."
"First, there is the need to relaunch the Lisbon Strategy and to re-focus it on growth and jobs in order to bring our wider economic, social and environmental objectives within reach."
"This requires more than just words."
"People need to see a real commitment from Member States."
"That is why our new approach to working to support Members States in delivering on the Lisbon objectives is critical."
"Second, we must ensure that a stronger Stability and Growth Pact emerges from the summit with its credibility reinforced."
"Both these goals are well within our grasp, and I would like to comment on each one in turn."
"In relation to Lisbon, I would simply emphasise the importance of giving fresh momentum to the process of reform."
"That is why the European Council should make a clear commitment to the new governance mechanisms, the new integrated guidelines and the national and EU Lisbon programmes, with simple reporting and better coordination of reforms at a national level."
"The launch and follow-up to the renewed Lisbon approach must be prepared via close cooperation between the Commission, the Council and Parliament."
"I shall now turn to the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are all aware that operation of the Stability and Growth Pact has recently experienced problems."
"Differing interpretations of the Treaty and of the Stability Pact have led to uncertainties over the methods of budgetary supervision."
"We need an interpretation which can ensure the pact’s effectiveness and credibility, without the need to re-write the pact itself."
"Yesterday’s ECOFIN discussions were inconclusive."
"The Presidency has opted to hold a further meeting of ministers prior to the European Council."
"Nonetheless, I continue to hope that the spring summit can unveil a renewed and more credible pact, based on a comprehensive, consistent and balanced solution."
"The Commission will continue to fight for the principles it submitted, in particular for reform of the pact."
"The deficit and debt benchmarks set out in the Treaty must continue to be complied with as the cornerstone of the system."
"The preventive aspect of the pact can be improved, in particular by defining medium-term budgetary targets specific to each country."
"When the economic situation is buoyant, budgetary policy must remain sound."
"Excessive deficits must be identified unambiguously and corrected rapidly."
"However, the timescale for the correction could take account of economic factors."
"As for the Commission, it will continue to make all possible efforts with the Presidency and Member States to reach an agreement – but not an agreement at any price."
"The Council’s conclusions will also cover other important issues."
"On some of them, such as sustainable development and climate change, it is also vital to reach agreement if we are to use the Lisbon reforms to underpin sustainable growth."
"I await with interest the political impetus to come from the European Council towards a European charter for sustainable development, which the Commission will certainly follow up and support."
"Finally, we shall certainly review the latest developments in the Middle East and Iraq, and shall examine the progress made in preparation for the next round of enlargement and any future negotiations."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will close by saying that this summit is an opportunity we cannot afford to miss."
"It must set the tone for future reforms by relaunching Lisbon and reinforcing the credibility of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"As we said this morning, the two are linked."
"What is at stake here is our credibility, and the way we demonstrate to European citizens that we are seriously concerned for the future of Europe and determined to work towards that end."
"The public, the electorate, would simply not understand if we were unable to achieve a breakthrough, or if the summit ended not with a success but with winners and losers."
"Any fine distinctions we may wish to introduce in areas such as which institution does what, or whether the new Lisbon strategy is more to the left, right or centre, will be irrelevant to the majority of our citizens."
"For them, the issue is Europe, not one particular institution or another or one particular aspect or another."
"It is therefore extremely important to send a consistent message and to show that we are really working together in the interests of our Europe."
"Projecting an image of disharmony between institutions or conveying a tentative or pessimistic message on the future of Europe would inevitably have a negative effect on public opinion, something particularly dangerous at a time when the constitutional treaty is going through the ratification process."
"However, I believe we have a first-rate chance of success."
"We have a competent and determined Presidency."
"We have a Commission which is making its very best efforts."
"We are achieving an important victory today by showing our shared determination to achieve a new Lisbon strategy."
"We have demonstrated today that it is genuinely possible to reach a stronger and dynamic consensus."
"It is therefore vital to show the European Council that we can assist Europe in moving up to a higher gear."
"We can launch the reform process and begin to mobilise opinion in favour of a European renewal."
"That is what is at stake at the spring meeting of the European Council – to ensure that our vision is translated into action."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even though the ECOFIN meeting at the beginning of this week has still not finally resolved the issue of how the stability criteria are to be evaluated in the future, I do very much hope that the finance ministers will nevertheless come to an agreement before the European Council."
"For my own part, I remain convinced that the foundations of the Stability and Growth Pact must not be tampered with."
"The current threshold values – 3% for new debt and 60% for outstanding debt, measured in terms of gross national product – are so closely entwined with the euro’s exchange rate that they must be retained if the single currency is to be kept stable and solid."
"It is also fundamental to the Pact that a state’s budget should be considered as a single whole when assessing compliance with the criteria; this is not just prescribed by general budgetary law, but also enjoined upon us by sound human reason."
"A single, integral budget cannot be evaluated both with and without whole categories of expenditure."
"That is why we cannot have the situation in which categories of expenditure that some Member States regard as special burdens are excluded when assessing to what degree the stability criteria have been adhered to."
"After all, the Pact – containing as it does also a substantial growth component – does make provision for the possible nuanced valuation of a national budget in the light of the country’s current position in the economic cycle."
"For that reason, the current procedures have to be retained, while making their detailed course and consequences dependent on the realities of budget policy, and this – as I told the House a few weeks ago – for the reason that the Pact is called a ‘Stability and Growth Pact’ and excessive stability must not be allowed to hamper growth rather than it being stimulated."
"The ECOFIN Council has listed possible approaches to a more finely-honed evaluation of the nation states’ efforts at achieving stability."
"I very much hope that some of these will prove the key to bringing about a final agreement prior to the summit on 22 and 23 March."
"Let me now just say something else about the Lisbon strategy."
"The disappointing results at the end of its first half are, in essence, attributable to a too widely-dispersed range of goals."
"That is why, if we are to end up with tangible successes after the next five years, we need to concentrate on a number of essential objectives, and so I am in favour of an approach that relies more than hitherto on the nation states implementing the Lisbon requirements."
"This allows a certain degree of competition around what are termed ‘best practices’ that can in fact do nothing but good in terms of the strategy’s overall success."
"In future, we should cut the really big announcements down to size if it is not absolutely certain that they will actually be implemented."
". Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, I just want to make a brief comment on the Stability and Growth Pact."
"If I consider it as an economist – which is what I was trained to be – then there are many countries that make a success of things without stability rules; the USA is often quoted as an example."
"There are countries that strictly observe stability rules and achieve but little success, and the reverse also occurs."
"From an economic point of view, then, a variety of approaches are possible, but there are good reasons why we, having established ourselves as a community and now being desirous of creating a single market, should equip ourselves with a Stability and Growth Pact of this kind, the most important of these being the introduction of the euro."
"Despite the many prophecies of doom, originating not least from this House, we have ended up with a strong euro – it could even be described as too strong, and that is why now is very definitely the time to rearrange matters; not, though, by abandoning the Stability and Growth Pact, but by taking into account economic conditions in the individual countries."
"What is needed is not special arrangements for Germany, but the recognition that special economic conditions can occur in any of our Member States."
"Once such a change is made, it does of course follow that every country – whether Germany or some other – must abide by the rules."
"Some account should also be taken of the fact that Germany is still the European Union’s main paymaster."
"With this in mind, I regard the Luxembourg Presidency’s proposals as very, very worthwhile, and I hope that they will prove to be a successful solution."
"I hope that the Commission and its President will be able to help us on our way to a real solution."
"Second only to that solution and to the boosting of the Lisbon process, we need two things: closer coordination of general growth and economic policy between the individual countries, and a solution to the financial perspectives, if at all possible before Luxembourg vacates the presidency."
"I know that a heavy burden rests upon your shoulders – not, perhaps, broad ones in terms of your country – but I do hope you will be able to sort this out."
"In any case – and I am speaking on my group’s behalf when I say this – we wish the Luxembourg Presidency much success."
"It has brought with it all that is needed to resolve this issue with, not least, a new and rational reform of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Mr President, with the Lisbon strategy and the Stability and Growth Pact, the prime focus of the forthcoming spring meeting of the European Council will be issues of economic policy."
"With unemployment at 9% in Europe and a growth forecast of only 1.6% in the euro zone, it is perfectly clear that the time for talking is over and we need to take fundamental action in order to relaunch growth and employment."
"We need shared budgetary discipline."
"We must reaffirm that clearly so that there can be no doubt in anyone’s mind."
"It is the responsibility of each Member State to control public expenditure, to act to reduce their deficit and to stabilise or even cut the debt burden."
"Failing this, future generations will bear the cost, and the more the Member States try to circumvent the rules which they themselves introduced, the more they will destabilise the system as a whole."
"If we have rules, we obviously need to ensure they are adhered to."
"If not, they serve no purpose."
"It is only when we have agreed on these basic, common-sense principles that we can open the debate on possible changes in the pact."
"Moreover, these changes must take account of the nature of economic cycles and the necessary distinction between an operating deficit and an investment deficit."
"There is another and even more important question facing us: can we live in the longer term with common budgetary discipline while at the same time operating different economic policies?"
"In my view, the answer is no."
"I believe we must urgently decide to coordinate our economic policies, failing which we shall never be able to generate our own growth."
"We are fortunate in having a President of the European Council who is simultaneously the Eurogroup President."
"Let us, therefore, take advantage of it."
"The time is now ripe – it is now or never – to introduce economic governance which is so lacking in Europe and to take initiatives which will finally get things moving."
"We propose that the major investment for the future should be made on a European scale."
"I am thinking, for instance, of defence, research or major infrastructure investment."
"We are lagging far behind in this area and I think the time has come to change that – or at least to make an attempt to do so."
"There you have it, ladies and gentlemen. Of course we will need ambition, determination and courage, but I am sure of one thing: none of us acting alone and in isolation can achieve it."
"If we want to create growth and employment, if we want to continue to implement an innovative social model, the only solution is to do more at European level."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, Madam Vice-President, on the issue of the Stability and Growth Pact, our group unequivocally backs the efforts of the Luxembourg Presidency and, in particular, supports the idea of a list of relevant factors, as indicated by Mr Juncker."
"I believe we need to make progress towards greater differentiation of the national economies, particularly by reference to their debt levels and the demands placed on them."
"Therefore, we agree on an explicit list of factors which – to borrow Mr Prodi’s expression – would render a political and more intelligent assessment of the Stability Pact possible."
"Having said that, reform of the pact still falls short of a European coordination of budgetary policy – Mrs de Sarnez just referred to this."
"On this point, I would say to the Council that the statement I read after the ECOFIN Council, in particular to the effect that an agreement reached within the euro zone by the 12 Member States would not necessarily be ratified by all members of the Council, namely by all 25 Member States, constitutes, in my view, an extremely worrying signal from a political standpoint."
"From this point of view, the triangle to which Mr Juncker referred at the start of the Luxembourg Presidency when discussing the Lisbon strategy, the Stability Pact and the financial perspective, makes a lot of sense."
"I believe that interpretation of the Stability Pact should echo the readiness of Member States to make extra budgetary efforts in order to obtain a financial perspective and a European Union budget fit for purpose and able to deliver the objectives we should like it to achieve."
"From this point of view, the political timing is not particularly good, since we are asking the spring meeting of the European Council to reach agreement on Lisbon and on the Stability Pact, while possibly postponing the debate on the financial perspective until June."
"However, I believe that this danger of a rift between the new Member States, in particular, and the old Member States is a political risk which should not be underestimated in this whole debate."
"Finally, with regard to sustainable development, I am quite surprised by, let us call it, the superficiality of the proposition."
"The European Commission has issued a report on the Community strategy for sustainable development which therefore concerns the Union’s sectoral policies."
"This report is highly critical."
"It is honest enough to be extremely critical."
"Therefore, if the major political impetus which Mr Barroso is expecting and which we, too, are hoping for from the Council consists merely of saying, ‘we plan to draw up a European chart of indicators’ – we would say: is that all?"
"All you need to do is to look at the European Environment Agency’s reports and you will have your indicators."
"We are expecting a great deal more; we are expecting much more restrictive targets to be set in the areas of transport policy, energy policy and the Kyoto commitments."
"It is no longer enough to keep going back to the question of the indicators saying, in the morning, ‘we want fewer indicators’’, and in the afternoon, ‘we want more’."
"What exactly do we want?"
"We want successful policies and we want the Commission and Council to abide seriously by the Gothenburg commitments."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I feel, quite frankly, that the debate in this Chamber is rather paradoxical, since we are taking a fragmented approach to issues such as the Lisbon Strategy, the Financial Perspectives, the forthcoming European Council and the possible ways to reform the Stability and Growth Pact. The last, by the way, is an issue on which everyone except Parliament is taking action."
"I believe, instead, that these aspects should all be dealt with together."
"Indeed, social cohesion and growth in the number and quality of jobs have certainly not been facilitated by policies focusing on competitiveness, nor by monetarist policies. These have even been enshrined in the new Constitutional Treaty, the only case in history where a constitution includes a monetary treaty."
"We are confronted by the paradox of a Europe with a very strong currency but a weak economy in a deepening crisis and a society in great difficulty."
"There is a growing number of factors that are likely to make the situation even worse, such as those implicit in the Bolkestein directive, in the European budget cuts and in the false flexibility of the Stability Pact, which some would like to see used only to downgrade pensions."
"That has all led to a Europe of social fragmentation, relocations and the inevitable decline in its social and cultural model."
"We have to set off along a new path, one that breaks with economics and monetarism, is based on an upward harmonisation of rights and wage levels and provides new impetus for quality development."
"To achieve that, it is necessary on the left to break out of the Stability Pact straitjacket so as to invest within individual countries – but also directly as the European Union – in research, innovation and whatever else is needed to promote development."
"What we need, therefore, is a different Europe, a social Europe, the kind of Europe that we shall be demanding at the European demonstration in Brussels on 19 March."
"– Mr President, I would like to thank the Commission for agreeing to complete openness concerning 3 000 working groups."
"For the first time, we can now see the list of the groups."
"It can be found on the Commission’s website or, even easier, can be downloaded from my website at bonde.com."
"Mrs Wallström, the Vice-President of the Commission, yesterday agreed that we can also have the names of the participants."
"Thank you. Now, we shall soon see whether those advising the Commission on smoking are from the tobacco industry or from groups working to combat cancer."
"I would also like to thank the Commission for agreeing that in future we can find out about all the contributions from the Commission to the Council of Ministers and its working groups."
"Eighty-five per cent of all legislation is finally completed in 300 working groups and in Coreper."
"Until now, we have been excluded from the majority of this legislation."
"Now, we have been promised the greatest reform in openness to date."
"I am as happy as a little boy on Christmas Day, because I have been working towards such openness for many years."
"Thank you. It is almost too good to be true."
"Now it is your turn over in the Council."
"My dear Council of Ministers, can the Luxembourg Presidency not ask that the 300 working groups dealing with legislation be laid open to Parliament?"
"It is humiliating that elected representatives must always beg for the documents in a corridor or from a lobbyist or from a student at one of the permanent representations, or from the ambassador or from the actual minister."
"When we sit on the committees and deal with the draft legislation, officially we have only the original draft from the Commission, while the Council’s working group is sitting looking at edition 17 – which we cannot legally obtain."
"Officials and trainees sit behind us at the committee meetings with the latest edition of the draft legislation, but what about the members of the committee themselves?"
"We have the electorate’s vote, but we lack the confidence of the Council of Ministers."
"Now we will get the Commission’s new drafts while the legislation is being discussed."
"When will we have the opportunity to thank you in the Council for what would be the most natural thing of all?"
"In democracies, those exercising power are responsible to the elected representatives; in democracies, there is nobody above or equal to the electorate and their directly elected representatives."
"Thank you, Mr President, especially if the Council will give us a little more to say thank you for."
". I wish to thank the President-in-Office and the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, for their presentations."
"This Parliament has often taken a very narrow viewpoint with regard to the future development of the European economy and the European social model, whereas experience should have taught us that each action we take has an immediate effect on other areas."
"Therefore, we can no longer speak of exclusively having a social model that works according to the old ideology of high taxation and high social protection."
"Likewise, there cannot be a simple free-market area, where everyone can do whatever they wish, without any restrictions."
"We need rules and regulations to ensure that Europe works properly not only for the consumer or business but, most importantly of all, for the citizens we govern."
"That is why the Stability and Growth Pact is a good thing, in spite of the faults and mistakes in its operation that have recently been highlighted."
"The fact that it remains in place is a good thing, as also that it can be altered and changed to adapt to changing circumstances."
"However, I would warn against making widespread changes or reducing the powers contained within the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Let us not forget that the Growth Pact itself cannot be seen in isolation: it must also be seen in coordination with the broad economic policy guidelines that are laid down."
"Action has been taken in the past against one government – the Irish Government – because of its so-called failure to meet certain criteria under the broad economic policy guidelines."
"The mistake was not that the Pact was there, but that it was not enforced against other countries that continue to breach those guidelines and fail to observe the overall policies on the proper management and operation of economies and fiscal policies."
"Finally, the Lisbon Strategy, which we voted on today, is a strategy for good governance, good economic growth and, above all, employment creation, which is the best tool for tackling poverty, social disadvantage and isolation."
"It will ensure that we in Europe can give the very highest standard of jobs, training and, most importantly of all, social protection to all our citizens."
"Mr President, I should like to draw the Council’s attention to the fact that the brutal action taken on the part of the Turkish police against demonstrators a few days ago has resulted in quite justified protests across Europe and even – or should I say at long last – in it being asked somewhat more overtly whether a country such as Turkey could be a Member or candidate country of the European Union at all."
"This is, in itself, somewhat odd, of course, because we have known for some time that Turkey takes a rather casual approach to human rights and has for many years pursued a real policy of genocide against ethnic minorities and non-Islamic faith communities."
"I think that the incidents of a few days ago do indeed give the Council good cause to revisit the whole Turkey issue."
"There are sufficient fundamental reasons for doing so."
"Mr Vanhecke, I would ask you to keep to the subject of our debate."
"Mr President, I believe myself to be entitled, as a Member of this House, to draw the Council’s attention to whatever subject I like and it is not for the President to concern himself with the content of Members’ interventions."
"I do indeed think that there are sufficient fundamental reasons for putting this issue on the agenda."
"I would like to repeat that Turkey is not a European country politically, culturally, economically or historically speaking, and I have not even mentioned the problem of Islam, although no one would deny that the possible enlargement to include a country of 70 to 100 million Islamists threatens to fundamentally change the nature of our society."
"I would urge the Council to revisit the Turkey issue as a matter of urgency, and also for internal and democratic reasons."
"I consider the way in which in the past few months, in all European countries, debate on Turkey’s accession has been made impossible and the way in which the verdict of the voters and citizens on this subject has been avoided, to be totalitarian and undemocratic."
"Our citizens are intelligent enough to decide for themselves on Turkey’s membership in a referendum."
"Anyone who denies them and us the right – and indeed, anyone who denies us in this House the right, let me say now – to address the Council at any time about this fundamental problem, does the European Union a disservice and brings us a step closer to a totalitarian European regime, something that we cannot tolerate under any circumstances."
"It is the Council’s duty to discuss this as a matter of high priority."
"I regret to say that despite my request, Mr Vanhecke, what you said did not relate to the subject of our debate."
"I should nevertheless like to thank you for your intervention."
"– Mr President, I agree with the Commission President's conclusions."
"I believe that Europe is currently standing at a crossroads."
"Europe could enter a crisis period if the Constitutional Treaty is not ratified either now or in a few years' time, that is, if we are unable to define Europe in a way that affirms our political and economic identity to the outside world."
"We need to be defining Europe now in line with the mandate of the current Commission and of this House."
"To do that, in economic terms – which is what we are considering today – macro-economic stability is essential."
"The other minimum requirement is speeding up the Lisbon reform process in order to increase employment and productivity, and therefore competitiveness, which will narrow the gap between us and the United States and enable us to stand up to competition from emerging countries."
"We discussed the Lisbon reforms this morning, so I am going to return to the importance of the Stability Pact."
"I feel that we need to be very honest with one another on this matter."
"We are going to reform the Stability Pact not because its internal logic has failed, nor the ideas underpinning it, but rather for the simple reason that too many countries have failed to comply with its terms, notably the larger countries."
"Since it is the larger Member States who are forcing us to revise the Pact, we need to know what they are willing to do – which is what we have just heard."
"They are willing to accept reform of the preventative features of the Pact and to make an effort in the good times, simply because they know that no world power can force them to comply with the rules."
"In terms of prevention, they want to slacken and break the rules to the point where – as one German Social Democrat has said – there are no absolute rules."
"There are two options – and only two – in this state of affairs: either we move towards economic governance, economic coordination, and an independent judge incapable of imposing any sanctions, or we maintain the existing automatic procedures."
"We have not wanted to move ahead with economic coordination."
"The Intergovernmental Conference reversed all the tentative progress made by the Convention on the subject of coordination, leaving us in exactly the same position as before."
"Nor do we want to continue with the automatic processes."
"All that will happen in this Council and in future Councils is that we will move backwards."
"The question is how far will we backtrack, and at what pace?"
"The exemptions to the rules we set ourselves amount to weakening, to giving ground on the Stability Pact."
"How much you are willing to concede will determine our future credibility, our economic strength, and will affect whether or not we avoid the economic crisis I anticipate in the coming years."
"Mr President, the forthcoming summit is doubly interesting from the point of view of sustainable development."
"On the agenda are the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy and the annual audit of the sustainable development programme."
"These two go together."
"Sustainable growth and competitiveness cannot be achieved without the highest possible levels of environmental and social protection."
"The mid-term review of the sustainable development programme undertaken this year must see the creation of an ambitious strategy that reaches far into the future."
"It should be directly linked to the Lisbon strategy and it should also serve to guide different policy areas within the European Union."
"The spirit of Cardiff needs to be revived and we should examine the sustainability of the European Union’s various policies more closely, confronting those factors that are leading in the direction of unsustainable development."
"Special attention needs to be paid to energy production, transport, land use and agriculture."
"New, more ambitious steps have to be taken to prevent climate change."
"We must look ahead to the time after the Kyoto Protocol and achieve targets for the year 2020 that we can keep to and monitor."
"We also have to put a price tag on sustainable development."
"We have to estimate how much doing absolutely nothing will cost."
"Now of course all attention is focused on what environmental protection measures will cost."
"The European Union must continue to be the organisation that shows the way globally in environmental policy."
"Ambitious legislation linked to the right means of financial control is also a good combination for creating demand for the new environmental technology."
"Mr President, in the referendum on the EU Constitution which was held in the Spanish state, the Basques and Catalans clearly confirmed that we wish to be fully involved in Europe."
"Within the Hispanic map, the percentage of 'no' votes cast in Euskadi and Catalunya was three times as high as in Spain."
"Europe must take account of this political reality, especially if the goal is to build a closer and stronger Europe that counts for all the people of Europe."
"It would be very undemocratic to neglect the different realities that exist in Europe's stateless nations."
"We cannot be so hypocritical as to claim plurality in Europe and deny it internally."
"At a time when several Spanish MEPs have been complaining of alleged discrimination against the Castilian language, in the same period, Manuel Marín, the President of the Spanish Parliament, forbade a Catalan MP from speaking a few words of Catalan in his introductory remarks."
"Different criteria cannot be applied to equivalent situations."
"One cannot claim rights, justice or different standards of morality when in Europe and, on the other hand, insist on a pragmatic approach based on financial practicality when in Spain or Italy."
"If we are truly committed to multilingualism, if we want the Castilian language to be used at all committee meetings, press conferences, etc, we must first be honest and safeguard everyone's linguistic rights, including those of the Catalans and Basques as well as, for example, the Welsh and Irish."
"– Mr President, as the President-in-Office of the Council said a short time ago, the spring European Council will focus mainly on the Stability and Growth Pact and the Lisbon strategy, a strategy which is considered to have failed and to need review."
"It needs review because the number of unemployed in Europe today has now reached 20 million, with 70 million people at risk of poverty, wages paid to women are, on average, 16% lower than wages paid to men and real convergence has not therefore been achieved."
"Unfortunately, Lisbon puts social policies in second place."
"With the changes proposed to the Stability Pact and to the Lisbon strategy itself, the strategy cannot be made into a pro-grass roots strategy."
"It is a paradox and it is absurd for us to talk about creating the most productive economy on the planet, on the one hand, and to want reductions in budgets and, hence, less cohesion, on the other."
"Only with a series of radical measures, which also include increased resources for social growth, can the Lisbon strategy become a more pro-grass roots strategy."
"Mr President, before I move on to the Stability and Growth Pact, I would like to make a comment or two about the financial situation in general."
"I am a little disappointed to see that Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission, seems to have disappeared, because he is going to hear a comment from a representative of the United Kingdom, which is the second biggest contributor to European Union funds."
"To date, we have contributed some GBP 180 billion."
"We have received back around GBP 105 billion by way of subsidies of one form or another. Well, we believe that very soon there is to be a general election in the United Kingdom, and I think the voters are going to want to know what has happened to that GBP 75 billion deficit in our contributions."
"Is there going to be an answer from our current Prime Minister or Chancellor of the Exchequer?"
"Is there going to be an answer from this House?"
"When we remind them that the European Court of Auditors has, for the tenth year running, refused to sign the books because billions of pounds have gone missing, they might well put two and two together as regards what has happened to our 75 billion."
"Have we got a Stability and Growth Pact or not?"
"The Prime Minister of Luxembourg, Mr Jean-Claude Juncker, recently said to reporters in Brussels: ‘I am beginning to seriously consider the option of not changing the Pact at all’."
"He added: ‘We are not excluding the scenario of leaving the Pact as it is; that is now a distinct possibility."
"I have no goal of replacing a Pact that does not work well with one that seems to function but goes wrong later’."
"Previously he had said that the Pact was dead."
"So what about this Stability and Growth Pact?"
"Is it not ludicrous that countries that run up a deficit of over 3% are then fined enormous sums of money, making their position worse?"
"Of course the Stability Pact is wrong."
"It is useless!"
"Dump it!"
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the forthcoming European Council is going to deal with crucial reforms for the future of the European Union, including reform of the Stability Pact."
"This reform is unfortunately enveloped in mystery."
"In fact, we go from general news about a possible nineteen points to make the Pact more flexible to the possibility of leaving the Pact unchanged."
"In that respect, all that remains is regret at the opportunity that Parliament has wasted through being unwilling for this Chamber to directly enter the debate on how to reform the Pact."
"The President of Parliament and also the main political groups are to blame for that."
"It seems that we are reaching a possible compromise, as usual, characterised by tactical manoeuvring and political balancing acts."
"That is not what Europe needs right now."
"Instead, it needs bolder and more pragmatic approaches to the key objectives for revitalising the economy, that is to say investment in research, innovation, competitiveness, infrastructure and structural reform."
"That is also why I stress that I am baffled at the refusal by the Commission and the Luxembourg Presidency to consider applying the so-called golden rule, which could have done a great deal to boost our economic growth."
"We owe it above all to the younger generation to make a practical commitment to the future of our economy."
"In that respect, we need a genuine Pact for young people."
"The young need to be able to look forward to a future of stability, security and social cohesion, thanks to measures helping them to enter the workforce and to have access to credit, as well as measures directed towards the right to a home and a family."
"To conclude, I believe that the European Union needs to make a strong commitment to guarantee effective opportunities for Europe’s younger generations."
"That is what we are calling for, and that is what young people above all are expecting."
"Mr President, right now, it is not difficult to feel some sympathy with the Commission and the Council as they try to find a sensible solution to the problem of the Stability Pact."
"They have become victims of the EU’s self-chastisement and self-imposed captivity."
"This Stability Pact was brought into being for reasons that were very transparent, particularly in the case of Germany, which later turned out to be the country that had the greatest problems with it."
"I think one of the lessons we ought to learn for the future is that rushing these things is not the way to get them done, for the damage is now greater than the former short-term benefit."
"The whole thing is a virtual ruin and has precipitated another crisis of confidence in Europe."
"For the sake of the young and of all those who still, with a certain euphoria, believe in Europe, I really do hope you will manage to cut this particular Gordian knot."
"It will be very difficult, but a lot of trust has been lost – and it was that trust that the Stability Pact was originally intended to build."
"So, quite seriously, I wish you every success at the forthcoming Council, and at it, may you succeed in getting this stumbling-block out of the European Union’s way."
"Mr President, the Spring Council will no doubt be dominated by the mid-term review of the Lisbon Agenda."
"This is a matter on which I have spoken on a number of occasions in recent weeks, and one that should be at the heart of the European agenda in the coming years."
"I simply wish to emphasise the support of the European Democrats for strong action to reinvigorate that Agenda."
"We want to see a stronger commitment by national governments to real and enduring economic reform."
"The President of the Commission has our full support for an enterprising Europe, committed to growth and prosperity."
"However, I also want to make it clear that we are concerned about some recent developments and emphasise the need for President Barroso not to weaken his stance on EU market liberalisation by in any way undermining the Services Directive, which is a fundamental part of the Lisbon Agenda that he himself redefined only recently."
"There is also the Working Time Directive: it seems to me extraordinary that there are still politicians and governments who consider that a level playing field is one in which all EU Member States are equally uncompetitive."
"It is fundamental to our vision of Europe that employers and workers should, as far as possible, decide on their own terms and conditions and working hours, and not have governments or the EU decide for them."
"It goes against the whole spirit of economic liberalisation and flexibility that so many of us believe in."
"The Council will be considering other matters too, including the international situation."
"I wish to comment on one aspect of this: the reinvigoration of the transatlantic alliance."
"The visit of the President of the United States to Europe last month heralded a new chapter in the world's most important geopolitical partnership."
"There is a real prospect now of a fresh start to that relationship, which is crucial for world security."
"Some recent comments, including those by the German Chancellor, are of great importance and need to be taken seriously."
"His implication that NATO was no longer the pre-eminent vehicle for military defence is an issue which I feel needs to be further examined and about which I am concerned."
"If Europe wants to be a serious partner alongside the United States in the fight against terrorism and the spread of WMD, then it must work more closely with our American friends."
"Mr President, I too should like to say something about the Stability and Growth Pact, because it is regrettable that the ECOFIN Council failed to reach agreement on it earlier this week."
"I hope, and very much trust, that Mr Juncker, who will attend both this extra ECOFIN meeting and the summit, will be able to carry on his work."
"Indeed, it is with sorrow that I look upon the Pact’s reform being turned into a ."
"I fear that it will be reduced to common horse trading between Member States, particularly the large ones, something we have experienced all too often in the past."
"It is time our Heads of State or Government displayed real vision and leadership."
"My group has indicated many times that it is in favour of the Pact being reformed, which would result in growth, without putting the euro’s stability at risk, and so I think it would be useful if a quality assessment were to be made of Member State budget spending."
"This was borne out this morning during the discussion of the Lisbon strategy."
"In Europe, there is too little investment in the education and research that will enable it to become the competitive knowledge economy we desperately aspire to be."
"The Pact should not obstruct us in those endeavours."
"In industry, businesses would be out of the running if they failed to invest in the future."
"I should, however, add that in industry, investments are not written off over one year."
"So why do we do this in the Pact?"
"What is stopping us from applying a longer depreciation period to the Lisbon investments too?"
"This would involve a change to the substance, which would create space without putting discipline at risk."
"Another change that must be made is for us to start thinking more along European lines."
"It is wholly acceptable that government influence should impact on the economy, provided that it is done at European, rather than national, level."
"It seems that the leaders at the summit predominantly want to create a catalogue of excuses which will help them escape discipline and which they can use for all possible kinds of policy."
"My group favours a strong role for the Commission and considers that the rules of the game and the assessments should be drafted jointly, from a European perspective."
"– Mr President, I should like to ask the Council what happened to Gothenburg and what now remains of Gothenburg, because in my view the answer is: very little."
"If the Council had stuck to its commitments, it would not be looking, as you did this morning and again this evening, for a new impetus to dispel Euro-pessimism, because Gothenburg showed the way and gave new hope by proposing that each year, in spring, a special summit should be held to track the progress made on sustainable development;"
"Mrs Wallström knows what I am referring to."
"What have you done with the enthusiasm of Gothenburg to face up to the new threats and challenges worrying our fellow Europeans?"
"What are your innovative, compelling and concrete plans to combat climate change and to counter the decline in biodiversity?"
"In four years, what progress has been achieved and where are we with social harmonisation?"
"Where are we with European public services?"
"In my view, you have distorted the objectives of the spring summits which were supposed to provide a response to all those questions and bring about a refocusing of policy."
"And now you are asking for a charter on the new criteria!"
"Mr President, these criteria exist, and you have cast them aside, perhaps because they were too limiting, too troublesome."
"What about the biodiversity criterion, for instance: has the Commission kicked it into the long grass?"
"There is no need, Mr President, to go on reinventing the wheel day after day."
"Get back to the spirit of Gothenburg; restore this innovative project to its place at the heart of the spring summits, an innovative project long-awaited by our fellow citizens and which will pull Europe out of its state of stagnation."
"– Mr President, the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy does not set new objectives; it repositions so that it can become more competitive with the United States."
"It calls for closer cooperation and coordination between governments and for them to be monitored, in order to overcome delays caused by their opposition."
"Consequently, new storms against grass-roots incomes and other grass-roots achievements are brewing at the spring Council."
"This is guaranteed by the final outcome of the first five years' application of the Lisbon strategy, with increased poverty, unemployment, inequality, uncertainty for workers and greater wealth for the oligarchy."
"The leaders of the Member States will decide to proceed more aggressively and at a faster pace in making industrial relations more flexible, in cutting workers' incomes and grass-roots rights, with a new insurance system, with full liberalisation of the market and with across-the-board privatisations."
"At the same time, they will take decisions which will speed up the political and military presence of the European Union in more countries and they will seal the joint front of the United States and the European Union in the war against the peoples."
"These are measures which reduce social and employment rights in order to increase the profitability of European capital."
"This is the mediaeval working environment which they are preparing, this is the policy of the European Union and its parties."
"They are calling on the workers to make sacrifices in order to make their lives worse."
"However, there are also sacrifices with the prospect of a better life, by which I mean the organised fight against the barbarity and exploitation of the European Union and the governments."
"– Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, as has already been said, the forthcoming Spring European Council has two main topics: the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact and the review of the Lisbon Strategy."
"Looking beyond the current compromises, inevitable hypocrisies and tiresome tactical manoeuvring between those who want rigour and those who want flexibility, between grasshoppers and ants, the essence of the debate on the Stability and Growth Pact still remains the golden rule, or how to introduce flexibility into the budget rules honourably, without resorting to opportunistic or artful means."
"The compromise that is emerging appears to be useful, but it will not solve everything."
"A golden rule applied will do little for development, while it is liable to lose us our credibility and reputation."
"A clear strategy of deficit spending on objectives at a European level would be more useful, but we are probably not yet mature enough to make that kind of choice."
"The same may be said for the review of the Lisbon Strategy."
"Redefining the objectives will be of little use if the toolkit still consists of subsidiarity, open coordination, peer pressure and moral persuasion, particularly during a slump."
"What is needed are direct-action instruments, such as European action plans, but we are not yet mature enough for those either."
"I feel, therefore, that we need maturity in order to have more Europe, that is to say in order to be able to decide once and for all what kind of economic constitution we want for our Europe, over and above our selfish national interests."
"The challenges of globalisation really do not leave us much time any more."
"– Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the stalemate that has been created in recent days over the review of the Stability and Growth Pact shows that we have to learn how to manage flexibility."
"The long list of major exceptions prepared by the Luxembourg Presidency, which would allow the deficit reference figure to be exceeded on a temporary basis, has obviously opened up a Pandora’s box of national requests."
"If we continue like this, nothing will be achieved and we will resign ourselves to keeping the Pact as it is, as something more or less nonsensical."
"Instead, we need to follow the obvious path of having a single important exception, allowing the possibility of derogation only for precise, circumscribed European initiatives in the areas of training, research and major physical and intangible infrastructure networks."
"We therefore need to tie any flexibility in the Pact to real European added value through investment."
"The experience of recent days also teaches us that the Union’s economic policies need to be properly coordinated."
"I have the impression, however, that the Member States’ governments are adopting a strategy of slowly and gently weakening the Commission’s role."
"We shall probably also be able to see this during the debate on the Financial Perspectives in June, when it is not difficult to foresee a fresh attack on the credibility of the Community aspect of the European Union."
"Mr President, I wish the European Council every success in its review of the Lisbon Strategy."
"A decisive effort is needed to boost competitiveness not only through good programmes but also in real economic activities, because sustainable development and more jobs can result only from more growth."
"We also need to enhance the credibility of this Union for entrepreneurs as well as citizens at large."
"Not only the governments but also these people need to be motivated to contribute actively to achieving the Lisbon goals."
"One solution lies in opening up the EU market in services."
"If we really intend to enhance efficiency and motivation, then we must open up without further delay."
"This could prove to be one of the most important and productive reforms of this organisation."
"Conversely, watering down the Services Directive could deliver a devastating blow to the principles of equality and solidarity."
"It was said in this Chamber today that free movement of goods and capital without free movement of services is nonsense."
"In this context, the country-of-origin principle must be seen as an inseparable part of the directive."
"I really hope that the new Commission will not weaken its stand on EU market liberalisation."
"Instead of waging battles to further conserve the present unequal status quo, we should concentrate on the benefits that free competition would bring to all of us, both old and new Member States, and benefits there clearly are!"
"I hope that the European Council will show enough political will to make our citizens believe that Member States are serious about creating the conditions for dynamic growth."
"This will also be a test for the EU’s solidarity."
"I would like to contribute to this debate as a Member representing a newly acceded country, and for whom the question of a social Europe is especially important."
"We all of us know how great the difference in the standard of living is between the newly acceded and the older Member States."
"We also know that this difference is unacceptable, and we must strive to eliminate it."
"Among other things, the Lisbon Strategy was one of the most important guideline documents for us at the time of accession."
"It was hugely attractive that we could be members of a Europe which could envisage as a target increasing economic competitiveness, job creation and at the same time the spreading of the values of a social Europe across the whole of Europe."
"That set of views which sets growing economic competitiveness as a priority yet sees social dimensions as less important is not acceptable to the newly acceded Member States, where more than a third of the population lives in poverty."
"It is true that the best way to fight poverty is to increase economic competitiveness and job creation, but this must be tightly linked to social cohesion, education, research and development, and protection of the environment."
"Social questions belong among the responsibilities of Member States, but appropriate coordination among institutions at Union level is vital."
"We cannot accept that we live in brutal market economies we must strive to bring about a socially sensitive Europe."
"It is true that the European Council will focus on the Lisbon Strategy and on the Stability Pact."
"Let us admit, though, that in the background of this discussion, there will also be the question related to the financial perspectives that is linked to Lisbon and the Stability Pact – because in the end it is the financial means that the European Union will have for the coming years, which will determine whether and to what degree, we will be able to put into practice the vision of Europe to which Mr Barroso referred."
"This is where we have to remember that the new Member States still have a low standard of living when compared to the European average and, despite this, are still expected to implement the reforms required by the Lisbon strategy as well as by the Stability Pact."
"We also have to keep in mind that the new countries are experiencing a certain degree of tiredness, a certain fatigue, from the continuous reform process."
"It is enough to say that they have been undergoing a reform process for a number of years – first to prepare to join the European Union and, now that they have joined, they are facing more reforms, this time having more of a budgetary and fiscal nature to prepare for the introduction of the Euro."
"As if this were not enough, we now have the reforms needed by the reform strategy, which amounts to a non-stop reform process."
"This does not mean that the reform process should be stopped."
"Far be it from this case."
"It means, however, that there is a need for the new countries to feel that they are not being left alone on this road; to the contrary, they should feel that there is somebody helping them."
"This is exactly what the cohesion policy of the European Union could do, and this is why the financial resources that the European Union will have in the coming years will determine whether we really want the new Member States to be really integrated; if we really do want them to adopt the Euro and expand their economic development and create jobs as the Lisbon Strategy is telling us to do."
"As Mr Barroso himself said, you cannot have more Europe with less money."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, any German in this House will find it particularly difficult to talk about the forthcoming Council and the Stability and Growth Pact, for you know how hard the Germans found it to abandon the Deutschmark."
"The only way in which the German public could be persuaded to part with the Deutschmark was with the explicit promise that there would be a Stability and Growth Pact that would draw on the tradition of the Deutschmark and maintain the currency’s long-term stability."
"Of course, it is particularly problematic when, out of all the Member States, it is the larger ones, such as Germany and France, who, having compelled the smaller countries – including those in southern Europe – to accept this Pact, themselves breach it, breaking its rules and even altering it when they get into difficulties."
"For that reason, I can only encourage the Luxembourg presidency to stick to its guns at the summit, and urge all the other members of the Council to do likewise."
"Altering the Pact is certainly worth thinking about; here in this House, we have heard important arguments as to why it can be applied in different ways at certain stages."
"The worst option, though, is to alter the Pact precisely when one has oneself broken the rules and got away scot-free, and so the sixteen-point list that Mr Juncker has put forward is the right way to go about reforming it."
"Our position on this issue is that the Commission’s hand must be strengthened, and it must continue to be a player."
"It cannot be for the Member States to decide when and where this or that special rule should apply where the Stability Pact is concerned."
"What the European Council should bear in mind, when coming to its conclusions on 22 and 23 March, is that the Commission must be put in a stronger position, and that there are several changes we can talk about."
"As this Council is meeting in a special international situation, let me add the final comment that, in the Middle East, among our Mediterranean neighbours, a lot of things are in a state of flux."
"There too, it is important that we should be alongside the democrats and supporting human rights."
"For that reason, I would like to see this Council – in contrast to what we in this House have heard from it so far – send, by the way it votes, a clear message concerning the activities of terrorists, of Hezbollah, and everything associated with them."
"Mr President, I believe that the debate on the Stability and Growth Pact has shown that there is a genuine need for action."
"I was struck, in particular, by the comments of the last speaker, who gave us an encouraging message."
"It would be extremely serious if the European Union, on an issue like the Stability and Growth Pact, should see divisions, for instance, between old and new members."
"I view that as something very dangerous."
"We must approach reform of the Stability Pact in a spirit which is also one of solidarity."
"Any division would, in my view, be extremely harmful and dangerous."
"I should also like to return to an idea which was mentioned, in particular, by the last speaker, namely the importance of the institutional aspect."
"We must not weaken the Commission or the Commission's role in managing the Stability Pact, and there is no question as far as the Presidency is concerned of somehow withdrawing the Commission from its role in the area of budgetary surveillance."
"Thus, this aspect appears particularly important."
"The Presidency’s proposals, on which agreement has still to be reached, clearly tend to introduce greater flexibility, because in some quarters greater flexibility is required."
"However, at the same time, they aim to create a more precise framework specifically to enable the deficit to be assessed."
"One deficit is not the same as another."
"I believe we are all sufficiently familiar with economic rules and laws to know that no two deficits are necessarily identical in nature. A deficit caused by consumer spending should not be considered as being identical to one resulting from productive investment, from investment in the future."
"I therefore believe that this is the framework which the Presidency would like to create, to enable a more precise assessment to be made, avoiding any risk of arbitrariness."
"Next, I believe the pact has to be more closely related to economic cycles, and that it should still be possible to modify any instrument of economic policy in the light of experience."
"The rules adopted should be able to withstand the test of reality."
"When they are tested against reality, we may have to conclude, where necessary, that the rules are perhaps not always totally appropriate."
"Adapting the pact does not mean that deficits will be allowed to increase in the future."
"Those who think that deficits could be allowed to run unchecked without consequences are wrong, because deficits spiralling out of control would very quickly be punished by rising interest rates, which would have an impact on the investment urgently needed in Europe."
"We have also discussed the Lisbon strategy at length this morning – a strategy based, inter alia, on investment."
"It is clear, therefore, that we cannot recommend, on the one hand, a strategy based on investment and, on the other, encourage practices which would lead to an increase in interest rates, providing a disincentive to that very same investment."
"I believe that what we want is to have rules which are complied with – rules which can be respected by everyone; and so that everyone can comply with them, certain economic and political realities need to be taken into account."
"Without wishing to refer to any one country in particular, although one has already been mentioned, we have to acknowledge that some countries have experienced fairly exceptional events, and it would not be acceptable for such exceptional factors not to be taken into account, to some degree."
"Turning to sustainable development, I can say to Mrs Isler-Béguin that we have firmly insisted on maintaining the environmental dimension in the Lisbon strategy – not only on maintaining it but also genuinely incorporating it in all policies right across the board."
"Sustainable development cannot just be bolted on."
"It is something which must inspire the whole range of policies, and all policies must be assessed against a yardstick of sustainable development."
"Therefore, I do not believe that the Presidency is trying to neglect Gothenburg or consign it to oblivion."
"We continue to regard the strategy of sustainable development as fully valid."
"We recommend a horizontal approach to all environmental policy, as already set out in the Treaty and in the draft Constitution."
"On this point, we believe that a charter could be useful because it would give us a certain number of guiding principles to be followed when implementing the various policies."
"Finally, with regard to Kyoto, the Presidency is extremely keen to develop the Kyoto follow-up, and if there is sustainable development dimension, I believe it is based, in particular, on this aspect, namely preparing for the follow-up to Kyoto."
"On this point, the Presidency would like the European Union to take a lead, to be at the leading edge of progress and to have a key role in the defence of the planet."
". Mr President, I wish to thank all the Members of the European Parliament for their valuable contributions to this debate and also for their concrete ideas."
"This debate has shown the need for a coherent and consistent approach."
"We must ensure that the policies on the Stability Pact, the Lisbon Strategy and the Sustainable Development Strategy go hand in hand."
"During the debate this morning on the Lisbon Strategy you also made the point that the very concrete proposals we have been discussing for some time must uphold this balance."
"We shall do all this in the European way, which is to ensure that the creation of growth and jobs does not happen at the expense of over-using natural resources or of social policy."
"We must ensure that our policies include all three of those elements and that they reinforce one another."
"Climate change is one example, as it is not only an environmental issue but also one with enormous economic and social consequences, meaning that our policies have to be designed accordingly."
"This is exactly what incorporating the dimension of sustainable development is all about."
"It brings the future and the rest of the world into the frame as well."
"I wish to thank all those who have raised issues concerning the Lisbon Strategy and assure them that the Commission will take due note of all these issues."
"Mr Bonde was the only person who said he was very happy."
"I am glad he is happy, because his comments related to openness and transparency, which are things very close to my heart too."
"I would remind you that we have enhanced transparency as regards expert groups in the context of negotiations on the framework agreement."
"There is a new article on expert groups, and a list of the expert groups, their composition, activities, agendas and documents will be made available."
"That is important."
"Unfortunately, while some members of that Group put difficult questions, they have not stayed long enough to hear the responses as regards, for example, the Stability Pact, which is another important issue."
"We sometimes seem to lose sight of what has been achieved through the Stability Pact."
"Just a few years ago, the economic situation in Europe was totally different."
"The Pact has helped us to re-establish financial stability in Europe and enabled us to cooperate rather than to drive our currencies against each other."
"This is an important point which should not be forgotten."
"At the same time, if we are prepared to increase the flexibility of our rules, we also need to take steps to improve the quality of our cooperation at European Union level."
"The euro has brought our economies closer together, and national economic policies have become a common concern."
"If we want to maintain a meaningful fiscal surveillance system then we should also strengthen our institutional settings and provide greater incentives for cooperation and sound fiscal policies in Europe."
"The Commission will continue to work in a constructive way with the Luxembourg Presidency to ensure it is possible for the necessary changes to be made, to modernise and to harness the progress made to reinforce our other policies."
"Thank you for the contributions to the debate on the Stability Pact, which the Commission considers does not need re-writing, but to be interpreted in a way that guarantees its effectiveness and credibility."
"The Commission will look into the details of creating a charter for sustainable development, which must include very concrete policies and actions."
"Indeed, nothing of what has been said about the Stability Pact, the Lisbon Strategy or sustainable development will lead anywhere unless we start to take action."
"The overall challenge for us is one of implementation: to maintain consensus, ensure best use of governance and secure the support of European citizens for what we are doing."
"Those three issues must guide us in ensuring a successful summit meeting and, hopefully, successful implementation of what has been discussed today."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on health workers detained in Libya."
"Mr President, on the question of the health workers detained in Libya, the Council is extremely concerned for the safety of the five Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor condemned to death on 6 May 2004."
"Throughout recent years, the Council has been keeping a very close watch on their trial."
"It has intervened on a number of occasions with the Libyan authorities at the highest level, to ensure, in particular, that they were given a fair and equitable trial, especially in view of the fact that Professors Montanier and Collezzi in their final report on the HIV virus infection in Benghazi hospital had concluded that the five nurses and the doctor were innocent."
"In all its actions, the Council has always worked in close cooperation with the Bulgarian authorities and has had the support of other international partners."
"Bulgaria has thanked the European Union for what it has done."
"I met the Bulgarian Foreign Minister yesterday to discuss this matter with him once again."
"Bulgaria can count upon the Council’s help in the future in seeking a positive outcome to this matter."
"To this end, the Commission has joined with the Council so that the European Union can act in close coordination."
"Irrespective of the question of responsibility for the contamination in Benghazi hospital, it is clear that the issue has aroused strong feelings, particularly among the victims’ families, but also among the population generally."
"This is why the Council has expressed its profound sympathy with the people infected with the virus at Benghazi hospital. It has stated its readiness to show its solidarity by a humanitarian gesture on their behalf."
"An action plan drawn up by the Commission is accordingly being implemented at present."
"The Council now awaits a gesture from Libya."
"At its meeting on 11 October 2004, the Council invited Libya to make a positive response to the European Union’s proposed policy of engagement."
"In this context, the Council insisted that Libya should meet the European Union’s concerns, particularly on the question of the Bulgarian and Palestinian medical personnel."
"The Council feels that a review of the evidence will lead Libya to conclude that a rapid release of the five Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor would be in the best interests of justice."
"The Presidency assures the European Parliament that the Council will continue to treat this as a matter of high priority and will do everything in its power, in close coordination with the Bulgarian authorities, but respecting the rights of the authorities concerned, to reach the only positive outcome possible in this matter, namely the release of those sentenced."
". Mr President, thank you for this opportunity to discuss the very difficult issue of the health professionals detained in Libya, which indeed casts a shadow over international relations with that country."
"In order to fully address this issue, it is necessary to widen the scope of the discussion to also address the issue of the families in Benghazi affected by the mass HIV infection."
"The Commission considers these to be two separate dramas, but they have been linked by the verdict pronounced in May 2004 against the Bulgarian and Palestinian medical staff currently detained in Libya."
"I shall first address the issue of the Benghazi families."
"They are confronted with this infection which, either directly or indirectly, has affected many people."
"We have recently been reminded again of this tragedy by the recent deaths of some of the children and adults affected."
"The EU has a deep understanding of the serious consequences of the kind of large-scale accidental infection that affected Benghazi."
"Having faced similar tragedies in European countries, we have developed programmes to alleviate the effects of such tragedies and a system to prevent similar outbreaks from reoccurring."
"We can use this extensive experience to help the Libyan authorities deal with this situation and contribute to alleviating the plight of the stricken families in Benghazi."
"On numerous occasions the Commission and the EU have expressed their utmost compassion and solidarity as regards the situation in Benghazi."
"On the basis of a technical assessment carried out by the Commission in August 2004 and endorsed by the Council, the EU is now implementing an action plan aimed at addressing some of the issues faced by the Bengahzi families and also at enhancing capacities in the health sector in Libya."
"The implementation of this action plan is an act of solidarity aimed at expressing EU compassion by addressing specific identified needs in Libya."
"It is the responsibility of all of us to make sure that the action plan is implemented rapidly, completely and efficiently."
"In November 2004, the Commission organised an international meeting to launch the action plan and it is working closely with the Gaddafi Foundation to implement it."
"Success will depend on contributions by various public and private donors from the international community."
"I shall now address the issue of the five Bulgarian and Palestinian medical staff detained in Libya since 1999."
"The EU has repeatedly expressed serious reservations over the basis on which the trial was conducted, the treatment of the defendants, and delays in the process."
"It therefore came as a great disappointment and a source of concern when last May they were condemned to death on grounds that remain, in the Commission's view, unclear and unsatisfactory."
"Immediately after the verdict was pronounced, the EU and the Commission emphasised the importance we attach to a satisfactory and just outcome of the trial, and requested a reconsideration."
"An appeal process will soon be examined by the Libyan Supreme Court."
"The Commission has remained involved in working with the Libyan authorities to reach a satisfactory outcome to this issue."
"The EU made two formal approaches, at Prime Ministerial level, on 12 June and 27 June 2004."
"On 3 October 2004, a Commission official visited the Bulgarian and Palestinian medical staff to express its support for the detainees and to convey its concerns to the Libyan authorities."
"On 11 October 2004, the Council again expressed its grave concern over the plight of the medical workers and asked Libya to consider the release of the medical staff on the basis of a re-examination of the existing evidence."
"The Commission will continue to attach high priority to this dramatic issue and is constantly seeking ways to contribute to a positive outcome."
"It will remain in contact with the Libyan authorities, the Gaddafi Foundation and the Bulgarian authorities."
"I am convinced that all those concerned would like to turn the page on this tragedy as soon as possible."
"On the basis of the existing evidence, that is what must be done."
"At the same time, we will continue to focus on ways of alleviating the suffering of the Benghazi families and of helping the Libyan authorities build systems that will prevent a repetition of this contamination."
"The EU has decided to embark upon a policy of engagement with Libya and has already given considerable recognition to the significant steps taken by Libya to secure reintegration into the international community."
"Libya has been invited to move towards formal relations with the EU as a Mediterranean partner and as a close neighbour."
"In this context, the issue of the medical workers remains a serious problem and one which, as Libya understands very well, needs to be brought to an acceptable end."
". Mr President, I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Frattini for their very helpful statements."
"There is a double tragedy taking place in Libya at the moment."
"On the one hand there is the awful plight of hundreds of children in Benghazi infected by the HIV virus."
"We have the most enormous sympathy for them."
"I very much welcome the decision of the European Union's General Affairs and External Relations Council on 11 October 2004 to provide assistance to the Libyan health services."
"This includes medical equipment and help in establishing a reliable and safe blood bank."
"The other, quite separate tragedy is that since 1999 – for over five years now – Bulgarian medical workers have been imprisoned by the Libyan authorities on charges allegedly related to the HIV infection."
"This situation was dramatically worsened on 6 May last year when a Libyan court sentenced the Bulgarian nurses to death by firing squad."
"The most reputable international experts have testified that the problem of HIV infection was due to an in-hospital infection, which began over a year before the Bulgarians were hired by the Benghazi hospital."
"There are no good grounds for the imprisonment of the Bulgarian nurses."
"They should be released immediately."
"This is what the declaration of this Parliament, already signed by over 100 Members, is calling for."
"We ask the highest Libyan authorities to intervene in this matter, above all on grounds of natural justice and humanity."
"There is also a very practical reason why this should happen."
"Over the past year, important steps have been taken to improve the relationship between the European Union and Libya."
"This has come about because of a number of very sensible decisions taken by the Libyan authorities to dismantle the Libyan WMD programme and to compensate victims of terrorist attacks in which Libya had been implicated."
"The overall objective of EU engagement is Libya's full integration in the Barcelona process and subsequent progress towards an association agreement."
"This will not happen without further action on the part of Libya to meet our concerns."
"The most immediate of these concerns is the plight of the Bulgarian and Palestinian medical workers."
"We ask President Gaddafi to release them now."
", . Mr President, like other speakers, my heart goes out to the 400 children who have been infected by HIV and to the parents of the 40 children who have tragically died."
"I very much welcome the action programme that the Commissioner has outlined today."
"We should do everything possible to assist the Libyan people."
"However, the treatment by the Libyan authorities of the five Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian medical worker makes it very hard to take seriously Libya’s proclaimed desire to rehabilitate itself within the international community."
"We should remind ourselves that those people were in Libya to assist the Libyans; to provide better healthcare for Libyans."
"They have become scapegoats for the inadequacies of the Libyan health service."
"It is clear that the infection at the hospital, as indicated by Mr Van Orden, already existed."
"It was spread because of poor hygiene and because of the re-use of needles."
"A number of experts has testified that the nature of that contamination makes it almost inconceivable that it was spread deliberately."
"Rather than simply facing up to the facts, the Libyans have turned tragedy into a further tragedy and into a farce."
"First, they tried to blame the CIA and the Israeli intelligence services, saying it was a conspiracy to undermine Libya."
"Now, they have blamed the innocent Bulgarian nurses, at least some of whom were tortured before being tried; the trial was clearly unfair and not properly conducted."
"I very much support what the Council has said and would ask it to continue to pressurise the Libyan Government to come to its senses, to release these people and to become a normal part of the international community."
"– Mr President, I am pleased that we are having this debate, which was instigated by the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe."
"The situation of the Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor is truly a nightmare."
"For six long years, these people – who have devoted their lives to saving lives and caring for their fellow human beings – have languished in prison in Libya in loathsome conditions."
"The situation is Kafkaesque."
"The charges against them are unfounded, as researchers have shown."
"On 29 March, a court is finally to make a pronouncement on the death sentences against these six people, and this date is therefore incredibly critical."
"The EU must do everything in its power to secure the immediate release of those concerned."
"In just a few years’ time, Bulgaria will be a member of the EU. We therefore have a responsibility to these citizens."
"In our work on a gradual rapprochement between the EU and Libya within the context of the Barcelona Process, this case is a critical test of the direction that relations between us may take."
"If the death sentences are carried out, I believe that any future cooperation will be made impossible."
"At the same time, it is, of course, a terrible tragedy for the children who have been infected with AIDS and their families."
"The EU can do more."
"I am very pleased that the Commissioner supports the action plan and sees opportunities for the EU to support Libya in this way so that better care might be obtained in future for those infected with HIV."
"Mr President, this is an incredibly important issue."
"We expect the Council and the Commission to give it priority and to follow events extremely carefully in the period up to 29 March when the court once again pronounces on the case."
"We support the European Union’s agreements with Libya, concerning the HIV epidemic, and we urge the immediate implementation of the action plans which sparked our solidarity with sufferers from the epidemic in the Benghazi hospital [and I thank the Commission for this package of intervention plans]."
"Before anything else I would like to express our concerns in connection with the situation of the Bulgarian and Palestinian health workers."
"Six years ago they came under suspicion, were arrested, and were condemned to death."
"We were not the first to become involved in the affair, since successive presidencies of the Commission and the Council have dealt with the matter in their sittings."
"But again we must emphasise that the death penalty falls outside the values and fundamental principles of the European Union, and carrying out these death penalties would nullify the normalisation of relations between the European Union and Libya."
"We hope that Libya reacts positively to the EU’s efforts and labours to advance long-term, close cooperation."
"In light of this we hope there will be swift progress in this affair, and nothing other than a fair appeal hearing."
"Delaying justice is nothing other than a repudiation of justice."
"Because of this we call on Libya to respond to our concerns at the earliest possible date, and we ask the Council that they initiate a re-examination of the affair."
"Mr President, the standards of medical practice and care in Libya leave a lot to be desired."
"There is a lack of local medical staff, medical expertise and training, as well as of proper medical facilities and equipment."
"The problem is more prominent in large, overcrowded city hospitals serving largely poor, underdeveloped urban areas, like the Al Fatah Hospital in Benghazi."
"It was in that hospital, back in 1998, that an outbreak of HIV infection was discovered, affecting approximately 400 children."
"That outbreak was no surprise to western experts as they knew that the hygiene conditions in that hospital were abysmal and that it was only a matter of time before such a major infection catastrophe occurred."
"The Libyan Government needed a scapegoat, which was found in the form of five nurses from Bulgaria and one doctor from Palestine."
"In countries like Libya, getting signed confessions under torture and setting up staged trials is no difficult task."
"While the international community stood back and watched, these six medical workers, who went to Libya in order to offer their services for the benefit of the Libyan people, were sentenced to death in 2004."
"They were found guilty of the ludicrous charge of deliberately infecting the children in the Benghazi hospital with HIV."
"It was alleged by Colonel Gaddafi himself that they did this as part of a CIA and Mossad plot to destabilise the country."
"How can the situation now be remedied?"
"First of all, the EU must take concrete action."
"I propose the following three steps. Firstly, the President of the European Parliament should request the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety to send a small delegation immediately to visit the imprisoned medical workers in Libya and to see Colonel Gaddafi and convey to him the strong wish of Parliament that these medical workers are pardoned and released immediately."
"Secondly, the EU, in collaboration with the World Health Organisation, should immediately send a team of medical experts to Libya to assess the situation in relation to the HIV epidemic in the country and offer expert advice and help to deal with the problem."
"Thirdly, the EU should take further drastic initiatives in order quickly to lead Libya out of the isolation imposed by the western world from 1992 to 2003."
"Such actions, if effective, would be of mutual benefit to the EU in terms of trade enhancement, and to the people of Libya in terms of improving their standard of living."
"I do not think, Commissioner, that you need to be lectured about what needs to be done;"
"I believe that you identified the right target when speaking about the strategy that needs to be used."
"Kindly allow me to say such things as a person living in a country – I live in Malta – which is Libya’s neighbour, just forty-five minutes away from their coast."
"In my opinion, as a person who visits Libya frequently – and who knows the Libyan mentality, as it is in these countries – the point, the key to the solution, is direct contact with the people, direct contact especially with the relatives of the victims."
"These people are experiencing a major tragedy."
"I pronounce it as a clear statement – I am against any death penalty, be it in Libya, in the United States or in any other country of the world."
"However, the key to everything is found in the victims’ relatives and the work that needs to be done in general, in my opinion, with regards to the Libyan health system, but in a particular manner, also socially and psychologically with these families."
"We have to remember that AIDS victims in certain countries – even, I believe, in Europe, but particularly in certain other countries – are highly stigmatised."
"That means these people have already experienced the death of a relative, in many cases their son or daughter, they have experienced a big shock, and believe, and I say unfairly, that it is these five persons that killed their children and are experiencing this stigma."
"Secondly, where a Court confirms these people’s guilt but changes their sentence, I believe that there has to be consideration of the idea, by both the Council as well as the Commission, of prisoner exchange, as long as the prisoners within the Member States of the European Union are willing, are ready, to serve their prison sentence in Libya."
"I think that this is part of the solution for the things that could happen."
"Mr President, I think there is little to add to my previous comments and to the various points raised by Members of Parliament."
"I agree fully with Mr Muscat."
"We are indeed dealing with a genuine tragedy."
"The problem of the infection of children with the AIDS virus, particularly in a country like Libya where AIDS is even more of a taboo subject than in most of our own countries, affects both individual families and the entire population."
"I believe we also need to make efforts in this area."
"We have to offer our help to Libya – this is now being prepared and implemented – in its fight against AIDS, and in order to improve its healthcare system so that it can, at least, cope with this tragedy which is affecting the people concerned."
"Beyond that, we also need to send a very strong and clear signal to Libya and bring a degree of pressure to bear for justice to be done and for the health workers concerned to be released."
"Libya wishes to develop and strengthen its relations with the European Union."
"It cannot do so as long as it continues to persist in its determination to do nothing for these five or six people unjustly condemned to death."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should just like to make two brief concluding remarks."
"The European Union has very clearly held out the prospect of a Mediterranean partnership to Libya."
"We have put forward a number of objectives, some of which have already been achieved, such as the ending of the embargo, while others are still to happen, such as full adoption of the ."
"Bulgaria is about to sign the treaty of accession to the EU, and Libya is well aware that the case of the six Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor is politically highly sensitive in Europe."
"The Libyan authorities also know that the decision on whether it can join the Barcelona process will be made by unanimous vote at the forthcoming European Council, at which Bulgaria and Romania have the right to take part and to speak, even if they cannot vote."
"Europe will continue to maintain direct contacts with Libya, including visits to the Benghazi families."
"I share the view of a number of Members that we must show our solidarity with the civilian population in Libya that has been hit by the AIDS infection."
"Our visits to the detained health workers will, of course, continue, and in this respect I hope that the Libyan Government will continue to authorise the prison visits without attaching any conditions."
"Lastly, I can assure you that the Commission’s action plan will continue."
"We shall keep up our positive efforts with regard to Libya, which we consider an essential partner in the Mediterranean, and we shall work to improve the state of public services for the citizens – of which health is just one example – as a practical demonstration of how relations with Europe can be of real added value to Libya."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0019/2005)."
"We will be taking a series of questions to the Council."
"What is the Council Presidency’s judgment as to the state of play of preparations for clarifying the question of Kosovo's status, and what action can be expected under the Luxembourg Council Presidency?"
"Madam President, the Council agrees with Mr Posselt that the development of the situation in Kosovo, under the auspices of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244, will be of particular importance during 2005."
"The Luxembourg Presidency will give full support to the UN’s efforts and to the actions of the Secretary-General’s special representative, Mr Jensen Petersen, with a view to stabilising Kosovo."
"The Council was able to review the situation in that country in the presence of Mr Jensen Petersen during its meeting on 21 February."
"The Mid-2005 review will be the first opportunity to fully assess progress on effective compliance with United Nations standards."
"Progress towards a process for determining the future status of Kosovo, in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244, will be conditional on a positive outcome of that assessment."
"The European Union has been closely involved in this process, with absolute respect for the role of the United Nations in determining the future status of Kosovo."
"The Thessaloniki Summit clearly affirmed that the Western Balkans, including Kosovo, without prejudice to their future status, are destined to become future members of the European Union."
"Consequently, the Union will have an important role in examining the status of Kosovo, in order to ensure it is fully compatible with the process of European integration."
"The Council, in its conclusions of 21 February, stressed that Kosovo must not revert to the pre-1999 situation."
"Its future can only be envisaged as a multi-ethnic and democratic state, guaranteeing effective protection for minorities, preserving the cultural and religious heritage of all communities and respecting the rights of refugees and displaced persons to return, thereby contributing to the stability of the region and adhering to the European Union’s values and principles."
"The Council has invited the Secretary-General and High Representative, and the Commission, in close cooperation with the Presidency, and in conjunction with the United Nations and other relevant bodies, to examine the possible future contribution of the European Union to the efforts of the international community in Kosovo aimed at implementing Resolution 1244, and to assess its potential contribution to the overall assessment of the implementation of standards and to later phases of the process, and subsequently reporting back to it."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, UN Resolution 1244 has absolutely nothing to say about the future status of Kosovo."
"This resolution is already five years old."
"Now that the Americans have announced their intention of resolving the status issue this year, the question arises as to whether the EU wants to take an independent initiative on this or passively await what others will come up with."
"Unemployment in Kosovo is running at 70%, and people will invest in the place only as and when its long-term future is sorted out."
"I would therefore like to know whether the Council is planning some kind of active preparation for this decision, which is evidently due this year?"
"The approach adopted has been termed ‘Standards before status’ or ‘Standards for Kosovo’, and this approach still applies."
"The European Union is also in contact with all partners with an interest in seeing a political solution to the Kosovo situation."
"Therefore, the European Union is not waiting for others to take decisions."
"We remain in contact with our partners, but I believe that a risky and precipitate solution that failed to take sufficient account of a certain number of problems still unresolved in that country, would ultimately run the risk of threatening the still very fragile stability in Kosovo."
"Would the President-in-Office agree with me that the decision by the now ex-Prime Minister of Kosovo, Mr Ramush Haradinaj, to resign and to cooperate with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia is a welcome sign of the growing political maturity in the country."
"The response of the ethnic Albanians now is absolutely critical."
"It has been reported that 1000 extra KFOR troops have been deployed in Kosovo because of the fear of rising tension."
"If Kosovo can overcome this problem in the next day or two, I think that will augur well for a final political solution to the Kosovan crisis and allow the UN administration to withdraw."
"Does he agree with that?"
"I fully agree with that assessment."
"I believe that the Prime Minister’s decision to go to The Hague is a sensible one and one which demonstrates a significant political maturity."
"It will also have the effect of giving the Albanian inhabitants of Kosovo the right message, namely that the process is normal and that it is now a time for cool heads."
"I believe that if this can be achieved, and if people remain calm, new prospects will open up for Kosovo."
"– Madam President, I should like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council what the Council intends to do to protect minorities, given that the violently expelled Serbs and Roma have not yet returned home."
"I also wish to ask how the Council believes the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Serbia and Montenegro will be protected at the imminent negotiations, as expressly stated in UN Resolution 1244 which, as you said, the Council continues to support."
"Firstly, in relation to the protection of minorities, I believe this is part – as I have clearly said – of the European Union’s approach to a political solution in Kosovo."
"There can be no political solution for Kosovo without the protection of minorities and without all refugees having the right to return home."
"That much is clear."
"With regard to the issue of sovereignty, I believe that it is on this issue that a political solution has to be found, although without predicting what such a solution will be."
"We are conscious that the issue is highly complex and difficult; it must be the subject of negotiations to be entered into at the appropriate time."
"Therefore, I cannot give you a clear reply, but what we are being guided by today is resolution 1544."
"Question No 2 lapses."
"Question No 3 has been withdrawn."
"The assassination of the former Lebanese Prime Minister, Rafik Hariri, has raised fears at international level that Lebanon and the surrounding region may be destabilised."
"Statements by Condoleezza Rice reveal that the USA's view is that Syria is responsible for the assassination."
"For its part, Syria, which has been described by the US President as a country forming part of the 'axis of evil', condemned the attack, claiming that it had no connection with the assassination of Rafik Hariri."
"What initiatives will the Council take to prevent any unilateral US action against Syria?"
"Article 19 of the Treaty on European Union provides for coordination between Member States which are also members of the UN Security Council. What do those Member States propose to do in this respect?"
"The prospects for peace in the Middle East, which have improved significantly, nonetheless remain fragile and extreme care will be required if they are not to evaporate."
"On this issue, the common approach of the United States and the European Union, reaffirmed at the meeting of Heads of State or Government with the US President on 22 February in Brussels, are a source of satisfaction."
"The EU and USA share the same position on the Middle East peace process and on the need to implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 1559 in its entirety."
"Moreover, that resolution was initiated by one of the European Union Member States together with the US."
"It demands the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon, the disarmament and dismantling of all militias and the holding of parliamentary elections in that country, in accordance with a free and proper process without external interference."
"The Council has roundly condemned the attack which took the life of Rafik Hariri, former President of the Lebanese Council of Ministers."
"I think this has been discussed extensively in recent days – yesterday and during the previous sitting."
"Responsibility for that attack has not yet been established."
"The international community and the Council have demanded an international enquiry to establish the circumstances and attribute responsibility."
"The Council has called upon the Lebanese authorities to cooperate fully to that end with the investigating teams, in particular the United Nations representatives."
"The Council has also called upon all countries in the region to fulfil their international obligations, particularly in combating terrorism."
"The United Nations Secretary-General has announced that, in the next few weeks, he will be presenting a report on implementation of the resolution, on the basis of which the Security Council will take a decision on future steps."
"This will be done in close coordination with the various members of the Security Council and with EU Member States which are Security Council members, as well as the other Member States."
"– Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I should like to insist, having thanked you for your reply, on one issue: following the discussions which the European Union recently had with the US leadership, is the Council in a position to assure me that there will be no unilateral action of a negative nature by the United States in the area, given the sensitivity which exists in the entire area?"
"You are aware that, unfortunately – or perhaps fortunately, I am not sure – I am not the spokesman for the White House, and therefore cannot provide you with a clear answer on this point."
"As I have just explained, the agreed approach of the European Union and United States favours the United Nations and a UN resolution."
"Moreover, some positive signs are beginning to emerge from the country to which reference was clearly being made."
"At the JHA Council of Ministers on 29 January 2005, the representatives of Germany and the Netherlands asked Spain for explanations on the process of wholesale regularisation of illegal immigrants that it planned to initiate, considering such a measure to have irremediable consequences for the other EU Member States."
"This process, which in fact began on 7 February, and which it is estimated could affect around one million people, has already led to instances of immigrants being sacked for fear of denunciations and to the 'pull factor' warned of by some Spanish police unions."
"The principle of developing a common immigration policy has already been declared at the European Council meetings in Seville and Thessaloniki, the Green Paper on managing economic migration, recently presented by the Commission, recognises that 'decisions to admit … third country nationals in one Member State affect others', and Article III-267 of the Treaty on the European Constitution provides that the Union shall develop a common immigration policy."
"In the light of the above, how does the Council view the request for explanations and the criticisms levelled in respect of the process of extraordinary regularisation being implemented by the Spanish Government?"
"The Council reminds the Member that the decision on the numbers of migrant workers to admit falls within the remit of each EU Member State, and I would add that it will continue to remain within the remit of each Member State even after the Constitution comes into force."
"With regard to the regularisation process implemented by the Spanish Government and to which the question refers, the Council has not debated it formally and is not therefore in a position to respond."
"In more general terms, the Council invites the honourable Member to refer to developments in the Hague Programme, the multiannual programme adopted by the European Council at its meeting on 4 and 5 November 2004."
"By adopting that programme, the European Council, on the issue we are discussing here, based its conclusions in particular on the idea that the informal economy and unofficial employment may provide a stimulus to clandestine immigration and give rise to exploitation."
"Additionally, in view of the specific problem of dealing with economic migration, the Council, at its meeting on 24 February had an initial exchange of views on the Commission’s Green Book on a Community-wide approach."
"At this stage, it is a discussion document covering a wide range of questions and envisaging a range of possible solutions."
"The examination progress which has begun should provide a basis for the Commission to establish, at the end of 2005, a programme for legal immigration."
"– Whether or not this has been formally discussed, the fact remains that Otto Schily and Rita Verdonk have raised an objection."
"I have the Commission's response from yesterday, which uses the same terms, and I am sorry to say, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that the Commission's response was much clearer than yours. You said that the size of the unregulated labour market will not be reduced, which amounts to saying that illegal immigration is being encouraged in some way, as the Commission said yesterday."
"I would say, based on my own experience, that in addition to promoting illegal immigration, the 'call effect' is being supported, making life easier for mafia groups involved in human trafficking, encouraging the market in false documents and what is more, weakening the Schengen area."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, this cure is worse than the disease."
". The Hague programme, to which I referred, aims to combat illegal immigration and clandestine immigration, and also undeclared labour."
"We must admit that this is a complex problem, because the illegal immigrants that are here, are here."
"So, what are we going to do about it?"
"They are here and they are working illegally."
"Are we going to accept that they will continue doing so?"
"That is the question."
"I think the best solution is for there to be less illegal immigration and less undeclared labour."
"(We must not forget that the last Spanish Government undeniably made some very serious mistakes which resulted in a million illegal immigrants in Spain."
"I would like to join the Commission – and now the President-in-Office of the Council – in asking, by way of extension to the previous question, whether the Spanish regularisation efforts are not tantamount to staking everything on legal, regulated immigration, on strengthening border controls and on combating the hidden economy, as so clearly stated by the President."
". I think that what was decided within a Member State fell within the competence of that Member State."
"The European Union clearly has an interest in seeing additional efforts made to improve border controls."
"That, moreover, is one of the aims of the agency we are in the process of setting up."
"We must combat illegal immigration, but also the opportunities for employing workers illegally and clandestinely."
"There is a 'pull' effect in play."
"If there were no possibility of illegal work, illegal immigrants would probably find Europe less attractive."
"Is the Presidency aware that the Maltese Government is not allowing journalists, either local or international, to visit detention centres where immigrants are being held?"
"Are you aware that there were damning reports on the state of those immigration centres by the Council of Europe?"
"I agree with the detention policy, but the state of these places is indescribable."
"Do you think it is right that journalists should not be allowed to report, not just without restriction but even if they apply for permission to be given access to those places?"
". I do not think that this question is really related to the previous question."
"All I can say is that, indeed, all countries with particularly exposed borders must make every effort to control those borders, in order to limit illegal immigration and combat this phenomenon effectively."
"I will leave to the Council of Europe the responsibility that is incumbent upon it and to which you referred."
"As part of the plans for a Single European Sky, is the Council planning to create an operational airspace block which includes Kosovo?"
". Madam President, I would point out to the honourable Member that, under Article 5 of Regulation No 551/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2004 on the organisation and use of the airspace in the single European sky, the Council has no authority with regard to the creation of a functional airspace block, such as the one to which the Member referred in his question."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I should merely like to ask one additional question. Is this not a further example of something we discussed before, namely that the complex problems Kosovo faces cannot be resolved by means of the old ‘standards before status’ policy, and that the issue of status must finally be settled?"
"Standards will not be achieved if no one knows what the status is ultimately meant to be."
"I should also like to raise a point of order."
"I indicated a short while ago that I wished to put a supplementary question, and even though I did so very early on, it would appear that no one noticed."
"We did notice, Mr Posselt, but two other Members were even quicker off the mark than you were, and, as I can allow only two questions, I gave the floor to them."
". I agree with you that the 'standards before status' approach has its limits and that the time is coming – or will come – when we will, indeed, need to have clear discussions on the status issue."
"That time is certainly drawing nearer."
"What action will the Council take on the Justice and Home Affairs report for the Council on hooliganism in football and football information centres? (13 January 2005)"
". Madam President, the report setting out the situation in the Member States as regards hooliganism in football between July 2002 and July 2003 will be discussed at the Member States' experts meeting, which is scheduled for the end of April 2005."
"They will pay particular attention to the expected developments in this field: the continuing internationalisation of football; troublemakers developing counter-strategies to deal with measures taken to combat hooliganism; solutions aimed at reducing, or even eliminating, internal border controls, in connection with the growth of the EU; the emergence of forms of extremism in violence surrounding sporting events; the progressive and continuing commercialisation of football; and the gathering of hooligans in groups that act as a unit rather than as individuals."
"President-in-Office, I discovered this report and was keen that during your presidency you put further pressure on UEFA in particular and, if necessary, FIFA, to move us towards a position where football is truly a family sport."
"At the moment it is being scarred not just by hooliganism but, as you said, also by racism."
"In your view, does UEFA issue stiff enough penalties, particularly in international football?"
"What is being done about national football?"
"Some pressure should be put on countries like, for instance, Italy, the Netherlands, Germany and my own country to ensure that football is truly a family sport."
"Is there anything you can do during your presidency to make that a reality?"
". Indeed, the Presidency attaches considerable importance to these phenomena that occur in stadia, and which are due to hooliganism, but also to racism."
"In cooperation with UEFA and the national football federations, we must be firmly committed to combating these phenomena, which are damaging the reputation of a sport that, in other respects, is very worthwhile and popular."
"Following on from that, would the Council care to comment on the lackadaisical attitude by the football authorities as regards what happened at the England v. Spain game, where there was lots of racist chanting?"
"It seems to me that racism and hooliganism in football are combining."
"It is the same sort of group of people, who are not football fans, who are responsible for this."
"The Council seems to have very few views on the subject."
"I wonder whether it could expand slightly more?"
". We cannot tolerate expressions of racism, whether during sporting events or at any other events."
"I think we need both thought and action in this matter."
"Those involved in such expressions of racism need to know that they will be punished, but also that they are putting at risk the continuation of sporting events."
"I think that the action we have in part taken against hooligans must also be extended to all expressions of racism, which are now tending to become more frequent on the margins of sporting events, particularly of football matches."
"Efforts to resolve the 18-year-old conflict in Uganda have failed, and violence has flared up once again."
"The conflict has caused immense human suffering, massive displacement of populations, a breakdown of social and economic structures and gross human rights violations."
"The Lord’s Resistance Army rebels continue to use extreme violence against the civilian population of northern Uganda and to abduct children for use as soldiers or sex slaves."
"In light of the European Parliament’s resolutions on human rights violations in Uganda, what steps has the Council taken, or will the Council take, in order to guarantee the security of the Ugandan population, especially the children, and put an end to the atrocities?"
". The Council remains deeply concerned about the conflict in northern Uganda."
"It has on several occasions condemned the serious violations of human rights and atrocities committed against the civilian population, especially by the Lord's Resistance Army."
"The conflict in northern Uganda is one of the main points in the political dialogue between the European Union and the Ugandan Government."
"As part of this, representatives of the Member States and of the Commission have regularly expressed their concerns regarding the continual violations of human rights occurring in the north of Uganda."
"They have stressed the need to put an end to the suffering of the civilian population by means of a peaceful, negotiated solution to the conflict."
"Representatives of the European Union and of other international partners have reiterated this position to the Ugandan Government."
"Moreover, the EU itself has also expressed a willingness to support the peace process and to contribute to the economic reconstruction of the north of the country."
"A significant proportion of the humanitarian aid that the EU provides to Uganda is intended to help the most vulnerable population groups in that part of the country."
"Despite the resumption of fighting which followed the recent expiry of the government-declared ceasefire, the Council hopes that negotiations with the Lord's Resistance Army can continue."
"It is also prepared to investigate what means it could use to increase the pressure on the two parties, in order to reach a lasting solution to this conflict in Uganda."
"I thank the President for this response and should like, at the same time, to give expression to a certain level of astonishment about the fact that there is talk of a war between two factions."
"As far as I can judge, this is about the terrorist activities of the Lord’s Resistance Army, backed by the Sudanese Government and at the expense of the people of Northern Uganda."
"I wonder whether it would not be opportune to include in the political dialogue with Sudan, and not only in the political dialogue with Uganda, the issue of the Lord's Resistance Army and the massive scale on which human rights are being violated."
"Secondly, what initiatives does the Council intend to take in order to counter the absence of any punishment in this conflict, more particularly with regard to the complaint that has been lodged with the International Criminal Court in The Hague?"
". Indeed, the formulation putting the government and this so-called resistance army on the same level may not be entirely appropriate."
"Nevertheless, I think that the only way to find a solution to this conflict is to urge the Ugandan Government and that army to enter into dialogue."
"I think that, without dialogue, a peaceful resolution will not be possible."
"With regard to responsibilities, I think that we do indeed need to examine the extent to which these responsibilities can be set out and determined, and we must not rule out any option, including the option of the International Criminal Court."
"On 22 February 2005 George Bush, President of the United States, made an official visit to Brussels, attending the summit meeting of the 25."
"How does the Council view the development of transatlantic relations and future prospects in this connection?"
"At the summit meeting, questions of vital importance to the EU were considered, such as the peace process in the Middle East, relations with Iraq, Iran, Syria and Lebanon and wider Mediterranean policy issues."
"Can the Council now discern any convergence between the US and EU foreign policy approach to the Middle East in general?"
"Did the question of the Kyoto Protocol elicit a favourable American response and, if so, what form did this take?"
". President Bush's visit to Brussels, so early in his second term, sends an important political signal."
"The message sent by the US President was twofold, firstly that the time for diplomacy has arrived, and secondly that Europe, and particularly the European Union, is considered to be an important partner."
"The change in the administration may seem to have happened at lightning speed, but in reality the tone began to change several months back."
"It was very clear during the most recent, very successful, summit in Ireland."
"It was after the elections in November, though, that the offer of a new partnership with Europe and, more specifically, with the EU, was made explicit."
"A new start like this is obviously in Europe's interest, especially if it is made in a spirit of true partnership and greater equality."
"None of today's major geostrategic issues are the subject of real disagreement."
"It is only on issues of society and the relative importance of multilateralism compared to national sovereignty that our approaches diverge."
"With regard to the crucial issues currently occupying the international scene, we can see a very broad convergence of opinions between the United States and the EU."
"This is true, of course, of the Middle-East peace process, and it is now true of the stabilisation of Iraq."
"With regard to Iran, there is agreement on the two main objectives: Iran must not develop nuclear weapons and must contribute actively to combating terrorism."
"The United States is in close contact with the European Union to find a peaceful solution to these problems."
"As for Lebanon and Syria, I spoke about them a few moments ago."
"In terms of the environment, it is true that the problems have not entirely been ironed out, but President Bush has recognised the existence of the serious problem of climate change."
"He has expressed a desire to work with the European Union to provide solutions, in particular in the field of research and technology, and to develop clean technologies, whilst integrating the emerging powers such as India and China."
"Thus, without wishing to paint an idyllic picture of our relations they are a long way from that and without ignoring the subjects on which it will be the EU's duty to return to the attack, it nevertheless seems possible to take the view that this summit made it possible to demonstrate more effectively the important points of convergence that are providing a structure for transatlantic dialogue."
"– Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, thank you for your reply."
"I should like to ask you, as a supplementary question, if some programme of contacts and cooperation between the European Union and the United States has been decided, in order to ensure that specific action is taken so as to capitalise on this auspicious climate and the basis for cooperation which, as you say, was cultivated during the recent visit to Brussels by President Bush."
". Transatlantic relations are not limited to summit meetings."
"There is continuous contact on all subjects, at all levels, not only between the Ministers for Foreign Affairs, but also between the Ministers for Justice, focussing on the fight against crime and terrorism."
"That is the programme."
"In addition, we are going to hold another summit, which we are already working towards, with a broader agenda that will also cover matters of economic cooperation."
"This summit will take place in June and, in my opinion, it will demonstrate that the relaunch of transatlantic dialogue is a strong one, with very clear aims."
"If there has indeed been a relaunch of transatlantic relations, then that is good news for the Middle East peace process, because there can be no peace in the Middle East without both EU and US involvement."
"Will the Council take advantage of this new climate to up the tempo of meetings of the Quartet and the road map to peace in the Middle East, in order to lend greater impetus to that process?"
". It is quite correct that transatlantic cooperation is essential to the Middle-East peace process."
"There cannot be a political solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict without the participation of the European Union and the United States."
"Therefore, cooperation within the Quartet is extremely important for the application of the road map, and the relaunch of the Quartet's efforts to implement that road map would seem to be absolutely essential."
"Does the Council consider that, given the fact that the European Parliament is one of the pillars of the budgetary authority, it is necessary, before a final decision is taken on the allocation and spending of the USD 1.2 billion in funds deriving from the agreement between the European Commission and Philip Morris with respect to the fight against cigarette smuggling, to a initiate a round of consultations between the Council and the EP?"
". The Council would inform the honourable Member that the allocation of the amount referred to is still the subject of discussion between the Commission and the Member States concerned."
"The file has not been submitted to the Council itself."
"The Council invites the honourable Member to put this question directly to the Commission."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, your answer is very diplomatic, I have to say."
"We all know that this agreement exists; we know that there are already funds in a Luxembourg account and we know that these funds have to be shared out."
"We know that the budgetary authority is made up of two branches, namely the Council and Parliament."
"Would it not indeed be desirable, therefore, for the Council and Parliament, as the joint budgetary authority, to come to an agreement with the Commission on how those funds were to be apportioned?"
"I do not believe that you can simply say that I should direct this question to the Commission."
"There is a great deal of money involved."
"It is reported that 10% would now be channelled to the Commission and 90% to the Member States, while the usual procedure in customs practices, when funds are claimed, is that 25% is channelled to the Member State and 75% to the Commission."
"This is therefore a serious matter, and one that cannot simply be dismissed with a diplomatic response."
"I acknowledge the honourable Member's comment, including with regard to the diplomatic answer."
"However, I believe that bilateral discussions are indeed still continuing between the Commission and the Member States."
"You have my word that the Council will contact the Commission to find out in what context we can find a solution that, of course, will also respect Parliament's budgetary powers."
"Do any, or all, of the 25 Member States ever report to the Council about the activities of their secret services, such as MI6 in the UK, in the fight against international organised crime?"
"If so, which and how often?"
". The Council has not been informed of any activities carried out by the secret services of the Member States in the fight against organised crime."
"Indeed, no provision in Title VI of the Treaty on European Union requires the Member States to provide the Council with such data."
"I hope that the Council is very shocked by its own reply."
"Organised crime crosses frontiers in Europe very easily and we need to work together as Member States and as European institutions to fight against it."
"So what you are telling me, President-in-Office, is that there is no coordination at all between the activities of the secret services of the Member States."
"Should there not be some coordination?"
". I do not think that I was telling you that there was no cooperation between the secret services."
"You are well aware that there is coordination between the services, amongst other things for combating terrorism and organised crime, against which the networks are also joined."
"What I was saying was that this issue does not fall within the formal remit of the Council, as it is not a competence of the EU."
"The Council discusses and reaches almost all of its decisions in closed session."
"Despite this, members of the Council repeatedly disclose details of these meetings."
"What penalties do Council members face in these circumstances?"
"What is the Council doing to create the greatest possible transparency, and why are many more meetings not made open to the public – at least when legislative decisions are being taken?"
"How does the Council respond to the criticism that in many of its activities it is an undemocratic body which meets and reaches its decisions in secret?"
". The Council would remind the honourable Member that it is up to each member of the Council to set out his or her position during the press conferences that follow Council sessions and to explain those aspects of the debate that they feel need to be presented in public in order to provide the context for that position."
"The Council is not in the habit of commenting on public statements made by its members."
"With regard to the transparency of the Council's work, it would stress that, in accordance with Article 11(6) of Annex II to its Rules of Procedure, after adoption of decisions by the Council during the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the EC Treaty or final adoption of the act concerned, the General Secretariat makes available to the public any legislative documents relating to this act, that is to say those that were drawn up before one of such decisions and that are not covered by any of the exceptions laid down in Article 4(1), (2) and (3), second subparagraph, of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001."
"At the request of the Member State concerned, documents that are covered by those criteria, and that reflect the position of that Member State's delegation, are not made available to the public."
"On the other hand, when negotiations are in progress on a draft text, the Council reserves the right not to release the identities of the delegations if the conditions of Article 4(3) of that Regulation are met."
"Thus, the Council complies with both the letter and the spirit of the official texts, while ensuring the greatest possible transparency. I hope that my statement has also been sufficiently transparent."
"With respect to the publication of the votes themselves, the Council would remind the honourable Member that, in the field of legislation, these are automatically published and invites him to refer, in this regard, to the responses that it gave in particular to a series of written questions in 2003 and 2004 on the same subject."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I find it extremely frustrating that you have not answered a single one of my questions in any way, shape or form."
"I am not asking you about documents, but I am specifically asking what penalties Council members face if they disclose details of what has been said at Council meetings."
"What action is taken against them?"
"My two other questions do not relate to the legal position, of which I am well aware, but to the steps you intend to take in response to accusations that you are a secret society."
"It is not the legal position I am interested in, but the specific measures you plan to take."
"In the public interest – and a great many members of the public are in fact keen to know this – I would ask you again to give a proper answer to the question as to what action is taken against a Minister or Council member who discloses details of who said what during confidential talks in closed session."
". In legal terms, there are no sanctions."
"That is very clear."
"And we have no intention of introducing any."
"We cannot both call for greater transparency and at the same time punish, ultimately, the freedom of speech of Council members, even if, at times, they misuse this freedom of speech."
"I cannot see how we could introduce sanctions in this respect."
"Is the Council aware that the Special EU Programmes Body, which oversees EU expenditure in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland under the Peace II Programme, is exempt from the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (UK) and the Freedom of Information Acts 1997 and 2003 (Ireland) and, in consequence, as a public body is above the law prevailing in both jurisdictions on freedom of information?"
"Is the Council satisfied with this situation, particularly since a promised Code of Practice on access to information for Implementation Bodies acting under SEUPB has never materialised."
"Given the allocations of EU funds involved, what steps will the Council take to rectify this wholly unsatisfactory situation?"
". The Council would remind the honourable Member that, on the matter of the freedom of information system applicable to the Special EU Programmes Body that oversees the Peace I and Peace II programmes in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and also other Community initiatives, this falls within the competence of the said Member States."
"The Council would also draw the honourable Member's attention to the fact that it is the Commission's responsibility to ensure that Council Regulation No 1260/99 of 21 June 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds, as amended by the Council on 24 January 2005 to extend the duration of the Peace programme, is properly implemented, in view of the fact that responsibility for managing these funds is split between the European Commission and the governments of the Member States, on the basis of a close partnership."
"Surely it is a matter of concern to the Council when two Member States combine to exclude an EU monitoring body from their indigenous freedom of information legislation and so exempt it from provisions on providing the public with information that is available from all internal governmental bodies in those states."
"In particular, should it not be a matter of concern for the Council that those two states have indulged in five years of default in terms of producing a voluntary code of practice for those implementation bodies under the SEUPB?"
"I have no reason to believe that Community law has been infringed, and I assume that the rules regarding provision of information and supervision have been complied with."
"Since 2001 a civil protection mechanism for the rendering of assistance(1) in the 25 Member States, Bulgaria, Romania, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway has been in operation."
"At a meeting of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly (EMPA) I recommended the introduction of such cooperation arrangements and the creation of an early warning system in the Mediterranean as part of the Barcelona process. It was decided that the question of natural disasters and civil protection would be placed on the agenda of the EMPA plenary of 12-15 March 2005 in Cairo."
"Does the Council support my recommendation and what follow-up measures does it intend to take in response to potential dangers in the Mediterranean area with a view to reassuring the public and assessing existing preventive mechanisms, the state of readiness for emergencies and the standard of public information and participation, so that all relevant measures can be implemented as part of Euro-Mediterranean partnership arrangements?"
"What is its assessment of the civil protection pilot project being funded under the MEDA programme?"
". Madam President, the Council would invite the honourable Member to refer to the statement made on this subject during the last plenary session in Strasbourg in February."
"In the same vein, it would remind the honourable Member that it recognises and shares his desire for the establishment of cooperation in civil protection in the Mediterranean, in particular by the possible creation of an early warning system in the Mediterranean as part of the Barcelona process."
"In addition, the Council welcomes the fact that this issue is to be raised during the first session of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly from 12 to 15 March 2005 in Cairo."
"The Council points out that, with regard to the proposal put forward by the author of this question with the aim of finding a solution for the dangers threatening the Mediterranean region, an ad hoc group on partnership measures, appointed by senior officials responsible for the political and social chapter of the Barcelona process, discussed these issues on 9 February 2005."
"In particular, it discussed maritime safety in the region, and civil protection, particularly by preparing a mandate to draw up aid plans in the event of a tsunami as part of the existing interim Euro-Mediterranean programme."
"On this matter, a seminar scheduled to be held in Marseille in June 2005 will aim to bring together the various instruments and should discuss prevention in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, operational organisation in collaboration with other forums such as the 5+5 or the Euro-Mediterranean forum, a specific assistance plan for the Mediterranean and a warning centre."
"The possibility of organising voluntary practical exercises shared between the Member States in October 2005 will also be looked into."
"The Luxembourg Presidency attaches considerable importance to this initiative, which it launched and in which it has participated."
"– Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, thank you very much for your answer, which is satisfactory."
"I should like, nonetheless, to remind you that, of course, the early warning system is very important because, today, 70 million people are living on the shores of the Mediterranean, not counting tourists. In other words, we do not want a repeat of the disaster in South-East Asia."
"Furthermore, we have numerous fires, numerous earthquakes and other natural disasters."
"Consequently, what I should like to hear from you, in addition to what you have already said, which is highly satisfactory, is whether we really are prepared to make available the sum needed, because this sum will be much larger than the sum we already have for the bridge programme or the sum of around EUR 12 million budgeted for the early warning system."
"We are talking about several million euros more and I should like to know if the European Union has decided to make these sums available."
". I do not think that the Council on its own can provide an answer."
"This question needs to be put to all the bodies with budgetary authority."
"Once an operational system has been put in place, we will also need to finance it."
"The two bodies with budgetary authority will thus have to reach agreement so that this financing comes, at least in part, from Community sources."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, whenever disaster strikes we are faced with the same problem: although preparations are made in advance for aid programmes, no market research or opinion polls are carried out among those hit by disasters, even though these are key prerequisites."
"Is any provision made in the Action Plan for future victims to be asked what their real needs are when a disaster strikes, to ensure that they are involved in any plans that are drawn up?"
". You are describing the ideal situation, and it would certainly be the best way of saving a great deal of money and of intervening using the means that are absolutely necessary."
"Unfortunately, disasters always surprise us and the expected needs are not always those that really need to be met."
"We certainly do need to ensure that we pay as much attention as possible to the aspect to which you refer."
"What is the Council's position on the subject of the possible accession of central and southern European countries such as Serbia and Montenegro, Bosnia Herzegovina, and Albania within the next decade or more?"
"Could enlargement of the Union to include these countries precede the accession of Turkey, which would appear to be logical?"
". Madam President, the European Council established in June 2000 that all the countries in the Western Balkans were potential candidates for accession to the European Union."
"Subsequently, in June 2003, the European Council reiterated its determination to fully and effectively support the European perspective of the western Balkan countries, which will become an integral part of the European Union once they meet the established criteria."
"It is therefore essentially up to the countries concerned to set the pace at which they come closer to the EU by aligning with the and by meeting the criteria established by the Copenhagen European Council and the conditions of the stabilisation and association process."
"To date, only Croatia and the FYROM have officially applied to join the EU."
"Following Croatia's application for membership, the European Council has decided to open accession negotiations in March 2005, provided that Croatia cooperates fully with ICTY."
"As regards the FYROM, the Commission is still in the process of preparing its opinion on that country's application for membership."
"At its meeting in Brussels on 16 and 17 December 2004, the European Council reaffirmed its commitment to the full implementation of the Thessaloniki agenda, which underlines that the future of the countries of the Balkans is within the European Union."
"The recent ministerial meetings of the EU-Western Balkans Forum served to assess the progress achieved and identify the challenges ahead."
"The European Council restated, in particular, that in this process regional cooperation would remain an essential element of EU policy."
"With regard to the financial aspects of the accession of a candidate State, it also stated that these aspects must be allowed for in the applicable Financial Framework."
"Hence, accession negotiations yet to be opened with candidates whose accession could have substantial financial consequences can only be concluded after the establishment of the Financial Framework for the period from 2014 together with possible consequential financial reforms."
"Many thanks, Mr President."
"I have both good and bad news for you."
"The good news is that I am the last person with questions for you today."
"The bad news is that I have a supplementary question I should like to put to you."
"The first point I have to make is that you mentioned two countries that did not feature in my question, namely Macedonia and Croatia."
"My question related to three other countries."
"Although my party and I voted in favour of Turkey’s entry into the European Union, we believe it would be absurd for Turkey to enter into the EU before other countries that are clearly European."
"The European public would find this impossible to understand, and such a situation would be best avoided."
"That is why I also believe that cooperation with the countries in question should involve the drafting of a more accurate timetable for their integration into European structures, covering the next dozen or so years."
"It is my impression that this will not happen, and this disappoints me somewhat."
". I would say to the honourable Member that, of course, we do know the date when negotiations will be opened with Turkey, as does he, but we do not know their accession date."
"At the moment, there are no other applications."
"You referred to other countries."
"The path is open to them, if they accept and meet the criteria."
"The path will then be politically open, in other words they will actually become candidates."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you said yourself that Croatia should seek to cooperate with the International Criminal Tribunal."
"I would be interested to know whether any evidence is available, for example from Europol or Interpol, to suggest that the general in question is in fact still in Croatia."
". I do not actually have any information, either from Europol and I would add that Europol is not an investigative body, as you know or from Interpol, but reports sent to us by the prosecutor of the Hague tribunal show that, in any event, the person in question, General Ante Gotovina, did pass through Croatia."
"Is he still there?"
"That is a question I cannot answer."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, something very unusual has happened; not only have we taken all the questions, we have also completed Question Time half an hour ahead of time, something that we very, very, rarely do."
"I should like to thank everyone present."
"That concludes Question Time."
"The next item is the report (A6-0046/2005) by Mrs Locatelli, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on Science and technology – Guidelines for future European Union policy to support research (2004/2150(INI))."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Lisbon European Council of 2000 marks an important turning-point for European politics in general and for research and the knowledge-based society in particular."
"The Prodi Commission project – developed particularly by Commissioner Busquin but even prior to that by the Italian commissioner, Professor Ruberti – to create the European Research Area by means of a number of measures was confirmed at Lisbon."
"That is a fundamental step if Europe is to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world."
"We are all aware of the current gap between Europe and its major competitors in this field, that is, the United States and Japan."
"The percentage of GDP devoted to research spending is 3.12% in Japan, 2.76% in the United States, 1.99% in the EU of 15 and 1.93% in the EU of 25."
"We have to close this gap, and the European Research Area is a step in the right direction."
"This project is within reach, but it needs determination to make it happen, the same determination that was shown when we created the single market and the single currency."
"The importance of the European Research Area is underlined by the new powers that the Constitutional Treaty attributes to the Union in this field, and we therefore call on the Commission to act in line with the new legal framework."
"Weighing up what has been done and outlining future prospects, I must underline the importance of having continuity between the sixth and seventh Framework Programmes."
"The sixth Framework Programme marked a break with previous programmes, because it set itself more ambitious targets and introduced innovative instruments that encourage a greater number of stake-holders to become involved and to coordinate their actions."
"The seventh Framework Programme presents yet another novelty, which is to set up the European Research Council."
"I am also speaking on this subject on behalf of our fellow Member Erika Mann, who could not be present at this debate."
"The European Research Council responds to the European scientific community’s increasingly vehement demand for a new body to be created to stimulate basic research."
"Basic research is crucially important for successful innovation and will create European added value."
"Up to now, European added value has been defined through collaboration between research teams in different countries."
"As the Mayor report shows, however, it is time to provide a new definition of added value, making it possible for individual researchers or individual teams in any EU Member State to compete with all other researchers on the basis of excellence."
"That is the real mission of the European Research Council, which must be independent in its scientific evaluations, autonomous in its operation and adequately funded."
"In this connection, I call on the Commission to present a clear, precise proposal regarding the structure and composition of the European Research Council governing bodies as soon as possible."
"The report pays particular attention to the subject of human resources, which are the EU’s real strength."
"In this respect, we have to create the right conditions so that European researchers can best express themselves. It is essential to foster mobility among researchers and to make that a widespread practice at all career stages."
"Two-way mobility between companies, universities and research centres, the harmonisation of working conditions and career structures and the creation of Europe-wide infrastructure are essential conditions for creating a fertile research environment."
"To achieve these aims, I call for the Marie Curie actions to be strengthened, as they have proved to be effective and to encourage mobility in the scientific world."
"Still on the subject of human resources, I should like to point to the need to promote women’s access to the research sector, as well as their careers."
"We want to see a greater presence of women at all levels, including the highest, and we also want gender research."
"The future of research and of Europe also depends on our ability to make science more attractive to young people."
"A closer link between educational courses and scientific careers is a precondition for us to have the numbers of researchers needed for the success of the Lisbon Strategy."
"Another chapter in the report concerns technology transfer."
"The seventh Framework Programme should devote special attention to technology transfer, thus coordinating Europe’s research policy with its industrial policy."
"Technology platforms and joint technology initiatives are vital mechanisms for achieving this objective."
"At the same time, funding needs to be increased for instruments aimed specifically at small and medium-sized enterprises, which also require the streamlining of project selection criteria and of bureaucracy in general, which has often been an obstacle preventing SMEs from taking part in research programmes."
"On this last point, I believe the recommendations included in the Marimon and Ormala reports should be adopted, and not only in relation to SMEs."
"To conclude, I should like to touch briefly on thematic priorities, without going into the merits of individual arguments."
"I think it should be emphasised that these thematic priorities reflect the strategic priorities of the Lisbon Agenda."
"In this context, I should like to make it clear that to implement the Lisbon Agenda we need to adopt a different approach to spending compared with the past."
"We must move on from a model of diffuse provision of aid – what in Italy is called ‘’ – to a model that prioritises spending on investments that have a multiplying effect, that is, an effect of reinforcing growth."
"Lastly, I would stress that Parliament must not make concessions on research funds, and I hope that the Commission will be on Parliament’s side in this battle."
". Mr President, there could hardly be a better day than today, when this House has expressed its position on the mid-term review of Lisbon, to take up the issue of the future of European research policy."
"Let me thank Mrs Locatelli, the rapporteur, in particular, and all the committee members for the fruitful and intense cooperation demonstrated during this first month of our work together."
"I would also like to thank everyone present at this late hour for their real interest in and commitment to future European research policy."
"The Commission attaches a great deal of importance to the adoption of the Locatelli report."
"It constitutes the European Parliament’s formal position on our June communication and, what is more, will pave the way for preparing the Commission’s proposal on the new framework programme to be adopted on 6 April 2005."
"Before highlighting what I consider to be the key elements of the Locatelli report, I would like to share with you some thoughts about the general context of European research and our plans for the Seventh Framework Programme."
"Even if some of you heard this during the plenary debate on the question of the financing of FP7 two weeks ago, the context is clear."
"We want and need to relaunch the Lisbon Strategy."
"The intensive discussion this morning on the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy has allowed us to take the measure of the challenges ahead."
"Europe cannot compete on the basis of cheap labour or low social standards."
"We cannot compete on the back of our environment."
"We do not have the natural resources to sustain our prosperity; we only have our brains, intelligence and creativity."
"Knowledge, in the broader sense, is our strongest factor of competitiveness in the global, fiercely competitive market place."
"In Europe, we need to become much better at producing knowledge through research, diffusing knowledge through education, and using and applying knowledge through innovation."
"That means that the knowledge triangle of research, education and innovation must function within favourable framework conditions, which reward the knowledge that is put to work."
"The Commission is already working hard to develop such framework conditions for knowledge and innovation."
"For example, we will come forward later this year with a revision of the state aid regime, work on fiscal incentives for research and development and innovation, guidelines on cooperation between industry and universities, re-evaluation of the profession of European researchers, and other actions."
"Only knowledge-based growth can leverage the resources that we need to sustain the cost of the inclusive society, with the high levels of care and protection that Europeans aspire to."
"Building the knowledge society is thus probably the best and maybe the only way to sustain the European model of society, without having to make a trade-off between economic growth, social cohesion and environmental protection."
"It is in this same Lisbon context that I will present our proposals for the Seventh Framework Programme."
"As some of you rightly stated during our debate on the oral question on the research budget in Strasbourg two weeks ago, FP7 needs to be the framework programme for the Lisbon Strategy."
"I could not agree more."
"I want it to be the programme for the growth and job strategy."
"The duration of the programme will be seven years, as in the case of the next financial perspectives."
"But given that we envisage a mid-term review, this allows us more stability, but also more flexibility."
"Both are needed."
"As regards the structure, there will be more emphasis on themes and less on instruments."
"Cooperation projects, formerly known as collaborative research, will be more focused on industry needs and will therefore be more supportive of growth."
"I hope that you will all appreciate this new approach."
"There will be a strong focus on ideas, with actions concerning frontier research in the context of the European Research Council."
"The ‘people’ part of FP7 will strengthen the existing and well-appreciated mobility actions under Marie Curie."
"The ‘capacities’ part will deal with infrastructures, SMEs, regions, the research potential of all Member States, as well as science, society and international cooperation."
"As regards the management of the funds, which are to double, I am fully aware of the challenges ahead."
"But with their simplification and rationalisation on the one hand, and modernised management as well as externalisation of some of the activities – such as the European Research Council, SMEs and the mobility actions – on the other, we are prepared to rise to this challenge."
"Turning to the Locatelli report itself, a report that will make a significant contribution to the success of the forthcoming framework programme, allow me, firstly, to express my sincere gratitude for all the support you have given until now for the proposed doubling of funds for FP7."
"This is fully in line with the Commission’s proposal for the next financial perspective and firmly defends the proposal to set the EU budget above 1% of GDP."
"Let me make a personal comment here."
"I really appreciate this support."
"It is crucial."
"Together we have a real chance to start changing the structure of the European budget in favour of more growth- and competitiveness-orientated actions."
"The financial perspective debate will thus be the moment of truth for the European Union."
"It will be then, and not later, that we must demonstrate that we are ready to address the challenges ahead of us fully."
"We should not miss this opportunity to prove that we are ready to invest in the future rather than look to the past."
"Second, you rightly ask for simpler and clearer administrative procedures in order to improve efficiency and reduce the costs for participants, in particular SMEs and small actors."
"I have underlined the importance of simplification on several occasions, starting with the hearing last autumn, and I did not forget the message I was given two weeks ago in this plenary."
"We have been told since FP4 that there will be simplification."
"It is time to do something."
"The Commission will do all in its power to achieve this and I look to Parliament to support it."
"Third, let me thank you for your support for the swift establishment of the European Research Council: I am using your exact wording."
"Let me underline two fundamental principles that I intend to strive for vigorously: autonomy and scientific excellence."
"I wish to assure you of my determination to guarantee this autonomy."
"Furthermore, autonomy will be the best guarantor of the highest level of scientific excellence, which should be the sole criterion for the selection of the proposed projects."
"What is more, the ERC needs to support at European level research in all scientific fields, from specific industry-driven research to social and human sciences."
"The EU needs high-level researchers in all research fields in order to grow and compete with the USA, Japan and other strong parties."
"In terms of the structure of the ERC, our current view is that an executive agency would be best placed to support such a council."
"Let me assure you that we are examining all possible options, including those based on a more mid-term approach, and will inform you of our decision in due course."
"Fourth, the report is fully aligned with the Commission’s intention in recommending a substantial increase of funding for Marie Curie actions and welcoming the Commission’s proposal for European technology platforms and joint technology initiatives."
"As you know, this will be an important part of the forthcoming proposal for the framework programme."
"Europe is weak in public and private partnerships, and this needs to be sorted out."
"Focusing the efforts of all the stakeholders around a few well-identified key technologies is of the utmost importance, and this is what we intend to do."
"Finally, the report puts great emphasis on the regional dimension, by underlining the need for the participation of regions in order to increase investment in research and innovation."
"Let me add that the Structural Funds and European research policy share common objectives."
"The link between the regional dimension and FP7 is important in the sense that they should be mutually reinforcing."
"Parliament is fully justified in drawing attention to this requirement."
"Let me conclude by saying that I consider the Locatelli report a strong encouragement to my current preparations for the FP7 proposal."
"I am happy to note that on all key issues we very much follow the same line."
"This is an encouraging signal for the legislative process ahead of us."
"I trust you will send a strong signal tomorrow in your vote on the Locatelli report."
"We need this strong signal."
"It would, and should, be widely heard."
"It would be an echo of the support you broadly expressed during the debate earlier today for renewed efforts for Lisbon, and an echo of our mutual readiness and determination to really deliver."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow rapporteur for the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Locatelli, for her work and I should above all like to congratulate her on successfully achieving a collective effort in the best possible spirit of collaboration, creating a firm foundation for us to continue to work together on the European research policy while awaiting the now imminent arrival of the seventh Framework Programme."
"Research, which President Barroso has indicated to be one of the priorities of the revamped Lisbon Strategy, is the tool on which the knowledge-based society is founded."
"It is not just a strategic step but also an essential one for closing Europe’s competitive gap in terms of innovation and, consequently, economic growth, employment and sustainable development."
"In order to catch up quickly, we have to invest greater resources, to the extent of doubling the funds available compared with the previous Framework Programme."
"Even then, that is not enough."
"In the context of the most ambitious objective, which is to provide the scientific community, industry and European society in general with the tools needed to strengthen and improve our research capacity, we need above all to use the funds better, with the aim of creating real centres of excellence that can attract our researchers, who are all too often forced to emigrate abroad."
"Consolidating the European Research Area is important not only for our researchers and for their mobility, but also to attract investment, both public and private, European and non-European."
"That is a target that can be met primarily by directing resources towards traditionally strategic sectors for the European Union."
"With this report, Parliament hopes for thematic continuity with the sixth Framework Programme and an enhanced spirit of transnational collaboration."
"The European Research Area must be the catalyst for private investment."
"In addition, great emphasis has been placed on small and medium-sized enterprises, precisely because of the particular industrial structure of our economy, which is predominantly characterised by an industrial fabric made up of productive areas that are unable to develop independent research projects."
"It therefore becomes essential to strengthen the dialogue that SMEs or associations of SMEs have with our universities and with the many European centres of excellence."
"Such a dialogue should lead to a more effective and fruitful transfer of technology."
"The proposal to set up a European Research Council must be seen in this context."
"I support its aims, which include guiding basic research and guaranteeing not only its suitability but also its quality."
"I have, however, expressed my doubts both about the potential overlap with the remit of other European coordination bodies and institutes and about the funds to be devoted to setting up and running the Council itself."
"Mr President, I shall finish by issuing the common challenge that research must become a real beacon of European competitiveness, a real action plan."
"If Europe does not make this choice, it runs the risk of being regarded as a weary, lumbering colossus, a continent that gets bogged down in talk and all too often bends its strategies to the individual interests of its Member States."
"I hope that this will be the decade of research, just as the last one was the decade of the single market."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my thanks go to the rapporteur, Mrs Locatelli, for her excellent work."
"It is hard to believe that she has only just arrived here in Parliament."
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists strongly supports the report and appreciates the work that has been done so well."
"Research is the key to implementing the Lisbon objectives."
"We do not have natural resources here in Europe: our natural resources are in our heads."
"That is why this is a crucial area."
"There is a problem with basic research and technology platforms, collaborations and especially financing."
"It is sensible to finance European research when it produces genuine European added value."
"Accordingly, it is hardly appropriate to finance very small individual projects in the field of basic research."
"Instead, support should go to projects that are too broad, complex or risky for one single Member State to fund."
"In the context of the technology platforms, the concept of cooperation with regard to new industrial research, the assumption that the private sector would put up two-thirds of the costs is not realistic in all cases."
"Private agencies and institutions will hardly be prepared to provide such a large share of the funding of organisations that have their sights on the distant future and technological revolution."
"Examples might be hydrotechnology and nanotechnology."
"In the countries that are the Union’s major competitors, such as the United States of America and Japan, the share of public funding in these sectors is as much as 80%."
"We cannot possibly afford to give the competitive edge to outsiders in this way."
"We therefore have to be ready, if necessary, to use public funds to subsidise projects which may only be of potential benefit in the long term."
"Consequently, the rules governing State aid should be reformed."
"Secondly, research and development must be made to benefit the SME sector."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises do not have the funds for sophisticated research."
"They are flexible, however, and can use the results of research and development work, and this might be the key to solving our unemployment problem."
"There are 19 million SMEs and we have 16 million unemployed."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should particularly like to thank Commissioner Potočnik for his words, which I feel are extremely important."
"As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, of course I also thank my colleague Mrs Locatelli for her hard work and collaboration."
"This document highlights three key elements in the forthcoming Framework Programme for research, which are the European Research Council, the new priority thematic areas for research and the technological platforms."
"Parliament thus recognises that basic research has an importance that transcends the Member States and requires a response at EU level, within the rationale of the Lisbon Strategy."
"Hence we need to promote a genuine development policy through specific research instruments, such as technology platforms, financed above all by private enterprise but also by public institutions, Member States, regions and local bodies."
"Research thus becomes an instrument, a core around which a general political proposal for economic and social development can be brought to maturity, alongside a monetary policy which is already in place."
"Private enterprises, particularly small and medium-sized ones, will thus be able to meet their research needs in order to become more competitive."
"These are strong, decisive new factors that will give European companies fresh impetus, supporting new sectors and innovation while also ensuring that conventional productive activities have a competitive edge."
"By setting out these guidelines, Parliament is stating that it does not want to stand idly by and watch the deindustrialisation of Europe take place, and it is spurring the Commission and the Council to commit themselves more specifically to developing European research."
"This programme is the core of a development policy."
"It is pointless to think of changing the Stability Pact, which would just be a palliative measure, while the real cure is an economic and social development policy at European Union level."
". – (Mr President, I would like to say how grateful I am to Commissioner Potočnik for his openness and willingness to engage in dialogue, and to Mrs Locatelli and all the members of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, who have been very constructive and positive in their work on this subject."
"I understand that petrol prices have now reached USD 55 per barrel."
"According to the financial analysts, petrol prices are not likely to fall in the foreseeable future, which constitutes a threat to the economy."
"We need some pretty rapid responses."
"We need dynamic responses which will produce results within the next few years."
"The Group considers that these responses need to be contained within the Seventh Framework Programme in terms of investment in energy efficiency and in renewable energy sources, both of which will help resolve the situation in the short term."
"We are concerned about the priority being given to the hazardous energy sources of the past, such as nuclear energy, which are vulnerable to abuse by international terrorists."
"We are also uneasy about the massive investment focus on energy programmes like Fusion ITER, which will not provide a single kilowatt of energy in the next 40 or 50 years according to the scientists involved."
"We would like the Seventh Framework Programme to improve quality of life and the social environment, public health, preventative health, to benefit sustainable urban transport and promote the social science required to provide a balanced overview of research and of the society we are creating."
"With this in mind, Commissioner Potočnik, we are glad that you recognise the importance of social science."
"I believe that in the future – and this is my last point – research will be very important, if that science is open and accessible to the general public and the scientific community."
". –Mr President, Commissioner, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has drafted a committee-initiative report on European research policy."
"It is like a shopping list."
"The European Parliament is prepared to buy the results of scientific research in these areas."
"My main message is this: our group is in favour of guaranteeing additional resources for scientific research work."
"The Commission’s proposal for additional funds under the Seventh Framework Programme is justified."
"There are fields which it would be beneficial to finance from common funds."
"It should not be just business that derives the benefit."
"There are many socio-political and ethical reasons for supporting basic research at university research institutes, which is unconstrained by the interests of big business and the war industry."
"Joint research projects can be promoted in the best way if they lead to results for which the English would use the word ‘serendipity’."
"It means to find something by chance that you did not even know you were looking for."
"The right conditions for serendipityhave to be created, and those conditions are established best in international collaboration."
"The best example of a benefit jointly achieved through a jointly financed project is fusion energy research under the ITER project."
"That is an area in which the Greens confuse fission with fusion."
"No EU country would be prepared to undertake research into fusion alone."
"When there is collaboration, projects start up that would not otherwise."
"All participants can reap the benefits that result."
"In the case of ITER, the beneficiaries include countries not in the EU."
"We have to use the research framework programme to create the right conditions for ‘serendipity’."
"– Mr President, whenever we take a stand on various issues in this Chamber, we must always justify whether these issues should really be decided at EU level."
"The principle of subsidiarity is not something merely to be referred to in formal contexts, but rather should direct all our activities."
"We all know that that is not how it works at all in Brussels and Strasbourg."
"Political power is continually being shifted from the Member States to the institutions of the EU."
"There are two driving forces behind this: the desire for a superstate, and a lack of political principle."
"A majority of the EU’s elected representatives and of its civil servants want to create a new superstate."
"For them, the principle of subsidiarity is not a guiding principle but rather an obstacle in their way."
"Lack of political principle means that the Members of the House are more often than not prepared to cooperate with decisions that are to their liking, even when it is obvious that these are strictly national matters."
"The end is allowed to justify the means."
"Mrs Locatelli’s report, too, entirely neglects the principle of subsidiarity."
"It does not put the question of what the EU should do when the Member States are unable to deal with a task themselves."
"The question it asks is how the EU can drive forward the research that an establishment wishes to have."
"How are we to deal with small and medium-sized enterprises’ need for research?"
"How are we to awaken the interest of young people and women in science?"
"How are we to strengthen the links between research and industry?"
"How are we to increase total research funding to three per cent of GDP? And so on."
"These are all things that the Member States themselves are better equipped to deal with."
"Finland and Sweden now already set aside three percent of GDP for research."
"If other countries want to set aside the same amount, they only have to do so."
"The research funds will not increase as a result of the Member States sending it via EU authorities."
"On the contrary, this will result in increased bureaucracy and additional costs."
"Competition between countries to find good solutions to this type of problem normally results in faster progress than central management at higher levels."
"In the research world, this is known as institutional competition."
"Competition is important not just between enterprises, but also between institutions."
"Competition between countries in various areas is one of the most important explanations for the great progress made by the Western world in recent centuries."
"Mrs Locatelli should therefore have asked the question: what can EU institutions do for research in Europe that the countries cannot do themselves?"
"There are many such questions."
"They fall into five categories, these being basic research, free movement of research staff within the EU, large-scale research in areas such as nuclear energy and space technology, infrastructure for research networks and common security issues for the EU."
"The EU’s research policy should be limited to areas such as these, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity that is fêted in banquet speeches and draft constitutions."
"EU research policy is on the wrong track."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, neither investment in science and research nor the Lisbon Strategy as a whole are goals in themselves."
"This means that a great deal of care should be taken when drafting resolutions on science and technology."
"I should like to thank Mrs Locatelli and express my admiration for the effort she has put into preparing this report."
"It is clear that, on its own, the announcement that a European Research Area is to be established will change little."
"The announcement will need to be backed up by appropriate funding for science and research, which means that no cuts should be made to the EU budget."
"The funds will also need to be used in a rational manner, and this is a point I should particularly like to stress."
"There are a number of issues I would like to touch upon very briefly."
"Firstly, effective methods must be developed to identify talented young people and appropriate systems put in place to provide scholarships."
"Secondly, accreditation standards for Higher Education institutions ought to be implemented according to the guidelines adopted in Berlin in 2003."
"Thirdly, a simpler system should be introduced for awarding academic promotion, whilst ensuring that the criteria for granting grades and qualifications continue to be transparent."
"Fourthly, more extensive use should be made of private sector funding, both for applied and basic scientific research and for research in the humanities, as mentioned by the Commissioner."
"Mrs Locatelli said that life would be made easier for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"That may well be the case, but how can measures aimed at introducing software patents be reconciled with such a statement?"
"Someone once said that knowledge is power, yet given the state of the world today, it must unfortunately be added that ignorance does not mean a lack of power."
"I thank you."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the New Italian Socialist Party."
"First of all, I must congratulate Mrs Locatelli on her excellent work."
"The problems of the European Union’s competitiveness in relation to the new Asian giants, the drain of our best brains to horizons richer in opportunities, the difficulty in meeting the Lisbon targets in terms of employment, development and innovation, and the issues of energy supply and health – these are the subjects that fill our time in Parliament and on which the future of our economy and our social system depends."
"These topics are closely linked to each other, and their common denominator is the development of scientific and technological research."
"Research actually means knowledge, employment and economic development, as well as a better quality of life."
"It is therefore essential to obtain a substantial increase in funding to make it our strong point."
"Research, however, is not just a matter of funds, instruments and infrastructure."
"Research is done by people."
"Any economic effort made by the European Union and the Member States will in fact be in vain without suitable human capital."
"I am not alluding to quality, since our universities and our graduates are already the best in the world, but I am referring to jobs: opportunities to do research and to earn money."
"Paradoxically, while science and technology play an ever more decisive role in today’s global economy, young people are avoiding science subjects because of the limited job opportunities."
"As a result, many graduates are forced to leave Europe or to spend years living on grants that are totally inadequate for the current cost of living, while they wait for a stroke of luck."
"In recent years the number of young Europeans who choose to carry on studying science subjects has declined."
"European universities do not have enough staff in their science departments to replace lecturers reaching the end of their careers, and fewer and fewer science and technology graduates find work as researchers compared with their main competitors in Europe."
"We must at all costs reverse this trend, bring our young people into contact with science from an early age, stimulate their curiosity and above all enable not just the fortunate few but all those who deserve it to use their knowledge to serve Europe, by offering them work, careers and decent salaries in exchange."
"If we want a future based on knowledge, we have to invest in our young people in order to train them and, above all, not to lose them."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my love of research is the only reason why I am present at this evening’s late-night sitting, as I must admit that I would rather have watched Bayern Munich play Arsenal in the Champions League."
"I too should like to start by expressing my wholehearted thanks to the rapporteur."
"Not only has Mrs Locatelli presented a fine report, but she has also demonstrated a willingness to compromise."
"A unanimous vote by this House tomorrow in favour of this report will both send out a signal and provide our Research Commissioner with the backing he needs."
"This morning we spent a long time discussing the Lisbon Strategy."
"The only way to make Europe competitive is to invest huge amounts in research and development in the future."
"The Commissioner frequently refers to a ‘moment of truth’, and I believe that he is right to do so."
"We must ensure that the research budget is large enough for us to achieve the Lisbon goal at long last."
"This will not be enough on its own, of course."
"Public funding is a good thing, but we must also encourage private industry and the private sector to invest heavily in research and development, and to make money available for this purpose."
"I was delighted to hear you say earlier this evening that you are planning to issue guidelines particularly aimed at improving cooperation between research and industry in this respect."
"I should like to make one more point, one that I have raised in this House on a number of occasions, and to which you too have referred."
"It is pointless to increase funding unless this money is then spent on research in a truly efficient manner."
"It is also crucial that the correct lessons be learned from the Sixth Research Framework Programme, from the Marimon report and from the criticism that has been levelled at the Framework Programme."
"Programmes must be made simpler, more streamlined and less bureaucratic, and I would call on the Commission and on Parliament to do their homework on this matter."
"We must ensure that small and medium-sized enterprises are also successfully involved in European research."
"I look forward to the rest of the debate."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to congratulate Mrs Locatelli on her excellent work."
"I think that our debates over the past few months on the shape of European research policy and the objectives of the Seventh Framework Programme have been very productive, and I am sure they will have lasting benefits for science in Europe."
"We have clarified key objectives with a view to achieving longer-term European Union targets; we have also analysed the instruments available for meeting those objectives, and proposed some new instruments."
"If we want to meet the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy and the Barcelona Summit and to reflect the recommendations made in the Kok Report, the Seventh Framework Programme must include a clear and proportionate increase in resources within the scope of the new financial perspectives."
"In order to achieve these objectives and create a European Research Area we also need good coordination both at Member State and Union level to ensure that funding and activities are complementary and generate a multiplier effect."
"If we are to comply with the Lisbon Strategy, we also need to support excellent basic research as the driving force for technological development, growth and competitiveness."
"This entails making Europe more attractive to top researchers, from young and women researchers to highly-qualified scientists currently working abroad, and encouraging SME participation in every single thematic priority, in transnational collaborations, and in technology programmes through proportionate project funding and instruments tailored to their needs."
"We are all agreed on this much – for which I again congratulate the rapporteur."
"Other slightly more controversial issues will require further discussion."
"For example, research priorities, which we believe should be extended to include other new priorities with major economic potential for the European Union, such as scientific research."
"Mr President, this shows us that science and research last in the long run."
"I will continue in Swedish."
"Mr President, the resolution that we have adopted adds European value to both research policy and economic development."
"The entire resolution on the Lisbon Strategy that has been adopted by Parliament today with a very large majority – and which we in the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have put a lot of work into – is based on the knowledge that sustainable development is based not just on economic growth, but also on social cohesion and environmental considerations."
"The research policy and the report that we are discussing today will help build sustainable economic growth through investment in excellence and technology platforms and will help create the social cohesion that we desire – for example between men and women, from a gender perspective, as well as between different regions."
"Moreover, they will help generate the funds needed for our security system and ensure that we can continue working on technological development that is driven by the environment."
"I am pleased that this work is just as balanced as the Lisbon resolution adopted, and I look forward to the framework programme."
"Mr President, it is difficult to overstate the importance of this debate in the current hand-wringing over the Lisbon Agenda."
"The reality is that if we do not invest in research and, more importantly, involve the business community in that research process, we will not upscale our economies."
"The pan-Union coordination adds a clear value."
"So it is all the sadder that the Commission proposals – which I broadly support – are under threat from my own UK Government, with its insistence on cuts to the EU budget and with little detail on where the axe should fall."
"I support the broad thrust of this report and would add my words of congratulation to the rapporteur, with the rest of the House."
"I have some reservations about the details and I hope that our amendments will strengthen the report tomorrow."
"I would, in supporting the Commission, particularly stress the importance of simplifying the procedures in FP7, because the message I have heard loud and clear from Scotland is that the administration and the bureaucracy have been major off-putting factors in previous framework programmes."
"From what the Commissioner has said this evening, I think that message has been received loud and clear, although I look forward to receiving his actual proposals."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, exactly 27 years ago today – and incidentally also during a night shift – when I was preparing to return from an orbit around the Earth, following a research mission to the space station Salyut 6 that lasted over a week, I would never have dreamt that all these years later I would be able to speak about the future development of science and research in Europe before a House such as this one, and in the process maybe even to play an active role in this development."
"I should therefore like to praise the efforts of all those involved, and especially Mrs Locatelli, as she has done a very good job of drafting her report, and this is why I intend to vote in favour of it during tomorrow’s vote."
"A further reason why I intend to do so is that the draft report is quite clear on the significance of space exploration and the role space research will play for the future Europe, or, more accurately, for its citizens."
"It is my belief that backing must also be given to projects such as the Galileo or GMS Programme, because I know from my own experience that projects of this kind give rise to opportunities in a number of other related fields, and offer the chance of hundreds, if not thousands, of new jobs."
"The ITER programme should also provide such backing for the energy industry, as mentioned by my colleague."
"I should like to draw a comparison to conclude my speech."
"It may well be that we are on the threshold of decisions similar to those once taken by the Spanish kings when they decided whether or not to support Christopher Columbus’ project."
"In modern terms, his voyage was a scientific experiment to confirm that the Earth was round, yet it not only changed the map of the world – it influenced everything that has happened in the world since then."
"I thank you."
"Mr President, although I can see that scientific research is both beneficial and necessary, it remains to be seen whether the approach adopted in the Locatelli report is the most efficient way to achieve a more innovative Europe."
"Firstly, how effective can measures at European level be if it is the Member States that have powers and responsibilities in the relevant fields?"
"In the report, it is proposed that activities that take place in the Member States should be co-funded with EU resources."
"This proposal would provide EU funding for students, research institutes and facilities, as well as communication with the public about the importance of science; areas that the Member States promote many times more effectively, and so there are more effective ways of spending European funds in this area; consider how much of the red-tape and administrative burden could be cut in international cooperation and in the mobility of researchers."
"Secondly, the Commission communication on research policy guidelines lacks, to my mind, a strategic statement about research that is punishable in the Member States."
"Surely it is unacceptable for Community funds to be used to support such research?"
"Research involving the destruction of human embryos springs to mind."
"If Community funding used for such contentious research, this means that Member States will not benefit equally from the European research initiatives."
"Can the Commissioner express a view on this?"
"Finally, the ambition of the European institutions to make their mark in the field of research does not necessarily lead to more and better research in Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report obviously deserves our praise, as it is high time that such crucial issues were raised."
"We should also welcome the fact that these issues are being discussed in relation to the Lisbon Strategy."
"Yet I am afraid that this report will share the fate of the Lisbon Strategy, which failed to distinguish between economic and social goals."
"Consequently neither is achieved, even though both are crucial."
"We are all aware that the economy is flagging and that unemployment is on the rise."
"Yet scientific goals are unfortunately conflated with ideological goals in this report."
"I find it entirely incomprehensible that the report notes on three occasions that there is a particular need to promote the role of women in science."
"It is self-evident that professorships should be granted to those who have the qualifications needed to hold such positions."
"We can do our best to ensure that women gain these qualifications, but it is nonsensical to promote them by force if they do not."
"Furthermore, I must say that I was surprised to see that research on animals was the only area of scientific research mentioned in any detail."
"I am a great lover of animals, but this report is not the right place to deal with this issue to the exclusion of all others."
"I also find it unacceptable that ceilings are to be imposed on expenditure by the poorer countries."
"Poorer countries have traditionally benefited from the achievements of richer countries, and this should continue to be the case."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a French proverb that says that ‘he who grasps at too much loses everything’."
"If too many goals are set, too little will be achieved, and we should take a clear and detailed look at this issue."
"Many thanks, Mr President."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rapid growth experienced by Asian countries and the United States has presented Europe with a major economic challenge."
"This means that faster economic growth based on science and new technologies is needed in the European Union."
"A coherent research policy should be formulated to provide support for the latter."
"The report sets out the key areas of research for the EU as a whole."
"In view of the huge differences in the research potential of the various Member States and regions, particular attention should be paid to poor countries and regions, which lack the necessary resources but which have enormous human potential, in order to ensure cohesion between Member States and harmonised development."
"Certain groups have expressed the view that there is no point investing in science if the necessary resources are lacking, and steps should be taken to prove this view wrong."
"Special attention should therefore be paid to research policy in the countries and regions in question, in order to prevent the gap in intellectual ability and development opportunities widening instead of narrowing."
"The guidelines for EU research policy included in the report’s motion for a resolution highlight the key areas for the development of research."
"This is entirely correct, but the development of science and technology throughout the EU should not be neglected."
"I thank you."
"Mr President, Mrs Locatelli, I should like to thank you for your excellent work, and I should also like to thank our shadow rapporteur, Mr Brunetta."
"We are all aware that we face a huge challenge in achieving the Lisbon goals."
"Our aim is to spend 3% of GDP on research, of which two thirds should come from the private sector."
"Put quite simply, if we demand this of industry, we should be aware that 50% of gross national income is generated by small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Even more importantly, two thirds of all employees work for small and medium-sized enterprises, or in other words for companies with fewer than 250 employees."
"The Sixth Framework Programme set a goal of 15%, which figure the major horizontal projects did not, in the end, achieve, even though the energy programmes were heavily oversubscribed."
"I should therefore like to ask Commissioner Potočnik to consider ways in which research activities can be prioritised in the field of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I believe that it is also necessary to determine at long last where the responsibility lies for efficiency and evaluation in the field of academic research."
"Research generates know-how and values, and this process must be measured and evaluated."
"Greater transparency is needed, and I would specifically ask that an -Research Programme be established."
"We must ask ourselves how the simplest possible methods can be made available on the Internet for submitting applications to research programmes and providing funding for these programmes, and how we can ensure that the Commission also complies with the Late Payment Directive, which is applied in all other fields, but which the Commission has so far refused to accept."
"We need top-quality automated processes and better instruments to make research findings more widely available."
"Mr President, I should first of all like to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Locatelli, who has tabled an excellent and interesting report."
"Research in the Seventh Framework Programme is important to us, certainly in the framework of the Lisbon Strategy."
"A good working relationship between research centres and industry is essential."
"I should like to make three points."
"Firstly, it goes without saying that science should be autonomous, but that is not the same as being noncommittal."
"Scientific priorities are not a pastime for scientists; they must be issue-driven."
"I fully share Mr Hammerstein Mintz’s view that the public research agenda must be guided by social problems."
"The second point is the unnecessary red –tape, which has been mentioned before."
"It turned out too often that the chances of success in the Sixth Framework Programme were very minimal compared to the efforts that were being made."
"Certainly for small businesses and small institutions, it is a well-nigh impossible task to complete the paperwork and answer the questions."
"That is why we would ask for a two-step procedure, consisting of a brief description of the research project, followed by a selection procedure, so that the participants in the second round have reasonable certainty that their proposal will actually be accepted."
"Thirdly, I would urge you to combine forces."
"European research funds continue to be only a fraction of national budgets."
"Article 169 offers the opportunity of combining forces."
"We have already gathered experience in the area of clinical tests for developmental diseases."
"We can use this experience to carry out joint research into such things as the introduction of a low-CO2 economy, into hydrogen cells, and into improving energy efficiency."
"A bundling of forces is also what society wants, and that is what we have to work towards."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report; it is now up to you, Commissioner Potočnik, and your fellow Commissioners to ensure that the research priorities are implemented."
"I should like to focus on just one of these priorities, which in all probability will be absent from tomorrow’s report, namely defence research."
"After consulting the rest of my group, I have withdrawn an amendment on this matter in view of the confusion it could have caused, in connection with the Council."
"Why have I decided to speak out in favour of defence research?"
"Our future Constitution provides for the development of the common foreign and security policy, which means that we will need to carry out research in this field, some of which will be secret."
"We must therefore be capable of copying the Americans by adopting a ‘black box’ approach to individual projects."
"Yet we should step up transatlantic research cooperation in other fields where research lies in the interests of humanity as a whole."
"This will give rise to a research dialogue between equals that would be appropriate in the case of a number of other countries, as well as the USA."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"I should like to congratulate Mrs Locatelli on having drafted an excellent report, and to thank Commissioner Potočnik for joining us."
"In my opinion, the majority of those present in the Chamber are former researchers, and that this is why we share the same views."
"It is my belief that Commissioner Potočnik has never worked in the field of research, however, and can therefore adopt a more distanced and somewhat less passionate approach to our proposals."
"I hope that this will provide a good outcome."
"I should like to point out that the current Sixth Framework Programme is the first in the European Union’s history to have been drafted and implemented within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy."
"There is another new feature to the Seventh Framework Programme, however, as it has been drafted and will be implemented after enlargement, with the involvement of the ten new Member States."
"How can we use this enlargement to ensure that our science policy is effective and to implement the Lisbon Strategy, and what can the ten new Member States offer the EU as a whole?"
"They can offer it three things, namely a highly-educated population whose knowledge is often wasted, lower research costs and a thirst for success after half a century of isolation from Western civilisation and development opportunities."
"How can we make the most of these opportunities, and how can we improve the way we exploit the research potential of the new Member States?"
"I have five proposals."
"Excellence should not be the only criterion used when determining funding priorities, and additional criteria should be considered in order to make it possible for research centres in the new Member States to be integrated."
"These centres have had limited opportunities to implement European research programmes in the past."
"Secondly, we are counting on smaller projects being approved, as our research centres are also smaller."
"Thirdly, procedures need to be made simpler."
"The new Member States are inexperienced in dealing with complicated procedures, and they find them a major burden."
"We are hoping that clear and transparent rules will be put in place to govern investment in research infrastructures in the new Member States."
"Fifthly and finally, integration also means a common market and full freedom of movement for persons and services."
"Until this is achieved, we will not be able to boost research or succeed with the Lisbon Strategy."
"I thank you."
"Mr President, who could possibly disagree that the tool for promoting growth and competitiveness in Europe is a sustainable research and development policy?"
"It is not a choice; it has become a necessity."
"Europe has already lost its pole position to Japan and America."
"The aim that we are promoting, that is, 3% of GDP within a period of five years, is ambitious."
"We are also stating that two-thirds of that funding is to come from the private sector – let us hope."
"But as with everything in life, it all depends on money."
"This is where the general discussion on the budget comes in."
"However, we must realise that if we do not invest, the rich will become less rich and the poor will become poorer."
"The policy of investment in research and development is not a matter of choice."
"As I said, it has become a necessity."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking Mrs Locatelli both for her careful work and her truly exemplary cooperation with all sides."
"I wish in my intervention to emphasise and confine myself to one amendment."
"In particular, we all know that we are living in an age of uncertainty and increased mass risks, especially environmental risks."
"The recent catastrophic tsunami in South-East Asia should have convinced even the most incredulous among us that there is an immediate and urgent need to fortify our continent against this sort of catastrophic natural disaster."
"The scientists who study these phenomena come from many and varied sectors: seismologists, geologists, oceanologists, forestry experts and others."
"I believe that it is very important for the safety and welfare of European citizens for strong momentum to be given to these areas of research, especially as they appear to be converging continuously and increasingly into a risk and crisis management model."
"That is why I think that we should make special reference to natural dangers."
"An amendment to this effect has been tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats;"
"I refer to Amendment 8. An additional reason for this, no less important, is its link with the Lisbon Strategy."
"In fact, both the Commission communication on the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy and the resolution we adopted today emphasise the importance of eco-innovation to sustainable development in Europe."
"This means that, in the revised Lisbon Strategy, environmental technologies and high environmental standards will hold an important position."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the amendment we are proposing does not simply set out yet another thematic priority; it aims to make express reference to a research sector which comes within the philosophy of the revised Lisbon Strategy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, research and innovation are the key to solving a great many of the problems Europe faces."
"This is something that has been highlighted on a number of occasions, as has the fact that our aim is to increase funding."
"I should merely like to point out that the road ahead of us is a rocky one."
"Delighted though I am that Parliament and the Commission are agreed on the need for increased funding, I really am extremely concerned at the signals coming out of the Member States."
"As an example, I find it intolerable that the current government of Germany, my own country, has put forward official proposals to the finance ministers aimed at reducing the amount of money the EU spends each year on research in the European Union. This is the precise opposite of what we ought to be doing."
"Although we agree, then, on the need to aim for increased funding, I do believe that we should nevertheless bear in mind that a great deal of money still comes from the national research budgets, and that the Member States should increase these."
"At present 5% of funding comes from the Commission and 95% from the national research budgets. Although the Commission may one day provide 10% of funding and the Member States 90%, this ratio is unlikely to change substantially."
"It follows that European added value must be our main concern when selecting our priorities, and I would therefore ask you to vote in favour of Amendment 7 by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"I should, however, like to make it clear that I do not share the view of Mr Lundgren, who is unfortunately no longer present, that the measures taken to date have barely provided any European added value."
"There is a great deal for Europe to do; having studied medicine myself, I know that in this field alone European cooperation is needed, in particular in the fight against rare diseases and children’s diseases, and indeed to achieve any kind of success. We must therefore provide greater support for such cooperation."
"The 21st century will be the century of science, research, and technical development."
"The document before us starts from the recognition of that, and sees correctly that the EU needs the utmost effort in this field, so that it can stand its ground against ever fiercer competition."
"Because of this I hold this report as something to be supported."
"Allow me, however, in the short time at my disposal, to bring a worry to your attention."
"Perhaps not too far from this topic is a quote from Albert Einstein I would like to draw on: ‘there are limits to knowledge, but imagination is infinite.’"
"Now, when the Lisbon Strategy is on the day’s agenda, perhaps it is not churlish to put the question: what guarantee is there that the ambitious targets formulated in this document will not remain parts of the empire of imagination, rather than serving as a basis for true knowledge?"
"From the Hungarian perspective, for example, the ratio of 3% of GDP, though appealing, still seems very distant today, and this is sure to be the case with most of the recently acceded countries."
"It is my belief that there is only one way to dispel this worry."
"We must stimulate and support research and development in the new and the old Member States, each in line with their own and different situations."
"This is so that there should not be a situation where we keep funding for R[amp]D as something to be decided by each country’s level of economic development."
"This would preserve the existing differences and lead to a weakening of cohesion."
"It is also true that the Union is only as strong as the strengths and efforts of its Member States."
"If in this area there are no states or regions falling behind, only then will we be able to say that Europe has successfully faced one of the greatest challenges of the new century."
"And if that will be true, then it was worthwhile preparing this report."
". Mr President, there are four major areas to be addressed."
"Cooperation is the principal one: continuity in this area, a thematic approach but one that is based much more on industrial needs than in the past."
"The second is ideas: we want to create champions of thoughts and new-frontier ideas in the European Union, because we really need them."
"The third is people: there is no research without people and how good we will be in delivering and really creating depends a lot on how well we do in research."
"The fourth is capacities."
"All these areas need to be addressed in a proper way so that we will get the best for the European Union."
"Everything must be done with more flexible instruments than we have had until now."
"They must be transparent, understandable, simple and, I hope, efficient and based on a kind of upgraded continuity leading on from the Sixth Framework Programme."
"Some of you mentioned ethical questions."
"It is true that they are not easy."
"They are important in science because people’s perception of science is certainly crucial to the success of the issue we are discussing."
"These are definitely not easy questions that can be addressed in a limited amount of time, but I agree that we need to address them in an open and tolerant way."
"I also think that a special role should be given to the existing ethics committee, which discusses and considers all sides of these important and sometimes difficult questions."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises have been mentioned."
"They are extremely important because the European Union has a different structure to some of our competitors."
"As a proportion we have more of them, and they should and could participate more in research than they do today."
"Regarding enlargement and capacities, I would make two comments."
"One is that enlargement happened first in the areas of science and research, as scientists from the new Member States were able to participate earlier in these areas than in any others."
"On the other hand, it is more difficult to have full integration in these areas than, for example, in the political field, where people can sit at a table and discuss vexing questions."
"So we need to do all we can to address that matter, but we also have to be clear that proper funds are required if it is to be addressed properly."
"I believe that science and research funds should primarily address the question of excellence."
"We need to have a highly competitive European Union."
"Only if the Union as a whole is competitive can we rely on all the issues connected with questions of solidarity being properly addressed."
"I have listened carefully to all your comments."
"You have my promise that I will do my best."
"Your support is good for me, although it does not make my task easier."
"We all have high expectations, and rightly so, because the future of the European Union also depends greatly on the future development of the scientific and research field."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"The next item is the joint debate on oral questions on the transfer of passenger data:"
"– oral question (B6-0014/2005) by Baroness Ludford and others;"
"– oral question (B6-0154/2005) by Mrs Buitenweg;"
"– oral question (B6-0156/2005) by Mrs Klamt, Mrs Cederschiöld and Mr Coelho;"
"oral question (B6-0160/2005) by Mr Catania and Mrs Kaufmann;"
"and on data retention and data protection:"
"– oral question (B6-0017/2005) by Mr Alvaro, Mrs Roure and Mr Kreissl-Dörfler;"
"– oral question (B6-0020/2005) by Mrs Buitenweg;"
"– oral question (B6-0155/2005) by Mrs Klamt and others;"
"– oral question (B6-0159/2005) by Mr Catania and Mrs Kaufmann."
"Mr President, it is quite strange that this debate concerns the Internet and the retention of data on the Internet, and yet it is not being broadcast as normal on Parliament’s website."
"I should like to complain about that."
"Mrs Mastenbroek, late-night sittings have never been broadcast over the Internet in the past, as resources are limited in this respect."
"There has not yet been a single instance of a late-night sitting being broadcast, and so at present this is the rule rather than an exception."
"If we are to discuss anything, it should therefore be whether this rule should be changed on a permanent basis."
"Mr President, I wish to thank Commissioner Frattini for attending this debate tonight, which is the first on data protection during this parliamentary term, on the initiative of my own Group, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe."
"This is not the first time that Parliament has examined the issue of PNR, but it is almost two years to the day since Parliament first raised this issue."
"Tonight’s debate is therefore intended to take stock of what has happened since then."
"I have been appointed rapporteur on the initiative by four Member States relating to data retention."
"That is why some months ago we tabled two oral questions on the issue of PNR and the issue of data retention, with a view to having a public debate on two issues that raise serious concerns from the point of view of fundamental human rights, and to get more information from the Commission on these issues."
"Commissioner Frattini, we were pleased to hear during the EP hearings of candidate Commissioners that you attach a great deal of importance to defending fundamental rights, and I know that you are personally committed to defending citizens’ privacy."
"We appreciate that stance, but also want the Commission to bring forward the proposals on data protection under the third pillar that we have been promised for so long."
"The European Parliament finds itself in quite a conflictual situation vis-à-vis other EU institutions."
"We have strongly disagreed with the Commission and Council on the PNR issue, challenging their decisions before the Court of Justice, but unfortunately will have to wait a long time before the Court issues its decision."
"On the data retention issue, I am unconvinced by the four Member States’ initiative, with regard both to the content and the legal basis."
"I know that the Commission shares these doubts."
"In general terms, the European Parliament is extremely worried about the compliance of these provisions with international and European human rights norms, such as the European Convention on Human Rights, and the related jurisprudence, as well as with EU law."
"That is why we are here tonight."
"On the issue of data retention, we know the Commission has raised the scrutiny reservation on the correctness of the legal basis of the four Member States’ proposal."
"The Commission believes that a third pillar basis is not correct, and that a first pillar basis would be the right one."
"We would be keen to view the Commission’s legal responding, since I have the same doubts and have requested Parliament’s legal service to make the same legal check."
"However, we also have doubts on the necessity and proportionality of European data retention provisions."
"That is why we would ask the Commission whether it supports the four Member States’ initiative not only in terms of the legal basis but also in terms of the content."
"Secondly, we would like to know whether the Commission will ask the four Member States to withdraw their initiative, a move the Commission has not yet made."
"We would also like to know if and when the Commission will propose a first pillar instrument."
"The Commission 2005 working programme schedules for this month the adoption by the Commission of a directive on the retention of data for law enforcement purposes."
"Will this deadline be respected and what will the content of the proposal be?"
"Thirdly, we would like an update on the long-overdue third pillar data protection instrument that Commissioner Frattini personally promised would be brought forward."
"Let me underline that the Article 29 Working Party has already drafted a proposal for harmonised data protection principles for the third pillar."
"We would be honoured to hear your remarks on this issue."
"On the PNR issue, Parliament has a keen interest and a right to have an update on the current action before the Court of Justice, with Parliament objecting to the signing of the international agreement of 28 May 2004 that makes the transfer of air passenger data to the US possible."
"First of all, Parliament has consistently requested the development of a push system, most recently in the amendment adopted to the 2005 budget."
"Can the Commission inform Parliament whether there have been any developments?"
"With a view to the protection of the privacy of European air passengers, could the Commission inform Parliament of the volume of passenger data which the authorities have access to and whether there is an effective filtering of sensitive data."
"Also, are intra-European flights excluded?"
"The Commission has published a communication on a global EU approach on PNR."
"However, the Commission is evidently not following a coherent approach, since on the one hand it has not finalised the international agreement with Australia, while on the other hand it is ready to negotiate with Canada on standards that are entirely different from those which apply to the US."
"Will the Commission follow up on the communication and will it start adhering to a truly global EU approach?"
"Finally, why has Parliament never been informed about the negotiations on PNR at an ICAO level?"
"The current practice is not democratic, transparent or justifiable."
"Thank you, and I look forward to hearing your answers."
"Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, I will not repeat the questions that we sent to you."
"On the other hand, it is worth restating that last year, in April 2004, the European Parliament rejected the agreement negotiated between the Council, the Commission and the United States and referred the matter to the Court of Justice."
"I would also remind you that Article 7 of Directive 95/46 provides an exhaustive list of circumstances in which personal data may be processed."
"These authorisations must be understood as being laid down by Community law or by the national law of a Member State, and not by the law of a third country."
"Do you not think that, in the absence of an opinion from the Court of Justice, and in view of the European Parliament's negative opinion, the automatic transmission of passenger data to the US authorities violates European citizens' right to protection of their private lives?"
"I would remind you that the US authorities cannot guarantee the level of data protection that we require in Europe and that we also ask of other third countries such as Australia and Canada."
"In particular, we have no way of knowing who has access to these data."
"The issue should be settled with respect for fundamental rights and in line with the principles defined by the European Parliament."
"Thus, we need to define what data can be transferred automatically and what data can be transferred on a case-by-case basis."
"We would like the list of serious crimes for which an additional request can be made, the list of authorities and agencies that can have access to the data and the data protection conditions that must be met to be determined."
"We would like to know for how long these two types of data will be kept."
"We know, of course, that data relating to the prevention of serious crime must be exchanged in accordance with the EU-US agreement on mutual legal assistance and extradition."
"We would like to satisfy ourselves that passengers will be guaranteed the ability to correct data relating to them."
"Do you think, Commissioner, that the transfer of data complies with the principles of finality and proportionality advocated by the Article 29 working party?"
"Moreover, we would like to have assessments and figures and to know the results of this practical experience."
"Finally, do you not think that it is all the more urgent to deal with the issue of data protection under the third pillar, with a framework decision?"
"An initiative has been proposed by France, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden regarding a draft framework decision on data retention, and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs is also currently working on it."
"We would like to know, Commissioner, whether you support this?"
"What, in fact, are your plans with regard to data protection?"
"Do you want to put forward your own proposals?"
"We in the Civil Liberties Committee need to know the legislative basis on which we have to work, and we would be grateful if you could answer all these questions precisely."
"Mr President, I would like to take some time this evening to reminisce about the previous Commission and the things it promised to do."
"You may remember Mr Bolkestein’s letter to the American Minister, Tom Ridge, about the transfer of passenger data, in which he even quoted Benjamin Franklin with the well-known phrase: ‘They who would give up an essential liberty for temporary security deserve neither liberty or security’."
"Today, we would like to know what exactly happens with our citizens’ data."
"In previous debates, the transfer of sensitive data, such as the person’s religion or their state of health, proved extremely controversial."
"Mr Bolkestein promised that ‘pending the installation of filters by airlines, the United States should filter them and then delete them altogether’, which suggests that the United States gets its hands on the data, but is not allowed to read it."
"Has the Commission meanwhile checked whether the United States actually abides by this rule or do you simply take President Bush’s word for it?"
"What is the latest on the development of those filter systems for airline companies?"
"Last year, the Commission considered Parliament’s lawsuit to be generally unnecessary, because they could get the push system off the ground within a few months, six months at the most."
"What is happening with it now?"
"The Americans’ interest in the European public’s personal data cannot be seen in isolation from their efforts to set up a Global Computer Surveillance System."
"It is their desire to create a profile of as many citizens worldwide as possible on the basis of their travelling behaviour and their credit-card purchases."
"On 11 March 2004, the Commission response indicated its willingness, under certain conditions, to help develop this CAPPS II system and said that at the present time, the American authorities are not yet carrying out tests with our passenger data."
"I would ask the Commission whether, a year down the line, this situation has changed, so that they are now testing our passenger data."
"Have you checked this?"
"What is the latest on the CAPPS II system or perhaps its successor?"
"Is the Commission now involved in the development of this system with the United States?"
"I should like to have precise answers."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that Mr Frattini has read our questions and will certainly also answer them this evening."
"I am also convinced that he knows that Parliament supports a balanced viewpoint where combating crime comes up against the issue of privacy, as in this case involving data storage."
"All day long, we have discussed the Lisbon Process and how we are to become more competitive."
"It cannot, then, be the right time to impose upon enterprises, authorities and citizens enormous costs for which we do not even have an impact assessment; in other words, costs for which there is no basis."
"It seems to me entirely unreasonable and illogical to take decisions before such an assessment has been carried out while, at the same time, discussing competitiveness and Lisbon."
"It would be unreasonable to make people pay for this surveillance of themselves."
"I believe that it must always be the party who requests the information who pays."
"Otherwise, the situation would work in favour of a Big Brother society."
"Moreover, it has not been demonstrated that this approach is necessary, something that is essential before any decisions can be taken."
"Should the Commission submit a proposal, it is logical for the Member States to withdraw theirs."
"I hope and believe that Mr Frattini realises that it is a good idea – even necessary – to ensure that the protection of people’s privacy on a third pillar basis is at least as good as the same protection based on the first pillar."
"I share my fellow MEPs’ viewpoint that it would be interesting to hear how you intend to deal with this matter."
"– Mr President, as regards the issue of the transfer of passenger data, I would like to add my voice to the questions raised and the criticism made by my fellow MEPs in the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament."
"For my part, I shall concentrate, in my comments, on the issue of the storage of personal data."
"The proposal currently before the Council entails a very clear conflict between personal integrity and respect for privacy, on the one hand, and society’s need for surveillance, on the other."
"I believe that this draft goes way too far in infringing privacy, for it is based in practice on the concept of surveillance even when no crime is suspected and is actually based on a kind of underlying suspicion of everyone."
"This is clearly in conflict with the European Convention for Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, particularly Article 8 concerning respect for private and family life, home and correspondence."
"The Member States signed this Convention from the Council of Europe on the assumption that the EU as an institution would also do so."
"Are we serious about this if, at the same time, we can adopt legislation that clearly infringes international conventions?"
"This is a key issue concerning our credibility, which the Commission must address."
"Another important point is the severe criticism made of this proposal by what is known as the Article 29 Group."
"This comprises some of the foremost experts that we have in the Union when it comes to data protection."
"It would also be interesting to hear the Commission comment on the Article 29 Group’s criticism in this area."
"It is in times of crisis that the rule of law is put to the test, and it is in times of crisis that the rule of law is needed most of all, in order to protect people, partly from unwarranted surveillance by society itself."
"Following the terrorist attacks in the USA a few years ago, we saw that, once the line concerned has been crossed, it is that much easier to cross it again."
"That is why it is important to stand up for the fundamental values of the rule of law. The Commission and the Council must therefore also be prepared to debate this legislation in good time."
"Far too often we have discussed these issues – on many occasions without getting answers – only to find that it is then too late."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I am sure that no one in this House would hesitate to agree that data protection is a key task."
"Yet there can be no question that prioritising the fight against crime is equally important, particularly in this day and age."
"It is extremely difficult to weigh up data protection against opportunities to fight crime, and I am genuinely open and ready to discuss this matter."
"With regard to this draft report, however, I must say that no definite answer has yet been provided to a question that was asked quite clearly several months ago, namely whether there is actually any need for this report."
"I can therefore fully understand why all the groups within the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs believe – as I, indeed, very certainly do – that the scheme that is being pursued is absurd."
"We need a clear answer from the Commission."
"If these measures are necessary, then we can discuss them."
"Yet if they are unnecessary, which I currently believe to be the case, then we must do everything in our power to stop them."
"What worries me is that this process will go on and on, and that tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, or at some other point in the future, we will be presented with a proposal that we will carry on debating, and that there will no longer be any way to escape the process, even though every Member of this House believes it to be misguided."
"I would therefore be extremely interested to hear the Commission’s views on this."
"We have been discussing Lisbon and our desire to see less regulation, but we are well on the way to regulating something that is absurd and that no one wants apart from the four Member States which backed the initiative."
"Furthermore, given that all groups in the House are in agreement and have expressed their concerns on this matter, I would expect the Commission to explain to the House whether – and, if so, when – it intends to present a proposal and what the substance of this proposal will be."
"I do not want to wait around too long before we are told what we will be agreeing to, and who will bear the costs."
"Mrs Cederschiöld asked a short while ago who would foot the bill – will it be the public, industry, or those who called for these measures, namely the Member States behind the initiative?"
"Additional questions can then be dealt with at a later date."
". Mr President, the Commission shares the overall concern that Member States are aiming to address with the envisaged framework decision on data retention, which is to guarantee the capability of law enforcement authorities to access certain data related to electronic communication to underpin their efforts to fight crime, including terrorism and organised crime."
"From a legal point of view, the initiative of France, Ireland, Sweden and the United Kingdom on data retention currently under discussion was tabled under Title 6 of the Treaty on European Union."
"However, the Commission is of the opinion that the provisions of the draft instrument that deal with the harmonisation of obligations on electronic communication providers to retain data related to the provision of electronic communication services fall under the European Community Treaty, notably in view of the existing provisions of Community law on the subject."
"As a consequence, the Commission will present an alternative proposal on data retention based on Article 95 of the European Community Treaty by early spring 2005."
"Personally, I hope that the four Member States in question will withdraw their proposal."
"The Commission is fully aware of the possible cost implications of data retention obligations on the providers of electronic communication services."
"An impact assessment will be carried out to determine to what extent the creation of obligations to retain data will have economic implications."
"Regarding a third pillar general data protection instrument, the Commission intends to issue the first comprehensive proposal in the second half of 2005; in October or November."
"To that end, the Commission has started consultations with experts representing the relevant ministries and data protection control authorities of the Member States and the Schengen States."
"As regards the transfer of passenger data to the United States joint review, a number of questions concerning the transfer of passenger data – the PNR issue – are related to the implementation of undertakings by the US Customs and Border Protection agency."
"Those undertakings provide for a joint review on their implementation to be conducted by the US authorities and the Commission, the latter assisted by representatives of European law enforcement authorities and data protection supervisors."
"This joint review will take place in the first half of this year, i.e. during the first year of operation of the agreement and associated undertakings, which entered into force on 28 May 2004."
"The review aims to provide a clear picture of the way the undertakings function."
"It is my intention to inform this Parliament of the outcome of this joint review and any important developments in this file."
"As I have already mentioned, national data protection authorities will be part of the Commission-led team conducting the joint review."
"This should allow the Article 29 Working Party to participate to assess fully the implementation of the undertaking."
"I am pleased to tell you that, in spite of differences of opinion on the US PNR package, there is excellent cooperation on the implementation of this package between the Article 29 Working Party and the Commission."
"As regards passenger information, as an example of that excellent cooperation between the Article 29 Working Party and the Commission, the Working Party has issued a passenger information notice, which airlines and travel agents use in order to inform airline passengers of the fact that personal data are transferred to the US Customs and Border Protection agency for the purpose of preventing and combating terrorism and other serious crimes."
"As regards data transfers to third countries, according to information we received from the United States, no passenger data have been transferred so far to third countries."
"No doubt this issue will be looked into during the joint review exercise that will take place very soon."
"As regards ‘Secure Flight’ and CAPPS II, you will be aware that the US Transportation Security Administration has dropped its controversial computer-assisted passenger pre-screening system – also known as CAPPS II – in favour of a new programme called ‘Secure Flight’."
"That programme will use passenger data for pre-screening passengers on US domestic flights against a terrorist watch list, with the aim of helping to identify potential terrorists."
"Unlike CAPPS II, ‘Secure Flight’, for the time being, is limited to US domestic flights, which make it much less problematic than CAPPS II from a new data protection point of view."
"‘Secure Flight’ is only in its testing phase."
"That is why, for the moment, no negotiations are planned."
"This is an issue to be watched very carefully."
"As regards the EU’s global plan for PNR policy, the Commission issued a communication in December 2003 on the EU’s global approach on passenger data, advocating a comprehensive and balanced approach."
"The Commission indicated in the communication that it will pursue its task with other third countries requesting passengers’ data."
"The Commission has entered into talks with Canada and Australia."
"Concerning Canada, we will soon seek Parliament’s opinion on a draft Commission document and an accompanying international agreement."
"Talks with Australia are also well advanced."
"In both cases the Article 29 Working Party has issued a positive opinion."
"As you can see, the Commission’s strategy as outlined in the communication of December 2003 is being put into practice."
"Finally, as regards the International Civil Aviation Organization, that organisation established the passenger name record access study group in June 2004, following an initiative by several states within that organisation."
"They called for the development of a harmonised set of principles under the auspices of the ICAO."
"Guidelines are currently being prepared."
"The European Commission and several EU Member States are participating actively in the work of the study group."
"I will keep you well informed about further developments in that programme."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Frattini, I welcome your response on data protection and in relation to the announcement of the Commission’s initiative. Like you, I hope that the four Member States will withdraw their initiatives."
"With regard to PNR, this is an issue that has concerned Parliament for two years."
"As you know, Mr Frattini, the need for cooperation at Community level and at Transatlantic level is not the issue here."
"What we are highlighting is the need to maintain a balance between the citizens’ security, freedom and rights and we wish to emphasise our view that data transfer can take place only if the third country in question is able to guarantee adequate levels of protection."
"It is also absolutely crucial that a legal and secure framework be established on the transfer of PNR. We would advocate a ‘push’ system accompanied by the appropriate filters and would like to see the necessary guarantees with regard to the accuracy, security and supervision of data."
"Furthermore, the principle of reciprocity must always underpin any exchange of information with the US authorities or those of any other third country."
"We welcome the comments that you made on the involvement of Article 29 and on your readiness to continue to give Parliament all of the information on this dossier."
"We sincerely hope that the ongoing negotiations with Canada and Australia set the standard for other countries, in particular the United States of America, to follow."
"There was no reference to the issue of the chip in passports in the information – the response – that you gave."
"We understand that the United States is planning to insert a non-encrypted chip enabling remote reading and this is a further concern heading into these global talks on transferring data between the Union and the United States of America"
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to Commissioner Frattini for having already announced that the Commission will propose its own initiative."
"I have a number of questions regarding the retention of data in telecommunications networks, to which I hope your proposal will be able to provide answers."
"My first question relates to costs, as long-term data retention is a major financial burden, in particular for small telecommunications firms."
"The proposal put forward by the Council and the four Member States makes no provision for compensation."
"Who is meant to pay for these measures, and what is their cost-benefit ratio?"
"It is quite clear that longer retention periods will not mean increased security for citizens."
"Data protection experts, and even law enforcement agencies such as the Federal Criminal Police Office in Germany, have expressed doubt as to whether there is any need for the measures outlined in the Council decision."
"The has even stated its opposition to the minimum period for retention of traffic data, and it is calling on the Federal Government to withdraw its support for the proposal."
"How can we expect to achieve greater security if terrorists and those involved in organised crime still have alternatives open to them that are not covered at all in this proposal?"
"What measures will be taken to deal with Internet cafés, flat rate lines, public telephone boxes and calls using telephone providers based abroad, and who will be in a position to monitor and retain all this data?"
"Data protection is another extremely important issue as regards the transfer of data to third parties."
"It is also quite clear that what we need is effective security, and more of it."
"No one is opposed to fighting international terrorism or organised crime, but we have absolutely no need for unnecessary monitoring."
"I hope that you will provide answers to all these questions in your proposal."
"It is quite obvious, and we firmly believe it to be true, that although it is good that checks should be carried out, it is even better if people have confidence in them."
"As it stands, the proposal by the four Member States will not foster confidence among the public."
". Mr President, Commissioner Frattini, I am pleased to hear that this new Commission will be rectifying a number of mistakes made by its predecessor."
"That is important because my country, the Netherlands, will, in a few months’ time, be holding a referendum on the Constitution."
"I would like to be able to look those members of the Dutch public who are rather sceptical about it straight in the eye and tell them that this Constitution, those constitutional rights and the protection of personal data are really serious and not simply lip service."
"Let me turn first to the protection of personal data, which is a matter of general interest."
"You said that you personally are opposed to the proposal tabled by the four countries."
"I should like to hear what this means in institutional terms."
"As for the transfer of passenger data, the PNR issue, concerning which there was a report on which my predecessor Mrs Boogerd-Quaak worked very hard, will the Joint Review, which you mentioned a moment ago, also state how many attacks have been pre-empted and how many criminals have been arrested?"
"That, in the final analysis, is what this is all about."
"Secondly, you stated that information is already being handed out to the passengers, but what about the duty to ask for explicit permission before their data can be transferred?"
"Finally, I should like to find out from you what steps the Commission has taken so far in order to introduce the push system."
". Mr President, Commissioner, your response leaves a great many questions unanswered and raises new ones."
"I can tell you that the European public is far from happy with this regulation, and that there are a great many people who say that they no longer wish to fly to the United States because they do not enjoy being treated like criminals."
"Such views are now widespread among the public, and cannot therefore be ignored."
"I should like to ask a number of questions following on from the answers you provided."
"You said that a review is now to be carried out after one year, and that Parliament will be informed of its outcome."
"Am I to assume that you cannot yet tell us what will happen in the meantime with data that is being retained this year?"
"Am I to assume that you cannot provide us with any information on the way in which this data is currently retained, used and filtered, or that you do not wish to do so?"
"I should like to inform the Commissioner that this presents us with a major problem in terms of communication with the public."
"This leads me to ask what approach is being taken to the issue of data protection, as this is something by which the European public sets great store."
"What people want is information, Commissioner, and you should therefore be more open in your dealings with this House."
"Mr President, Commissioner Frattini, it is always good to see you."
"I would first like to say something about the procedure, and then move on to the content."
"The procedure is extremely vague."
"We in this House have been asked to assess a proposal which, technically speaking, does not yet exist."
"Indeed, the Council has tabled a proposal on the retention of traffic data, but this is still being drafted and it is not clear what the proposal will ultimately stipulate."
"In the first pillar, a ban on data retention has been agreed upon before and it is abundantly clear that some governments have tabled this proposal only because they cannot get it past their own parliaments."
"That is how the Council takes advantage of the democratic hole in the European Union, because as you know, this House only has an advisory role in this respect."
"I heard a moment ago that you are in agreement with us, or at least that is what I inferred from what you said."
"I should like to spell out once again, though, that the European Union is not designed for whitewashing failed national proposals."
"As for content, it is for this House to decide whether or not the final proposal is proportionate."
"We must assess how proportionate this limitation of communication secrecy is in terms of how much this limitation is needed."
"How can we assess a proposal’s proportionality if its content is still unclear and proof that it is needed has never been given?"
"You said a moment ago that, if the Commission were to table a proposal on this, you would weigh up the economic consequences of such a proposal."
"That is, in all honesty, a little too fast for my liking."
"I would first like to see proof for such a proposal."
"In other words, why is it necessary?"
"It has never been proven that it is."
"Dutch research has shown the reverse, if anything."
"The Dutch Government had kept that research secret, but our Government Information (Public Access) Act eventually obliged it to come clean."
"I would now like to make a general comment on terrorism."
"As I stand here, I do not feel terribly comfortable, because I have the feeling that I am giving up the fight against terrorism."
"I think it is an important fight, and also think it is a disgrace that the European Council should put this House in a position where we have to stand on the brakes where proposals intended to fight terrorism are concerned."
"To do so is to take advantage of our position."
"I would like to discuss what we should coordinate at European level and I would like to do this in a democratic manner."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to all the Members who have spoken."
"The first thought is that the Commission is trying to reconcile two great European values, which are the people’s right to security and the people’s right to have their freedoms and fundamental rights safeguarded."
"I do not think these two fundamental rights are contradictory."
"We in the Commission will work to show that proposals are possible which give greater security and greater freedom, that is to say greater safeguards for the fundamental right to personal data protection."
"I mentioned a data protection initiative under the third pillar."
"The Commission will, of course, base it on Article 8 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"I can briefly give Parliament a foretaste of certain principles: the principle by which processed data must be used transparently and only for specified purposes, the principle by which the interested party’s consent is required, the principle by which the legal basis must first be established by law and therefore cannot remain uncertain, and lastly the principle by which monitoring by an independent authority is required."
"These are guidelines that will enable the Commission, by the end of the year, to submit a proposal under the third pillar laying down a new generation of guarantees."
"More guarantees are needed that will take account of the times and changes in technology."
"As regards the initiative by the four Member States in relation to the first pillar, I have stated our intention of formulating an alternative proposal, because I am convinced that the legal basis on which those Member States have proceeded is incorrect."
"I have therefore also said that I will try to persuade them to withdraw their proposal."
"With regard to the question on biometric information on travel documents, especially passports, I am sure that rules are needed to encrypt the most sensitive data, such as fingerprints."
"This principle is contained in the actions and initiatives that the Commission is developing."
"Lastly, on the subject of the joint review, I am not in a position to anticipate the results, simply because the joint review has not yet been completed."
"I myself have not received any report on the outcome of the inquiry, but I confirm that I shall inform Parliament of it as soon as possible – within a few weeks, I expect, and no later than a month and a half from now."
"The last topic is the ‘push’ system."
"We are working to convince as many non-EU countries as possible to adopt this system, which I am certain is the best."
"You probably know that, during our talks, Canada agreed to start off with the push system, and I cherish a certain hope that the United States too, given a little persuasion, will come round to believing that it is the best system."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place in April."
"The next item is the report (A6-0049/2005) by Mrs Margrete Auken, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on financing Natura 2000."
"– Mr President, first and foremost, my thanks to all the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for their constructive cooperation."
"Immediately after the voting on Monday, I thought that perhaps the report had come to resemble a Christmas tree when a newly-married couple combine their Christmas traditions for the first time."
"After more careful study, however, I can clearly see that the tree is not only decorated but also maintains a consistent theme."
"Firstly, it has now been established that Natura 2000 is to be funded."
"The amount is not up for negotiation."
"We have international commitments, and nature will need help for the foreseeable future."
"The European Environment Agency in Copenhagen has, time after time, drawn attention to the alarming situation, and we need to reverse the trend."
"Consequently, to include the Commission’s own minimum amount of EUR 21.35 billion for 2007-2013 in the report is merely stating facts, because this amount is not up for discussion."
"We only know that if we do not get moving right away, matters will simply become more and more expensive day by day."
"I have seen in Poland how huge Danish and American pig farms are spreading out over a fine and vulnerable landscape with no regard for biodiversity."
"In Denmark, many farmers are bagging pollution permits in Natura 2000 areas."
"As a result, they will be able to earn a pretty penny when the government wants to buy them back."
"This type of behaviour must be stopped."
"What is actually up for negotiation is how the money is to be obtained."
"In this respect, it is pleasing that the Committee is united in believing that Natura 2000 should be incorporated not just into rural development policy, but also in a broader framework."
"Just as the Commission has stated, Natura 2000 must be incorporated into all EU policies."
"The committee has, however, been even more realistic than the Commission."
"We mention environmental considerations generally and not just Natura 2000, and we know that the goal cannot be achieved unless amounts are earmarked in these funds and conditions introduced."
"To date, we have seen little sign of environmental considerations, despite the fact it is already possible to incorporate them into the funds."
"On the contrary, the funds often work against the countryside."
"If, however, consideration for the countryside is integral to the way the funds are used, farmers will then have an interest in the environment and in environment-friendly farming and other production in the areas concerned, earning twice as much in the process."
"I am convinced that this will heighten their sense of the wealth that biodiversity represents – including in economic terms, as the Commission has, moreover, so rightly pointed out."
"There are small areas that cannot be helped via the funds."
"For these, we must use the ‘LIFE+’ dedicated fund, which is also designed to ensure that management and other organisational tasks are carried out."
"More than once we emphasise the need for the rural development fund in particular – in other words, the second pillar of the common agricultural policy – to be significantly increased, if the task is to be achieved in a justifiable way and in harmony with those who are to implement it."
"Naturally, we can call for more money in the budget for this purpose, but it is more relevant and realistic to obtain a considerable part of the money from the first pillar of the common agricultural policy, where the really large amounts of EU funding are committed."
"We must not forget, however, that a substantial part of the amount must come from the Member States."
"It is their commitment, and I believe it is important that we emphasise that the Member States have an obligation themselves and that this is not something to be funded solely by the EU."
"After all, it would be appalling if we expanded the idea of the eternal existence of subsidies – as we know all too well from agricultural policy, where the Member States are now of the opinion that practically the whole thing should be paid for by the Community."
"No, they must pay for this themselves."
"Cofinancing by the EU is above all an important helping hand, and we expect that, in any event, half of it will be covered via the EU’s budgets and thus, primarily, via the funds."
"Parliament must now have confidence that both the Commission and the Member States will comply with their responsibilities, listen to Parliament and incorporate Natura 2000 into all the relevant policies."
"The heads of government made a commitment to do so in Gothenburg and on various occasions subsequently, and this is something they owe both to the citizens of the EU and to our descendants."
"Mr President, before we start this debate, I should like to ask briefly, obviously without wishing to detract from Commissioner Frattini’s qualities, whether you know why the Commissioner for the environment is not here to take part in this very important debate on Natura 2000."
"I can only deplore this and find it unacceptable."
"I am afraid I noticed you too late during the previous debate, Mrs Brepoels."
"As you are next on the list of speakers, Commissioner, you can, if you so wish, answer Mrs Brepoels’ question now."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I apologise to the honourable Member, but I can only say that the Commissioner responsible, Mr Dimas, informed me that he would not be able to be present in the Chamber today because of personal commitments."
"Of course, I do not know the exact nature of his commitments, but I willingly agreed to replace him."
"In any case, I believe the speech I am going to make in this Chamber was drafted by his office and his Directorate-General, and Commissioner Dimas himself fully agrees with it."
"The commitment made by heads of state and government in Göteborg to halt the decline in the use of biodiversity by 2010 is recognised as a key element of the EU’s sustainable development strategy."
"Nature and biodiversity are included in the main priorities for action."
"The successful implementation of the Natura 2000 network will be the cornerstone of the EU’s effort."
"Ensuring that Natura 2000 is adequately financed is therefore one of the top priorities."
"It is in that context that, on 15 July 2004, the Commission adopted its communication on the financing of Natura 2000."
"The communication looked at all possible options, including the establishment of a separate fund, and concluded that the most effective approach would be to integrate the funding of Natura 2000 into existing Community financial instruments."
"The new structural fund regulations now under discussion in the Council provide for the financing of Natura 2000 and also include mechanisms for guidance and control by the Commission of the programmes the Member States submit."
"The Commission is aware that there is concern in Parliament about the priority Member States will give to Natura 2000 when faced with competing demands on limited budgets."
"It is argued that firmer guarantees and ring-fencing of funds are needed."
"The Commission cannot support such a rigid approach."
"It is not possible at this stage to give a precise indication of the amounts likely to be spent annually on cofinancing Natura sites from 2007 onwards."
"The needs of Member States will probably be very different."
"Therefore, on the basis of the subsidiarity principle, it will be up to each Member State to decide on the requirements of its Natura 2000 network in drawing up national programmes for different funding regulations."
"Nevertheless, the Commission has proposed an element of ring-fencing that will assist the second axis of Natura 2000 in land management or rural development regulations."
"That requires Member States to allocate a minimum of 25% of the total for this fund to this axis, which means that at least EUR 22.75 billion will be available for land management during the 2007-2013 period."
"Support from the European Parliament in safeguarding that amount will be crucial."
"In preparing their structural and rural development fund programmes, the Member States will need to take note of the priorities to be identified in the strategic guidelines, which will be issued by the Commission following approval of the funding regulation."
"As Natura 2000 has been clearly identified in a structural and rural development fund proposal, Natura 2000 will be identified as a Community priority in a strategic guideline for the relevant fund."
". Mr President, I believe that the report by Mrs Auken sends a very strong message to the Commission that proper funding for the Natura 2000 network is a very high priority for this Parliament too."
"I am pleased that the main points of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development have been taken on board in the report."
"The structural funds must be part of the funding mechanism for Natura 2000, but there must also be a clear commitment that the money will be spent on specific, authorised objectives; in other words, that the money earmarked and that the release of that money is conditional on national Natura 2000 financing plans being in place in the Member States."
"Mainstreaming environmental considerations into all EU policy work is the way forward."
"I welcome the integrated approach of the Commission."
"One of the most important features of Natura 2000 is that it reflects that integrated approach; it puts people at the heart of the process and, in particular, people who live and work in our rural areas."
"As well as aiming to stop the decline in biodiversity in Europe, Natura 2000 creates and sustains jobs, supports agriculture, forestry and rural development and provides tourism and educational opportunities."
"But the truth is that support from the structural funds or the rural development budget will not be enough on its own to fund Natura 2000."
"That is why it must go hand-in-hand with Life+ and a dedicated fund."
"Our main concern is that we have effective funding options to ensure that this ambitious scheme to safeguard and support Europe’s natural heritage actually succeeds in its aim."
". – ‘Natura 2000’ is an ecological network to protect designated natural habitats, animal and plant species of communal significance."
"The European Parliament owes it to the citizens of the Union that we stop the decline of biodiversity in Europe."
"To reach this goal, however – as with any other large-scale enterprise – money is needed."
"All the Member States, the Council, and the Commission were in agreement when they created the bird and habitat protection Directive."
"Equally unanimous was our decision to build up a European network for nature protection."
"Therefore let us now undertake to carry out our decision, and with our joint resources create the material conditions for it too!"
"In the People’s Party and the Environmental Protection Committee we heartily welcomed the European Commission’s Recommendation for financial support for the ’Natura 2000’ network."
"The integrated approach in this case would be financed by the Regional Development Fund, the Structural Funds, and also the supplemented LIFE+ fund, however it is workable."
"This could be workable, insofar as [1] the funds just named would handle nature protection goals as a real priority, [2] appropriate guarantees would be built into the provisions of the various financial instruments, [3] due to the greater number of tasks, these funds would be supplied with extra money."
"Therefore we take it as given that the individual Member States will take part appropriately in financing this, and that the danger of their being knocked out by other, more economically competitive, projects will not threaten programmes targeted at safeguarding biodiversity."
"The Commission’s answers to our questions, however, have strengthened our misgivings in connection with the effectiveness of the integrated approach."
"Because of this, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats believes we must review this financial solution and consider a financial instrument created specially for this purpose."
"I would like to thank Mrs. Margaret Auken for her work, compiling an in-depth and expert report and for giving us her fullest cooperation."
"Our recommendations for compromise amendments bear witness that with common interests every party group and specialist committee moves in the same direction."
". Mr President, just recently the Hungarian National Assembly presented a sculpture named ‘The Rediscovered Europe’ as a gift to the European Parliament."
"This sculpture reminds us once again that Europe is not just a continent, or a political and economic unit, but also an imaginary person."
"Europe not only needs competition, development and infrastructure, but, like any woman, she also needs care in order to preserve her beauty and natural assets."
"Many natural assets such as lakes, rivers, forests and fields have already been destroyed by industry, urban planning and intensive agriculture."
"Now it is really our last chance to save the remaining natural sites in our Member States."
"That is why the Socialist Group welcomes the Commission’s Natura 2000 initiative without any hesitation."
"We also welcome every further step to strengthen the programme."
"We have consulted many environmental NGOs in Brussels and at home and have built their suggestions into our amendments."
"Natura 2000 can work only with the active support of local communities, NGOs, and rank and file people – men and women, young and old, who just like the beauties of nature without any political statement."
"The Socialist Group is committed to providing a clean natural environment for every European citizen."
"The Commission’s original communication envisaged EUR 6.1 billion per year for the project."
"We considered it a brave and encouraging step."
"Later, we heard that, due to co-financing, the Member States would have to cover half of that sum."
"For new Member States like my country, Hungary, it is not easy to secure money, but we are committed to doing our best to save our unique and untouched natural sites."
"However, at least half of the sum should be guaranteed by the EU, which is why I have tabled an amendment to ensure that at least the minimum sum of EUR 3.05 billion per year, or EUR 25.35 billion between 2006 and 2013, is guaranteed by the Commission."
"On Monday evening, the amendment was carried unanimously in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"It is very sad to see that the PPE-DE Group has changed its mind once more and wants to delete the reference to a concrete sum in the report."
"I am very disappointed by that approach."
"Without money, we can tell fairy tales for 1001 nights, but not a single tree or one square metre of a lake will be spared from destruction."
"The Socialist Group keeps to a straight path and we do not change our standpoint from one day to the next."
"We support the report as it has already been accepted by the Environment Committee, and ask other Groups to also say ‘no’ to those who try to start cutting the budget for nature and the future of Europe’s environmental assets."
"The voting list for tomorrow will speak for itself."
". Mr President, Commissioner, I, too, find it regrettable that Commissioner Dimas is not here, but I would like to thank Commissioner Frattini for agreeing to be present for a debate that does not really fall within his competence."
"I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, our rapporteur, Mrs Auken, most sincerely on the quality of her report and also, I would like to say, for her tenacity in defending our common objectives."
"Tomorrow's vote, as I am sure we all appreciate, is crucial."
"Natura 2000 is the main tool for protecting biodiversity and endangered species in the EU."
"Despite the slow pace taken by certain Member States, the local administrations and players have set to work."
"Today, Natura 2000 covers more than 18 000 sites, 64 million hectares and nearly 15% of the landmass of Europe."
"With regard to the issue of financing, yes, we must guarantee the viability of the financing, of the co-financing, of Natura 2000 by turning, as the Commission proposes, to existing sector financing instruments: the CAP Rural Development Fund and the Structural Funds."
"The integrated approach is certainly the most logical one in this regard, and we must now follow this logical path to its end and ensure that it is made compulsory to include Natura 2000 in the funds in question."
"This is also the main criticism being levelled at you, Commissioner, by the players on the ground and which is supported by no fewer than 15 Member States and the European Parliament: as Natura 2000 is by definition a concrete example of local governance, it is clear that, if local councillors and officials are not compelled to clearly promote the conservation of habitats and species in special areas, the money will be used for completely different things, for example road construction or the implementation of social or economic development projects."
"This is what is said in the important point 8 of our resolution, which our group strongly supports."
"Finally, we are also in favour of point 5, which calls on the Commission to make a commitment to amend the new financial instrument LIFE + to include a specific item on 'nature conservation' and also to guarantee a minimum amount for Natura 2000 in the next financial perspectives, an amount which, as for other European policies, must match up to our ambitions."
"Those ambitions are clear: for all of us to endeavour to protect the environment."
"Mr President, I have a point of order that relates to the French translation and is important for tomorrow's vote in plenary."
"If I am not mistaken, and I do not think I am, the French translation is incomplete."
"I am referring to point 5, which is a crucial point, as I have just said, since it relates to financing and to the level of that financing."
"I think that the English translation, which is the other text that I have here, must refer to this matter, because it is seven lines longer than the French translation and those seven lines make specific reference to what I have just mentioned, in particular the proposed minimum amount of EUR 21.35 billion."
"I therefore think that we will need to point out tomorrow that seven lines are missing at the end of the French text."
"We also need to be told which language version is authentic."
"Many thanks for pointing this out, Mrs Ries."
"Your comment has been noted, and we will ensure that the French version is also complete."
". Mr President, Commissioner, I, too, would like to start by congratulating Mrs Auken on her excellent report which raises the real issues of Natura 2000."
"In contrast, I am quite stunned but I am not holding it against you, Commissioner by the text that you read to us giving the Commission's position."
"Indeed, I have the impression that Mr Dimas has sent you into battle and is washing his hands of it, because, when it comes down to it, we have not learned anything new that the Commissioner did not reveal to us two weeks ago."
"The issue being raised which is the subject of Mrs Auken's report is the financing of Natura 2000."
"In your explanation, though, the Commission has once again failed to state that it will guarantee the financing of Natura 2000 for seven years."
"Our fellow Member is right to ask about the figure."
"These are not fantasy figures, produced by NGOs that may have taken certain liberties."
"No, the figure comes from the Commission, which has estimated the costs of managing Natura 2000 as at least EUR 6.1 billion per year."
"I really do not understand why you cannot assure the European Parliament that the Commission will fully guarantee three billion per year of EU funding."
"The proposal you are putting forward does not guarantee that."
"Thus, we are no further forward today than we were two weeks ago, and we would like to have a response from the Commission."
". Mr President, before turning to the question of Natura 2000 itself, I would like to raise an objection to the way in which the Committee on Regional Development was bulldozed into an emergency meeting on this matter on Monday night."
"There was very little time to consider."
"We were told there would be an enormous outlay of EUR 6 billion, and now the Commissioner says that a minimum of EUR 22.75 billion will be made available for the 2006-2013 period."
"To compound matters, there was only one translation available, in English."
"I was disappointed to see the Committee on Regional Development voting in favour, although it did not do so unanimously, as Mr Hegyi stated, as I and several others voted against."
"This episode is a perfect illustration of the cavalier way in which this Parliament too often goes about its business, and that is no laughing matter given the profound effect the EU has on people’s daily lives."
"Natura 2000 is a case in point."
"Although we all appreciate that the environment is very important, the livelihood of human beings has to be the priority."
"Natura 2000 has had a negative effect in this regard."
"Let me give a good example from the Czech Republic, where an area has been designated to create feeding habitats favourable to partridges and quails and to reduce the erosion of soil and nutrients."
"My Czech colleagues tell me that this has been very good for the quails, but disastrous for the human beings who live and work there!"
"In the United Kingdom too, chalk downland, dry bog and hedgerows have been destroyed in the name of EU standardisation."
"The Habitats Directive, from which Natura 2000 derives, seeks to establish a common framework for nature protection as though wildlife were subject to academic theory."
"Nature, by definition, cannot be standardised, nor can real human lives, which is why UKIP opposes the dead hand of the EU wherever its grip extends."
"Mr President, I mentioned in my speech the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, of which I am a member."
"That committee voted unanimously on the report."
"I did not mention the Committee on Regional Development, so I was not mistaken."
". Many thanks, Mr President."
"Ladies and gentlemen, there can be no doubt that the Natura 2000 programme is a cornerstone of the European Union’s efforts to protect biodiversity."
"The debate initiated by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety in this House on the impact of the programme and how it should be financed is therefore extremely important."
"The benefits derived by the public from this programme are indisputable."
"The most significant come under the heading of public health, yet it should not be forgotten that tourism has also been boosted and job opportunities created."
"It is estimated that 125 000 jobs have been created in the 15 old Member States alone."
"For a number of years, however, it has been apparent that developments in the Natura 2000 network in Europe have not been backed up by appropriate funding for the creation and maintenance of this network."
"Admittedly, the European Commission has announced that it will adopt a strategic approach to financing the programme."
"What worries me, however, is that the proposal to cofinance the Natura 2000 network from various sources, for example the Rural Development Fund, the Structural Funds and LIFE+, the financial instrument for the environment, will make it impossible for the network to be implemented in a comprehensive, coherent and timely fashion."
"The fact that potential beneficiaries will need to apply for money from various funds will undoubtedly make it harder to obtain funding for specific protection measures."
"It will also become more difficult to monitor the implementation of the network at national level."
"According to the criteria currently used, certain areas do not qualify for funding under the various structural instruments."
"The latter have a number of different aims, which frequently relate to various types of land use, and sometimes even to specific regions."
"Separate funding is therefore needed to ensure that the Natura 2000 network can be established."
"If this money is not safeguarded, there may be gaps in the network’s funding during the next Financial Perspective, which covers the period from 2007 to 2013, and this could mean that a large number of protective measures are not implemented."
"As an example, in my country, Poland, most of the land that is covered by the Natura 2000 programme does not qualify for the above-mentioned funds, either because the land is part of the national forests, or because it is not used for agriculture."
"It is for this reason that I hope that appropriate funding will be earmarked to support the establishment of the Natura 2000 network during work on the next Financial Perspective."
"I thank you."
"– Mr President, I am sorry to say that, despite all Mrs Auken's efforts to improve the document, we are not doing well. I say this because I have never seen an initiative like Natura 2000 which has been backed by all MEPs and political groups and yet generated so much confusion, and in many cases, conflicting positions."
"Why is this?"
"Because the document itself is poor."
"It is a document born of good intentions, but technically speaking it is incomplete and muddled."
"Firstly, because it fails to distinguish between the different categories covered by Natura 2000: for example, between forests and agricultural land – the vast majority – where the land is farmed or a protected natural environment, as opposed to rivers, the sea and the sea bed."
"It would be folly to envisage applying rural development to the sea bed."
"How would it be funded?"
"The same problem arises in the case of rivers and wetlands."
"The different categories are not clearly defined, nor is the subject of funding dealt with clearly."
"For example, we see that the Structural Funds rules would need to be changed in order to finance Natura 2000, but the Structural Funds are based on statistics rather than qualitative terms, as is the case with Natura 2000."
"At the same time, when funding rural development, there should be an initial awareness-raising campaign because, in reality, environmental concerns and agriculture are relatively incompatible, and because the policy underlying Natura 2000 caused many landowners to lose land or have their activities curtailed."
"In addition, there has been no work to assess the extent to which rural development contains environmental elements that could be used to get farmers enthused about future landscape conservation and environmental projects."
"Unfortunately, as a result, this document has not been returned to the Committee, despite the importance of the subject to this Parliament and the good faith currently being demonstrated by its actions."
"In my view, both Parliament and biodiversity deserve a better document."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, in order to guarantee funding for Natura 2000, we need to be practical."
"We have spent a lot of time working on the subject in this Parliament, and as everyone has said, we are very concerned about the future of the Natura 2000 network."
"Three months ago, I had an opportunity to meet Mrs Day, the Director-General of DG Environment. At the time, Mrs Day made it clear that she had no plans to create a special fund for Natura 2000, no matter how legitimate requests from this House might be."
"The Socialist Group is therefore supporting the compromise solution agreed in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"It is an agreement which still allows for cofinancing or the creation of a separate fund whilst also leaving an extremely attractive option open within the new LIFE+ programme for all those activities that cannot be classified under rural development in their own right."
"In view of this, I would like to make an appeal for tomorrow's vote."
"My Group does not understand the last-minute amendments tabled by the PPE-DE Group."
"We do not understand because we do not feel it is worth creating division at the eleventh hour and throwing away the huge efforts made on all sides within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"We need to ratify the position."
"At the same time, we are also very pleased that the text to be voted on tomorrow includes a reference to the principle of proportionality when allocating funding, whereby, given that the network benefits the Union as a whole, countries such as my own, which have much greater biological diversity and more extensive protected areas, will not be required to shoulder greater costs."
"We would like to remind the Commission of this principle, although it is already enshrined in the Habitat Directive."
"The Natura 2000 network is one of the best moves made since the Union's inception."
"For this very reason we must continue to support the programme at Community level, working closely with the Member States."
"We are not opposed to cofinancing, but we are extremely concerned about the future of the network, particularly as many parts of the network are still unprotected at the moment."
"I call on the House to endorse the work done made by the Environment Committee, and in particular paragraph 5."
"Mr President, Commissioner, although I have every sympathy for you, I must tell you that we find it very regrettable that Commissioner Dimas is not here, because, during the last session in Strasbourg, we were not satisfied by the answers he gave us and we would have liked to express our dissatisfaction to him once again."
"Natura 2000 is a compulsory policy within the framework of preservation of biodiversity, and we are obliged to implement it."
"The European Commission proposes to finance Natura 2000 by integrating it in the ERDF fund and in the rural development fund."
"In my opinion, this constitutes a twofold error, because, even if the concept of transversality is a good one, in practice it is completely unrealistic."
"The European Union's priority is, quite rightly, growth and employment, and one could wonder what the weighting of matters relating to biodiversity will be in comparison with economic development projects."
"It is therefore unrealistic to integrate this financing into the Structural Funds or the rural development fund."
"How can we guarantee that Natura 2000 will get the funds it needs?"
"The members of the Committee on Agriculture, and those of the Committee on Regional Development, consider that there is a risk that this will also have a detrimental effect on the financing guarantees for those funds."
"We have thus all reached the same position: we consider that, under those conditions, Natura 2000 will not be financed correctly."
"Furthermore, some Natura 2000 areas are neither agricultural nor forested, and are not covered by either the Structural Funds or the rural development fund."
"In this case, these classified areas will not get any Community funding."
"How will we explain to the owners of this land, on which Natura 2000 classification has been imposed, that they will not benefit from the financial instruments?"
"In our opinion, only the creation of a specific fund will make it possible to guarantee that all land classified under Natura 2000 can obtain Community co-financing."
"We call for this fund to be implemented as part of the new LIFE + instrument, because we cannot talk constantly about biodiversity within the framework of sustainable development and at the same time dangerously compromise those few financial instruments that make it possible to act to promote biodiversity."
"– Mr President, I too would like to congratulate Mrs Auken on her excellent work, especially since she has incorporated nearly all of the proposals made by the Committee on Regional Development."
"Commissioner, we are concerned about the funding for Natura 2000."
"We agree with the strategic approach, but we also want to ensure adequate funding for Natura 2000, and we fear that if environmental projects have to compete for funding against other projects of greater socio-economic interest, they may well come off badly, especially when – as you yourself have said – the budget available is limited."
"We are definitely in favour of paragraph 5, because this opens the way for providing appropriate funding for Natura 2000 using a specific instrument within LIFE+, or of course, by increasing the Structural Funds and rural development funding to include a separate section for Natura 2000."
"We therefore ask the Commission to take this report into consideration since it covers all the factors which provide stability and genuinely guarantee appropriate levels of funding for Natura 2000."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, no one would argue with the fact that Natura 2000 is an extremely ambitious programme with demanding targets. It does a great deal to protect nature and the environment, and is also highly regarded by the public."
"The land we value so highly was developed and cultivated and is now maintained by European farmers, forestry workers and landowners, and safeguarding this land is also a key goal of Natura 2000."
"Appropriate funding must be guaranteed if we are to achieve these ambitious goals."
"Although Natura 2000 has been in existence for a number of years, and even though landowners have had to tolerate certain restrictions for a great many years, this is the first time that thought has been given to appropriate financing at European level."
"The Commission is proposing that the Natura 2000 network be cofinanced under the Rural Development Fund and the Structural Funds."
"As rapporteur for rural development, I must stress the need for a guarantee that Natura 2000 really will be financed under both funds, which will mean that we will need a larger budget for rural development."
"The property rights of our farmers and landowners must not be encroached upon without a guarantee of full financial compensation."
"Unless we safeguard funding in the long term, levels of uncertainty will continue to rise."
"Commissioner, as a result of the decisions taken at Brussels, which included a cap on the agriculture budget until 2013, and following CAP reform, which moved funding for modulation from the first to the second pillar – or in other words to cofinancing for rural development – the priority must be to ensure that landowners and farmers in particular get compensation for their efforts."
"We farmers have declared our support for sustainable agriculture."
"More Europe cannot be achieved with less money, especially not now there are 25 Member States."
"It is evident that the funding of the Natura 2000 network is still very precarious."
"As you have already heard, we have no problem as such with the integrated approach, as long as the Commission provides firm guarantees or guidelines, which are currently lacking, and, if I have understood the Commissioner correctly, will be lacking for some time."
"Funding, though, is a very important matter; this House has done its level best and has made every effort to convince the Commission that playing Pontius Pilate is all too easy an option."
"Putting things into practice is a different matter altogether, though."
"When we return home on Friday and a local government, farmer, environmental association or, indeed, our neighbour asks what we have agreed on, what it means to them in concrete terms and how things should progress from here on, we will be unable to give a reply."
"Yet, it is important to create a solid social support base to set up the Natura 2000 network."
"Since the procedure for the implementation of the Bird and Habitat Directives was carried out without input from the public, we are still – in my country at least – waiting for its publication, because it is a very sensitive issue politically speaking."
"If we want to give Natura 2000 a fighting chance and not again give people the impression that the matter is being decided from the top down, it is important to inform them as soon, and as accurately, as possible about the implications of this decision."
"To the public, it really makes no difference whether the funds are sourced from a special fund, a structural fund or a rural development fund."
"What they do want to know is whether, and by whom, they will be compensated if certain things are no longer allowed or if their land has been reduced in value."
"Questions such as ‘Am I allowed to build a house?’ and, in the case of agricultural land, ‘what about the fertiliser issue?’ will most certainly surface."
"It therefore follows that the Commission must communicate in plain terms as quickly as possible."
"There is too much uncertainty, which certainly does not benefit the environment."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall probably not succeed in giving all the answers that Members are expecting, but I shall try at least to give some clarification."
"It is obvious that the need for adequate funding for the Natura 2000 programme is something that the Commission accepts."
"It is also obvious that, as the rapporteur said, Natura 2000 falls within the scope of European Union cofinancing."
"First of all, we have to see how to guarantee this funding."
"On behalf of the Commission, I can assure you that financing Natura 2000 from existing funds will be made even more effective."
"That will be possible because the priority of financing Natura 2000 will be included in the strategic guidelines relating to the various funds designed to finance the initiatives which are soon to be presented by the Commission and which will help the Member States in presenting their programmes."
"We believe that, by placing this priority right among the strategic guidelines, we shall be able to adequately guarantee its financing."
"Secondly, we have to see how the Commission can contribute to the appropriate use of the available funds."
"I can tell you that by the end of this year the Commission will publish a guidance manual designed to explain the funding procedures for Natura 2000, while in 2006 workshops will be organised in every Member State to explain the funding opportunities."
"The Commission is committed to launching these initiatives, which are intended to encourage the submission of programmes that can be effective and will thus meet the requirements for obtaining finance."
"Some speakers underlined the possibility of using the Life+ programme."
"That programme does not exclude the funding of specific initiatives included within the Natura 2000 network."
"In that respect I can mention just a few examples."
"There are certain actions that the Commission considers can be financed through Life+, for instance initiatives in the field of communication, support for setting up local partnerships for the specific promotion of areas and sites that are part of the Natura 2000 network, the development of initiatives relating to the marine environment, which is an extremely important aspect, and innovative schemes for protecting animal or plant species."
"These are just a few examples that show how, in the Commission’s view, even Life+ can be used to finance Natura 2000."
"Lastly, I would recall the possibility of financially supporting marine sites."
"You are aware that the Commission’s proposal on the European Fisheries Fund does not specifically mention the Natura 2000 sites."
"The Commission understands, however, that this proposal allows for the possibility of supporting activities designed to develop the marine environment."
"In that spirit, therefore, the possibility of financing activities that promote the marine environment will be considered."
"I believe that the points I have mentioned provide at least some further reassurance that the Commission certainly does not intend to call the priority of Natura 2000 funding into question."
"– Mr President, I would simply like to say that it is now extremely clear to me how wrong it is that it is not Mr Dimas who is here."
"We have simply heard someone reel off the options that exist within the existing sources of funding – something with which we were already very familiar."
"That was already established at the outset."
"What we drew attention to is the fact that if no commitments are introduced, matters will not work. All our previous experience shows that such opportunities are not utilised."
"It is rather disappointing that the Commission stands here giving us a lecture on the options that currently exist instead of answering the questions put in the course of the debate."
"I am well aware that Mr Frattini is not in a position to do that, but to send a Commissioner who is not responsible for this area and who can therefore only make general comments is not the right way to treat Parliament."
"Commissioner Frattini has also convinced me of his expertise on Natura 2000."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"The next item is the oral question to the Commission by Joseph Daul and Jean-Claude Fruteau, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the forthcoming reform of the common organisation of the markets in sugar (B6-0013/2005)."
"Mr President, as a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and as a sugar producer and grower, I will not be taking part in the final vote today."
"However, I will take part in the debate."
"That does not necessarily apply to the Commission proposals when they come out."
"But today I will not be voting in the final vote."
"I take note of what you have said."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Fruteau, I shall be very brief, because I am anxious to give my friend Mr Fruteau, who has written the report, the speaking time which he needs."
"I should simply like, Commissioner, to mention three points."
"First of all, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and Parliament, by means of the vote which will follow at midday, are asking you for market management via a system of quotas and a safety net in order to avoid a drastic fall in prices."
"Secondly, we very much hope that this reform will make it possible to establish a market organisation which will foreshadow a new way of approaching our relations with third countries, and in particular the ACP countries, with which we are linked through the sugar protocol."
"I am against the liberalisation of agricultural products at any price: it is the sort of dogmatism that can only lead to disaster."
"I would like there to be regulatory tools making it possible to stabilise prices within the European Union and at the level of the international economy."
"That is why, Commissioner, together with my fellow MEPs, I believe that we should have instruments prohibiting triangular trade between competitive countries such as Brazil, poor countries and the European Union."
"We need to keep an eye on this type of trade which is in the process of becoming established, both in the context of the GSP and in the context of the new organisation of the sugar market."
"Thirdly, I should like to draw your attention to the difficulties which the Community sugar market is currently experiencing."
"According to my information, the sugar surplus in the European Union is 850 000 tonnes compared with last year."
"It seems that these stocks are the result of incorrect assessments of available stocks and of consumption in certain Member States."
"This has given rise to unusual trade flows."
"In these circumstances, Commissioner, an in-depth study should be carried out into this illogical solution which is currently in place on the Community sugar market, in order to determine the cause and find a way of managing this problem."
"That is what I wanted to tell you on the three points with which we are concerned."
"I shall now leave the rest of my speaking time to Mr Fruteau, who has worked very hard on this dossier."
"Ladies and gentlemen, of course, after this speech, I am asking you to adopt the resolution, which has been approved, practically unanimously, by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on 21 February the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, by 31 votes out of 35, adopted a common position on the reform of the common organisation of the markets in sugar."
"This large majority demonstrates the degree of equilibrium which we achieved and which takes into account the opinions of most of the political groups and nationalities represented in this House."
"The subject is a complex one."
"On the one hand, bearing in mind the international economic context, the reform of the common organisation of the markets in sugar is now necessary and unavoidable."
"On the other hand, however, it must not neglect the position and the future of the men and women who depend on this sector, both in Europe and in the countries that are our trading partners."
"From this point of view, the draft resolution lays down clear guiding principles: adjusting the sugar COM in line with the rules of world trade, increasing the competitiveness of the sugar sector, guaranteeing a decent standard of living for those engaged in the sector – a social objective – either by enabling them to keep their jobs or, if necessary, retraining them, and at the same time complying with the principle of Community solidarity which takes account of the most vulnerable regions and States within the Union and also our historical trading partners, the ACP countries and the least-developed countries."
"In order to respond to these demands, we need to define four principal themes which will guide the future reform of this sector."
"First of all, as far as the timetable is concerned, the forthcoming reform must remain effective until the end of 2012, so that those engaged in the sector can have the long-term outlook which they need if their investments are to succeed."
"Secondly, the lowering of prices and quotas must be limited to what is strictly necessary in order to take into account the interests of European farmers."
"It must also be backed up by a level of compensation which really corresponds to what is needed."
"Finally, as a replacement for the quota transfer mechanism, which is unfair and destructive for the most vulnerable countries, the resolution proposes the setting up of a special fund, managed by Europe and budget-neutral, which will make it possible to organise the restructuring of the sector."
"Fourthly, the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have at last come out strongly in favour of a system of market regulation which makes use, in particular, of an adaptation of the ‘Everything but Arms’ initiative in the sugar sector."
"This major theme is aimed at maintaining the consistency and viability of the COM by requiring the European Union to be in a position to retain control of the supply of sugar on its market, while at the same time responding to repeated requests by the least-developed countries themselves, who are well aware that the illegal triangular trade which may be encouraged by unlimited access to the European market will not provide any profit for the development of the economic and social structures in the least-developed countries."
"Finally, together with these four main themes, the draft resolution emphasises the need to take into consideration the special situation of the extremely remote areas of the Union, looking at their geographical and structural constraints as well as their specific economic and productive development needs."
"Emphasising the important and irreplaceable role which the growing of sugar cane plays in some of those regions, the report comes down heavily in favour of total compensation for any loss of revenue which overseas farmers might suffer and demands, equally firmly, that the essential mechanism of marketing aid should be retained."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in view of the current blockages to which the Commission’s radical measures have given rise within the Council of Ministers, only the European Parliament is currently in a position to act as the driving force in defining the detailed rules for the implementation of the sugar COM."
"This is the ambition of our report, which adopts a position which I regard as balanced, consistent and proactive, and tending towards a reform which will be effective but also based on solidarity."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking Mr Daul, Mr Fruteau and the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for all the work they have done."
"The drafting of the resolution and the hearing on 30 November last year make valuable contributions to our thorough preparations for this important reform of the common organisation of the markets in sugar."
"Allow me to make a few introductory remarks before responding to your questions."
"The need for reform of the sugar sector is inevitable."
"Based on the consultations I have had with stakeholders in recent months, it is my clear impression that this view is widely shared."
"The question is ‘how far’ and ‘how fast’ we should move."
"I sincerely believe that we need an ambitious reform."
"I should now like to make a few comments on the major issues you raised in your resolution."
"With regard to price and quota cuts, I am convinced that there is a future for sugar production within the European Union, but that it must be based on competitiveness."
"We therefore need to accept that sugar production should be concentrated in the areas where it has a sustainable long-term perspective."
"The price cuts proposed in the communication will keep us well below current world market prices."
"I am therefore convinced that the proposed 33% price cut and the 2.8 million quota cut are a necessary minimum to achieve an effective reform, balance the market and respect our international obligations."
"The less thorough we are now, the more likely it is that we will have to reform again in the near future, with ensuing uncertainty for the sector."
"It is clear that the reform will force farmers and producers to take important, and sometimes difficult, decisions about their future in the sector."
"We have to offer them a clear outlook."
"I therefore consider predictability to be a key issue."
"I have taken good note that this is a concern shared by Parliament."
"I therefore do not intend to include the idea of a mid-term review in two or three years in the legislative proposal."
"Instead, a long-term perspective will be offered."
"Farmers will receive compensation equal to 60% percent of the reduction in the institutional price, through the single farm payment scheme."
"This will offset the loss in revenue."
"Past experience shows that income loss at farm level does not equal the price cut."
"That is especially true for sugar, where the farmers will no longer carry the cost of the production levy."
"In any case, the reform needs to be budget-neutral, which limits the degree of compensation."
"If we go beyond 60% then other sectors will have to pay, through a reduction in their direct payment."
"With regard to the quota transfer between Member States, the communication introduces this as one of the key elements in driving the necessary restructuring within the sugar industry."
"Quota transfers could facilitate production moving to regions where the production conditions are best, and at the same time provide regions that are not competitive with an opportunity to give up their quota and invest the proceeds in alternative economically viable activities."
"Your concerns about the quota transfer have not gone unnoticed."
"If our objectives can be achieved through alternative instruments then that deserves thorough consideration."
"I have been particularly interested in the ideas put forward in the resolution on making the transfer subject to some degree of control by Member States and farmers, and on the setting-up of a special fund."
"I am currently exploring those ideas."
"The creation of a specific fund forms a particularly important element of my reflections."
"Let me be very clear on the ‘Everything but Arms’ – EBA – initiative, which is one of the cornerstones of our trade relations with the least-developed countries, the LDCs."
"It was the result of an unprecedented unilateral concession made by the European Union, and a logical step given our commitment to the development of these countries."
"It would be a wrong signal to roll back our privileges to the LDCs, particularly in a year where we are trying to convince the rest of the developed world to follow our example and increase market access to developing countries."
"I am therefore against a renegotiation of the EBA initiative."
"Furthermore, a system with regulated imports at remunerative prices would lead to a price reduction which is too small and thus inefficient."
"We should not give incentives for unsustainable investments within the EU or in Third World countries."
"We recognise that the sugar reform will imply certain adjustments of the sugar sector in the ACP countries concerned, but we have also clearly indicated that we are prepared to accompany this process."
"On the basis of an action plan the Commission presented on 24 January, a dialogue with the ACP countries is currently taking place."
"It is the Commission’s intention to submit the final action plan on accompanying measures in the form of a communication to the European Parliament and the Council in mid-2005."
"The last point I want to address is the WTO."
"The final ruling of the WTO Appellate Body is fixed for 28 April 2005."
"Our reform proposal will take due account of its outcome, and with that we will have brought the common market organisation for sugar into line with our existing WTO obligations."
"Let me conclude with the timetable."
"For internal and external reasons I consider it absolutely necessary to reach an agreement on the sugar reform by November at the latest."
"In fact, the current sugar regime expires on 1 July 2006."
"The sector has to know sufficiently in advance what the new sugar regime looks like in order to make their decisions for the common marketing year 2006-2007."
"Furthermore, we have a clear interest to indicate to our WTO ministerial partners, before the conference in December this year, what the basic elements of our sugar reform are."
"Otherwise we run the risk of the sugar issue spoiling the Hong Kong meeting in the same way that cotton did the Cancún meeting."
"The UK presidency has scheduled discussions in the Council in order to reach final political agreement in the November Council."
"To meet this timeframe I will present the legislative proposal to the European Parliament and the Council by the summer."
"I know that I can count on your cooperation to make this timetable possible."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I wish particularly to thank the rapporteur, Mr Fruteau, and the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, Mr Daul, for the excellence of their cooperation on the motion for a resolution on the reform of the common organisation of the markets in sugar."
"I also, however, want to thank all the other Members of the House who have made constructive contributions to making this motion for a resolution what it is."
"On my travels around my electoral district in Bavaria, sugar beet farmers ask me why it is necessary to amend, root and branch, the market organisation for sugar, which has stood the test of decades."
"The farmers and workers concerned are very disappointed by the Commission’s proposals of 14 July 2004."
"I then explain to them that the market organisation needs to be reformed in order that sugar beet may continue to be cultivated in Europe in the future."
"What we want our motion for a resolution to achieve, Commissioner, is that sugar beet may in future continue to be grown in the European Union and sugar cane in its border areas, with sugar factories continuing to produce sugar."
"This concerns 350 000 farming families in Europe, and 230 sugar factories with an untold number of employees."
"The Commission’s proposals go too far; in many European regions, sustainable cultivation of sugar beet would be a thing of the past, and sugar cane would no longer be grown in the border areas."
"The only beneficiaries from the reform would be a few major sugar-growing countries such as Brazil, which, in contrast to the EU Member States, invariably produce their crops to very low environmental and social standards."
"Our environmental organisations would scream blue murder if, in Europe – as happens in countries such as Brazil – whole rivers were to be pumped dry in order to irrigate land, and if hundreds of thousands of hectares of land were to be burned off, with the animals living there having no chance whatever of escaping the flames."
"Such a way of producing sugar cannot be the yardstick against which European sugar production is to be compared. The argument that consumers in Europe would stand to gain from reduced sugar prices is one that leaves me cold, for, although cereals now cost not even one-third of what they did 40 years ago, the price of bread has multiplied over the same period of time."
"The EU’s Council of Agriculture Ministers, at its meeting on 18 November 1997, described the multifunctional tasks of European agriculture in the following terms: ‘The Council believes that European commercial farming must be multifunctional, sustainable, competitive and spread throughout Europe."
"It must be capable of caring for the countryside, maintaining the natural environment, making a substantial contribution to the vitality of rural areas and meeting consumers’ needs and requirements in terms of the quality and safety of food, and the protection of the environment and of animals.’"
"If you want that sort of multifunctional agriculture in Europe, then you have to grant it protection accordingly."
"We therefore call for imported sugar to be produced subject to the same social and environmental standards as sugar produced in the EU."
"We urge the Commission to comply with the demands of the ACP states and give consideration to how the EU, using a regulation for this purpose as part of the ‘Everything but Arms’ initiative, can continue in future to manage the quantity of sugar supplied."
"We also expect the Commission’s legislative proposal to contain explicit proposals on how to prevent what is termed ‘triangular trade’ being carried on through the least-developed countries."
"Let me close by adding that I would not want to see a global market in which production lacked the environmental dimension."
"I do not want a global market that exploits people and entire regions."
"I urge you to give the motion for a resolution a broad majority, and thereby get the Commission to incorporate our demands in its legislative proposal."
"Mr President, Commissioner, nobody in this Parliament questions the need for reform in the sugar sector."
"You explained the reasons why it is necessary very well in your speech."
"What we do question, however, is the proposal presented by the Commission and, from my point of view, there are two fundamental reasons for this: firstly, because it creates an unbalanced distribution of reductions within the European Union, placing the burden on the least-favoured regions; and, secondly, because it does not guarantee that the income of producers of beet will be maintained."
"In fact, in my country, Spain, its application would mean, in practice, the disappearance of much of the 118 000 hectares of crops in Castilla y León, in Andalucía and in Castilla-La Mancha, and would affect 23 000 producers."
"The problem, once again, Commissioner, is that the Commission is presenting proposals despite the fact that the impact study has not taken account either of the effects of these reductions in prices and quotas on the incomes of family farms, or of the loss of jobs in the industry and its affect on the rural life of the States in question."
"Commissioner, we believe that the reduction in prices should be smaller and more gradual, and should remain coupled to a significant proportion of the aid in order not to unravel the economic and social fabric of the producing areas, which, in my country, are located in the least prosperous regions."
"Furthermore, the reduction in quotas should begin with surplus quantities and those intended for export, which do most damage to the international market in this product."
"We are completely against - and I would put it that strongly – the transfer of quotas between Member States."
"We believe that this method would produce, or could produce, a relocation of jobs and economic activity within the European Union, which would create the greatest imbalance in the least competitive States, and would create a dangerous precedent within the CAP."
"With regard to the external element of the proposal, the ‘Everything but Arms’ (EBA) initiative should include quantitative instruments for controlling imports similar to those that already exist for ACP countries."
"That is what the representatives of the ACP countries and of the LDCs are asking for, and this is fully reflected in our resolution."
"I would like to end, Commissioner, by asking you to take account of something that both Mr Daul and Mr Fruteau, my two fellow rapporteurs for this proposal, have said: this resolution has been approved with a broad consensus in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development; so please present suitable legislative proposals that reflect the observations made in it."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to call for us to have the EU’s common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector reformed as soon as possible and the way prepared for a liberalisation of the whole market in sugar."
"The reforms have been a long time in preparation."
"This gives rise to uncertainty as to how long the present arrangements will last and, especially, as to when they will be changed."
"European sugar producers are ill served by this uncertainty. I therefore welcome a final settlement concerning the organisation of the markets in the sugar sector."
"The WTO has pronounced its judgment upon the organisation of the sugar markets – a judgment that calls upon us to get something done about it."
"I also agree, of course, that we must wait for the appeal over the next two months, but we need to accept the consequences of this appeal once its result is made known."
"European sugar production is both efficient and competitive."
"Some changes will of course occur, especially regarding where production will take place in future."
"It is very important, however, for us to make it possible for production and, thus, also the quotas, to move to where production is best and thus also cheapest."
"That is the very best we can do for the European sugar producers, while we of course have a duty to equip producers to face the competition that exists in the world market."
"We must not disregard the concerns expressed either in the EBA agreement or by the world’s poorest countries."
"The latter have arranged their production in accordance with an artificial price in the European market, and they must naturally be helped in the transitional period that will exist on the way to freer competition in the world market."
"It is no help, however, sticking to the present arrangements so that they can sell what they produce at artificially high prices in the EU’s internal market. In fact, quite the reverse is true."
"Last but not least, it is of the greatest importance for us to ensure that every country in the world removes its subsidy for sugar production so that there can be competition in a free and fair market."
"We must of course demand that imported sugar be produced in accordance with the same social and environmental standards for sugar production with which we are familiar in Europe."
"Mr President, the Commissioner spoke of the need for reform, and I agree with her; the common market organisation for sugar has itself been corrupted by the sugar industry, which was geared to consumption plus privileged access for sugar from the ACP countries."
"A situation then developed in which C sugar, too, was, in effect, dumped on the global market, and in which the quantity of sugar arriving from the ACP countries was re-exported, which cost the budget another EUR 1.5 billion."
"You say, though, that you want to cut the quantity by 1.8 million tonnes. If we include the C sugar, the cut will have to be by between 4 and 5 million tonnes, which will end up on the global market."
"It follows that you must reduce quantity rather than price."
"We can accept a reduction in price, but, if you are proposing 33% without allocating a quota to the least-developed countries – something that does not go against the rules that we have, but simply prevents them from becoming transit countries – then this 33% is not enough, for, even under these conditions, the multinationals will use these countries as transit routes through which to dump their sugar back in the European Union."
"It follows that you will have to cut the price again to make that less appealing, so it would be better if you were to describe this as liberalisation, without beating about the bush."
"If you want to maintain a market organisation, you have to get to grips with what matters – the quantities rather than the prices."
"I am strongly opposed to bonuses being paid for the reduction in quantity that I regard as perversion and for which the sugar industry itself bears responsibility."
"It makes no sense, and does not benefit the farmers, for these 1.3 or 1.5 billion to be paid out as bonuses – they are swallowed up and do not benefit the farms."
"Instead, what matters is that the sugar business should be arranged in such a way that the cultivation of sugar makes money."
"That does not happen with C sugar, and that is why C sugar must no longer be allowed on the global market."
"Farmers can do with it whatever they like – anything, that is, other than dumping it on the global market."
"That is something we have to lay down, and what we have to do with the EUR 1.3 billion that are not going to be used as a bonus is to put them in a fund for the development of the rural economy and for diversification in the least-developed countries and in the ACP countries, in order to enable their economies to develop."
"Nor does it make any sense whatsoever to compensate these countries, for if they are compensated for no longer making any money out of sugar, from what are they meant to fund their economic development?"
"We put money into these countries, and we have to put it to work – not by paying it as compensation, but by initiating economic development, by making them dependent on things other than sugar, enabling them to earn money by supplying sugar to the European Union with the preferences and quotas that they have, whilst at the same time enabling them to provide for themselves and promoting rural development in the artisanal and technical spheres."
"It would be a forward-looking strategy if we were to use the market organisation for sugar as a means to come up with a development strategy and to consider the fundamentals of the shape global trade should take."
"Liberalising tendencies are present in all our political groups; that much is apparent from the amendments, including those from my own group, and you, Commissioner Fischer Boel, are – perhaps without even wanting to – making concessions to those tendencies by having to take the next step in five years’ time, when you will, in essence, be doing away with the organisation of the markets in sugar."
". – Mr President, the Commission proposal for the new sugar regulation and today's statements by the Commissioner basically come within the framework of the reform of the CAP – even if she does not admit as much – and, of course, of the spending cuts on agriculture."
"The proposed 33% reductions in quotas and prices and the abolition of intervention and intervention prices will cause unemployment casualties on small and medium-sized farms and in sugar factories."
"The drastic reduction in prices and the reduction in quotas will erode the income of beet producers and force them to abandon farming, with no alternative means of survival other than unemployment."
"At the same time, sugar factories which are not viable – and they are quite numerous – will close and entire areas will be abandoned, both in northern Greece and in Calais in France and in other countries."
"In Greece, factory closures mean dead towns and, more importantly, dead towns in remote areas."
"Nevertheless, imports will increase."
"However, imported sugar will be cheaper for the industries which use it as a raw material, but not for consumers, who never pay less for any product, even if its price drops."
"Beet producers in the countries with which the European Union has preferential agreements will also lose, because it will import sugar at lower prices."
"Consequently, it is hypocrisy to say that poor countries will benefit."
"The real reason for these changes is the drastic reduction in the agricultural budget, so that it can be used for other repressive and reactionary policies and to favour exports of products from the European industrial monopolies to Brazil, India and elsewhere, thereby sacrificing and condemning beet producers and workers in the sector, who will join the armies of the unemployed."
"Minor improvements and minor changes, with limited and meagre subsidies, compensation and funds do not change the spirit or the objective of the proposed regulation."
"They are no solution."
"The only solution is the coordinated fight by farmers and workers to change this anti-farming and anti-grass roots policy."
"Mr President, over-production of sugar is another manifestation of the obscene common agricultural policy that protects certain producers for political reasons and penalises consumers for the same political reasons."
"The French produce 160% of their domestic requirements in sugar, and dump the rest on the Third World."
"The British produce 50% of their requirements, and import the remainder from African, Caribbean and Pacific countries."
"British sugar producers act responsibly and are not the cause of the problem."
"They will suffer through ill-considered so-called reforms."
"Real reform for Britain will only be accomplished when we withdraw from the common agricultural policy, and indeed from the European Union itself."
"This resolution has left a sour taste with British sugar producers, many of whom have written to me and my British colleagues."
"The UK Independence Party will vote against the resolution and its amendments, which will damage the interests of British sugar producers."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is undoubtedly a need for reform of the regime governing Type C Sugar, partly in view of the latest developments at the WTO, but we believe this should be included within the key points of the overall CAP reform."
"That means making the necessary changes, while not losing sight of the essential aim of keeping the sector internationally competitive over the medium and long term."
"Instead of this, we have the impression that the European Commission, in complying with the constraints of production cut-backs imposed by international treaties and free trade agreements, is intending to sacrifice certain producing areas, which are frequently the weakest."
"That will be facilitated by the Commission’s planned mechanism for the purchase of quotas by one Member State from another."
"On a European level, the closure and abandonment of many sugar plants and the move away from sugar beet production by many agricultural enterprises all confirm that competitive pressure is constantly on the increase as a result of the reduction, in real terms, of the guaranteed price for volumes produced."
"To conclude, the measures proposed by the European Commission should certainly be viewed as unacceptable, since the excessive reduction in the benchmark intervention price, the major fall in sugar beet prices, the partial 60% compensation and the introduction of private storage put the survival of the sugar beet sector at great risk."
"In our view, the future proposed law should instead be based upon quotas and guaranteed prices, linked to real national production quotas."
"It should also protect the European single market, by introducing import restrictions; it should introduce more effective customs rules for checking the origins of products, reduce quotas to a level which would suffice for internal consumption and introduce or maintain measures to reduce the structural disparities – for instance, authorisation for state aid in order to protect the interests of farmers living in the Union's under-privileged areas, guaranteeing the continuation of a multifunctional agriculture throughout the European region."
"Commissioner, I agree with you that the analyses confirm that our only prospect lies in the enforcement of the market in the sugar sector as well."
"But, as indicated, the most important thing is to control the gigantic spectre of vested interests, behind which stand thousands who are profiting from the market as it is currently regulated."
"I think that a key question for us in the European Parliament is whether we will more or less succumb to these vested interests, or whether, as the highest political agency of the European Union, the Parliament will decide in principle whether fundamental market values should prevail in the sugar reform, or whether bureaucratic principles will continue to dominate."
"Today, Commissioner, I am among those who see here, in the draft resolution, a willingness to give priority to a more extensive influence of the market in the sugar reform, which is why I also support it."
"I personally do not think it is necessary to discuss the exact elaboration of the related procedures, as this is a technical, rather than a political problem."
"In conclusion, I would like to confirm that we support the view that only more genuine competition in the European market, the sugar market included, will enable us to hold our own in competition in the dynamic and developing global market."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are all aware that society has, over recent years, started to make quite different demands of agriculture, and when I say that, I am thinking not only of CAP reform and of the current WTO negotiations."
"If these demands are to be met in every area, it is understandable that the common market organisation for sugar has to be reformed."
"That having been said, Commissioner, the role of policy must be to create fair framework conditions under which our farmers can continue to produce sugar in the European Union, and do so sustainably, economically, and in a socially acceptable way."
"The communication presented by the Commission in July 2004 on the reform of the sugar sector does, however, by its approach, involve profound effects on, and changes to, the existing market organisation for sugar."
"Although this House’s Committee on Agriculture is not opposed to such a reform, our motion for a resolution does advocate a moderate approach."
"We reject the quota transfers that the Commission originally envisaged, believing as we do that quotas should remain with the producers, that is, with the farmers."
"We also take the view that the planned cuts in prices and quotas will add up to considerable losses in income, and that we cannot disregard alternative uses either, for which there is a great deal of potential, particularly where biofuels are concerned."
"Our farmers can expect to lose income, and for that they must be compensated accordingly."
"I am confident, Commissioner, that this House will, when it votes today, endorse the compromise that the Agriculture Committee, over and above all party boundaries, has made such a good job of hammering out, and I very much hope that the Commission will listen to its messages when the time comes for it to present its legislative proposals."
"We say ‘yes’ to reform of the sugar sector, Commissioner, but it needs to be done with sensitivity."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Fischer Boel, the sugar market may be seen as the last of the Mohicans when it comes to products whose regime has not been reformed over recent years and which have so far escaped the philosophy behind the new common agricultural policy."
"Which direction should the Commission's legislative proposals take?"
"First, they should ensure that all sugar-producing regions are treated equally."
"Secondly, they should apply the philosophy behind the reformed CAP to the new measures."
"Thirdly, they should express the international solidarity of the European Union with developing countries."
"In view of the foregoing, I consider the following to be particularly negative points in the Commission communication:"
"First, the lack of compensation for beet producers' incomes following the reduction in support for products; when the CAP was reformed for cereals and beef, compensation covered 90% of the reductions in direct subsidies, whereas for sugar they only cover 60%."
"Secondly, the system of transferring quotas between Member States proposed by the European Commission will result in the concentration of production in specific regions only."
"Thirdly, the external aspects of the regime require especially careful handling."
"In particular, commitments in the sugar sector should not exceed the limits which are absolutely necessary within the framework of the WTO."
"Similarly, the economic and social repercussions in less developed countries should be handled tactfully and efficiently on the basis of the choices of the developing countries themselves."
"To close, I consider that it should be clarified and maintained that quotas belong to beet producers and compensation for producers in third countries cannot be financed from the agricultural social fund."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the sugar reform being discussed is an extension of agricultural policy reform."
"Its central component is price reductions, amounting to almost 40%, and quota cuts."
"This would involve a price cut of roughly EUR 2.5 billion."
"As it is industry that uses most of the sugar, approximately 75%, price cuts would hardly be reflected in the consumer prices of manufactured products, but would mainly constitute a benefit to the sugar industry."
"There is a certain feature of the reform of the sugar sector which has been absent from previous agricultural reforms."
"Fundamental to it would be the notion that sugar production quotas could be transferred from one country to another."
"This way it would be clear to all that sugar production was being transferred to the regions best suited to its cultivation, and it would end in countries that were unfavourable in terms of their natural conditions."
"This would be of no benefit to the EU budget."
"Such a solution would be a dangerous precedent."
"I earnestly appeal to you, Commissioner, that such a lack of solidarity among Member States should not come about."
"I was happy to note that in your opening speech you were prepared to re-examine this point."
"Mr President, I would thank the Commissioner for sticking with a reform of the sugar markets, however modest this may be."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development’s resolution is, however, appalling, at least if global solidarity has even a minor role to play in political life."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development believes that sugar production in the EU and, preferably, throughout the world should be regulated by quotas."
"That is a profoundly odd point of view."
"Sugar production should instead be set free."
"The committee makes a few polite nods in the direction of the developing countries, but it is transparently obvious that its main concern is sugar production in the EU."
"We do not help poor farm workers in, for example, Brazil by making export conditions there worse."
"It is possible that, if the market were opened up, a large part of the profits would go to the landowners, but it is impossible to argue that such opening-up would be directly to the financial detriment of farm workers."
"In the EU, half of the aid goes, moreover, to the sugar industry."
"If there is a genuine desire to do something constructive to benefit the poor sugar-producing countries, it is the ILO that should be strengthened and, in Brazil, President Lulla too."
"In Brazil, negotiations with the government could be proposed to make sure that the plantations comply with the ILO’s demands."
"To impose quotas and the EU’s social and environmental standards upon all the other countries would be to disregard the ‘Everything But Arms’ agreement which says that, by 2009, the least-developed countries should be able freely to sell sugar to the EU."
"The concerns expressed about the developing countries are hollow."
"This is also apparent from the fact that what the EU saves on export subsidies for sugar is now to be used to secure incomes, and not for the developing countries."
"The proposal to use sugar as a fuel is beyond the pale."
"I support all the amendments by the Socialist group, and I also think that others should do so, for the sake of the developing countries, agriculture and the EU."
"Mr President, for the sake of some vague compromise with the WTO, we are getting ready to throw tens of thousands of workers onto the street, to close down dozens of undertakings, to deal a terrible blow to European agriculture, and to call into question the development of many countries."
"Yet who will profit from this reform?"
"Will it be the farmers?"
"Who could possibly believe such a stupid idea, when the gross loss of income is announced as being 50%?"
"Perhaps it will be the consumers?"
"That is really hard to believe, because a fall in the producer prices paid to farmers has never had any effect on the purchasing power of households."
"How about small producers in the Southern hemisphere?"
"Our experience of the coffee market and of sugar production in Brazil is hardly going to convince us."
"On the other hand, the multinationals in the agri-food industry have cause for celebration."
"Thanks to the Commission and the WTO, they will be able to force more young children to work on the sugar-cane plantations."
"They will be able to exploit a little more the suffering men and women who are often paid less than 100 dollars a month."
"They will be able to watch their profits swell enormously on the basis of a social disaster."
"This reform is also giving rise to terrible anxiety throughout the most remote regions."
"Our group recently visited Réunion, at the invitation of Mr Verges, and we were able to see for ourselves the extent to which this reform was a catastrophe for that island."
"In addition to the need for total compensation, a problem of consistency has also arisen."
"Despite the fact that, for over 40 years, the greater part of the European Union’s investments have been devoted to the development of the cane-sugar sector, and the fact that that sector represents one third of final agricultural production, 25% of electric production and three quarters of exports, it is now proposed to call into question the very existence of this strategic development action, without there being any possibility of an alternative which could cope with the consequences."
"We must understand the full scope of the consequences of this reform."
"At the request of Mr Verges, our group would like the Commission to undertake to submit to Parliament a study of the impact, particularly the social impact, on the real situation of the outlying regions."
"We would also like the same type of study to be carried out on a European scale."
"Mr President, let me finish by saying that we are convinced that there are solutions to be found within a real policy on the regulation of the sugar market, of which Europe should be the promoter."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the proposed reform of the common organisation of the market in sugar runs counter to the aims of the common agricultural policy, namely ensuring a dignified standard of living for farmers and the sustainable development of agriculture, and it also contradicts the Lisbon Strategy."
"The proposal to reduce both the A and B quotas is unacceptable."
"Its impact will be strongest in the new Member States, particularly in Poland, where the sector has already been cut drastically in recent years, and only 43 out of the original 78 sugar processing plants remain."
"There has been no investment in modernisation."
"Instead, workers are being condemned to unemployment, and consumers are paying more for their sugar, not less."
"There is a real threat that sugar production will be concentrated in just a few plants due to the transfer of quotas between Member States."
"As a result, sugar would be produced in the regions where farming is most expensive."
"It is also incorrect to claim that importing more sugar from the poorest countries into the Union will improve the financial situation of those countries."
"On the contrary, only speculators and trading companies will profit."
"EU taxpayers and farmers, including those from Poland, will be the ones who pay for this."
"Poland will become an importer of sugar, whereas previously it was one of the main producers."
"The Commission’s proposal for reform of the sugar market will result in a monopoly by the large undertakings that are already absorbing their competitors."
"This is all to be promoted by quota cuts and by the so-called transitional reduction in prices, lowered to dumping levels."
"It appears that the common agricultural policy is only common for a select few, and that is dangerous."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, I have, as you know, used every available opportunity in this Parliament to raise the matter of the sugar industry."
"Sugar beet growing and sugar processing have a long tradition in my country, dating back almost 80 years."
"The impact assessment adopted earlier by the Commission shows that Ireland is one of countries particularly vulnerable to price reductions for sugar and sugar beet."
"The implications of the proposal on price and quota cuts, even allowing for compensation, would make sugar beet growing no longer viable in Ireland."
"The proposals in their current form would be devastating for the Irish industry at both growing and processing levels and there would be a direct threat to the 3,800 farmers currently growing sugar beet."
"On the manufacturing side, the industry has in the past provided a very important employment opportunity in the sugar plants, in addition to supporting employment in associated industries."
"Some of these jobs have already been lost."
"The Carlow plant in my own constituency has announced its closure, with all the associated socio-economic problems."
"The uncertain future of the sugar sector has, in my opinion, seriously contributed to this closure."
"The European Commission's initial reform ideas are already causing unacceptable casualties."
"This view was also expressed by the agriculture ministers of 10 Member States, including Ireland, in a joint submission to the Agriculture Commissioner."
"We all accept that reform of the existing regime is necessary."
"However, reform should aim at maintaining the existing distribution of sugar beet and sugar production in the entire European Union territory."
"Reform should be based on the following principles. First, an import system from third countries should be put in place, which will ensure predictable and regular import quantities."
"Secondly, the price reductions should be significantly less than what is currently proposed and implemented more gradually."
"Thirdly, the impact of the quota reductions should fall mainly on those Member States that are net exporters of sugar."
"The transfer of quotas among Member States should not be allowed."
"In recent days, the Commission has approved excise relief for a bio-ethanol pilot project in Ireland using rapeseed oil and I particularly welcome that. A few years ago a feasibility study was commissioned by the sugar processing sector in Ireland, with a view to producing bio-ethanol using surplus sugar beet."
"Surplus beet is of limited value to growers and an ethanol plant would provide an alternative outlet for a significant quantity of such beet."
"Apart from the obvious benefit of bio-ethanol as an alternative energy source and its potential contribution to a cleaner environment, some of the by-products produced would also be of value to the fertiliser and animal feed sectors."
"I know you accept this, Commissioner, and you have said so in a previous response."
"Because of the current reform process in the sugar sector, it is time for all the governments concerned, all the relevant Commission directorates and the commercial sector to act and seriously re-examine the possibility of developing a sugar-based bio-ethanol industry."
"In Brazil, the rain forest is being destroyed to grow sugar that nobody wants, so sugar-based bio-ethanol is being produced instead."
"It can be done; the technology is there."
"Commissioner, I appeal to you again to have another look at your proposals, come back and be mindful of the people that you represent."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the system of national limits creates unfair divisions in the European sugar market."
"It works to the advantage of the multinationals, and of those holding a sugar monopoly."
"These enterprises make enormous profits at the expense of individual consumers and producers."
"Nonetheless, the issue of reform of the common organisation of the market in sugar should be approached very carefully."
"Mr Daul’s and Mr Fruteau’s motion for a resolution is very well-balanced, and provides for the interests of all the parties concerned."
"It rightly draws attention to the difficulties experienced by new Member States as a result of cuts in production quotas."
"Any future reform of the sugar market should maintain production and fully compensate farmers and workers employed in sugar plants for the losses incurred, guaranteeing them a dignified standard of living."
"Mr President, the beginning of 2005 marks the introduction of the EU's new CAP reforms."
"The CAP reforms require European farmers to become more competitive and efficient, while maintaining sustainable environment-friendly farming practices."
"The single farm payment requires farmers to produce the goods demanded by the marketplace."
"The sugar regime therefore needs to be reformed in order to fit in to our new agricultural policy."
"I welcome the communication from the European Commission, which aims to remove trade-distorting subsidies from the EU sugar regime."
"However, there are several areas that still need improvement."
"European sugar prices currently stand at nearly three times the world price, and these artificially high prices must be reduced."
"At the same time, though, a full liberalisation of the sugar market would have an adverse effect, not only on the European sugar industry but also on the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries and less-developed countries."
"A large price cut would place ACP and LDC countries at a competitive disadvantage in relation to countries that can produce sugar at a very low world price, notably Brazil."
"Oxfam has claimed that unfettered liberalisation will harm the most vulnerable."
"Brazilian expansion would also be at the cost of thousands of acres of rainforest and savannah that contain precious biodiversity and wild life."
"It is necessary to bring the sugar regime into line with CAP reforms, and we must abandon C quota, which I believe will be ruled illegal by the WTO."
"Also, when we make quota cuts, it is B quota that should be targeted first, because it is this quota that is being exported onto the world markets, thereby distorting trade."
"We must follow the CAP principles we have established."
"In order to establish competitive sugar production in the EU there must be cross-border quota transfers to allow more efficient areas of the EU to be ..."
"Mr President, allow me to chip in with my own, somewhat different angle."
"I disagree with the gist of the resolution, and in principle, I support the Commission proposals, beginning with what it says about C-dumping and C sugar."
"Dumping does indeed cost us EUR 800 million per annum, and is completely at odds with what is supposed to be done according to the world trade agreements."
"We will be forced to stop this practice without delay and we should not think that we could eke it out for a few years."
"The Commission proposal still maintains a world price, or market price in Europe, which is double – or, nowadays, three times – the world price."
"Those who argue in favour of wholesale liberalisation and contend that everything should be freed up, have not, in my view, read the Commission proposal properly."
"I consider the proposal to be sensible, although there is room for improvement on a number of points."
"I would particularly refer to the action plan for the poor countries."
"It is, of course, true that a number of those countries must invest in industries in order to become more competitive."
"I do not think it is realistic for the money for this to come from the European Development Fund."
"This is where the funds that we ourselves save in this sector of agriculture could be used, not only for the European agricultural sector, but also for the ACP countries."
"I would also like to say a few words about the quotas."
"Trade is, of course, the best way of helping countries."
"At present, the least-developed countries can increase their levels from 120 000 tonnes to 209 000 tonnes. What is stopping us from doubling this 1% of the European market?"
"That would be an excellent compensation for the countries involved for the period up to 2009, and it could really mean that they have an income."
"Commissioner, you were right in saying that we should steer clear of ‘Everything but Arms’."
"Let this Parliament not bring shame on itself by turning this soon into ‘Everything but Arms and sugar’."
"That would take the cornerstone out of a fair world trade policy and it would mean that we would promptly fail at Doha."
"That should not happen."
"I wholeheartedly support the proposals, and I hope that you want to improve and strengthen them."
"Mr President, when Commissioner Fischler tabled his three proposals about a year ago, it was evident that only one of them was reasonable."
"We must change the sugar market; there is no escaping that."
"We have to acknowledge that this will have serious implications for many parts of Europe."
"What is essential to the whole sugar policy is the issue of what the future price of sugar in Europe will be."
"The Commission thinks it can control that price by introducing a reference price."
"Perhaps the Commission could explain this again, as we have hitherto always had an intervention price for the most important products."
"How can the reference price really guarantee a price on the European markets?"
"As regards the least-developed countries and the ‘anything but arms’ initiative, the Commission insists – and this is also related to the future price – that a quota system for those countries would not be realistic."
"How confident is the Commission in the light of its experiences in the Balkans where, initially, sugar imports were also unrestricted?"
"The Commission was subsequently forced to backtrack and introduce a quota system."
"Why would this not apply to the least-developed countries?"
"I share the view of many that the Commission should give more attention to the peripheral regions."
"Finally, I should like to say something about Mr van den Berg’s amendments."
"I think it is an extremely bad idea for the compensation intended for the least-developed countries to be paid out of the agricultural budget."
"Development aid is not only for farmers, it is intended for all sections of society."
"Mr President, I wish to thank the MEP who honourably declared his interests."
"Today, the Commission is my ally, in spite of the fact that the reform does not go far enough."
"Sugar policy is governed by big business and the self-centredness of the big farmers."
"Small farmers, consumers and poor countries are hit."
"Current sugar policy in the EU has some thousands of winners and 450 million losers."
"If we take account of the effects upon literally millions of people around the world, current policy is scandalous."
"It is good that my fellow MEPs in the Committee on Agriculture are going to Mali in April where they are to defend today’s report before the ACP-EU Assembly."
"The Committee on Development and the Committee on Agriculture should share the responsibility."
"A weakened reform will lead literally to famine and destitution."
"It is hypocritical to use today’s proposal to defend subsidy-dependent sugar production in every corner of the EU and, at the same time, demand thoroughgoing reform in all the poor countries."
"Everyone must play his or her part."
"Finally, the criticism of the ‘Everything but Arms’ initiative is unjustified."
"The problem is not that the ‘Everything but Arms’ initiative exists but that it is not supplemented by social and environmental considerations and by guarantees for small farmers."
"Mr President, it is a matter for regret that the Commission’s current position is exactly the same as it was last year."
"We would be faced with a relocation of sugar beet production from the present production areas to more competitive areas, accompanied by a drastic reduction in prices, which would seriously affect the development of the numerous less-developed regions of the European Union, including Portugal."
"That would undermine sugar beet production, the sugar industry in general and the only factory we have in Europe; the quota allocated to it is so small that it could not be reduced without making its operation untenable."
"Equally worrying, however, is the impact of this reform on production in the autonomous region of the Azores, given the need to maintain this activity in that outermost region."
"There is also a need to maintain stability, safeguard refinery supplies and preserve the balance between the refining and processing of sugar beet, if we are to avoid the disaster that this reform would entail on the basis of the proposal before us."
"Mr President, the European industrial beet producing sector has said a unanimous ""no"" to the European Commission’s proposal and has spoken out against a reduction in institutional prices, a cut in production quotas and the possibility of transferring quotas, a measure that would clearly benefit the most competitive countries at the expense of others, such as Spain."
"Spanish beet producers alone will suffer losses that could amount to as much as EUR 60 million per year."
"The possibility of transferring quotas from one country to another would lead to a concentration of European production in a few regions and the impoverishment of rural life in many areas in which sugar beet production plays a very important social and economic role."
"In its communication, the European Commission itself acknowledges that this reform will also lead to the closure of sugar production plants. In other words, it accepts that its reform will have damaging consequences."
"The Commission does not take account of the situation of countries such as Spain, whose production of sugar has always been in deficit."
"In my view, the draft resolution of the European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development must be seen as a document of minimums, which should provide the basis for the negotiations within the Council of Ministers of the European Union."
"The Commission should not once again ignore the concerns of the sector and should take careful note of what I hope will be this Parliament's rejection of its proposal in the vote that will take place today."
"I also hope that this European Parliament will reject the package of measures presented by certain Socialist Members, whose approach runs counter to the negotiations that have already taken place amongst various political groups."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate the two authors, Mr Fruteau and Mr Daul, who had an extremely difficult and complicated duty to perform."
"It was their task to temper the exaggerated radicalism of the European Commission and find a satisfactory compromise."
"There is no doubt that a real reform of the sugar sector needs to be implemented, but it is essential to avoid any kind of shock treatment."
"We must avoid causing thousands of producers to stop producing sugar in Europe."
"The reform ought to guarantee appropriate compensation for producers following price and quota cuts."
"From the point of view of the new Member States, of which Hungary is one, the transferability of quotas will have catastrophic consequences."
"I should like to draw your attention to the fact that Amendment No 38, which seeks to freeze isoglucose quotas, would have very serious consequences for both Poland and Hungary."
"In this area we support the Commission’s position."
"I am asking for solidarity among my fellow MEPs in this respect, and I would ask the European Commission to take very serious account of the proposals contained in Parliament’s resolution."
"Mr President, the present European sugar regime is untenable at world level; it is unaffordable and it distorts the market."
"Europe alone still spends more than EUR 3 billion annually on export subsidies for agricultural products, including sugar."
"In the current WTO Doha negotiations, the rich countries promised to reduce those subsidies drastically."
"The success of this important trade round will partly be dictated by the willingness to deliver on this promise."
"In the sugar reforms, we cannot, of course, overlook our commitments to the ACP countries."
"The sugar protocol to the Cotonou Agreement accords them preferential treatment for their exports to Europe, which they can sell at the same, subsidised price as the European producers."
"If this support is cut back, this will also be at the expense of the many sugar farmers from the South for whom sugar is often the only source of income."
"Temporary compensation and transitional measures such as those for the European sugar producers are not available to them."
"It can surely never be the intention for tens of thousands of farmers in the South to be plunged into even greater poverty as a result of our sugar reform."
"Mr President, I should first of all like to congratulate the Commissioner on addressing the issues raised by this debate."
"One can have a different opinion about the direction and manner in which reforms are being carried out, but this is something I greatly value ."
"I would also like to congratulate Mr Fruteau and Mr Daul, who have done excellent work and have tabled a resolution that has the ring of excellence about it."
"Why is this resolution so good?"
"In any event, it shows understanding for the need for reforms, as well as understanding for the fact that this touches upon many social aspects."
"Moreover, the resolution illustrates that sometimes pure liberalisation in agricultural policy has the opposite effect and it is better to reach sound agreements worldwide."
"I am therefore surprised that there are still many in this discussion who still believe that the liberalisation of the world food trade is the perfect solution to resolve all evils in development cooperation and the fight against poverty."
"Sometimes, one wonders what this unshakeable belief is based on."
"Over the past ten years, world trade in food has been further liberalised, and Europe now accounts for 85% of exports from Africa to the developed word."
"What does this add up to?"
"Hunger and poverty have increased, 40% of children in the world are starving and the European consumer enjoys anything but lower prices."
"It will not come as a surprise that in that respect, I also have major objections to the amendments, including those tabled by my Dutch fellow MEP, Mr Van den Berg."
"I sometimes wonder – and I think it is positive to highlight this in the debate – how it is possible that he should first want complete freedom and then believes that the solution will materialise from the chaos on the world food market."
"I do not share this belief."
"I believe in agreements, worldwide and in Europe, in order to achieve responsible reform."
"His idea that the agricultural budget should fund development aid amounts, in my view, to nothing more or less than doing your shopping using someone else’s wallet ."
"No one can go without food for a day, and I hope that that will be the for the further debate about the sugar reform in the course of this year."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their report."
"I think they have done an excellent job of work, bearing in mind the angle from which they approached it and their representation of farmers’ interests."
"It is rather unfortunate that this resolution takes no account of the points of view of the trade or development committees, and I hope we will be able to do that when the House comes to debate and consider the Regulation."
"We should certainly ensure that we are in line with our obligations to the WTO, and that we comply with its Appellate Body’s decision, and I very much endorse the Commissioner’s proposal."
"Although, as many Members have indicated, changes are needed, it generally tends in the right direction."
"I have tabled Amendment No 37, which I hope will be supported."
"It explicitly reiterates our support for the ‘Everything but Arms’ initiative, and, in that context, for the reforms to which reference has been made."
"Perhaps I might also be permitted to respond in a small way to Mr Sturdy’s interesting comment that he intends to abstain, or refrain from voting, on the grounds that he, while being a member of the Agriculture Committee, is also a producer for the sugar market."
"Whilst I see this as cause for rejoicing, I do find it remarkable, as he is also a coordinator on the Committee on International Trade."
"Perhaps he should reconsider his position and, in that capacity, perhaps reflect more the position of the trade committee than that of the agriculture committee."
"It could be that this would help the House as a whole to evaluate what is before it now."
"Please allow me, by way of conclusion, to again ask the Commissioner when and how she plans to actually submit her actual proposal for the trading of quotas in the Member States."
"I got the impression from what you said that you have some doubts, and was myself not entirely sure what line you took on the suggestion made in the resolution that this should be abandoned and replaced by a fund."
"Perhaps you could say something more on the subject."
"– Thank you Mr President."
"Commissioner, I would like to take a slightly different tack."
"The present sugar regime has been in force, unchanged, for 40 years."
"At the same time, the European Union is no longer the same as it was 40 years ago."
"The main shortcomings of the present sugar regime are the lack of competition, market distortions and high prices."
"The lowering of the sugar price is an issue of key importance for the new Member States, including Estonia."
"Since Estonia is not a sugar producer or a sugar beet grower, the whole burden of the higher sugar price is shouldered by the consumer."
"At the same time, there are no producers in Estonia who would benefit from the higher price."
"Today Estonia is one of the Member States with the lowest average income, and the price of sugar will affect the quality of life of people with a lower income in particular."
"Sugar is a significant component in the consumer’s average shopping basket."
"The price of sugar in European Union countries is up to three times higher than the world market price."
"Knowing this, people in our country rushed to buy sugar just before accession, and we are now in a situation where our sugar reserves are larger than those permitted in the EU."
"We are threatened with a sugar fine."
"According to data held by competent State bodies, 2/3 of this reserve is in the hands of the general public and was not bought for speculative purposes."
"We ask you to take into consideration your own Directive No 6…"
"Mr President, today we are debating the difference between reform and destruction, between helping the developing world and enriching the powerful forces in the global sugar market."
"This House and the Commission have a huge responsibility to get the balance right."
"Reform of the sugar market is required, but destruction of the sugar market to the detriment of workers and farmers here in the European Union is not acceptable."
"Yet that is the inevitable outcome of the proposed reforms."
"These reforms are too drastic in terms of price and quota cuts."
"The inevitable consequence is the closure of the sugar industry in some Member States."
"The proposal to trade quotas across borders is a new departure and one which will assist in the winding down of the sugar industry, especially in peripheral regions."
"It must also have implications for milk quotas."
"Alongside this threat, we do not have clarity as to who actually owns the sugar quota;"
"I think it is essential that the quota be vested in growers of beet."
"But let us look beyond the borders of the European Union."
"The ACP countries, which already enjoy preferential access to the EU market, have expressed their concerns that the reforms will hinder and not help their economies."
"Further afield, Brazil is waiting in the wings to increase massively its sugar production."
"There are some who lick their lips in anticipation, mainly the dozen or so sugar beet barons in that country."
"However, for the poor, the landless, the workers in the sugar mills, there is no such eager anticipation, because they will not benefit."
"In reality their lives will be made even more miserable, as the barons grab land and destroy the environment in pursuit of profit."
"For us sugar is sweet, yet in Brazil the landless speak of sugar with the taste of blood."
"We must be fully aware of the consequences of what is proposed."
"We have a chance to get it right for the developing world and the EU sugar industry, but the current proposals are not the solution to this dilemma."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it is hardly surprising that there should be such strong feelings about the proposed reform of the sugar market."
"Firstly, it affects sectors crucial to the further development of the food industry, for which sugar is one of the main raw materials."
"The three-fold increase in its price makes it difficult for this industry to develop and compete on the world market."
"A second important aspect of this reform is the need to regulate one of the most prized European Union initiatives, namely assistance to the poorest countries, for whom sugar is a major export and source of income."
"The Everything But Arms programme is a relevant example."
"The third and most important aspect of the proposed reform is its impact on agriculture within the Union."
"This is particularly true in the case of my country, Poland, which is the third largest sugar producer."
"Implementation of the reform and an unrestricted transfer of quotas is likely to lead to production being concentrated in plants in countries that benefited from Union support in the past."
"This could well mean the end of sugar production in Poland, with the loss of several hundred thousand jobs."
"It would also make it necessary to import two million tonnes of sugar a year."
"Mr Daul’s and Mr Fruteau’s motion for a resolution contains many good ideas."
"It also points out to the Commission the need to achieve a compromise between the three factors mentioned, yet the Commission, by issuing the document in its present form, seems to wish to impact on the social structure of our electorate, including farmers, consumers and producers."
"Disputes are bound to ensue, and this at a time when the whole of Europe is engaged in debating the European Constitution and voting on it."
"The Commission must draft a new document to help both Brazilian farmers and farmers in the new Member States."
"The latter might well be feeling cheated, because the goalposts are being moved in the course of the game, as was the case for the budget."
"Alternative solutions such as the production of biofuels or cereals are needed for those likely to lose out."
"It is time for all interested parties, politicians included, to sit down together at the negotiating table."
"In particular, politicians need to explain to their electorate why they are proposing to deprive them of something they had spent so many years getting them used to."
"MEPs representing the new Member States can now for the first time take part in the debate on reform of the common agricultural policy."
"Reform of the sugar market is, for us Hungarians, especially important."
"In Hungary, the cultivation and processing of sugar beet go back more than a hundred years."
"However, Hungarian growers and processors now say that for us the European Commission’s Recommendation brings the danger that the sugar beet industry will be completely wiped out."
"We find this unacceptable not only from the social and economic point of view, but also because in Hungary farmers cultivate sugar beet on the best quality land, and if cultivation of sugar beet stops, then it will be replaced by wheat, thus further increasing the wheat surplus."
"The proposal approved by the European Parliament agricultural committee would benefit both European and Hungarian producers."
"This proposal abolishes the quota trade between Member States and makes the future of the sector less predictable, because the new rules enforce longer deadlines."
"It prevents the abuse of trade discounts set up by the EU, as is happening for example in the case of the western Balkan countries, because this illegal trade does not benefit producers in other countries for whom the preferences were originally intended, but the exporters of third countries, such as the Brazilians."
"A point of decisive significance is the recommendation to make the quotas the property of producers, stopping sugar beet processors from moving sugar production to third countries from the European Union."
"Although on this question we have no legislative powers, and can only voice our opinion, I nevertheless trust that the Commission and the Council will take this opinion into account."
"Mr President, whilst I admire the way my colleagues have pursued the interests of farmers and share their anxiety about the future of farming, I cannot agree with the approach they outline in the resolution."
"I much prefer the approach outlined by the Commissioner this morning."
"A 33% reduction in price support for sugar, a reduction in the quota and an end to export subsidies for sugar would all send a powerful signal to the Doha Development Round."
"If the Commissioner's timing can be adhered to and we can adopt our final proposal in November, this would create a very good environment in advance of the December Hong Kong meeting."
"It would help to obtain a settlement at that meeting and any settlement would benefit both the developing and the developed world."
"That would be good news."
"My colleagues are also wrong about farmers, because their proposal would not provide certainty for farmers and would give them false expectations of the support they can expect in the future."
"Finally, the 60% compensation scheme is equivalent to full compensation and the Commissioner should keep reiterating that."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has been confronted with the necessity and challenge of reforming its sugar policy, and indeed its agricultural policy as a whole."
"The current high sugar prices are having a negative impact on both European consumers and the poorest developing countries."
"The previous reform proposal and quota distribution, however, were a good example of what not to do."
"This proposal discriminated against the new Member States, which had already had to adapt to the quotas imposed upon them during the accession process."
"I can illustrate this with the example of the Czech Republic, which during the 1990s cut annual production from over one million tonnes of sugar to 435 000 tonnes."
"Manufacturing capacities were rationalised at the same time as these cuts were made, which means that production is now efficient and competitive."
"Yet no such process has taken place in the old Member States, and this should not be forgotten when drafting the new reform proposal."
"If quotas are to be reduced, then it is the turn of the old Member States to bear the brunt of these reductions."
"What must not happen is a situation whereby the proposed quota for the Czech Republic, for example, is so low that the country cannot even produce enough sugar for domestic consumption."
"This would not be because we would not be able to produce it efficiently; it would be so that other European producers could export their sugar to us, thus solving the problem of WTO restrictions at our expense."
"Such a solution is not only uneconomical; it violates the basic principles of European integration."
"I believe that those who draft the reform proposal will realise this and put forward a solution that does not discriminate against anyone."
"I thank you for your attention."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it must surely be possible to take the multifarious statements that have been made today and make of some of them a legislative proposal for making sugar production sustainable both here and in what we call the developing world."
"To those, however, who believe that a global market price must be imposed, I would like to say that nowhere in the world could anyone produce at such prices in a way that does not harm the environment, is socially just, and is also rational."
"That is utterly out of the question."
"As Brazil is on everyone’s lips, let me say that, until a few years ago, the overwhelming majority did not care what happened to the plantation workers and the landless there."
"I would warn against shedding crocodile tears, as Mr Deß has done, and many others to a lesser extent."
"We are dealing here with a good measure of protectionism."
"The Brazilian Government is endeavouring to introduce social and ecological standards in this area, and we should be supporting it in that."
"If it succeeds in doing so, prices will rise in response to that, but let me remind you that they will still be only half what they are in the European Union."
"I do believe, though, that we will come up with proper solutions."
"Mr President, the Commissioner has heard many speeches today, as well as my remarks at the beginning of the debate this morning."
"I believe that one country has caused this whole problem."
"Madam Commissioner, when we go to the Hong Kong Round, in my view you are slightly mistaken to think that reforming the sugar industry will give us a strong position in Europe."
"I was present at Cancún, and if my memory serves me correctly, Mr Fischler had done a pretty good job of reforming the common agricultural policy."
"But it was quite clear that no-one actually understood what had been done."
"The Americans, in particular, seemed to draw the line and say ‘we are not going to do anything except protect our agriculture and our business’."
"It is clear that the sugar industry needs reforming: we have been dumping sugar on the world market and destroying it."
"But have we actually destroyed the world market or, is it Brazil, as Mr Kreissl-Dörfler has just said?"
"Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf mentioned ACP and LDC countries."
"Let us be absolutely clear that the LDC and ACP countries want access to our market, at market prices; that means keeping prices reasonably high in the European Union, so that they can have access at the prices they believe are safe for them."
"I say to Mr Martin that I was surprised that the PSE Group tabled so many amendments, particularly to the resolution."
"I did not realise its members felt they had the right to be spokesmen for the LDC and ACP countries, which have a slightly different view from what is proposed in their amendments."
"I leave you with one last thought."
"It is clear that the reform of the sugar industry will only benefit multinational companies, not the LDC and ACP countries."
"Mr President, answering all these very important questions within two-and-a-half minutes is not very easy, but I will do my best."
"It is up to you to stop me when you think I have spoken long enough."
"I have been listening with great interest to all the various statements."
"I believe that we need an ambitious reform, a reform that actually brings the sugar regime into line with the 2003 CAP reform, allowing farmers to take decisions that are market-driven and not based on political decisions."
"It must also be a reform that will enable the necessary restructuring of the sugar sector, to secure its long-term viability within the European Union."
"As regards prices, let me be quite clear."
"Maintaining prices at levels three times as high as world market prices is becoming increasingly difficult to justify and will certainly not lead to a sustainable European sugar sector."
"We also need a reform in order to live up to our international commitments."
"As for employment, the current regime does not guarantee the maintenance of jobs."
"Over the last decade, 17 000 jobs have been lost as a result of continuous gains in productivity."
"If the current regime remains unchanged, it is estimated that there would be around 15 000 fewer jobs in 2012, a loss of more than 75%."
"The goal is therefore to achieve a competitive sugar sector in the Community, so that the remaining jobs in the sector enjoy long-term sustainability."
"There were quite a few questions on impact assessment."
"The Commission has carried out an impact analysis that gives a clear answer to the main questions relating to the reform proposal, including its regional effects."
"I am convinced that more studies will not provide us with facts that we do not already know."
"Further analyses will just lead to a further delay in the decisions that we really have to take."
"On the point raised about ownership of quotas, under the current system the quotas for each Member State are fixed by a Council regulation."
"The Member State then fixes the quantities each sugar producer is allowed to produce under the national quota, and the sugar producers themselves may then distribute sugar directly to the farmer on the basis of delivery rights."
"Under the quota transfer system, as laid down in the Commission communication of last July, quotas may be transferred between sugar-producing companies, against payment, across national borders."
"This would mean that companies have access to valuable quota rights, which can be transferred and then paid for."
"The normal way to achieve this would be to allocate quotas to companies."
"However, in the case of the transfer of a quota, the company concerned would not only have to use the money paid for the quota for its own restructuring, but also for compensating the sugar beet farmers for the devaluation of their delivery rights."
"As I mentioned in my introductory remarks, I can envisage a restructuring fund system."
"Such a system could even leave the question of ownership of quotas untouched."
"The payments out of the fund could take the form of compensatory payments to farmers who suffered from the abandonment of sugar production in a given area."
"Many Members have criticised the transfer of quotas."
"I am willing to explore further the suggestion of a European restructuring fund, which could facilitate a quick exit from the sector by operators who might be interested in going out of business."
"This is an idea with tremendous legal, budgetary and political implications."
"However, provided it could be implemented in a safe and equitable way, a restructuring fund could be another tool that might be of great importance to our sugar restructuring objectives."
"It is clear that the reform will force farmers and producers to take important and sometimes difficult decisions about their future in the sector."
"We must offer them a clear outlook and, therefore, I consider predictability to be a key issue."
"I have taken note that this is a concern shared by Parliament."
"I do not, therefore, intend to include the idea of a mid-term review in two or three years in the legislative proposals."
"Instead, a long-term perspective should be offered."
"Finally, let me summarise the main intentions of this reform."
"It is important to pursue the principles and objectives set out in the July communication."
"It is also important to have a long-term perspective, to bring prices and European production to a sustainable level and to reopen the EBA negotiations."
"Then, with the help of the European Parliament, we must reach a final political agreement before this summer."
"I have received one motion for a resolution(1) tabled pursuant to Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12.15 p.m."
"I support the motion for a resolution, but at this stage I reject those amendments that run counter to the spirit of the motion, in particular those tabled by Mr van den Berg, Mrs Kinnock, Mrs Segelström, Mr Andersson, Mrs Westlund, Mrs Hedh, and Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, because on the pretext of on the one hand helping European consumers and on the other hand of helping the African, Caribbean and Pacific States and the least-developed countries, it poses a threat to EU sugar beet and sugar cane producers, and in particular, to producers in the European Union’s outermost regions, as it does not take the specific circumstances of those regions properly into consideration."
"The sugar-cane sector is of vital importance to the French Overseas Départements (DOMs) in terms of social, economic and environmental equilibrium."
"This sector no longer has any room to manoeuvre when it comes to industrial restructuring, and it is unrealistic to envisage any overall conversion, given the current state of international competition in the market for tropical agricultural products."
"The Commission must indicate what measures it has in mind in order to avoid the most remote regions’ being doubly penalised by the reform in question."
"In actual fact, those areas run the risk of suffering as a result of the proportionately more favourable treatment given to the ACP countries with which they are in direct competition, and as a result of the restrictions on their development capacity, whilst at the same time they do not play a part in the Community sugar surplus production."
"It is absolutely essential that the Commission, in its next proposals for the reform of the sugar COM, should translate the promised ‘special treatment’ for the extremely remote areas into specific technical measures accompanied by financial resources which correspond to the real needs of the sector and to the development objectives of those areas."
"I am counting on your support, Commissioner, to ensure that the legislative proposals for reform which the Commission will shortly be submitting will show a better understanding of the situation in our most remote regions."
"The next item is the report (A6-0039/2005) by Mrs Aubert, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the European action plan for organic food and farming [2004/2202(INI)]."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when we talk about organic farming there is a real paradox."
"Everyone – including you, Commissioner, and the European Commission as a whole – recognises the undeniable benefits of organic farming, in terms of the environment, biodiversity and health, but also in terms of employment and rural development."
"However, despite a growing demand on the part of consumers for products originating from organic farming, the organically farmed areas and organic production are not increasing, and still represent a very marginal share of overall production of agricultural products."
"It was with great astonishment that we learned of the Commission’s action plan in favour of organic farming, which we had been hoping would be particularly ambitious and accompanied by the appropriate resources."
"This is not how it has turned out, however, even though we note, with evident satisfaction, some welcome proposals, such as the public awareness and information campaigns, or the emphasis placed on public canteens and school meals in particular."
"Moreover, when it comes to organic products we could make a start with the catering facilities at the European Parliament itself."
"You do not identify any specific resources, i.e. additional resources, and nor are there any proactive – let alone mandatory – measures with regard to Member States, even though the need to harmonise the different policies of Member States on organic farming would appear to be obvious to everybody if we really want to contribute to the development of organic farming and reduce the disparities that exist."
"Nor do we find any progress on the nonetheless crucial question of genetically modified organisms, the coexistence of conventional crops alongside organic crops, or the issue of liability in cases of contamination."
"We are waiting for your proposals on these matters, without which Member States will finally be left entirely to their own devices on issues which are, after all, essential to organic farming."
"This is why the Members of the European Parliament wanted to see a much firmer commitment to organic farming, much firmer than information campaigns which, useful though they may be, seem to us to be an inadequate response to the issues at stake."
"Consequently, we believe that major investments need to be made, in particular to make the specifications for different products in different Member States more consistent and more precise, and to make better use of rural development funds by defining much more clearly the share which is assigned to organic farming."
"We hope that the FEADER programme, which is devoted to rural development, will make it possible to reply to these questions."
"These rural development funds also need to be strengthened."
"There are substantial threats hanging over these funds, and we cannot accept the plans to reduce the European Union’s overall budget, which would be likely to damage them badly."
"We would also like to make organic farming the subject of priority research within the framework of the European research programmes."
"We want increased aid to be granted to the economic structuring of the organic sector, from production and processing to distribution and marketing."
"Unless this sector is strengthened, we shall not achieve any real progress."
"It is also necessary to settle the issue of genetically modified organisms, and to improve significantly the inspection and fraud control systems in this area."
"All this must be done in collaboration with the people involved in the sector, the producer associations, consumers, cooperatives and all those who have been committed, for many years, to organic farming, unfortunately without much support."
"The European Parliament must also be fully associated with these policies, and I would draw your attention to the fact that any amendment to the regulation on organic farming should also be the subject of consultations with the Members of the European Parliament."
"Finally, we really must move away from the idea of a ‘niche’ as far as organic farming is concerned."
"It is not a small, separate sector destined for a sympathetic clientele which is well motivated with regard to environmental issues, and with a high disposable income which will enable it to have access to this type of food."
"On the contrary, we believe that organic farming can be the spearhead of a truly sustainable agricultural industry."
"As part of any future reforms of the common agricultural policy, which are, as we all know, inevitable, we believe that organic farming can serve as a model."
"Obviously, it is not a model that is 100% reproducible everywhere, but we believe that this type of farming, the merits and benefits of which are recognised by everyone, should be strongly supported and encouraged so that it can achieve much higher percentages of overall agricultural production."
"We are therefore counting on action on the part of the Members of the European Parliament, and we hope that the Commission will listen to this desire to declare support for organic farming in much stronger terms."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Members for their comments."
"The action plan gave me an opportunity to listen carefully to the stakeholders and to make use of their practical experiences in the further development of the agricultural sector."
"Let me just mention the main points that we have to keep in mind."
"Firstly, this is an initial attempt to build a comprehensive policy for organic farming within the European Union."
"Secondly, organic farming plays an essential role in the reform of the CAP."
"Thirdly, it is difficult to see a credible future for organic farming without sufficient market demand."
"I hope to return to give you my final comments and to listen to those of the Members of the European Parliament."
"Thank you very much, especially for being so concise."
"I anticipate that the Commissioner will have a further opportunity to comment on the various interventions at the end of proceedings."
"As the time allowed has elapsed, I shall now suspend the debate."
"The debate will resume at approximately 12.15 p.m., after the formal part of our sitting, and it will be followed by the concluding remarks."
"Thank you."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Ambassadors, a year ago, on the initiative of the European Parliament, our Union decided that 11 March would become European Day for the Victims of Terrorism."
"And we did so because, a year ago, Madrid awoke to the blasts of the bombs that cost the lives of 192 citizens of various countries."
"Spain has unfortunately become accustomed to the threat of terrorism."
"For many years we endured it."
"Many people were killed."
"But, even during the toughest times in the fight against the terrorist group ETA, Spanish society never gave up its freedom."
"Nevertheless, on that 11 March, that new and even more horrific attack added to the dynamic created by another attack, 11 September 2001 in New York and in Washington, which had woken the western world from its confident tranquillity and changed the world’s geopolitical pattern."
"On that 11 September, we said that we were all Americans."
"Then, in March, in Madrid, we said that we were all passengers on the Atocha trains."
"Today, in the Plaza de Atocha, the candles which turned it into a shrine of commemoration are no longer there, but the memory is still there, the memory of the victims who, as a sign of our respect, must become the symbol of our unity and not the banners of our political confrontation."
"Our first tribute to the victims must be to make them the symbol of unity amongst democrats, the symbol of the unity amongst those of us who believe in the rule of law and human rights."
"On that 11 March, the Europeans came face-to-face with a global view of the problem of terrorism."
"Until then, each country had had its own terrorists, but after 11 September, firstly, and then 11 March, terrorism took on a global dimension that required a global response."
"We Europeans came to realise that our values, and not just our lives, were threatened, and we therefore reacted together without forgetting that the fight for democracy was and would remain at the heart of our European political project."
"Let us remember that democracy has never succumbed to terrorism, but that military resources alone do not create it."
"Firstly, we must look back and assess how we were able to respond to those events."
"The first conclusion we should draw is that, perhaps, the deaths in Madrid were not in vain because, shortly afterwards, Europe reached an agreement that unblocked the drafting of its Constitution, which is now subject to ratification."
"They were perhaps a wake-up call that allowed us to overcome many of our differences."
"Secondly, we must ascertain whether we have really applied the commitments we made then, whether we have fulfilled all the agreements we reached amongst ourselves and whether we have really applied the measures we promised to apply."
"In this regard, perhaps we should acknowledge that we have not applied everything that our emotions at that time inspired us to agree."
"Many of the measures provided for in the action plan adopted by the Council following 11 March have yet to be fully applied, which must remind us that in order to combat terrorism we also need more Europe, because we are now aware that the traditional forms of judicial and police cooperation are not enough."
"The European Parliament has always been in the vanguard in the fight against terrorism, despite the limited role attributed to it by the Treaties in this area."
"This is clearly not the time to present a long list of everything Parliament has done, but I would like to express our profound conviction that the greater the Member States’ capacity to exchange police and security information is, the more effective policing will be, and we must therefore ask ourselves the question now, at a time when we are remembering the victims: what are the remaining fundamental problems preventing Europol from being fully operative?"
"When will we have a European Prosecutor?"
"When will we have European legislation to prevent the laundering of capital..."
"... which is a fundamental element in the fight against organised crime and its links with terrorism?"
"There has been positive progress in these fields, but some of the decisions adopted – and I am simply talking about what was decided following 11 September – have yet to see the light."
"I do not understand your indignation, because many political leaders from all over the world are discussing this very thing today in Madrid."
"That is what is being discussed today in Madrid at the International Conference, which is being attended by many dignitaries and experts from all over the world, and which I will attend following this formal sitting, together with the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Kofi Anan, and the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, who will present an action plan drawn up by the Commission for combating terrorism, which refers to some of the measures I have just mentioned."
"Yes, there in Madrid, and the day before yesterday here in Brussels and in Strasbourg, the need to combat terrorism from a global and complete point of view is being discussed, starting with full respect for the rule of law and not forgetting to look into the causes of terrorism and the instruments allowing it to grow and spread around the world."
"Let us not forget that, in order to guarantee our security, it is essential to promote dialogue and integration between cultures and religions, without forgetting development cooperation."
"This is not a comfortable or easy debate, but we cannot avoid it."
"There can be no explanation or justification for terrorism, but there are reasons why it arises and our analysis must take them into account."
"This analysis must take account of the need not just to respect the values and fundamental rights which form the basis of our Community, but also to apply preventive measures which not only prevent us from having to show regret every time, but which prevent us from ever having to do so."
"I am not of course just talking about prevention through war."
"I am talking about prevention in the broadest sense of the word."
"Internal and external prevention, within our societies, in order to ensure the integration of migrants, tolerance, religious and cultural pluralism, the fight against discrimination, cooperation between intelligence services and judicial systems..."
"... and also external action on many fronts: war, poverty, the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons; a world framework for combating terrorism, without forgetting, ladies and gentlemen – representatives of the citizens of Europe – that the most effective way and the basis for all forms of combating terrorism, is respect for the values upon which our Union is founded."
"Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen."
"And now, ladies and gentlemen, Ambassadors, in memory of those victims, who, as I said, must be the symbol of our democratic Union, I would invite you to observe a minute’s silence."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we shall resume the debate on the Aubert Report for about a quarter of an hour, so that we can close it and vote on it during this morning’s voting time."
". Mr President, this is an important topic for us to be dealing with, and consumers will be becoming ever more aware of it in the future."
"Our group has examined the issue of organic farming in very great depth, and regards it as very important."
"Indispensable though traditional agriculture is, we also have to consider its organic counterpart, and not only as a small sectoral niche with limited aims, but as something that will in future be a truly complementary source of supplies."
"For this reason, and also speaking for my group, I am very grateful to the Commissioner for her particular concern for this issue, which she has again underlined in her brief statement today."
"We must redouble our efforts."
"We have to stimulate demand, and we can do that only if we are able to iron out or resolve the problems in production, processing and operation."
"Although I do not, right now, want to go into details, for which I lack both the time and the capacity for attention, I do believe that a great deal of effort and quite a bit of imagination has gone into the 21 actions and three priority areas; what we need, though, is a bit more courage, including when it comes to setting aside the financial means needed to acquire human resources."
"That this must involve a timetable and the necessary controls is self-evident."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs Aubert on her report, which was approved unanimously in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and by expressing the Socialist Group’s satisfaction with the final result of the report."
"At committee stage, all of our amendments have been incorporated, and this has substantially improved the Commission's initial proposal, which began with 21 measures which were not very concrete, not at all ambitious and in no way binding."
"One of the objectives of the reform of the CAP is to combine the production of quality products with respect for the environment, and this type of agriculture is precisely the fundamental pillar required in order to achieve that twin objective."
"In certain European regions, such as Andalusia, over the last decade we have increased the area dedicated to these crops from 2 000 to 300 000 hectares as a result of the regional government being the first in Europe to have a serious and budgeted action plan for ecological crops."
"In general terms, the sector is increasing by an average of 30% per year."
"We will all agree, therefore, that, if the CAP acknowledges the importance of ecological agriculture, which is increasing, as has been pointed out, we cannot and must not leave the farmers and the Member States on their own at the end of the day."
"Neither is leaving it to the States to decide whether or not to promote this type of production the best solution."
"We in my group essentially believe that the Commission is being inconsistent."
"The qualities and virtues of this very important sector are stressed but at the same time it is not given clear and decisive support."
"Gestures are not enough."
"We also need real action and budgets."
"Ecological agriculture must become an integral part of a production system that supports the environment."
"We are working on the basis of a reality on which, furthermore, there is unanimity: farmers, consumers and all political bodies have shown a renewed interest in the phenomenon of ecological agriculture."
"It therefore falls to us in the European Parliament to insist on and encourage clear and decisive support for this type of agriculture."
"We believe that the action plan that we are voting on today is a first step and an opportunity for debate, but it is a weak and unambitious step."
"We shall not pretend that we did not want to go further. For example, the committee would have considered it appropriate to establish specific aid for the sector."
"More support is needed for marketing, certification, control, etc."
"Having said that, however, we believe that the Commission should go ahead with this plan."
"But what we must ask, particularly while the Commissioner is present, is that it be a genuine action plan and not simply a suggestion plan, and that Parliament show decisive support for this very important sector and this pioneering action plan that the sector needed so much."
", Ladies and gentlemen, authorising genetically modified organisms in agriculture, animal husbandry and on the Union’s market represents a major threat to organic farming, and above all to consumer health."
"It makes no sense to resort to GMOs in the event of overproduction of natural crops."
"The introduction of GMOs will result in the devastation of the natural environment."
"There may well be unexpected consequences for future generations, for example serious allergies, and also increased resistance of pests and weeds, increased resistance of bacteria to antibiotics and the disappearance of beneficial insects."
"Authorising GMOs will result in disputes amongst farmers."
"Those who decide to use GMOs in their production will be burdened with costs because of large claims."
"They will become dependent on the biotech companies."
"Potential controls on GMOs do not guarantee effectiveness."
"Dutch research confirms that it is almost impossible to produce meat without GMOs."
"Facts such as these undermine consumer confidence in organic farming."
"The laws of biology mean it is impossible for traditional farming to coexist with GMO farming."
"The Union is demonstrating its own kind of legal schizophrenia by authorising GMOs on the market whilst banning the use of GMOs in agriculture and cattle raising in organic farming."
"In view of the major dangers posed by GMOs, which are not yet fully understood, the European Parliament and the Commission are taking on an enormous moral responsibility by legislating in a way that runs counter to nature and the good of mankind."
"The future of European farming lies in organic agriculture and animal husbandry based on traditional and natural methods."
"I thank you."
"Mr President, I welcome this debate because, following the reform of the CAP, farmers need to look at alternative methods of increasing farm incomes."
"For some farmers this could be organic farming."
"In Northern Ireland we have a small but determined organic sector."
"Local supply and local branding are keys to success."
"There is little point in the farmers in the United Kingdom diversifying into organic production only to be undermined by products from South America coming in at a lower cost."
"Products from outside the United Kingdom may be organically produced, though in truth little is known as to whether environmental damage is done in producing some of those goods."
"The number of air miles involved in transporting the products is also a consumer concern."
"Those issues need to be factored into the WTO negotiations."
"I am also concerned about United Kingdom organic farmers being undermined by products from Eastern European countries."
"Again, short food miles and local branding are essential."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, the production of organic products cannot be seen as a utopian economic and social policy."
"On the contrary, it is a strategic policy which safeguards a new qualitative consumer standard, a new environmental standard and a new dimension to rural development."
"It is a framework which guarantees the protection of public health and a new way of safeguarding the competitiveness of agriculture."
"I should like to highlight two issues which are important to the further development and promotion of organic products as a dynamic sector in forthcoming years."
"First, the Member States must, when planning the application of the reformed common agricultural policy at national level, encourage young farmers to become active in the production of organic products, as well as granting rights from their national reserves for the promotion of organic farming in designated areas."
"The second issue – and this relates to the first – is the problem of the coexistence of organic crops and genetically modified products."
"Organic farming and the production of agricultural products with integrated management will be destroyed."
"They will be contaminated by the production of modified crops which, in addition, will also contaminate public health, in other words our health."
"The Commission and certain Member States must understand this and must renounce modified products, because the repercussions for our health are more dangerous than the repercussions from mad cow disease."
"The European Union cannot be hypocritical by promoting crops which respect public health and the environment, on the one hand, while allowing products such as modified products, on the other."
"It is time we made an honest decision for the citizens of Europe."
"Mr President, organic farming means nature governing food, but the EU wants a law of nature written in Brussels."
"The EU wishes to harmonise organic products and production, with more EU regulations and more EU snoopers."
"It is ‘straight banana’ time again!"
"Organic products come in all shapes and sizes, but the EU cannot accept that."
"The EU believes that nothing should escape manic control."
"People are selling food in pounds and ounces."
"When they are caught they are treated as criminals."
"Why?"
"Because this is EU control for the sake of it."
"The report praises the common agricultural policy, which was one of the worst EU mistakes ever."
"The CAP destroyed areas of British agriculture, and now the EU wants to destroy British organic agriculture."
"UKIP wants to see organic farming flourishing, not buried under tonnes of EU manure."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, once upon a time people used nitrates, pesticides and herbicides, and they were driven out of agricultural paradise."
"Now we cannot even eat Golden Delicious apples any more."
"Before, thanks to the good old organic pig, we could have tapeworms and other parasites, and with granny’s delicious home-made jams we could die of botulism."
"Now, thanks to industrial farming, we are living 25 years longer!"
"We shall therefore have to change all that, and go back to the age of Cro-Magnon man, to a landscape of biodiversity where the 130 000 organic farmers can frisk about, and where the 230 000 organic cows, the 400 000 organic sheep and the 230 000 organic pigs can all live happily."
"It is only one per cent of agriculture, but it is one per cent that changes everything."
"It is like the parting of the Red Sea, like Mahomet on his mare, or like Jesus returning at Easter. Organic farming is like that: it is of no earthly use, but it makes life bearable."
"Mr President, I would like to emphasise one recommendation of this report: the need for clarity in GMOs."
"I want it to be clarified that GMOs will never be allowed to contaminate an organic farm."
"This kind of clarity cannot be given on the basis of coexistence and promises of compensation after contamination: after contamination it is too late, it is no good to an organic farmer or to people who value their produce."
"GM crops are an experiment, by any definition."
"A good scientific experiment needs a control."
"I do not support the experiment, but if it is to go ahead I recommend Ireland as the perfect control."
"It is an island with predominantly westerly winds and therefore significantly protected from contamination by GMOs from neighbouring countries."
"With the control, we will be able properly to assess GM crops for 5, 10 or 50 years; if GM bellies up, there will be somewhere to get safe food and seed stocks."
"Today the European Council is deciding whether to write the public out of the GMO process."
"Will the Council today, with the support of my own country, Ireland, make GMOs exempt from the Aarhus Convention?"
"This must not happen."
"It is an issue of vital importance to organic farmers and their customers and to all stakeholders."
"We must insist on the right to take part in all decisions made about our environment."
"Mr President, I welcome this report on organic food and farming."
"The growth of this industry in some Member States is to be applauded, but it must be acknowledged that some Member States have provided less financial support than others. These include the United Kingdom, where nothing more than lip service has been paid to the development of organic farming."
"I realise that you cannot force people either to grow or to eat organic food."
"However, I strongly believe that you should encourage both, and that if the will is there the desire will be there too."
"We now have an opportunity to encourage diversification."
"Following the mid-term review, farmers are looking for alternative ways to carry on their business."
"Unfortunately, I believe that leaving this to Member States would be a total disaster."
"Many will do nothing to either encourage demand or improve marketing for organic farming, which faces the same challenges as other branches of the industry, with the growing power of multinationals squeezing profit margins and dictating standards."
"Organic production is no longer a niche market."
"It is the long-term future of agriculture."
"The support provided to organic farming should be used to help open up new opportunities for the sector and to create an alternative to so-called conventional farming."
"Both sectors have a future, side-by-side."
"Both must be mutual and complementary."
"The one thing I now see clearly is that there are no real level playing fields in agricultural production, be this organic or conventional, and I firmly believe you can only achieve this from the centre and with positive encouragement."
"Mr President, I should like to make a few comments on the report."
"First, with regard to public support for sustainable agriculture, the action plan acknowledges the role of organic farming in society."
"In delivering public goods, organic farmers incur high production costs."
"They should be entitled to be compensated for income foregone and costs incurred when delivering those public goods."
"That is exactly what we recommend that Member States do within their own development programmes."
"On the other hand, as stated in the report, the successful development of organic farming depends crucially on customers’ willingness to pay a higher price to have organic food."
"That brings me to the next point: promotion and marketing."
"Consumers must be given the correct information in order to stimulate demand."
"The Commission has already contributed to organic food information and promotion campaigns."
"I am fully aware that we need to make use of the best expertise available when taking the further steps set out in the plan."
"I have a great deal of sympathy for your call to promote organic food for children and school canteens, but want to have advice on this from specialists."
"We need to be sure that we reach our target groups, and must therefore use the right channels in our marketing campaigns."
"Regarding the internal market, I share your concerns about the obstacles that might hamper trade."
"Organic food that has been produced in accordance with all the requirements of EU legislation should have access to all EU organic markets."
"The European logo can play an important role in making this happen."
"At the same time, I see no contradiction in organic producers underlining the region of origin of their own products if they wish to."
"Innovation in organic farming and food processing relies, to a great extent, on research."
"We have already seen an increase in organic research and there is more to come."
"However, it is not up to the Commission to prescribe in detail the different research subjects."
"With regard to coexistence, the action plan is not the right place to address this issue, since organic farming is not the only area concerned."
"At the end of the year the Commission will issue a report on the national coexistence measures which will show what further steps need to be taken."
"The action plan recommends that Member States make full use of the rural development policy possibilities available; not only agri-environmental measures, but also investment, extension services, quality schemes and all the other rural development elements that can be used to help organic farmers extend their production."
"I appreciate the comments you have made and look forward to working with you on this important issue in the future."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place during voting time, which will begin now."
"Mr President, a few minutes ago we were called in this Parliament to observe a moment of silence in memory of those who died in the terrorism events in Spain and to remember all those of our constituents who have died from terrorism."
"It was a solemn moment; it was a special moment; it was a potent moment."
"Every Member of this House was silent, all our visitors in the gallery were silent, but that silence was wrecked by the noise of a camera clicking away persistently."
"Mr President, I ask that when we have a moment of solemn silence it should mean silence for the cameramen and everybody in this Chamber and not just for those on the ground floor."
"Mr Bowis, your comment will be passed on."
"Moreover, I should also like to have silence during debates here in the House, particularly when the Commissioner is speaking, because I can assure you that that does not always happen."
"Mr President, I do not wish to delay this House too much longer, but I would like to make one trenchant point."
"We were summoned here to vote, originally at 12.00, then at 12.15 and now here we are voting at nearly 12.40."
"You will be aware that there is a strike on today and travelling is excessively difficult."
"A number of colleagues are having to leave at unearthly hours because they have to make different travel arrangements and, consequently, will not be able to participate in all the votes."
"It is a constant disgrace that business is chopped and changed in this Parliament without consulting those who really count: the Members sitting here."
"Very well, I shall pass on your comment to the session staff, but I would remind Members that we also have votes following this afternoon’s debates."
"Nevertheless, I shall do my best to make up for the delay, without going too fast."
"The next item is voting time."
"Mr President, paragraph 7, in the English version, presents a linguistic problem."
"I would therefore ask that the word ‘’ be replaced by ‘’ and that the word ‘’ be added, so that the second part of paragraph 7 would read: ‘This really is just about the English version and this linguistic difficulty."
"I have an oral amendment to Amendment 5 to add, after ‘business and industry’, ‘e.g. by involving the technology platforms’."
"Are there any objections to this addition?"
"Mr President, there is something I just wanted to ask Mr Rübig."
"I apologise for intervening, but last night, we agreed, indirectly and informally, that, on the last part, the European People’s Party and the Liberals would not vote for the deletion of the whole paragraph, and that we, in return, would vote in favour of the Conservatives’ and Liberals’ amendment."
"Perhaps Mr Rübig would say something about that?"
"Mrs Mann, you are certainly not inconveniencing the President. On the contrary, I was expecting this to happen because I had heard rumours to that effect."
"I was therefore waiting for someone from the benches of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to stand up and ask for the final part of their amendment, which seeks the deletion of the last part of Paragraph 21, to be abandoned."
"Is there a member of the PPE-DE who would like to speak on this subject?"
"Mr President, we agree with Mrs Erika Mann and her group."
"To sum up then, Amendment No 5 by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats adds the words ‘in addition to representatives of the world of business and industry’, no longer asks for the deletion of the end of Paragraph 21, and is supplemented by Mr Prodi’s oral amendment."
"I voted in favour of Mrs Jensen’s report on Parliament's estimates for an amending budget of the European Union for the financial year 2005 (salary adjustment), as I believe it is important to consider a reduction in personnel costs in the 2005 budget."
"Parliament’s 2005 budget earmarked appropriations for the implementation of the equipment purchasing policy."
"I believe that those appropriations should be used to finance priorities for which there is at present no financial provision in the budget, such as preparations for the accession of Bulgaria and Romania."
"Lastly, I would like to emphasise that as the necessary funding for the development of the activities of the Community institutions has already been earmarked, we need to be strict about the prudent and judicious management of public monies, which come from the pockets of our taxpayers."
"This motion for a resolution arises from the identification of a surplus in the 2005 budget because the 2004 salary adjustment, which was approved by the Council at the end of 2004, was just 0.7% instead of the 2.6% envisaged when the budgets of the institutions were being drawn up."
"These surpluses will make it possible both to free up some of the appropriations included in the 2005 budget in relation to fixed assets policy, making it possible for the Parliament to purchase buildings that are currently leased, and, as the rapporteur quite rightly points out, to finance areas for which funding is not at present provided in the budget, such as preparations for the accession of Bulgaria and Romania."
"I voted in favour, of course."
"I voted in favour of the report by Mr Garriga Polledo (A6-0047/2005) on draft amending budget No 1/2005 of the European Union for the financial year 2005, because I accept the modifications made to the organisational structure of the Commission’s services following the appointment of the new Commission and the distribution of portfolios amongst the new Commissioners, which made changes essential."
"That being the case, these changes should be incorporated into the amending budget in the most transparent and efficient way possible."
"I welcome the neutral impact of these changes on the budget."
"The aim of this first draft amending budget is to make the necessary budget-neutral technical changes to the 2005 budget as a consequence of the revision of the services’ organisational structure in connection with the appointment of the new Commission and the distribution of portfolios amongst the Commissioners."
"It is important to remember that although it is an administrative body, the new Commission undertook to make this the ‘competitiveness and cohesion’ budget."
"Furthermore, the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy that we voted on yesterday calls for greater determination and creativity in pursuing its objectives."
"The Commission has been given the appropriate cooperation by Parliament."
"I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution because I am convinced that the Commission will make good use of this instrument and that it will deploy its resources to achieve those objectives, thus justifying the very firm support it received in the relevant committee."
"At a time when the damage both to the environment and to public health caused by conventional methods of food production indicates that it is vital to look for alternatives, and that there is a need to guarantee access to safe and sustainably produced food, it is important for the European Parliament to adopt a position on this."
"Support is needed for organic production methods, in view of their respect for environmental balance."
"This support may be in the form of incentives for producers or in the form of measures to protect organic crops from the risks involved in the use of GMOs. The risks to the environment caused by GMOs are not yet known, and there is no way to guarantee their containment, and there is therefore a danger that they will contaminate the species alongside which they are grown."
"I voted in favour of Mrs Aubert’s report on the European Action Plan for Organic Food and Farming, because I believe that it raises fundamental questions about the very future of organic farming."
"We need to be aware that this type of agriculture now accounts for an important share of the food market and of agricultural production in the European Union."
"The Action Plan sets out to address three key priorities: information-led development of the organic food market by providing the public with more information and increasing consumer awareness; making public support for organic farming more effective; and improving and reinforcing the Community’s organic farming standards and import and inspection requirements."
"These priorities should consequently be aimed above all at endeavouring to effectively overcome the specific difficulties inherent in the special nature of organic farming, throughout the whole industry, from production through to distribution."
"A European action plan for organic farming should be ambitious, given that organic farming is not just limited to the production of food, but also has a far wider environmental and social role."
"Organic issues are of great importance in today’s world."
"Since 1985, we have witnessed a significant increase in the number of agricultural holdings and acreage devoted to organic farming."
"Yet there has been a major slowdown in this growth in recent years because of problems relating to the production, processing and distribution of these products."
"The report before us advocates the introduction of additional and enhanced measures with a view to eliminating these obstacles."
"The main objective is to raise everyone’s awareness, and not just that of an urban minority, of the advantages of organic produce for the environment."
"An improvement in Community legislation, including the common agricultural policy, and an increase in public aid, are essential if we are to make organic farming a more dynamic aspect of sustainable agriculture."
"At a time when the environment should be a priority, this issue should be high on the agenda."
"Given that I am certain that the high price of organic products is the main obstacle to their consumption, I am convinced that developing support for organic farming will result in a reduction in the price of organic produce and consequently in an increase in the consumption of organic products by the public at large."
"I voted in favour of the report."
"– I voted in favour of Mrs Aubert's report which encourages the development of organic food and agriculture."
"These practices have been developing constantly in Europe for several years now and meet a demand from European consumers for a healthy and varied diet."
"To reassure both farmers and the public, it is also vital to establish rigorous controls to prevent the risk of contamination in the event of the coexistence of organic and transgenic crops."
"This is also the Belgian position: the assessment of controls and risks linked to GMOs must be based on independent scientific reports."
"Additionally, it is urgent to provide solutions for the specific problems being encountered by organic farmers: in Belgium, consumer demand for organic produce is far from consistent and often varies in line with food scares."
"Farmers suffer from these fluctuations whereas, instead, they should be seeing the reward for all their efforts and investment."
"It is absolutely essential to avoid a situation in which certain farmers are forced to sell at a loss."
"Defending organic farming means taking a stand for quality and safety, not forgetting freedom of choice for consumers."
"Mr President, if I had been given the chance to speak in the debate on International Women’s Day and Beijing + 10, I would have said that it was actually a shame that violence against women is a long-running issue in this House, although thankfully it is less prevalent than other important problems that affect far more women – untold millions of them, in fact, who have for years been waiting for solutions called for, I might add, by overwhelming majorities in this House."
"Let me take as an example the splitting of pensions entitlements acquired during marriage, so that a woman who wholly or partly gave up work in order to devote herself to her family duties is not left without social security after divorce."
"We therefore need a framework directive to put a stop to divorce tourism in the EU."
"I also recall our 1996 report on the status of spouses who help out in small businesses and in agriculture."
"Ten years ago, we were demanding the lifting of directive 86 on the equal treatment of self-employed men and women and the spouses who help them out."
"Nothing has happened!"
"If I may now turn to the battered wives, let me add that men get beaten up too."
"Since 2003, Luxembourg has had a law that has already helped a great deal; its law on domestic violence bars violent men from the home, so that, if the man turns violent, it is he who has to leave the shared home, rather than the woman and her children having to flee to a refuge for battered women or to her family."
"It would be appropriate if the Commission were to recommend to all the Member States that they adopt a law along those lines if they have not already done so."
"There would then be no need for Beijing + 10!"
". Despite voting against the resolution on the World Conference on Women, the Christian Union/SGP is not at all opposed to the women being treated normally in this society."
"We unreservedly support the fight against the abuse of women, their genital mutilation, trafficking in them, the custom of giving women away in marriage and honour killings."
"In addition, equal access to good education and good health care is important to everyone."
"There are, however, a number of ideas that we are unable to back."
"We do not reject participation by women in the labour process, but an enforced gender distribution according to numbers does not do justice to reality."
"Capacities and aptitudes are the criteria according to which job applicants must be selected; whether they are men or women is less relevant in this context."
"Individuals and organisations should both have freedom of choice."
"It is up to the people and organisations themselves to make choices with regard to their personal privacy or their internal structure and external representation, provided no improper means or methods are used in the process."
"Finally, situations in the medical-ethical field must be treated with the utmost care."
"Man is not the last link in an evolutionary process, but is a being who was given life by his Creator."
"He should treat his own life, that of others, as well as existing and unborn life, with due responsibility."
"The Moderate delegation has voted in favour of the resolution but wishes to emphasise certain problems we see with the wording."
"The resolution regards the world’s women as a homogeneous group, a fact we regard as very unfortunate, because the position of women varies very dramatically indeed from one country to the next."
"The situation of women in the developing countries is confused with the situation of women in Europe, as if they were comparable problems."
"Problems such as rape in war, honour killings and genital mutilation cannot, as has been done in the resolution, be compared with issues relating to lifelong learning, the allocation of quotas and the number of months’ paternity leave."
"The resolution confuses issues that belong at EU level with those that are quite clearly national issues or, quite simply, matters to be decided by individuals."
"We should have preferred it if the focus had been upon women in the developing countries, where they are in a very vulnerable situation."
"The wordings concerning the developing countries relate, to a large degree, to issues to which the EU should call attention in the Common Foreign and Security Policy and in aid policy."
"We should have liked the resolution to have stood up for men’s and women’s equal rights and the defence of human rights throughout the world."
"On 10 March 2005, I voted against the resolution on the Follow-up to the Fourth World Conference on Women – Platform for Action (Beijing +10)."
"This was because the resolution was particularly short-sighted and poorly thought out."
"It contained many appropriate proposals but also many quite inappropriate ones, some of which were simply ridiculous."
"An example of the latter is paragraph 12, the measure providing for gender equality to be incorporated into the Structural Funds."
"There is also the call for women to constitute 40% of the staff of peacekeeping or conflict prevention missions."
"I wish to register a particular protest against paragraph 13, which contains a reference to female reproductive health."
"In the final analysis, it was because of that wording that I was unable to vote in favour of the resolution."
"I and my British Conservative colleagues have abstained on the resolution concerning the 4th World Conference on Women because we do not believe that it deals with the most vital issues appropriately or in a truly practical way."
"The over-prescriptive references to 'gender mainstreaming', 'gender-based budgeting' and the call for rigid enforcement of quota systems are examples of this."
"The Conservative Party leads the way in championing respect and rights for women."
"Human trafficking, prostitution and genital mutilation are just some of the horrors facing girls and women in developing countries."
"But they cannot be dealt with only through financial aid, though aid is clearly needed; nor can they be dealt with by legislation, although legislation can of course help in appropriate cases."
"Womens' freedom will only be guaranteed if there is a proper programme of education extending to both sexes and vigorously pursued."
". On this World Women’s Day 2005, I would like to focus attention on all women who go about performing their duties in a perfectly normal way."
"I would like to make their primary concerns – provision for families, for children, and also for older people – matters of political interest."
"We talk a lot about gender mainstreaming;"
"I would ask that we also give thought to family mainstreaming when taking policy decisions that affect society."
"In future, when taking policy decisions, we have to examine the effect they will have on families; state programmes for encouraging women to return to work, in particular, must in future be guided by the principle of family mainstreaming."
"Work and society must fit the family rather than the other way round."
"Agricultural statistics, for example, still take insufficient account of the work done by farmers’ wives."
"On commercial farms, women work for around 63 hours a week."
"Agricultural statistics first deduct around 50% under the heading of provision for the family."
"Farmers’ wives do unpaid work at home, on the farm and for the family in exactly the same way as all women work in addition to the time they spend doing a job, but statistics take no account of what they do; it is still not taken seriously by society, and is not recognised as an economic factor."
"Generally speaking, the services performed by women must be fully taken into account in calculating the gross national product."
"At last, the European Parliament is including among its priority aims in the defence of the dignity of women, the serious issue of female genital mutilation."
"All too often, Europe has announced its good intentions of defending the dignity of the individual, of women or children, without being able to translate that into concrete and genuinely effective action."
"We hope that today’s initiative is a turning point in tackling seriously the phenomenon of female genital mutilation, a phenomenon which has nothing whatsoever to do with the respect for the traditions and cultures of other nations, since barbarity is not culture."
"We therefore propose that a directive should be issued prohibiting the practice of female sexual mutilation, that steps should be taken to provide proper education on the problem, and, in particular, to provide support to immigrants from countries in which these customs are tolerated and even considered legitimate."
"Additionally, we believe it is necessary that a public awareness campaign should be promoted on the phenomenon of violence against women, that proper information should be made available on respect for women’s health and physical safety and that the criminal law of European Union Member States should treat the practice of sexual mutilation of women as an aggravating factor in the crime of assault and battery."
"Taking advantage of the fact that the plenary is meeting on International Women’s Day, Parliament has decided, by means of this motion for a resolution, to highlight some well-known aspects of the situation of women which are to be deplored and which we should combat."
"Anyone who is opposed to a gender war or to a quota policy or to confusing what is it to be in a minority with what it is to be a woman, is all the more duty-bound to fight for full respect for women’s unique role in society, in the family and as individuals, and for legal provisions to apply which give them genuine equality, while respecting the natural differences between all of us and in particular fully respecting something that is vital regardless of gender: individual liberty, and each person’s inalienable right to individual happiness."
"This week we are celebrating International Women’s Day, which gives us an opportunity to take stock of the progress made at world level as regards women’s equality, liberty, development, recognition and participation in civic life."
"I believe that collective awareness raising about the enormous amount that remains to be done is very important, and that the EU should remain at the forefront of a just battle, which, while favouring women, is not exclusively a women’s issue, but one for humankind as a whole."
"The innumerable afflictions and dangers faced by many millions of women all over the world are extremely serious, and deserve a prompt, full and unreserved response."
"At the same time, I feel bound to say that I regret the fact that on the pretext of these fine-sounding but vague principles and concepts, attempts are being made to treat certain practices that fly in the face of such rights as rights in themselves – for example abortion, which is conveniently disguised and played down under the disingenuously employed banner of ‘sexual and reproductive health’."
"– Violence against women comes in many different forms: physical or psychological violence, rape, domestic slavery, the sex trade and prostitution, etc."
"In our so-called ‘civilised’ countries which pride themselves on their respect for human rights and the rights of citizens, did you know that in France, six women die every month as a result of domestic violence, with almost no public reaction?"
"Did you know that, in 2002, this violence was covered by an amnesty, while there is no amnesty for the mistreatment of animals?"
"Surely women are not considered as being less worthy of protection."
"Only a few days ago, police violently beat women who were demonstrating peacefully in Istanbul."
"That has to stop."
"We need to tackle the factors which, as in the case of women in Islam, contribute directly or indirectly to their subjugation."
"It is intolerable that, in our countries and throughout the world, archaic and inhumane practices such as excision, honour crimes, stoning and decapitation should be accepted."
"This day devoted to women must not just be a symbolic event; it must be an opportunity for true awareness of women's rights in France and throughout the world."
"I welcome the fact that, as part of the celebration of International Women’s Day, the European Parliament decided to hold a debate to mark the tenth anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women and the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, and, in particular, to focus on domestic violence."
"Given the worrying scale of this blight on society, I support the idea of 2006 being designated European Year against Violence against Women."
"However, in addition to symbolic gestures, I also consider that the EU should play a leading role in taking practical steps to establish gender equality."
"I firmly believe that we should move on from mere political recognition to practical application in our day-to-day lives."
"In the area that I follow most closely, social policy, there is a need to strengthen all those measures that help to combat all aspects of inequality between men and women in the workplace, be it wage levels, career progression or access to the labour market."
"The Nordic countries have very low levels of unemployment, and one of the reasons for this is that they have encouraged greater employability amongst women."
"By the same token, given that the labour market is becoming ever more demanding, it is important for flexible working conditions to take into account key values such as the balance between family and professional life …"
"– Mr President, of course I am against the trade in both organs and eggs."
"It is a despicable practice."
"However, I cannot agree with the text of the resolution, because it places the donation of eggs on the same footing as the donation of organs or cells."
"While the latter is undertaken in order to save life, the donation of gametes, and therefore also of egg cells, must be considered as part of a parental project."
"The child born from such a donation cannot be considered as an object but as a person, with the right to know the identity of his or her biological parents later in life should he or she so desire."
"The resolution should have referred to this fundamental difference, and I regret that the text was not amended."
"We Moderates do not believe that the issue of trading in human eggs should be dealt with in the manner of the current resolution."
"The resolution we are voting on today has not been thoroughly prepared."
"Nor does it weigh up the ethical pros and cons in such a way as to shed light upon the whole of this complex issue."
"It does not make sense categorically to call for a ban on trading in egg cells and embryos."
"Women who are unable to have children of their own will always be able to come to agreements with other women who are willing to donate eggs."
"For many, childlessness is very painful and traumatic."
"It would be a mistake to criminalise such agreements."
"The issue of egg donations entails many complex moral considerations."
"More clarification than is provided by the current resolution is needed in connection with the issues both of what interventions in reproduction should be permitted and of what the consequences are both for those women who donate eggs and for the childless women who desire help."
"The reason why, in spite of everything, we choose to vote in favour of the resolution has to do with the situation that gave rise to it, that is to say the exploitation of poor women in Romania, which is something we view seriously, without having a detailed knowledge of all the facts."
"– I voted against the joint resolution on the planned egg trade, which is little more than a flight of fancy."
"On the basis of a rumour circulated by the gutter press, disproved by an official report of the competent authorities in the UK, Parliament has cloaked itself in the lofty principles of human dignity, while at the same time refusing to deal with the underlying issue, namely that of whether we should or should not encourage well-supervised scientific research into embryonic stem cells."
"I believe this research is essential for the fight against genetic disorders and against the scourges of modern life such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease."
"Regenerative medicine in Europe is beginning to lag behind the US and Asia."
"Parliament makes itself look foolish by tackling the subject of egg cell donations solely from the standpoint of the much-needed protection of women against involuntary exploitation."
"We need to respond to the news that has reached our ears about trade in women’s ova with firm condemnation, sincere concern and an effective reaction by international bodies, in addition to that by the Romanian and British authorities."
"The mere possibility that women may be forced to use their bodies as part of an obscene new trade should be enough to make us all commit ourselves to combating this practice by acting without delay."
"It is at times such as this, much more than on commemorative dates, that we can and indeed should demonstrate our willingness to live up to the values that we advocate."
"The news we have heard about the United Kingdom importing human somatic cells from Romania, if it is true, indicates behaviour that demonstrates contempt for the most basic human rights."
"If British clinics are indeed offering high cash prices to Romanian women for their ova, not only are they encouraging people to turn the human body into a source of profit, which is prohibited and condemned under Article 3 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, they are also indulging in sordid exploitation of the donors’ weakness and poverty."
"In the light of these reports, the European Parliament should apply itself to urgently adopting measures with a view to protecting the dignity of human beings, amongst which I wish to highlight strict controls on the donation of ova, tissue or organs as a whole, so as to provide protection against this uncivilised exploitation of one human being by another."
"Lastly, I consider that the practices that have been reported should be the subject of a vehement protest by this House, and deserve to be treated with the utmost repugnance."
"I also welcome the adoption in this resolution of extremely important principles opposing cloning and advocating the protection of human embryos."
"Europe should unite in defending the dignity of all human life, from the moment of conception until death."
"I voted in favour."
"– On behalf of the liberal members of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in the European Parliament, I condemn this afternoon's vote on the joint ‘egg cell trade’ resolution, a vote which, on the pretext of combating the exploitation of women and supporting the inalienability of the human body, really has a totally different purpose: to ban, directly or indirectly, research into embryonic stem cells and therapeutic cloning…"
"It is a moralistic, retrograde and obscurantist vote which rejects and calls into question the ‘yes’ vote of this very same Parliament, on 19 November 2003, for the financing of research into embryonic stem cells, and this within the context of the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Development."
"It is a disastrous signal from 307 Members to couples waiting for the gift of life, but also to the hundreds of thousands of patients in Europe who are placing all their hopes for a cure on research – diabetics and sufferers from Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s and many other diseases."
"There are 199 of us in this Parliament whose ambition is still undiminished, namely to respond to these hopes, not merely by a vote for progress and solidarity, but above all by supporting modern and humanistic medical research in the interests of patients awaiting treatment."
"– At puberty, a young woman only has a limited number of egg cells – approximately 500 – which are released one by one at each menstrual cycle."
"By the time of the menopause, the egg cell stock is exhausted and the woman is no longer able to conceive children."
"The hyper-stimulation of a young woman’s ovaries, involving an increased risk of ovarian cancer, is not a trivial public health issue."
"In a country where the resources of the healthcare system are limited, what guarantees will be offered to these young women?"
"Why would a young woman wish to run a risk of this type, except under financial pressure?"
"To remove and damage tens or even hundreds of egg cells from a young woman of 18 is tantamount to inducing a premature menopause, and to making it quite impossible for that woman ever to have children."
"Who can be certain that a young woman of 18 is ready to make such a decision?"
"How can we be certain that it is not the result of financial and economic pressures?"
"Given these circumstances, it is clear that this issue goes far beyond Directive 2004/23/EC; it is impossible to call for demand to be met while at the same time stating that the donation of egg cells should be voluntary and free."
"This is a major infringement of a woman’s most fundamental rights."
"Nuclear weapons constitute a serious threat to our global security, and not only in countries such as North Korea and Iran."
"The June List’s MEPs support the call to limit the spread of nuclear weapons, something that, in the long term, should lead to a phasing-out of all nuclear weapons."
"With its experience, knowledge and global reach, the United Nations (UN) is the best organisation for guaranteeing the success of the Non-Proliferation Treaty 2005."
"The UN must therefore be given priority in the work on global disarmament."
"The resolution contains, however, proposals that would gradually strengthen the role of the EU’s foreign and defence policy, something that would be in danger of weakening the UN’s position."
"Hiroshima was devastated by an atomic bomb sixty years ago this summer."
"Including the effects of radiation poisoning, the five-year death total was over two hundred thousand, almost two thirds of the city's population."
"In May the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty (NPT) comes up for another five-year review by those countries that are party to it."
"The treaty regime is weaker than it has been since its entry into force in 1970."
"If this vital security instrument is to continue to be effective, it is highly important that the central bargain be revived by the NPT nuclear weapon states, led by Washington, at the review conference."
"1962 saw predictions of as many as 25 to 30 nuclear weapons states with such weapons integrated into their arsenals by the end of the 1970s."
"This could have resulted in over forty such nations today, leaving nuclear weapons vulnerable to the hands of terrorists."
"But it did not happen."
"Today there are only two more states with nuclear weapon programmes than there were in 1970..."
".– The motion for a resolution on nuclear weapons may well describe the situation, but it focuses solely on the problem of non-proliferation, rather than on the problem of the existence and use of nuclear weapons."
"Only the United States have used nuclear weapons, committing a huge crime against humanity in Hiroshima and Nagasaki."
"Depleted uranium was also used by NATO forces in the wars against Iraq, Yugoslavia and Afghanistan, with devastating consequences."
"No mention is made of these issues."
"Interest in the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons is hypocritical, unless it is linked to a demand for immediate specific action to destroy them, starting with the European nuclear powers (France, Britain), and unless a clear request is made for US nuclear weapons to be removed from Europe."
"From this point of view, with the situation as it stands and taking account of the fact that the United States have reversed their commitment not to use nuclear weapons and strike first, the reference to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons directs people's attention away from the real dangers arising from the imperialist nuclear powers."
"We support general nuclear disarmament and that is why we shall abstain from the vote."
"In the context of the long-standing and more far-reaching objective of securing total compliance with the Non-Proliferation Treaty, if we are to be realistic, some concerns are more urgent and serious than others."
"The danger represented by nuclear arms being acquired by pariah states not committed to international law and by terrorist groups cannot be compared with the acquisition of such arms by states which form part of the fabric of modern international relations, and it would not be reasonable to act as if the two were comparable."
"Against that background, the situation both in North Korea and Iran gives us cause for concern."
"In the case of Iran, the hopes we are pinning on the work done as part of the negotiations conducted by the EU should not blind us to the fact that the indications of any real commitment by Iran to the proposals are very slight."
"In the case of North Korea, however, there are more than indications, there are clear statements and instances of behaviour on the part of the leaders of that country that should give the international community pause for thought about what actions it may have to take in due course."
"World security calls for careful reflection, respect for the law and courage when the time comes for a decision."
"In developing their nuclear arms programmes, North Korea and Iran have adopted an approach that obviously indicates contempt for international law and for the agreements they have signed, the consequences of which are clearly damaging for world peace and political stability."
"Such behaviour, which borders on belligerence in some cases, calls for a firm and united response on the part of the European Union."
"This does not just involve condemning the attitude displayed by those who breach agreements, but also making every effort, as a matter of urgency, to get the North Korean and Iranian Governments to return to the negotiating table, failing which they will be subject to economic and political sanctions."
"The EU should also carry out a prior analysis of the consequences for Europe – particularly in political and economic terms – of the possibility of Iran and North Korea possessing nuclear arms."
"Lastly, I believe that the EU and its Member States should put up a common front at the 2005 Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference, and exhort the international community to strengthen programmes designed to prevent the spread of nuclear materials, technology and know-how, and to adopt additional measures to avoid terrorists or those that harbour them having access to weapons of mass destruction and their components."
"I voted in favour."
"While we support a robust NPT and steps to curtail the nuclear programmes of North Korea and Iran, we have abstained on this resolution because we are not in agreement with the following paragraphs in particular:"
"paragraphs 10 and 19 - we believe that conventional forces alone cannot ensure credible deterrence, that nuclear weapons make a unique contribution in rendering the risks of aggression against the UK and its allies incalculable and unacceptable and consequently that they remain essential to preserving peace;"
"paragraph 15 - we do not agree that the EU has a role in coordinating intelligence;"
"paragraph 17 - we believe that the presence of United States conventional and nuclear forces in Europe remain vital to the security of the continent and consequently it would be wrong to call on ""the USA to clarify the situation of the quantity and strategic objectives of its tactical nuclear arsenals stationed on European bases"";"
"paragraph 18 - Israel has not declared that it possesses nuclear weapons and therefore it is in appropriate to include Israel in this context;"
"paragraph 31 - the United States has not declared that it would ""not engage in preventive military action against Iran"", and it would be wrong to rule out any option at this stage."
"We welcome the development of a peaceful and democratic Lebanon as an important part of a peaceful and democratic Middle East."
"We are happy to see individual European countries accepting their responsibility and contributing to the peace process, but we object to the constant attempts to increase the role of the EU’s foreign and defence policy."
"Such a development would involve the EU taking resources that would have been better administered by the United Nations, and it would weaken the world community in the longer term."
"The recent developments in the situation in Lebanon need to be viewed in the light of the deteriorating situation in the Middle East, where there has been an escalation in interference and military intervention and occupation by the United States and its allies, in an attempt to secure domination of the region and its vital resources, thus putting into action its ‘Greater Middle East Initiative’."
"Furthermore, it is against the background of the growing pressures and threats directed by the United States at countries in this region such as Syria and Iran – for which the US sought to secure the support of France and Germany at the recent EU and NATO summits – that attempts are being made to justify dangerous ventures and an escalation of destabilisation of the region, in particular in Lebanon, and to undermine that country’s national unity and the implementation of the Taif Agreement. This could have serious consequences."
"This resolution obscures the fundamental issue, the ‘cause of causes’, that is to say the role of the United states and of Israel, which is in military occupation of Palestinian, Syrian and even Lebanese territory, in aggravating the situation in the Middle East."
"We accordingly disagree with the overall approach of the resolution."
"The European Parliamentary Labour Party supports the resolution on the situation in Lebanon, in particular its focus on the importance of free, democratic and transparent parliamentary elections, the need for a complete and rapid withdrawal of Syrian forces and intelligence, and hopes for reform to spread across the wider Middle East."
"However it is important to clarify that the military wing of Hezbollah is already listed as a terrorist organisation by the United Kingdom, whereas the political wing is under constant review."
"Hezbollah represents significant public support in Lebanon, and our hope should be that Hezbollah rejects terrorism and embraces the political process."
"– Parliament has just passed a resolution calling for the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon."
"That is a positive step, but it does not go far enough."
"The re-establishment of Lebanese independence also requires that those Lebanese who were forced to leave their country should be able to return and that all political prisoners, prominent among whom is Samir Geagea, should be set free."
"However, the majority of Members who voted in favour of a text defending the sovereignty of Lebanon are the same ones who are striving to dismantle the sovereignty of our own nations within the Europe of Brussels; a Europe without borders, open to immigration from anywhere in the world."
"Lebanon lost its sovereignty as a result of massive immigration."
"The arrival, in the early 1970s, of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians shattered the demographic equilibrium between Moslems and Christians – to the detriment of the latter, who became a minority in their own country."
"The resulting civil war served as a pretext for Syria to occupy Lebanon and put an end to its sovereignty."
"Today, the presence of 500 000 Syrian immigrants is a serious obstacle to the restoration of independence to the country."
"The disaster of Lebanon is proof: woe betide a country which loses its identity and sovereignty."
"– We voted against – and emphatically against the second part of paragraph 6."
"Our position is that we refuse to draw a distinction between the political and military wings of a terrorist movement, namely Hezbollah."
"We also bitterly regret that the amendment calling on the Union to place it on its list of terrorist organisations was withdrawn."
"This Party of God, whose fundamental charter calls for the destruction of the state of Israel and the establishment of an Islamic Republic in Lebanon; this Hezbollah, whose emblem is a machine gun and whose motto calls for the sole victory of the congregation of Allah. Could this movement, responsible for atrocities, the hijacking of aircraft, kidnapping, torture and assassinations too numerous to mention, be anything other than a terrorist organisation?"
"Of course it is a terrorist organisation, and we are all perfectly aware of the fact."
"The real issue which is dividing the Council is whether or not it is expedient to say so."
"We believe that the planned text was sufficiently clear to avoid severing links."
"The European Parliament is not the Council’s echo chamber. It has just deprived itself of the opportunity to send a clear political signal to all those throughout the world who are fighting against our values of freedom and democracy."
"The most recent events in the Middle East and the way the situation in that part of the world has been developing – partly, it must be said, because of military intervention in Iraq – today give us some, albeit modest, grounds for hope."
"Alongside tragic events such as the assassination of the former Lebanese Prime Minister or the repeated attacks in Iraq, there are in fact signs that new solutions to the problems of the Middle East are emerging, solutions that point towards the possibility of stability, peace and democratisation in the region in the future."
"In this context, and against the background of the groundswell of protest against that assassination, the time has come for us to demand that Syria should comply with the wishes of the international community and totally withdraw from Lebanon, thus allowing normal elections to be held in that country."
"Furthermore, it is time that the European Union recognised what has been obvious for a long time and include Hezbollah in the list of terrorist groups."
"Lebanon has long been the stage for a clash between the main powers in the Middle East, and its entire social fabric has suffered because of its geographical location."
"The most recent in a long list of acts of violence that stretches back to antiquity was the deplorable assassination of former Prime Minister Hariri, demonstrating just how far there is to go before Lebanon achieves stability and also the degree of uncertainty hanging over the current elections."
"I consider it essential, if this state of affairs is to be brought to an end, for the international community not to prevaricate in the face of those who subsidise, promote and incite terrorism."
"Simply tolerating terrorism is not a good policy."
"I am therefore pleased to see the withdrawal of Syria’s troops, but I feel bound to condemn the relationship that this country has maintained with Hezbollah and the way in which it has interfered, directly or surreptitiously, in the internal affairs of Lebanon, a sovereign state."
"Until we have irrefutable proof that this behaviour, this interference, has ceased, and that human rights and fundamental freedoms are being respected, I believe that the European Union will have very little to gain from forging closer links with Syria."
"I also believe that Hezbollah should be included in the European list of terrorist organisations, with all that that implies."
"I abstained in the vote on Hezbollah because ‘all necessary measures’ against terrorist activities would involve Hezbollah being added to the list of terrorist organisations."
"Sweden’s Green Party is opposed to this list because it is not based upon objective criteria, the decisions cannot be appealed against and no rights are granted to those whose names are added to the list."
"Hezbollah has many parliamentarians and civil activists, and an across-the-board fight against all parts of the organisation will not solve the complex situation involving its status in Lebanon."
"We abstained from voting on asking the Commission to defend the proposal that the EU budget should amount to significantly more than one per cent of GDP."
"We wish to prioritise the Lisbon Strategy, of which research is an important part."
"It is, however, too early in the current situation to commit ourselves to a particular level for the EU budget."
"This report addresses a topic that is very important for the future of research, knowledge and innovation in the various Member States of the European Union, which can be summed up by focussing on three aspects:"
"- If we are to increase the level of research, we need an increase in funding."
"The budget of the Sixth Framework Programme amounts to only 5.4% of total public research spending in Europe, which means that it is not viable to create any kind of European Research Area."
"Financing for the future programme is essential, but the final amount of the Union’s financial perspective is not yet known."
"The rapporteur calls for a doubling of the budget, which seems logical."
"- The content of the next Framework Programme needs to be changed in various ways as compared with the present programme, but not quite as proposed in the report."
"Research must support innovation, but it should not be totally redirected solely towards increasing competitiveness, as is the case with the Commission’s guidelines, following Wim Kok’s report."
"- Greater attention needs to be paid to the working conditions of all those engaged in research."
"The rapporteur states that the EU needs 700 000 new researchers by 2010 if the target of 3% of GDP investment in research and development is to be reached."
"This implies adequate investment in human resources in order to produce more researchers."
"Research is a vital area for the long-term success of the European Union as regards innovation and competitiveness."
"I accordingly voted in favour of this report on guidelines for future European Union policy to support research."
"It will only be possible to create the European Research Area by increasing the EU’s financial support for research, in the context of improved coordination between European, national and regional research policies."
"For this reason, I wholeheartedly approve of the proposal to double the budget for the Seventh Framework Programme."
"The EU needs 700 000 new adequately skilled researchers by 2010 if the target of 3% of GDP investment in technological research and development is to be reached."
"To achieve this objective, it is essential to make Europe more attractive for researchers and scientists, to stir up fresh enthusiasm for science among young people, to foster the participation of women and to promote scientific careers and the mobility of researchers."
"Lastly, I wish to emphasise that those Member States that are eligible for the Structural Funds should devote a significant proportion of these resources to eliminating their disadvantages in the field of research."
"I welcome this report's emphasis on achieving the Lisbon objectives through various means."
"It is vital to improve framework conditions for private research, since in it is estimated that the EU needs 700 000 new, adequately skilled researchers by 2010 if the target of 3% of GDP investment in Research and Development (R[amp]D) is to be reached."
"Furthermore, to reach this target, two thirds of the investment in research should come from the business sector."
"The Kok report on the Lisbon Strategy has also identified “increasing Europe's attractiveness for researchers and scientists” and “making R[amp]D a top priority” among the policy areas requiring urgent action."
"I agree with the report that making Europe more competitive requires appropriate financial means."
"There should be sufficient coupling at European and national level to ensure a uniform quality of funded projects."
"I also welcome the call to increase support for R[amp]D and innovation in renewable energies following The International Conference for Renewable Energies (Bonn, June 2004)."
"I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Locatelli (A6-0046/2005) on Science and technology – Guidelines for future European Union policy to support research, because I advocate strong and effective research policies for Europe."
"I am very much aware of the difficulty of achieving the objectives set out in the Lisbon Strategy, and I accordingly continue to support a European Union research and development policy as one of the main instruments for promoting Europe’s growth and competitiveness."
"Establishing the European Research Area (ERA) is key here, as is achieving continuity in the planning of research programmes."
"The objective of making Europe more competitive requires funding for research."
"Accordingly, the new strategies aimed at creating companies that will cooperate both with regional institutions and universities are something that we need to develop for the future."
"It is important for universities to take on an entrepreneurial role, thus facilitating interaction between research and industry."
"Lastly, I welcome the proposals that Structural Funds should be used to support R[amp]D actions at regional level and a ‘European excellence label’."
"I welcome the courage of the rapporteur, who prefaces her explanatory statement with the sentence, ‘Europe deserves better: Stop with the “Lisbon lament”’."
"As I said yesterday, just as there is agreement about the Lisbon objectives, there is also general recognition that we urgently need a new, strong and courageous attitude."
"I would like to add another epithet: creative."
"The Kok report on the Lisbon Strategy stated that it is necessary to increase the attractiveness of Europe for researchers and scientists."
"In fact there are a great many sources of information and statistics showing that Europe has been suffering from a massive haemorrhage of its best scientists and researchers."
"It is important to halt that haemorrhage."
"It is also important to pursue the objective of the European Research Area by means of practical actions, such as greater technology transfer, especially to small and medium-sized enterprises; full and efficient use of the Structural Funds to support research and development at regional level; placing special emphasis on interdisciplinarity in the training chapter; strengthening the role and responsibility of universities in the Europe of knowledge; promoting the mobility of researchers by encouraging and facilitating family unity; achieving the objective of 3% for R[amp]D; funding and disseminating centres of innovation, such as the proposed European Institute of Technology; providing primary and secondary education with technological instruments to encourage research; and promoting information campaigns about success stories."
"Putting it simply, to ‘stop the laments’."
"I voted in favour."
"– European Union support for research must be in step with the objectives set out in the Lisbon Strategy."
"It is for this reason that I gave my wholehearted support to this ambitious report."
"A country such as Belgium has a duty to follow the example of certain of its European neighbours who have had the courage to invest in scientific research."
"In this context, Finland is a good role model."
"With 3.5% of GDP devoted to research, it has already exceeded the EU’s 3% objective for 2010."
"The results in Finland speak for themselves."
"The annual number of new PhD students has doubled in ten years and the country has added an extra 26 000 researchers over the same period (+50%)."
"We also need to bring about a change in mentality."
"On average, a young European researcher working in the USA has a research grant 2.5 times higher than in Europe."
"To stem the brain drain, we need to make Europe more attractive for the top researchers, and also encourage our young people to follow scientific careers."
"There is still much to be done in the fields of public health, the environment or high technology."
"With reference to Paragraph 44; the world’s most important environmental problem is global warming."
"The EU has signed up to the Kyoto Protocol, the main aim of which is to reduce carbon dioxide emissions."
"The expansion of nuclear power constitutes one of the most important means of reducing these."
"I therefore wish to support EU research into nuclear power in all its aspects."
"I do not, however, support the EU’s defence research."
"This is something about which countries must decide individually or about which they must reach agreements with each other."
"I and my British Conservative colleagues are voting for this report but with one important proviso."
"Nothing in any of our votes should be taken to mean that we support an increase in the overall EU budget."
"We do support the creation of a budget entry sufficient to support LIFE funding for nature protection and biodiversity which we do not feel will be adequately protected or financed under the Commission's present plans."
"It is vital that, now we have created the Natura 2000 network, we are prepared to find the money to continue to finance it where necessary."
"– I voted against the Auken report as I believe we cannot compromise future financial prospects by determining the expenditure for a single area of environmental policy in advance."
"The preservation of biodiversity and the reversal of desertification are essential in ensuring sustainable development."
"Healthy ecosystems provide important social and economic resources."
"The Natura 2000 network, based on sites protected under the Birds Directive and the Habitats Directive, is contributing towards achieving this objective."
"In its proposal for the financial perspective for 2007-2013, the Commission intends that the annual cost of managing the Natura 2000 network, EUR 6.1 billion per year, should be financed from existing funds."
"Although the objective of reversing the loss of biodiversity is being pursued, no attempt is being made to combat its causes: we need a change in the production model based on profit maximisation, of which one example is the release of GMOs into the environment."
"Similarly, the necessary financing is not provided for, as this objective has to ‘compete’ with other economic and social objectives."
"We therefore consider that the appropriations for rural development, which are intended to compensate farmers’ additional costs, and those for the Structural Funds should be proportionately increased if the costs of managing Natura 2000 are to be found from these funds."
"It is also essential to increase funding for the LIFE programme and/or to establish a programme dedicated to this network so as to ensure that its objectives are met."
". Protection of our natural environment can be achieved only by a real partnership between nature protection agencies and farmers, and so the Commission’s financial proposal must not jeopardise cooperation between them."
"It is farmers, across the length and breadth of Europe, who both ensure that nature is accessible to all and produce healthy food."
"Our farmers are in no doubt about what is required of them; they farm in accordance with best practice."
"It is for that reason that there must be certainty about the additional requirements prescribed for FFH areas by the European Union, also being adequately funded by it: ‘he who places the order pays the bill!’"
"It is not acceptable that the funding of Natura 2000 should be to the detriment of other agricultural and environmental measures or of other rural development programmes."
"Many issues have yet to be resolved."
"Precisely what actions are ultimately to be taken in the certified areas is to be decided at regional level in the first instance."
"It is important that funding for these actions should be in place."
"Those resources intended only for the management and organisation of the Natura 2000 areas must be kept to a minimum."
"We have to take care that there is no build-up of additional bureaucracy."
"Rather than putting money into management, bureaucracy and administration, the projects that are funded must be efficient, must help the environment and achieve tangible results."
"In an increasingly urbanised society in which rural areas are being abandoned and in which industrialisation and construction are taking over space traditionally regarded as ‘natural’, the European Union’s desire to ensure that biodiversity is maintained is both justified and beneficial."
"A society that abandons its fields, its forests and its rural space is not only reducing biodiversity, it is also reducing its capacity to take proper advantage of natural resources, and is instead encouraging urban concentration and the predominance of the main cities, while lowering the overall quality of life."
"Our key objective should not be to advocate biodiversity as an end in itself, but to protect a development model that enables people to enjoy the highest possible quality of life, which is only possible if ‘natural’ space is preserved and maintained."
"The environment deserves to be treated as a priority at world level, especially so given the growth witnessed over recent decades and the negative impact this has had on the world, combined with the need for sustainable development."
"More specifically, the issue before us today is biological diversity throughout the world, which has progressively declined over recent decades."
"Aiming as it does to protect nature and in particular animal life and its habitats, the Natura 2000 network gives us a unique opportunity to combat this impoverishment of biological diversity in Europe."
"That is something for which we are directly responsible."
"I attach great importance to the availability of appropriate levels of funding, together with an increase in support and special treatment, if the key objective is to be attained."
"The EU has of course already made a commitment with the Cardiff Process principle of integrating environmental considerations in all key policy areas and the EU's own Sustainable Development Strategy."
"The report before us advocates joint responsibility between the Community and Member States."
"EU funds should therefore cover both sites and their management activities."
"Above all, this strategy, by virtue of the activities associated with it, will help to boost the rural economy and enhance our citizens’ quality of life."
"I voted in favour."
"The Labour members voted against this resolution for a number of reasons."
"Firstly, we think it is bad for the World Trade talks because it undermines the seriousness of our commitment to a genuine reform of the world system."
"We voted against it because we think it is bad for farmers: farmers need certainty above all and this resolution would not provide that."
"We voted against it because we think it is bad for the European food industry: half a million European jobs depend on industries that use sugar and they will be facing higher sugar prices than the rest of their competitors throughout the world."
"And we voted against it because we think it is bad for the developing world."
"We will still be taking badly needed markets from developing countries."
"We hope that Parliament will think again and that when the Commission brings forward its draft legislative resolution we can have a different debate and a different approach to this issue, because the resolution we are adopting today simply does not solve the problems of the European sugar market."
". Today, this House is voting on the sugar sector’s market organisation, sugar subsidies and access to the market by the least-developed countries."
"In the debate between agriculture and development cooperation, two aspects were not given sufficient attention."
"The first one was sugar and public health."
"Diabetes has now become public disease Number One."
"It is a disease with debilitating symptoms and effects, and is also very expensive socially and economically."
"In addition, the consumption of sugar is a major factor in obesity, which is also an increasing public health problem."
"The EU was right to announce that – in cooperation with the WHO – it would fight obesity and diabetes."
"The consumption of sugar must be reduced, and the decline in the consumption of fruit and vegetables must be reversed, and so it is inconceivable that this House should commit to low sugar prices and that not one cent of subsidy should be available for fruit and vegetables."
"If we want to grant agricultural subsidies and keep prices down at all, we should do this for healthy products."
"The second aspect is Lisbon."
"The EU aspires to be the most dynamic and innovative economy in five years’ time."
"Everything should be geared towards that goal and sufficient means should also be freed up for this purpose."
"This House had fine things to say on this very subject only this week."
"It is difficult to see what contribution the sugar subsidies make to achieving the Lisbon objectives."
"Europe must grant farmers from developing countries full access to the market."
"I wholeheartedly support amendments to this effect."
"Needless to say, a sound scheme must be put in place for the European sugar farmers and for the workers in the sugar sector, but the long-term continuation of support for an unhealthy product and a sector that is somewhat resistant to innovation is inconsistent with this."
"We must stop this absurdity as quickly as possible."
"That in itself is sufficient reason to vote against the draft resolution."
"We are aware of allegations that the present arrangements for the sugar sector have distorted the market, leading to high prices for the consumer and a negative impact on the world market, particularly for developing countries."
"It was because of these allegations that in July 2004 the Commission brought forward a proposal for reforming the COM for sugar, based on a two-stage price reduction phased over three years of 37% in the guarantee price and 33% in the institutional price; on the abolition of the intervention price, which is currently three times the world market price; and on eliminating public intervention, which will be replaced by a system of private stocks."
"The intervention price is to be replaced by the reference price. Furthermore, sugar production quotas and subsidised exports are also to be reduced."
"The only support envisaged is the introduction of income aid in the form of a decoupled payment to sugar beet producers to partially compensate them – for 60% of the total – for the loss of income resulting from the reduction in prices, together with the introduction of possible transfers of quotas between operators in different Member States."
"We cannot accept these proposals and we therefore tabled various amendments. Unfortunately, not all of these were adopted."
"We support a radical reform of the sugar market within the EU with a view as soon as possible to liberalising this market and giving sugar-producing countries outside the EU the ability to compete on fair conditions."
"Given that all the amendments to Parliament’s draft resolution tabled by Mr van den Berg and others with this aim in view were defeated, the resolution will not take the issue of the EU’s sugar market down this route."
"We have therefore voted against the draft resolution."
"I believe it is of the greatest importance for EU agricultural policy, including the organisation of the market in sugar, to be reformed."
"The present system costs a lot of money. Moreover, today’s high agricultural subsidies involve EU products being dumped on the world market, something that has serious consequences for the developing countries."
"Today, the European Parliament has voted on a resolution subsequent to an oral question put by Mr Daul and Mr Fruteau."
"I chose to vote against the resolution as a whole since it is mainly oriented towards maintaining the status quo."
"Sugar producers in certain developing countries too will be affected by the reform of the common organisation of the market in sugar. The current system is not entirely to their disadvantage."
"Their situation should not, however, be remedied through a less far-reaching reform of the sugar market."
"Instead, these countries should be supported through other measures such as increased development cooperation and technical trade support."
"The motion for a resolution before us on the common organisation of the market in sugar was ultimately the result of a compromise which guarantees key national interests pending, in particular, the reduction in the size of the sugar beet market now underway in Portugal. What is even more serious here is that, if this were not the case, the damage would be felt by an outermost region like the Azores, which is already suffering from various constraints on its economic development."
"My main reservation about the reform of the sugar sector relates principally to the swingeing cut in sugar beet production quotas envisaged in the Commission proposal."
"In common with the producers’ associations and some European governments, I believe that a measure of this kind will lead to concentration of sugar beet production in just a few Member States."
"I believe that production should continue to be spread throughout the entire Community, not just for environmental and economic reasons, but also because otherwise there is a risk that thousands of jobs will be lost, jobs that will be hard to replace, thus leading to unavoidable social costs."
"To my mind it is essential for the planned reform of the common organisation of the market in sugar to guarantee price levels ensuring adequate remuneration both for Community producers and for suppliers in developing countries, while avoiding the temptation to disrupt the equilibrium prevailing in the sugar sector."
"Failing this, I believe that serious damage will be done not just to Community producers, who will suffer from a drastic fall in income, but also to Community consumers, who, as at the time of previous reforms, will not even benefit from a reduction in the price of sugar, which will be entirely lost through market mechanisms."
"I voted in favour."
"Today, the European Parliament has voted on a resolution subsequent to an oral question put by Mr Daul and Mr Fruteau."
"I chose to vote against the resolution as a whole since it is mainly oriented towards maintaining the status quo."
"It is of the greatest importance for EU agricultural policy – including the organisation of the market in sugar – to be reformed."
"This is partly because the present system costs EU taxpayers a lot of money to maintain and partly because today’s high agricultural subsidies involve EU products being dumped on the world market, something that has serious consequences for the developing countries’ ability to export and produce."
"The reform of the common organisation of the market in sugar will not only affect European sugar producers, but also producers in certain developing countries whom the current system does not at present entirely place at a disadvantage."
"Their situation should not, however, be remedied through a less far-reaching reform of the sugar market."
"Instead, these countries should be supported through increased development cooperation and technical trade support, derived perhaps from the resources released in connection with the reform of the sugar market."
"Finally, it is important for these countries to be given an adequate transitional period in which to adapt to the new situation."
"On behalf of the EPLP I would like to outline why we will not be voting in favour of the Fruteau/Daul resolution."
"This resolution follows an oral question from the Agriculture committee, ands aims to give a de facto EP position on sugar ahead of the Commission's legislative proposals."
"The Development, Trade, Budgets, Consumers and the Environment Committees are all concerned by this complex issue."
"We need reform in the sugar sector not only due to WTO pressures but also because we need a competitive EU food industry, to maintain jobs and a viable industry."
"We need a proper single market in sugar which this resolution does not address."
"We need to help the least-developed countries by allowing them access to EU markets, but this needs to be discussed fully not determined by an oral resolution."
"We need to support the Commission in their efforts to bring this complex sector into line with other CAP reforms not argue to retain the status quo."
"The next item is the Commission Statement on the situation in Tibet."
"Mr President, the situation in Tibet remains high on the political and human rights agenda of the European Union's relations with China."
"The EU is concerned about the preservation of the cultural, religious and linguistic identity of the Tibetan people, and more particularly about the restrictive conditions imposed by the central authorities on the exercise of religious freedom in the Tibet Autonomous Region."
"Recently, some Tibetan monks were sentenced, allegedly for possessing portraits of the Dalai Lama."
"We heard that some were detained and beaten."
"We are also still waiting, in spite of continuous requests, for information on the whereabouts of the Dalai Lama’s choice of the eleventh Panchen Lama, Gedhun Choekyi Nyima."
"We have seized every opportunity regularly to raise these concerns with our Chinese interlocutors."
"We have done so at the highest political level, for example at the seventh bilateral summit held in the Hague on 8 December 2004, as we have done regularly within the framework of the ongoing bilateral dialogue on human rights."
"During the last session of this dialogue, held in Luxembourg on 24/25 February 2005, the issue was again extensively addressed."
"We have also brought to the attention of the Chinese authorities the situation of Tibetan individuals, together with individuals from all over China, who have been sentenced for freely expressing their opinion or belief."
"The case of Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche has become emblematic."
"We fully share the view that the European Parliament expressed in January in a resolution on Tibet and we will continue urging the Chinese authorities to release this monk at the earliest possible date."
"We hope that a solution compatible with Chinese sovereignty and respect for the Tibetan population will be found soon."
"In our view, to reach this ultimate goal, there is no alternative to a peaceful process based on dialogue."
"We have called for years, and will continue to call, for such a dialogue. We, therefore, fully support the consultations that have taken place over the past years between Beijing and the representatives of the Dalai Lama."
"We welcome the fact that the two Special Envoys of the Dalai Lama were able to visit China last September for the third time since the resumption of contacts in September 2002."
"We met - as we often have in the past - Kelsang Gyaltsen, one of the two Dalai Lama’s Special Envoys, on his return from China, and we felt encouraged by his positive assessment of the visit."
"We understand that progress has been made to narrow the gap between the existing respective positions."
"We hope that those developments will encourage the start of a meaningful and direct dialogue between Beijing and the Dalai Lama, which will lead to the recognition of genuine autonomy for the Tibetan region."
"We firmly believe that only such direct dialogue can be conducive to a lasting solution of the Tibetan issue."
"In our view, the opening of a direct dialogue should not be subject to any precondition."
"On the other hand, the respective parties should refrain from taking any steps that would compromise the establishment of a climate of confidence, which appears indispensable if a solution is to be reached."
"In all circumstances, we would condemn violence from any quarter as a solution to the problem of Tibet."
"The Commission would certainly be prepared to become more involved in finding a solution if it were the wish of the parties most concerned."
"We will, no doubt, continue to pay the greatest attention to the situation in Tibet and to press for conditions that allow the Tibetans to fully exercise their basic political, religious and cultural rights and permit the cultural identity of Tibet to be preserved."
". Mr President, speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I wish to thank all those – including you, Commissioner Kallas – who have supported our request for a debate on a country whose citizens need us alongside them more than ever."
"Forty-six years ago today, in Lhasa, Chinese troops crushed the Tibetans’ peaceful protests against the armed occupation of their country, killing 87 000 of them, and arresting thousands of others."
"To date, over a million Tibetans have died as a result of hunger, torture and execution, and over three-quarters of their shrines, temples and monasteries have been systematically destroyed."
"While 10 March is a day of mourning, it is also a day of resistance to enforced silence, to the violation of human rights, to the suppression of cultural, religious and human identity."
"Today, as every year, Tibetan flags are being hoisted all around the world, in 2 000 cities and municipalities in the European Union, over 650 of them in Germany – my own country – alone."
"The day after tomorrow, in Berlin, we will be joining thousands of campaigners for human rights, including an increasing number of young people and political office-holders, remembering the victims before the Brandenburg Gate."
"This House has adopted significant resolutions that have given the Tibetans courage, among them the outstanding Romeva Report on arms exports, in which the Council was urged to maintain the embargo on the sale of armaments to China – an appeal backed up by our joint resolution on the Geneva Human Rights Convention."
"The day after tomorrow, the 3 000 delegates to the Chinese People’s Congress will be assembling in Beijing."
"They will be adopting an anti-secession law, intended to back up a possible military strike against Taiwan."
"To endorse such a confrontation, even if only indirectly, is a fatal and irreparable error, as we, Commissioner, have pointed out time and time again, calling at the same time for the continuation of dialogue between representatives of the Dalai Lama and the Chinese authorities."
"It is not enough to announce, immediately before important state visits, that talks are in progress, only for them, again and again, to prove fruitless."
"In his message on the occasion of the anniversary of the popular uprising, His Holiness the Dalai Lama declares his determination to find a solution that both takes account of Chinese interests and enables the Tibetan people to live in peace, freedom and dignity."
"Our Parliament’s Tibet Intergroup, composed of representatives from all the political families, will continue to campaign for human rights campaigners, NGOs, members of other national parliaments to be heard in this House again and again."
"In terms of our solidarity with the Tibetan people and their justified claims, there is no more appropriate day than today, 10 March."
"And so, to those of us who join in showing our colours in cities, towns and parliaments, ‘Tashi delek’ – good fortune."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, European policy towards China is based on political dialogue and genuine two-way communication."
"It is only thanks to this communication that we can help our Chinese friends in their transition towards an open society and one more respectful of human rights and the rule of law."
"This two-way communication must also be the cornerstone of our discussions on Tibet."
"The recent case of Tenzin Delek Rinpoche gave us the opportunity to appeal to the Chinese Government to improve the conditions of prisoners."
"If China wishes to play a wider global role, it must comply with international standards on imprisonment, including in Tibet."
"In particular, everyone is entitled to a fair and equitable trial, internationally recognised as such."
"For this reason, we are delighted whenever prisoners of conscience are freed in Tibet."
"We again ask them to abolish the death penalty."
"The European Union has managed to eradicate capital punishment from its territory."
"This was a great victory for humanity, and we hope China will follow in these footsteps."
"We should like to see an ongoing improvement in the human rights situation in Tibet."
"We invite China to ratify the UN International Pact on Civil and Political Rights."
"Everyone must be able to express his or her political opinions freely and without the threat of imprisonment."
"The European Union/China inter-parliamentary delegation was able to travel to Tibet two years ago."
"The visit taught us a great deal."
"We looked at European programmes and were able to grasp the importance of our relations with China and with the autonomous province of Tibet."
"Tibet needs electricity, running water and hospitals."
"I should also like the European Union to share its experience in terms of minority rights."
"We could share best practice on the rights of minorities to maintain their heritage and traditions, something which is sorely needed when we see the disfigured state of Lhasa."
"Finally, we would encourage China to maintain a dialogue with representatives of the Dalai Lama."
"This dialogue must be undertaken with a view to finding a mutually acceptable solution to the question of Tibet as quickly as possible."
"Mr President, it is clear that China has been acting in an expansionist manner for decades."
"It has also been aiming to strengthen its position at the expense of other countries and peoples."
"I can provide abundant evidence of this."
"Allow me to recall the annexation of part of Kashmir by China, the war in the Himalayas between China and India and China’s attack on Vietnam in 1979."
"The most appalling and shameful action of this type happened earlier and has already been mentioned in the House."
"I refer to the subjugation of Tibet."
"Very few events of this kind have taken place over the last 50 years, and they have never gone unpunished."
"Conquests of this sort have not been allowed to continue."
"I could remind the House of the case of East Timor or of the cases of Kuwait and Iraq with which we are so very familiar."
"Things turned out differently where China and Tibet are concerned."
"It is a case of more than mere conquest, as China has taken over every aspect of Tibetan life by force."
"Large numbers of Chinese settlements have been set up in Tibet, and they are of course controlled by the central government."
"Tibetans cannot find work in their own country, as all new jobs are reserved for the Chinese."
"The national identity of Tibet is being destroyed, and its great historical legacy eroded."
"Obviously, such a course of action meant that Tibet’s great religion was first in the line of fire."
"This is evident from the treatment meted out to the Dalai Lama, and also from the disappearance of the second most important religious representative, the Panchen Lama, whose fate remains unknown."
"In addition, wholesale indoctrination of Buddhist monks and nuns has taken place."
"The brainwashing process always concludes in the same way."
"Individuals are forced to choose between signing a statement breaking with the Dalai Lama or not returning to their religious communities."
"The outcome has been that some 12 000 Buddhist monks and nuns have been expelled from their communities."
"As the House will be well aware, even possession of an image of the Dalai Lama is a punishable offence."
"The intention is to erase him from the collective memory of the Tibetan people."
"This is all alarmingly reminiscent of the steps taken in Russia, when Bukharin, Trotsky and others were airbrushed out of photographs."
"As to the position that this is an internal Chinese matter and we should not become involved, it brings to mind the arguments adduced by a person being tried for murdering his parents, who pleads with the court for a lenient sentence on the grounds that he is an orphan."
"Mr President, thank you for the opportunity today to make the House once again aware of the issue of Tibet, of which, if there is eventually to be a solution, it must again and again be reminded, particularly at a time when the human rights situation there and in China is increasingly glossed over and ignored out of the desire for improved economic relations."
"You mentioned, Commissioner, that the Commission will get involved as and when both parties approach you."
"For that, I fear, we will have a very, very long time to wait, for it is not exactly in China’s interest that Tibet and the suppression of its culture be publicly debated and exposed."
"It is for us in this European Parliament – and also for all European delegations that travel to China – to spell out the fact that it is Tibet that will – and must – determine whether there is to be more cooperation between Europe and China, both in terms of improved trading relations and of whether or not embargos are to be lifted."
"Let the Chinese Government be aware that the latest attacks on Tibetan religion are counter-productive in this respect."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the Commissioner for his answer to the question."
"As has been quite rightly pointed out, the Tibetans are being denied their most basic political and democratic rights."
"What, moreover, we see, and have seen for a long time, is an all but systematic destruction of their cultural heritage and of their ability to practise their religion."
"The example given by the Commissioner, namely of monks being imprisoned for having portraits of the Dalai Lama, is just one example of how absurd this oppression is."
"As is well known, the EU has expressed this view on quite a number of occasions."
"The question is: is this enough?"
"It would be interesting to hear more about plans for the future."
"How is the pressure on China to be increased where the issue of Tibet is concerned?"
"China is now an economic and political giant which is increasingly also becoming a global player."
"There must, however, be no beating about the bush where China is concerned."
"The positive economic development is in no way matched by correspondingly positive democratic development."
"We see nothing of that at present."
"On the contrary, the fact is that China’s economic progress is partly based upon its systematically denying its own workers their most basic rights."
"Policy on China is therefore a test of the EU’s credibility on human rights issues."
"Economic interests vie with support for Tibetans’ and other Chinese people’s political and democratic rights."
"That test is one that the EU must pass."
"It would therefore be quite absurd to do what is now proposed, namely to lift the arms embargo on China."
"That would be to give two different signals at the same time."
"There would be oral criticism, but a simultaneous demonstration in practical terms that another type of relationship with China was desired, with little real importance attached to the oppression practised by that country."
"The EU must adopt a more consistent attitude."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased that the House has now raised the issue of Tibet on three occasions within a short space of time, because it is an issue of the utmost importance."
"I am also pleased that the European Commission is dealing with it, and I should like to thank the Commissioner for his statement."
"I would like to make it clear that I cannot accept some of the content of the Commissioner’s statement."
"As I understood Mr Onyszkiewicz’s speech, he cannot accept it either."
"The Commissioner seemed to indicate that this was an internal Chinese matter."
"I beg to differ."
"This is not an internal Chinese matter, and we are all aware that China violates human rights on its own territory."
"As Mr Onyszkiewicz said, this is a matter of a nation conquered by China, and I fully agree with him."
"Commissioner, you ventured to suggest that a solution compatible with Chinese sovereignty and respect for the rights of the Tibetan people should be sought."
"That is a tall order, as there are no limits to the aspirations of the Chinese leadership."
"We can only go as far as agreeing to what the Dalai Lama is prepared to consent to, namely that China could represent Tibet in the international arena."
"Tibet must run its own internal affairs."
"There can be no question of autonomy."
"It therefore seems to me that calling for a climate of mutual trust is not the right approach."
"What is needed is a change in the Chinese attitude."
"The people of Tibet have shown quite clearly that they are acting appropriately and building a climate of trust."
"The fact that they have agreed for China to represent them abroad is ample proof of the trust they deserve."
"It has to be said that trust is an unfortunate term to use in connection with a conquered and humiliated nation."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we need to understand that in conquering Tibet, China identified religion with cultural and national issues."
"The Tibetan people are being persecuted on all three counts, and this persecution must be stopped."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"I want to thank you particularly for allowing me to take the floor."
"I had intended to do so on behalf of the Non-attached Members, but I differ from my colleagues in that I wish to thank Commissioner Kallas very much for his statement."
"In my view, the European Commission needs to find its own way of dealing with Tibet."
"The Commission’s way is likely to be effective but less dramatic than ours."
"I believe the Commission has presented such a policy today and demonstrated the political will to see it through, and I wished to thank the Commissioner for that."
"As I see it, the Dalai Lama’s latest statement, in which he refers to respecting the territorial integrity of China, is very significant."
"Another important development is political in nature. I refer to the Chinese leadership’s undertaking to engage in the dialogue the Commissioner mentioned."
"I believe that even the so-called ‘step-by-step’ policy is effective."
"I am convinced that with the support of the House and acting also on its behalf, the Commission will be able to ensure that all the problems previous speakers rightly pointed out are resolved."
"Essentially, the Members who spoke before me were presenting a snapshot of reality."
"I very much hope that any future snapshot will be entirely different."
"It is my earnest desire that the problems referred to today will have faded into oblivion in a couple of years’ time."
"I would like to express my gratitude to the Commission for this statement."
"I am often critical of the European Commission, but on this occasion I believe it has taken a step in the right direction."
"Finally, I should like to thank the President again for enabling me to speak pursuant to an earlier agreement."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, today is the 46th anniversary of the Tibetan national uprising of 1959 and this year the Chinese Government is marking the 40th anniversary of the establishment of the Tibet Autonomous Region."
"The PPE-DE Group supports the middle-way approach for increased Tibetan autonomy or self-government within a united China that is respectful of cultural, religious and linguistic diversity."
"This is exactly what the Dalai Lama has reiterated today to be his approach and that of the Tibetan people."
"I quote his words of today: 'I want once again to reassure the Chinese authorities that as long as I am responsible for the affairs of Tibet, we remain fully committed to the middle-way approach of not seeking independence for Tibet and are willing to remain within the People's Republic of China.'"
"I acknowledge that His Excellency Mr Guan Chengyua, the Chinese Ambassador to the EU, stated this morning at the China delegation meeting, in response to a question, that the door is open for the Dalai Lama, especially if he abandons any secessionist activities and recognises that China is whole and indivisible."
"It appears to me that the Dalai Lama, and indeed His Excellency the Chinese Ambassador, are singing from the same hymn sheet on this and I would urge them to make progress."
"The Dalai Lama accepts the middle way as the only way forward."
"He has made that very clear and reiterated it today."
"It is also the view of my own group, which passionately supports that way forward."
"China has made great economic progress in recent decades and it is now a major player on the world stage, which delights us all."
"We see the potential and the enormous contribution that China and the Chinese people can make worldwide."
"There still is, as Commissioner Kallas said earlier, a problem in certain areas of human rights."
"We should be able to sit down and make progress in these areas."
"In China, with a population of 1½ billion, the scale of the problem is different, but China has made enormous progress on the economic side."
"I believe, with the good will and support of all concerned, China can make the same progress on human rights issues and we want to encourage it to do that."
"Tibet, however, is an international treasure and international treasures are not the preserve of any one people."
"We want to help the Chinese to preserve Tibet, which has a unique cultural, religious and linguistic heritage."
"I say to the Chinese authorities: please preserve it, through the middle way approach, through supporting the autonomous region of Tibet, so that we can all continue to enjoy the heritage of this absolute jewel on the world stage."
"Mr President, I would like once again to congratulate this Parliament and the Commission on tackling the issue of Tibet."
"I believe that this offers us a good opportunity to point out that it is not the Tibetan Government and the Dalai Lama who now have to make a move in favour of Sino-Tibetan dialogue and a lasting and fair solution for the people of Tibet — they have already done so — but rather the Chinese Government in particular."
"Within this framework of growing relations with the European Union, I believe that it is important to send a clear message to China that it must respond favourably to the progress in this dialogue and it is therefore very worrying that the possibility of lifting the arms embargo on China is also mentioned."
"I believe that this is a serious mistake and that it would not just send an inappropriate message about the European Union's double standards when assessing human rights in the world, but also about our institutional inconsistency, since we should remember that the European Parliament recently adopted a resolution that expressed quite the opposite point of view."
"I would therefore insist that to lift the arms embargo on China today, before the situation in Tibet is resolved, would clearly send the wrong message."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I am very glad that we are having this debate, for this year marks 23 years since this House, here in Strasbourg, adopted the Habsburg Report on the decolonisation of the Baltic states and asked the UN’s decolonisation sub-committee to take up their cause."
"Having at the time been on the rapporteur’s staff, I still remember the counter-arguments to the effect that independence for the Baltic states would never be possible, that this was utopian fantasy, that the Balts possessed no right to self-determination, and so on."
"The fact that there are, today, Members and Commissioners from the Baltic states sitting in this House should encourage us not to be deterred from our course where Tibet is concerned."
"Tibet is – as has been said here today many times – not only in essence a human rights problem, but much more than that."
"There are those who talk of it being a minorities issue, but to do so is to misread the facts."
"Tibet is not a minority problem; the problem is that it is a country that has been overrun by colonisers."
"China is a colonial power – no more and no less."
"If the Chinese want to go on living together with the Tibetans – a possibility to which the Dalai Lama has referred – then it is they who must take the first and crucial step and gain the trust of the Tibetan people – something they can do only by acknowledging and defending their right of self-determination, their own culture and religion and their rights as human beings."
"It is only through partnership that integration is possible."
"Suppression integrates nobody; it results in disintegration."
"That is why it makes such an impact that so many former human rights activists – Milan Horáček, who is sitting here, his former fellow-campaigner Václav Havel, many of our Polish Members – are so strong in their support for Tibet, for it is a clear sign that Europe’s freedom and Tibet’s are, in the long run, inseparable one from another, and that freedom is indivisible."
"So my thanks go to Mr Thomas Mann and to all the others in our group with primary responsibility for Tibet, for having joined with Members from other groups in securing for us this debate on a current issue before we move on to matters of urgent importance."
"The only thing I have to say to the Chinese leadership is that we, in the European Parliament, will not give up until this symbol of a free Tibet that we have set up here can indeed shine forth in freedom, and until the Tibetans can follow their own democratically chosen path."
"Mr President, I would especially like to thank Mr Posselt, who has touched on something that, for obvious reasons, is a serious point."
"What he said about the history of my own nation is true."
"Along with the rest of Estonia, I am very familiar with the history of Tibet, and with the events of 1959 in particular."
"We in Europe have to be concerned at the situation in Tibet, and I am pleased to say that the Commission is keeping this issue high on its agenda."
"What can be done?"
"The Commission is in favour of genuine autonomy and the preservation of cultural, religious and national identity."
"We have received some positive signs that the process is going in the right direction."
"We have had consultations with representatives of the Dalai Lama and know that there have been consultations between his representatives and the Chinese authorities."
"We hope that possible solutions will follow."
"In history, large-scale, comprehensive and unanimous peaceful pressure from the free world has brought impressive results."
"I am convinced that the European Parliament and the European Commission will again prove powerful driving forces for such pressure."
"Mr President, I beg permission to raise a matter concerning human rights."
"I have sent in letters on the subject."
"The human rights problems in Tibet, Belarus and so on are hard to comprehend."
"However, that does not mean that we do not have problems in our own countries."
"Last week a family with five special needs children had their children taken from them."
"That family’s case had been reported in the national media, exposing the lack of services for their own children and children in general."
"In Ireland the services are very patchy and in places very poor, and some families have been told that if they need help the State might take their children from them."
"I have had at least six families come to me about this."
"The five children involved were supposed to be returned to their parents on Monday, but have not been as yet."
"They are autistic and there is no way to explain to them what is happening or that they cannot go home."
"They are being damaged for life."
"I appeal to the House to talk to the Irish Government about its treatment of people with disabilities and their families."
"The next item is the debate on the six motions for resolutions on Belarus(1)."
"Mr President, we have a very tough resolution against Belarus before us, but it unfortunately also reflects the grim reality."
"The lights are going out in Belarus, and the prospects for development are ever more receding."
"I believe that one point could have been emphasised still more in this resolution, namely the oppression of the free trade union movement in Belarus."
"This is an important part of the country’s democratic opposition."
"Parts of this movement are now on the way to being crushed by the Lukashenko regime."
"Belarus is now a country that is becoming ever more isolated in Europe."
"That obviously applies also to its contacts with the EU - a course that has obviously been chosen by the President of Belarus and that thus also affects the Belarussian people."
"That is why it is all the more important to show that this policy of isolating Belarus is aimed at those in power in the country and not at the Belarussian people."
"What we need now is more contact with the civil organisations in Belarus, the democratic opposition, independent media and the free trade unions that are still fighting against the authoritarian government headed by President Lukashenko."
"At the same time, we should perhaps conduct a still tougher policy of sanctions against those who now govern Belarussian society."
"There is no alternative."
"In countries all around the region, for example in Ukraine and other countries, a process of democratisation is taking place."
"Clearly, the day will come when Belarus too is democratised and can be included in further European cooperation."
"Ladies and gentlemen, last year the European Parliament awarded the Sakharov human rights prize to the Belarusian Association of Journalists."
"Today we have a responsibility to European society and the people of Belarus to demonstrate whether we can sustain the high standards set by Dr Sakharov and the European Parliament, since the human rights prize awarded in the name of Academician Andrei Sakharov, is a symbol for the victory of the dignity of mankind, intellectual freedom and reason."
"Today we must continue what we have begun."
"We are responding to the struggle by the Belarussian democrat Mihail Marynich for human rights, by adopting a resolution demanding his immediate and unconditional release as well as that of other political prisoners — that is our responsibility."
"Responding to the struggle of the journalists of Belarus for the truth, in our statement we strongly condemn attacks by the Lukashenko regime on the media, journalists and any person who freely expresses their opinion — that is our responsibility."
"We are responding to the Belarusian people’s fight for the right to belong to the new democratic world by condemning the dictatorial Lukashenko regime — that is our responsibility."
"Europe must promote the process of shaping civil society in Belarus, where society is not as inert as is at times thought in Europe."
"People want to express their opinions and are ready to do so, and I am convinced that the struggle of the Belarussian people and the leaders of democracy there has earned the most comprehensive EU support — both moral and financial, since the criminal Lukashenko regime is combating them ruthlessly."
"Our duty is to call things by their real names."
"Today in Belarus there is a form of implementing political, economic and ideological power, a regime known as a dictatorship."
"In Minsk the true supreme power, legislative power, executive power and even judicial power belongs to one person — a dictator, who has usurped unlimited, absolute and uncontrollable power and dominion over society and individuals."
"I call on the European Parliament and the Council to acknowledge that the current Belarusian regime is a dictatorship and that President Lukashenko is a dictator, and to condemn them."
"In the name of Belarussian democracy, I call for a unification of vision and economic power, Europe’s parliamentary experience and the administrative capacity of the Commission."
"In order to protect Belarussian democracy, we need a decent shield, not an umbrella."
"I call for our common endeavour to begin today!"
"Thank you, Mr President."
"Belarus is a blot on the map of Europe, and unfortunately this blot is becoming blacker and blacker."
"Elsewhere, democracy is making headway, even in Arab countries, though the rate of progress is slow and we are not satisfied with it."
"In Belarus, however, the situation is worsening."
"Mr Lukaschenko, Belarus’ , is doing all he can to isolate the country still further."
"He recently stated that Belarus ought not to send young people to be educated and study in the West, because anything they learnt there would be of no use back in their home country, especially in view of the political situation in Belarus."
"It is hardly surprising that Western knowledge is deemed useless in Belarus, given that the country must be the only country in Europe and perhaps even further afield, where an official state ideology exists."
"There are officials everywhere, monitoring compliance with this state ideology and its development."
"They can be found in every workplace."
"It is therefore crucially important for us to send out a strong signal on this matter."
"Allow me to state quite clearly that what is happening in Belarus is not just a matter for Belarus, it is an important matter for the whole of Europe."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the world finds itself in an era in which democratic values are being imposed across the globe."
"Of course, none of us can remain indifferent in the face of events in the Middle East, including the major changes in Lebanon, where people are also demanding the right to freedom and democracy."
"We very recently had an opportunity here in Parliament to hear the new President of Ukraine drawing attention to the new reality and the major transformation that has taken place in his country."
"Against that background it is totally unacceptable for our continent to continue to be blemished by what has already been described, and very appositely, as a dark stain that is becoming darker still with each passing day."
"The news from Belarus is really very disturbing."
"There is not the least sign of the regime being willing to open up to civil society: quite the opposite, it is stepping up increasingly repressive measures."
"I therefore believe that, politically speaking, Belarus has become one of the greatest problems we face within Europe, and in view of the gravity of this situation I believe that we should strengthen our support for civil society in that country in every possible way, and that we should also step up existing sanctions as far as possible."
"The dialogue between the European Union and Russia has assumed particular importance in this context."
"As we know, one of the most important problems to be discussed as part of this dialogue is conditions in the neighbouring countries which lie between the European Union and Russia, and, as our resolution states very clearly, it is a matter of regret that this point – covered in paragraph 21 of our resolution – has not been taken up by the Commission."
"Commissioner, I hope that you will be able to enlighten us on that subject;"
"I regard that as essential."
"We will accordingly be supporting this motion for a resolution in the hope that there will be good news from Belarus before the year is out."
"I sincerely hope so."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, fortunate and independent countries have a tendency to forget the fate of those not equally blessed."
"Tibet was the subject of debate in the House today."
"Luckily, Tibet and the Dalai Lama do not allow themselves to be forgotten."
"They send out constant reminders of their existence."
"I have to say that my country’s history was equally bitter."
"In the nineteenth century Europe often tried to forget that the Polish people existed and had a right to independence."
"Only the many Polish uprisings kept the so-called Polish issue alive and ensured Poland was not forgotten."
"In more recent history, the world largely forgot about the whole area of Europe that found itself under a Communist yoke after the 1945 Yalta Conference."
"Then came 1989, the fall of the Communist regime in Poland, followed by the fall of the Berlin Wall."
"I should remind the House that the fall of Communism in Poland preceded the fall of the Berlin Wall."
"There followed happy times for Poland."
"We now need to realise that what lies beyond the eastern border of the present European Union is not another planet but our own back yard."
"When the people of Ukraine claimed their independence, the European Union managed to demonstrate its support."
"The same should happen now."
"The responsibility for defending the Belarussian nation and its right to genuine independence, rather than a semblance of independence controlled by Mr Lukaschenko and his cronies, rests on our shoulders."
"It is important to realise that whilst combating his people, Mr Lukaschenko is also combating their culture and religion, notably the Catholic religion."
"There are many Catholics in Belarus, and Catholicism tends to be identified with independentist and pro-Western tendencies."
"The expulsion of Catholic priests has become standard practice in Belarus."
"That is why we must offer every support to the people of Belarus as they seek their freedom."
"Mr President, there is no democracy when people are hunted down and thrown into jail for thinking differently, for then arbitrariness, fear and double-dealing hold the reins."
"There are many in this chamber who know what it was like when these conditions applied in our own states."
"This is a situation in which we should not shrink back from using the word ‘dictatorship’, for that is precisely what is currently gaining ground in Belarus."
"That is precisely the situation in which it is possible for political detainees such as Mikhail Marinitch, Valeri Levonevski and Alexander Vassiliev, as well as Yauhien Afnagel and Professor Yuri Bandashevsky, to cite two topical examples, to have their personal freedoms curtailed."
"This is something we have to bring to people’s attention, and, here and now, I call on the Council – in its absence – and the Commission to summon the Belarussian ambassadors and give them a political message demanding the immediate release of these political detainees and making it plain that we will not tolerate further detentions on the grounds of the free expression of opinion."
"In the same breath, let me reiterate my call to the Commission and the Council to also do something about the disappeared persons and press on with the work that the Council of Europe has begun."
"They must set in motion an international inquiry that will at last give the people of Belarus hope when the international community no longer keeps silent in the face of the massive violations of human rights in Belarus."
"Mr President, when I say 'Belarus' you might react with the all too familiar 'last dictatorship in Europe'."
"Indeed, human rights abuses are an everyday occurrence in the EU's new neighbour."
"Allow me, however, not to talk directly about human rights abuses in Belarus, but to raise the issue of the European Union's assistance to civil society in that country."
"Through the TACIS programme, the EU has allocated EUR 10 million to projects in Belarus in support of civil society and the independent media for the period 2005-2006."
"Since that assistance flows through the Belarus Government, it is not efficient and flexible enough to support civil society organisations, the majority of which have already been de-registered for political reasons."
"In spite of the Council of Ministers' resolution of November 2004 and the detailed EU action plan for promoting democracy in Belarus, the European Commission insists on using the existing mechanism for support to civil society in Belarus."
"Some Member States and the expelled Belarussian community, on the other hand, want to see the creation of a special fund, with more flexible structures, to support non-registered NGOs, which are the most active and important in Belarus but receive no support under the current EU mechanisms."
"We must acknowledge the progress made by the European Commission regarding Belarus."
"However, the Commission must finally recognise the need for increased support for genuine civil society organisations such as the Belarussian Association of Journalists, laureate of the Sakharov Prize."
"I therefore call on the European Parliament to raise its voice in this matter, exert its influence and put adequate pressure not only on the Commission but also on Belarus."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is rare for a motion to be carried unanimously in the European Parliament, but I am convinced this will be the case today, when we vote on Belarus."
"I truly believe it could happen."
"Rarely do black-and-white situations arise in the international arena or indeed in internal politics."
"The situation in Belarus is like a black-and-white film."
"Truth and freedom are on one side, and the regime on the other."
"I thank the rapporteurs for their motion for a resolution."
"I am not sure that it is too severe."
"It is appropriate to the current situation in Belarus, which is after all a European country."
"This motion for a resolution is a rallying call to the defence of a free, democratic and European Belarus."
"The country deserves a better future."
"The European Parliament has remembered the political prisoners and the disappeared in Belarus, the closed-down newspapers and educational establishments, whilst emphasising that freedom is indivisible and that freedom does not require a visa from Mr Lukaschenko."
"I believe thanks are due to the rapporteurs for this."
"In conclusion, I should like to say that as the House defends the cause of Belarus today, it is also defending European solidarity and honour."
"I thank you."
"Mr President, in the Middle Ages, the Lithuanians, the Poles and the White Russians constituted a triple federation, a central European kingdom."
"Today, the Poles and Lithuanians are with us, and people talk as if Belarus were on the moon."
"I recently received an e-mail from a member of the public who strongly protested at what he saw as our neglect of that country."
"Such is not the case; here in the European Parliament, we are giving human rights in Belarus massive backing, awarding the Sakharov Prize to its citizens, holding debates on a regular basis, and really getting stuck in."
"That, though, is the impression that the public get as a result of the Council’s absolute passivity, and, in particular, of the policies adopted by our nation states, whose interest in this issue is – with a few laudable exceptions – quite inadequate."
"For these reasons, it is important that we should make it clear that items 3 and 4 in this resolution must be addressed with all speed;"
"I refer to the investigation of the cases where people have disappeared, and the release of political detainees."
"I would ask the other groups to lend their support to our amendment, whereby we may be able to do something for young people from Belarus, where, we agree, democracy and the rule of law must be advanced, and the nation states must at last awake from their torpor."
"Mr President, let me start by saying that I very much share the sentiments expressed in your motion for a resolution on Belarus, about which we share many of the same concerns."
"The EU’s goal is to have close relations with all of our neighbours, including Belarus."
"We want to see Belarus as a democratic, stable and prosperous country, fully benefiting from our Neighbourhood Policy."
"Unfortunately, its government's policies prevent it from taking its rightful place in the family of European nations."
"The seriously flawed conduct of the parliamentary elections and the referendum in October 2004, show how far Belarus is lagging behind in terms of democratic development."
"It is deeply worrying for us all that democratisation, respect for fundamental freedoms and respect for the rule of law are deteriorating rather than improving, as the regime continues to tighten its grip on democratic forces, the independent media and opposition forces."
"In November 2004, following the elections in Belarus, EU foreign ministers adopted conclusions setting out a clear EU policy."
"We confirmed the restrictions on ministerial-level contacts with Belarussian authorities, but at the same time sent a clear message to the population that they are not forgotten and that we are trying to support civil society and democratic forces in Belarus."
"We are closely monitoring the human rights situation in the country and, as a result, the EU imposed a visa ban last year on certain high-ranking Belarussian officials, on the basis of the findings of the Council of Europe’s Pourgourides report on politically motivated disappearances."
"We then extended this visa ban to the officials considered responsible for the rigged election and the referendum, as well as those responsible for the repression of the peaceful demonstrations that followed."
"The cases of Mr Marinich and other imprisoned political opponents are of great concern to us."
"We believe that his trial was politically motivated and have issued a statement calling for his disproportionate sentence to be reconsidered."
"We have serious concerns in general about the independence of the judiciary in Belarus and continue to follow these cases closely."
"The EU issued the statement on Mr Marinich's case in January."
"As regards your call on the Commission to step up our assistance efforts to Belarus, I am pleased to report that we have already done so in response to the EU Foreign Ministers' conclusions last November."
"The Commission is playing the lead role in coordinating and delivering EU assistance in support of civil society and democratisation in Belarus."
"A conference will be held in Vilnius next week on that very important subject."
"In difficult situations such as that of Belarus, where a country is isolating itself from the world, this is particularly difficult and we are working on the appropriate division of labour between the Community Member States and other donors."
"We very much welcome the role that the European Parliament can play in encouraging democratic changes and supporting democratic forces in Belarus."
"We are currently carefully examining the action plan which your Delegation for Relations with Belarus has prepared, to see how this can mesh with our own efforts in that regard."
"There is much to be done and we look forward to working with Parliament and with the democratic forces inside Belarus."
"You raised some questions in your contributions that I should like to answer."
"The first was whether Belarus was discussed at high-level meetings between the EU and Russia."
"The answer is yes; the issue is always raised during those meetings."
"The question of how to channel the funds and how to assist civil society in Belarus financially was also raised."
"The main question is the ability of the relevant organisations to absorb the funds."
"The Commission is ready to examine all possible ways of supporting Belarussian civil society financially so that the funds can be used efficiently."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place this afternoon following the debates."
"The next item is the debate on the six motions for resolutions on Cambodia(1)."
"Mr President, there has, for over thirty-five years, been a great deal of poison in Cambodian politics."
"After the French ceased their occupation of the much larger colony formerly known as Indochina, mainly as a result of the war of independence in what is now Vietnam, the Americans, the Russians and the Chinese were ready to bring the smaller new states of Cambodia and Laos into their respective spheres of influence."
"Each of those superpowers tried to arm their own satellite movements in those states and bring them to power with military support in order thereafter to permanently eliminate all other forces."
"In a sharp reaction to an irresponsible American intervention, power fell into the hands of the Khmer Rouge, a movement that laboured under the illusion that the destruction of the cities and the intellectuals would mean major progress for the poor farming population."
"I would remind you that it was this murderous terror regime that the United Nations recognised, rather than the insurgents backed by Vietnam, who wanted to bring it to an end."
"The then liberators still have a large following among the people, although they still feel distrusted by the outside world."
"On account of its toxic past, Cambodia still finds it virtually impossible to sustain normal coalition governments and a normally functioning parliamentary democracy."
"The political parties deny each other’s right of existence and would ideally like to annihilate one another for good."
"This explains how members of the parliamentary opposition can be treated as public enemies and locked up."
"Since the rich Western nations have in the past made a considerable contribution to this venomous climate, we have the moral duty to help the Cambodians to break free of it."
"Criticism and condemnation are desperately needed, but also the lesson that things could have been done better than the outside world have demonstrated to the Cambodians in the past."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we as parliamentarians can easily understand the horror and the violence described in relation to the motion for a resolution before us today."
"Three of our fellow parliamentarians, Sam Rainsy, Cheam Channy and Chea Poch were subjected to loss of immunity in a particularly brutal way, by means of a show of hands, in a parliamentary session – if it can be called that – held behind closed doors, hidden from the public gaze and without any formal record of the proceedings. Furthermore, one of these parliamentarians was arrested shortly afterwards."
"These events struck at the heart of democracy itself, at the very nature of parliament."
"One of the targets of this action, Mr Sam Rainsy, the leader of his party in fact, had two days earlier written an article in the Cambodia Daily clearly describing the gravity of the situation in his country. I would like to draw your attention to that situation, ladies and gentlemen."
"We need to act resolutely in this case."
"It is not the first time that we have had to highlight the serious nature of the situation in Cambodia, and we should call on the Commission, the Council and on the Member States to be particularly clear about this at the forthcoming meeting on 10 and 11 March."
"This issue will, however, also be dealt with at the next meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Committee which will be taking place in Geneva at the end of this month and continuing into April. A delegation from Parliament will be present at that meeting."
"It will be incumbent on us to follow all the debates very carefully, because the report of the UN special envoy, Mr Peter Leuprecht, also denounces the very grave situation in that country in the clearest terms."
"If I may quote the English expression he used, he called the situation in Cambodia ‘a chunky façade of democracy’."
"That is the extent of the deterioration we are witnessing."
"Cambodia, instead of offering us signs of hope and confidence in the future, is doing just the opposite. The attitude of the regime is hardening and human rights violations are on the increase."
"I accordingly suggest, ladies and gentlemen, that we should revisit this subject before the summer recess, once the conclusions of the Geneva meetings are available, and if there has been no significant progress in Cambodia."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to apologise to the Commissioners and fellow Members, because unfortunately, due to my flight schedule, I will be unable to stay until the end of this debate."
"I would kindly ask you to forgive me."
"Mr Sam Rainsy – Sam being, as you know, his surname and Rainsy his first name – and his wife are very good friends of mine, and so I have first-hand experience of the difficulty of the battle that is being fought."
"To give you an example, Mr Sam Rainsy’s party is entitled ‘Sam Rainsy’ because that is the only name that Hun Sen’s party did not reject."
"All other names he had tried first had been rejected."
"This is to give you an idea of that country’s power mechanism."
"What is particularly unfortunate, even more unfortunate than the fate of our three colleagues from the Cambodian Parliament, is the fact that, to date, Cambodia has been one of the poorest countries of South-East Asia, with a society characterised by an unusually high level of crime on a daily basis – violence that is politically inspired, criminally inspired, and in respect of which very little is being done."
"What we should not forget either is that despite all fine promises, the Cambodian Government – Mr Hun Sen having, as you know, again become Prime Minister – has not actually made a serious start on bringing to justice those who are most responsible for the mass destruction, the genocide that was committed by the Khmer Rouge, and nor does it seem likely that they will do so in the short term."
"It therefore goes without saying that we are concerned about the fate of our colleagues, which other members of the opposition could also suffer."
"I would, however, urge you not to lose sight of the fact that the European Union is Cambodia’s largest donor and that fact alone means that we definitely have levers at our disposal to persuade this awful regime to make changes for the better."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in Cambodia is indeed a source of concern."
"In supporting this joint resolution on Cambodia by six groups within this Parliament, I should like to emphasise two points, albeit at the risk of going over ground covered by some of the earlier speakers."
"The first point which I would like to stress today concerns the withdrawal of parliamentary immunity from three members of the Sam Rainsy party."
"The first of these is Cheam Channy, who has also been imprisoned and is set to be tried by a military tribunal, despite the fact that a Cambodian civilian may not be subjected to military justice."
"Next there are Chea Po and Sam Rainsy himself, who have both fled Cambodia in order to be able to speak out more effectively on the situation in that country."
"It is vital that they should be given back their immunity and thus be able to resume their role as elected representatives, a role conferred on them by the electors of Cambodia."
"We would point out that we received Sam Rainsy here a fortnight ago during the February plenary session, on the occasion of the visit of the ASEAN delegation."
"At that time, he expressed a desire for some gesture from us."
"It was therefore incumbent upon us to make that gesture today."
"Secondly, I should like there to be more effective monitoring of the various types of aid provided to Cambodia, as has just been mentioned."
"It is inconceivable that, according to the United Nations development programmes, over the last ten years the country should have seen deterioration in three of the key development benchmarks, namely the number of persons living below the poverty line, the adult illiteracy rate and the rate of infant mortality."
"There are fears that aid is not necessarily reaching those for whom it was originally intended and that it does not meet the population’s real needs."
"Effective monitoring and control of aid is necessary in that country in order to put a stop to this unfortunate tendency."
"The Cambodian Government should indicate its good intentions in terms of the effectiveness of measures taken and implemented in the country’s interests and should explain, in particular, the purpose to which European aid has been directed."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, by withdrawing parliamentary immunity from three opposition members of parliament – including our friend Sam Rainsy, whom a number of us have met – who had drawn attention to what was currently happening in Cambodia and had denounced the gangrene of corruption in their country, Cambodia has once again shown itself to be a very inadequate democracy indeed, in which autocracy imposes an arbitrary governance on political, social and economic life."
"We must bear in mind, as our colleague has just pointed out – and it is important that people are aware of this – that, despite the five billion dollars in international aid received during the last ten years, Cambodia is nonetheless the only country in the world where illiteracy, infant mortality and the number of people living below the poverty line are still on the increase."
"As the UN and World Bank have emphasised, those exercising political power are misappropriating international aid, the country’s resources, leaving the Cambodian people in a state of abject poverty."
"The donor countries – including ourselves – share the blame for this situation because there is no control of the true recipients of the aid, and a regime, known for its corruption and authoritarian excesses, is not being called to account."
"Finally, what can we say about the peasants expropriated for the benefit of a Chinese company which, like other companies, is unscrupulously laying waste to entire hectares of forest?"
"Since 1993, 50% of the Cambodian forest has been destroyed with the complicity of a corrupt government."
"It is time that the European Union began supporting those really engaged in the fight against corruption and striving to establish the rule of law and compliance with democratic principles, by, for example, making aid conditional upon respect for democracy, human rights and the environment."
"Finally, let us force the Cambodian Government to do what is the duty of every democratically elected government, namely to respect and support democrats."
". Mr President, during the difficult period in which Cambodia made a new beginning after dictatorship and the rampages of the Khmer Rouge, it was Son San, the president of its parliament, who became a driving force for freedom and democracy."
"He was a frequent visitor here in Strasbourg and an impressive partner to this House."
"It is therefore all the more terrible that the attempt is now being made to silence the Cambodian Parliament and its great democratic tradition, using intimidation and terror initiated by the Prime Minister."
"Let me say that Sam Rainsy’s visit a fortnight ago was entirely in the tradition of the visits made by the campaigner for freedom Son San, and that Sam Rainsy deserves our wholehearted support, for without a functioning parliament, all the efforts undertaken in Cambodia by the UN and the international community will have been in vain."
"Despite the great deal of money and the efforts by the international community that have been invested in Cambodia, we face the prospect of yet more general wreckage if we do not succeed in putting a stop to its government’s authoritarian tendencies and strengthening the democratic forces and parliamentary life."
". Mr President, the European Union has been in support of Cambodia’s democratisation process since 1992."
"We have always assumed that Cambodia would make gradual progress on the road to democracy, but patience is now, of course, wearing thin."
"In the past year, the situation in Cambodia has taken a dramatic turn for the worse, the latest low point being the witch hunt against three members of the opposition, including the brave Sam Rainsy who was here two weeks ago."
"Good though it was to see him here, it would have been better if he had not been here and had simply been able to fulfil his opposition role in Phnom Penh."
"You need not take my word for it, because in the next few days, the UN envoy to Cambodia, Mr Peter Leuprecht, will be presenting his findings to the United Nations."
"His conclusion is simply depressing."
"In his four years as envoy, hardly any progress has been made."
"The European Union, the Commission and the Member States have now spent a total of EUR 1 billion on the office in Phnom Penh, observation missions during elections, financial support for mine-clearing operations, and suchlike. Should we not conclude that the EU policy has simply failed?"
"We should be able to say so."
"In my view, the time for compromise is over."
"If the Cambodian Government does not soon respect the basic principles of democratic rule of law, such as transparency and accountability, we must suspend our support."
"What is, in any event, called for is a drastic reorientation of our support."
"Thank you."
"Several years have elapsed since the end of the conflict in Cambodia, but the situation within that country continues to give rise to concern."
"The House was recently moved to debate violations of human rights in Cambodia along with the unacceptable treatment of women and children that constituted an affront to their human dignity."
"The group in power was elected in so-called free elections."
"It has no concept of a state, and is either unable to engage in dialogue with the opposition or does not wish to do so."
"Twenty people died during the first local elections alone, and those in power did not allow the opposition access to the media."
"Many activists are now under arrest."
"Those who were arrested in the past remain in prison, and no sentence has been passed on them."
"Obtaining statements by force or through bribery is an everyday event."
"Corruption is widespread."
"These are all features of political life in Cambodia and of how the system of justice operates there."
"The attitude of the Cambodian Ministry for cults and religion is significant."
"It recently issued an edict banning the missionary activities of Christian churches, which led to anti-Christian protests."
"Religious discrimination, restrictions on the right of assembly and freedom of speech, threats and intimidation by political leaders all amount to serious infringements of the nation’s and the individual’s right to freedom."
"We therefore appeal for respect for human rights, an end to persecution and to the intimidation of human rights defenders."
"We also support the European Parliament’s resolution."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the people of Cambodia have suffered extensively for many decades from the catastrophic effects of a totalitarian government and high-level official corruption."
"At present, those in the country who have fought endlessly for justice and reform are once again under severe government-led persecution."
"They include the three opposition leaders, Sam Rainsy, Chea Poch and Cheam Channy, whose parliamentary immunity was recently lifted for obvious political reasons and using dubious and groundless proceedings."
"In passing this resolution we, the representatives of the European people, want to convey a strong and clear message to the autocratic rulers in Phnom Penh and to those who support them that the friends of Cambodia will not turn a blind eye to the ongoing attempts to eliminate the democratic opposition in that country."
"They will continue to support wholeheartedly those pluralistic political forces that are fighting for reform, democracy, freedom of expression and social justice."
"The Commission has been following with concern the events relating to the lifting on 3 February of the parliamentary immunity of Mr Sam Rainsy, the leader of the Cambodian opposition Sam Rainsy Party, and two other members of the National Assembly."
"The Commission believes these events could further weaken the opposition and risk jeopardising the continuation of the democratic process in the country."
"Commission representatives in Brussels have also recently met Mr Rainsy, who briefed them on the recent developments."
"The Commission strongly supported the issuing of an EU declaration on the subject and I can inform you that the EU declaration was brought to the personal attention of the Prime Minister by the local representative of the EU presidency."
"The Commission is raising its concern over these issues in its political dialogue with Cambodian authorities, for instance at the EC-Cambodia Joint Committee meeting to be held later this year."
"I can also assure you that, in all its co-operation activities in Cambodia, the Commission attaches the greatest importance to democracy, good governance and respect for human rights."
"I take this opportunity to call upon the political leaders in Cambodia to work constructively together to find an appropriate solution to this problem, so as to enable Cambodia to continue its progress on the road to a fully functioning democracy."
"At the same time, I would like to assure this House that the Commission will continue to follow these events closely, through its delegation in Phnom Penh and with the missions of EU Member States in Cambodia."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place this afternoon following the debates."
"The next item is the debate on the six motions for resolutions on Saudi Arabia(1)."
"Mr President, it is good that we should have today a joint resolution focussing attention on the human rights situation in Saudi Arabia."
"On the Arabian peninsula, just as in certain Swiss cantons, it is women who have fundamental rights denied them."
"It was as recently as the 1970s that Saudi Arabia held its first local elections, in which women were denied the vote – and, as I was able to see for myself when our Gulf States delegation went to the local elections in Riyadh at the beginning of February, they still are."
"What double standards, though, do we find among the Member States’ Heads of State or Government?"
"On the one hand, they do – occasionally and quietly – make critical comments about the human rights situation in Saudi Arabia."
"On the other, business is booming, particularly in armaments."
"Yet again, alas, Germany leads the field in this respect."
"The statements made by the German Federal Chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, on his visit to Saudi Arabia, speak volumes."
"He described Saudi Arabia as a country with enormous potential and vast financial resources."
"It is therefore hardly surprising that his visit saw every kind of arms deal being done – deals that certainly do nothing to make the region more peaceful and will do nothing to improve the human rights situation there."
"I favour a general ban on Member States of the European Union exporting weaponry, not only to China, but also to Saudi Arabia."
"Let us do away with double standards and stop exporting armaments."
"Something else I want to address is the position of workers who are not Saudi nationals."
"People in EU diplomatic circles said that the term ‘slavery’ struck them as a description of the situation of such workers in Saudi Arabia."
"The situation of non-Saudi workers in Saudi Arabia is a fundamental issue, and one that this House really will have to debate."
"Mr President, the first ever nation-wide electoral process in the history of Saudi Arabia is under way, with the local elections in Riyadh completed last month and continuing in the rest of the country until April."
"Riyadh had an 82% turnout of men only, even though the Saudi Arabian electoral law states that citizens are eligible to vote."
"The authorities have declared that women will be entitled to vote in the future."
"I acknowledge that last October they ratified the UN Convention on the Elimination on all Forms of Discrimination against Women."
"Those elections were witnessed by a delegation of the European Parliament and I wish to thank the authorities for the kindness and hospitality extended to all its members."
"I favour a substantial strengthening of EU-Saudi relations and urge the EU institutions to increase our presence in the region."
"I welcome the enactment of new codes of judicial procedure and criminal procedure and the establishment of a standing committee to investigate complaints of torture and a national programme to eliminate poverty."
"I hope these very positive moves will translate into practice on the ground very soon."
"I know that centuries of cultural and religious practice separate the EU and Saudi Arabia."
"However, I must urge the Saudi Arabian authorities to lift the restrictions on women's freedom, including the prohibition to drive, to work, to hold public office – restrictions on their very legal personality."
"While countering terrorism and fundamentalism is essential, we must at the same time safeguard basic human and civil freedoms."
"I would also urge more tolerance in relation to religious freedom."
"I look forward to very fruitful relations continuing between the EU and Saudi Arabia."
"I am particularly concerned here as a woman and a public representative of a small country that up to 30 years ago had prohibitions on women's rights in many areas; women were not even allowed to work once they got married."
"We have come a long way."
"We do not always get it right in our part of the world, but let us look at the women's issue in Saudi Arabia and move ahead on that together."
"Mr President, Commissioner, a country that in the 21st century does not allow women to exercise their voting rights, surely cannot be included on the list of the world's democracies."
"A country that in the 21st century treats women socially and politically the way that Saudi Arabia does, unquestionably cannot be regarded as a civilised nation."
"Such a country should have been subjected to the most fierce international pressure and total isolation until drastic reforms were urgently brought about."
"Yet we Europeans, who pride ourselves on being the guardians of human rights and the defenders of gender equality, do nothing more than pass semi-polite, mildly reprimanding resolutions which we know for sure will have not the slightest impact."
"At the same time, we continue through lucrative trade and defence contracts – some Member States more than others – to fully support the dictatorial regime in power in Saudi Arabia."
"It is shameful."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the visit to Riyadh and Jeddah by the Delegation for relations with the Gulf States was extremely useful, both in terms of increased collaboration between the European Parliament and countries such as Saudi Arabia, which are vital for Middle East stability, and in terms of improved understanding between different cultures and religions."
"We met many representatives of the political and economic world, of the media and of what is termed “civil society”, although that does not currently exist as such in Saudi Arabia, due to the ban on associations and the establishment of political parties."
"We were in the Saudi capital during the week of the first elections, which were only held on a municipal level but which represented a first small step towards the necessary political and social reforms."
"However, the exclusion of women from the vote cast a dark shadow over the credibility of the entire process."
"We reminded all our contacts that it was unacceptable to deny women the right to vote."
"We repeated the same message to the Prince Regent, Abdullah, himself, who appeared to concur but replied that it would take time."
"In the meantime, a few days ago, the statement by the Saudi Foreign Minister was released, announcing that women would take part in the next elections."
"We therefore remain confident that words will be followed up by action."
"Women today represent a vital driving force in the development of the much-hoped-for democratic institutions."
"Many of them are cultured and well-educated and have responsible roles in various sectors of society."
"Persons we met who are active in promoting women’s interests are trying energetically and tenaciously to make women more aware of their rights."
"It is obvious that much still has to be done in terms of respect for the rights of women and for civil and, above all, human rights in general, including those of the numerous foreign workers operating in the country."
"Today, the country is faced with conflicting demands from those seeking greater openness for Saudi society and those who prefer to maintain the ."
"However, the impression is that it will be difficult to turn the clock back."
"Everyone we met emphasised the Saudi commitment to the fight against terrorism and religious fundamentalism, which, as we know, has found a disturbingly fertile breeding-ground in the country."
"We should stress that a constant theme, and one which, I believe, deserves our support, was the request for closer relations between Europe and Saudi Arabia, with the aim of achieving the shared goals of peace, stability, political reform and economic cooperation."
"In particular, we need to give joint support for efforts to eliminate the causes of terrorism and put an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
"Additionally, Saudi Arabia is insistently asking the European institutions to increase their presence in the country and to strengthen economic and commercial ties."
"I believe it is vital to intensify contacts on all fronts, particularly in this sensitive transitional phase."
"One final point to bear in mind is that even the most reformist of the Saudis are asking us in the West not to impose our model of society and democracy and to give them the necessary time to take action, even if this does not always match our expectations."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the municipal elections in Saudi Arabia do indeed represent a significant step forward in terms of the political reforms that country is undertaking; we should acknowledge this just as it is acknowledged in the resolution we are presenting today."
"Nevertheless, the fact that women quite literally suffer segregation and have not been able to vote or stand for office is a blatant anachronism."
"Women suffer incomprehensible and unacceptable restrictions in terms of freedom of movement — they are not even allowed to drive — work opportunities, legal personality and legal representation in judicial processes."
"Furthermore, the precarious conditions suffered by the immigrant population as a whole is to be regretted, and in this case too, women are particularly affected."
"If Saudi Arabia wants to be recognised internationally as a modern state that respects human rights, it must, as a minimum, respect the rights laid down in the Convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women, to which — I would remind you — Saudi Arabia is a contracting party."
"In particular, Article 7 of that Convention states that the contracting parties must take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women in the political and public life of the country, and in particular they must guarantee women’s right to vote in all elections and to be elected, and also to participate in the creation of State policy and its implementation."
"In the recent municipal elections, this article has clearly not been complied with."
"Furthermore, we should remember that, according to Amnesty International, at least 31 people were put to death during 2004."
"We must therefore once again call for the abolition of the death penalty, as the European Union has been doing for a long time."
"It is important to maintain good relations with Saudi Arabia, and this offers an opportunity for both parties to contribute to greater understanding between peoples and cultures."
"Nevertheless, precisely in the interests of these good relations, Saudi Arabia should not be another example of the double standards sometimes shown by the European Union when considering democratisation and respect for human rights in the world."
"The credibility of the European Union is once again at stake."
"– Mr President, it is impossible to avoid feeling a mixture of both encouragement and regret following the first local elections in Saudi Arabia."
"Encouragement, because these elections are a first significant step towards the political democratisation of that country."
"We must give our clear support to this process, because the act of choosing between different voting slips and then placing them in the ballot box constitutes an undoubtedly positive social development for the Saudi people."
"However, not everyone was entitled to make this gesture, which is something I regret profoundly."
"Although this election was based on universal suffrage, women were deprived of this right in Saudi Arabia, just as they are deprived of other rights, such as the right to drive."
"Our Parliament sent a delegation to these elections, and our fellow MEPs on the spot did not fail to point out how surreal this situation appeared to them and emphasised that it cannot last."
"Fortunately, we are not alone because, I am pleased to say, senior Saudi figures have publicly expressed their determination to see this situation change."
"While globalisation can involve threats and risks, it is also a way of obtaining an exceptional degree of openness towards others."
"In the age of the Internet and satellites, no society can remain cut off and unaware of the need to respect the universal dignity of both men and women."
"I hope this message will also be heard in Riyadh."
"Without, naturally, wishing to give lessons in democracy, there is still much that has to be said about the situation in Saudi Arabia in terms of respect for religious freedom or the huge challenges represented by the fight against terrorism in the region."
"However, I would like to end on a positive note: our political dialogue with the Saudi authorities must remain calm and cordial, but it must also be frank."
"Let us have the courage to face up to the real problems and find solutions to them!"
"Mr President, the European Commission thanks Parliament for bringing forward this resolution on Saudi Arabia."
"It is a well-drafted and balanced resolution, which has the merit of pointing out the positive and less positive aspects of the Saudi elections and the on-going reform process."
"The Commission also welcomes the visit to Saudi Arabia by the European Parliament's Delegation for Relations with the Gulf Cooperation Council, and encourages it to pursue its efforts."
"The Commission shares Parliament’s view on the need to promote a substantial strengthening of EU-Saudi relations."
"In June 2004, the European Council adopted an EU Strategic Partnership for the Mediterranean and the Middle East."
"That document reflected EU political will to intensify efforts to resolve conflicts, ease tension, build trust, strengthen governance and improve the lives of the people living on the shores of the Mediterranean and in the Middle East, and not least to address the situation faced by women in some of these countries."
"Our current EU-Gulf Cooperation Council Agreement and our future Free Trade Area Agreement - which will include human rights as an essential element - will remain the framework for our cooperation."
"However, we will be further developing our relations with each Gulf country according to its particular needs, capacities and will to move towards."
"The European Union’s determination to promote both stability and change throughout the region is at the core of this process."
"Indeed, we must pursue stability through change and reform: political and economic reforms are needed for the region’s development and the well-being of its peoples."
"The Commission, as you know, is keen that an initiative for reform should come from within the region itself."
"This requires that the region speak out clearly in favour of political, economic and social reform."
"Whilst reforms cannot be imposed from the outside, they can be encouraged."
"For example, the EU should encourage the Saudi Government to accelerate the pace of reforms that contribute towards women’s empowerment."
"The EU will continue to raise such issues in its official contacts with the Saudis, not least at the next EU-Gulf Cooperation Council ministerial meeting to be held in Bahrain on 5 April."
"In addition, Saudi Arabia has now been included as one of the countries on which the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights can focus."
"That means we will assess initiatives from NGOs willing to support the efforts made in the region."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place next."
"We will now move to the vote."
"Mr President, can I just point out that the versions in some languages do not list the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats as having signed the resolution?"
"That of course we did, and we support it wholeheartedly."
"Yes, it is clearly from six political groups, Mr Posselt, and that includes the PPE-DE Group."
"Mr President, with the agreement of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance I should like to amend the wording of the new paragraph 2a to read: '... calls on the Saudi Arabian Government to lift restrictions on women's free movement (including the to drive) - there is a change of word there -, on employment opportunities, on their legal personality and on their representation in judicial process'."
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"The next item is the debate on the European Council report and the Commission Statement on the meeting of the European Council (Brussels, 22 and 23 March 2005)."
"The President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Juncker, will take the floor first on behalf of the Council."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, in this Chamber on 12 January I presented to you the programme of the Luxembourg Presidency for the next six months."
"Today, as tradition dictates, I shall briefly present to you the results of the recent meeting of the European Council."
"I say briefly because, given the overwhelming attendance in the House today, the debate may not be greatly enriched."
"For this reason I do not seek to stoke the debate but simply to inform you that we agreed on the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact after some bitter debating, after macho and virile exchanges, although the occasional female voice did make itself heard in the midst of the stormy debate."
"The result at which we arrived represents a balanced outcome, because it attaches all due importance to stability and because it does everything possible to ensure that the application of the stability rules will not restrict the growth potential that exists and should exist in Europe."
"To this end, we did not interfere with the underlying principles of the Pact, but we did flesh out the framework, which means that the Stability and Growth Pact will henceforth apply in different ways in each phase of the trade cycle."
"The reform that we finally enacted is the fruit of excellent cooperation, and I must emphasise this here, between the Commission and the Council or, to be more precise, between the College of Commissioners and the Presidency of the Council, between the Commissioner responsible for monetary affairs and the President of the Council of Finance Ministers."
"It gave me real pleasure to be able to work hand in hand with the Commission."
"Everything has been said about the reform of the Pact, and much of what has been said borders on fabrication."
"Those who say that any deficit will be permissible once the Pact has been reformed and those who present the reform measures as a green light for Europe to follow the primrose path leading to mountains of debt are sorely mistaken."
"Neither the basic rules enshrined in the EC Treaty nor those set out in the Pact have been changed."
"The 3% and 60% criteria remain the cornerstones of a system which will continue to be based on clear rules and logical legal provisions."
"I wish to reiterate here that, as soon as we identify a transgression of the 3% barrier, the Commission will compile a report, and the Member State in question will be placed under closer surveillance."
"I want to make it clear that – as has always been the case – a deficit in excess of the reference value, namely 3%, does not automatically trigger infringement proceedings."
"Some people are behaving as if this were an innovation, thereby revealing a lack of familiarity with the terms of the Maastricht Treaty, which introduced this provision back in 1992."
"The powers of the Commission have not been diminished by the reform of the Pact but have actually been strengthened."
"Accordingly, it is no longer a matter of being seriously concerned but rather of being seriously vigilant to ensure that the new rules are applied in a logical manner, and we shall make every effort to demonstrate, in the course of the coming months and in the decisions we shall have to take, that the Pact is far from dead but that it continues to apply and be applied."
"The second item on the European Council agenda in Brussels was the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy."
"You will recall that considerable disquiet was expressed in our debate of 12 January by Members who felt that the Council was unravelling the fundamental balance of the Lisbon Strategy."
"After the Commission had presented its communication of 2 February on the Lisbon Strategy and its communication on the social agenda, the Commission and the Council – again acting together – succeeded in maintaining the basic balance of the Lisbon Strategy."
"We have, of course, realigned the Lisbon Strategy by focusing it more sharply on growth and competitiveness, but this does not mean that we have abandoned its social and environmental dimensions."
"As I did a few months ago, I must again observe that the people of Europe do not always appreciate the importance of the Lisbon Strategy, because we speak of competitiveness, productivity and growth, and these terms and concepts do not stir the emotions."
"What Europeans actually want is to have a job, to be able to start a business and have access to start-up capital, to have open markets for their goods and services and to be able to rely on efficient communication and transport systems."
"They would like to be able to reconcile their working and family lives and to keep pace with new technological developments and the world of the Internet."
"They want access to good education for their children; they want to have at their disposal high-quality public services and all the services of general interest; they want decent pensions, and they want to be able to develop in a healthy environment."
"All of these things are objectives of the Lisbon Strategy. In order to give credence to the idea that governments and the Commission should henceforth be more proactive and consistent in implementing decisions arising from the Lisbon Strategy, we have consolidated the action to be taken into three strands covering ten areas of activity and illustrated by a hundred individual measures."
"Many players are involved in the Lisbon Strategy: the Commission, the European Parliament, the national parliaments, the national governments and the regional and local authorities."
"All of these institutions and authorities must be able to derive more benefit from the Lisbon Strategy."
"I refer especially here to the national governments; since they are accountable to their national parliaments and to European public opinion, it is they that bear the responsibility for maximising the impact of the various components of the Lisbon Strategy."
"Let me say a word or two about the directive that bears the name of a former Commissioner."
"On 12 January, I told you that the Presidency would say yes to the opening of markets in services and no to social dumping and that it would like to see all risk of social dumping eliminated from this draft directive."
"The European Council endorsed this position at its March meeting by asking those involved in the legislative procedure to make the substantive amendments that were needed to ensure that the draft fully meets the requirements of the European social model."
"On this point, as on others, I wish to challenge the perception, and indeed the suspicion fed by ignorance, that the present Commission sees itself as the engine of a neo-liberal Europe."
"This has not been the impression I have taken from discussions with various members of the Commission, particularly on the directive concerning the internal market in services."
"This draft directive is the fruit of the deliberations of the previous Commission."
"The new Commission, together with the other European institutions, will make the amendments required by the European social model."
"It was our ambition, Mr President, to clarify a misunderstanding that has taken root over the past few years, in that we wanted to demonstrate, by doing what we did, that there is a difference between the sustainable-development strategy and the Lisbon Strategy."
"It is wrong to present sustainable development as the third pillar of the Lisbon Strategy, because sustainable development is a cross-cutting strategy that affects all other policies and hence relates to all aspects of the Lisbon Strategy, such as the environment, fisheries, agriculture, public finance and social security."
"Sustainable development, in other words, is what is known in English as an ‘overarching principle’, which has to be applied in the implementation of every policy pursued by the European Union."
"For this reason, the Presidency will take the initiative of having the European Council adopt, at its June summit, a declaration on the guiding principles of sustainable development which is designed to serve as a basis for the renewal of the sustainable development strategy adopted by the European Council in Gothenburg in 2001."
"On the basis of a decision taken by the Environment Ministers, we examined all the policies that have to be borne in mind whenever the subject of climate change is discussed."
"You will have noticed that the European Council welcomed the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol and, more particularly, its ratification by the Russian Federation."
"It is now time to devise a medium- and long-term EU strategy to combat climate change, a strategy that must be compatible with the aim of limiting the increase in the global annual mean surface temperature to a maximum of two degrees above pre-industrial levels."
"In view of the emission reductions that are required on a global scale, efforts made over the coming decades will have to be underpinned by the common consent of all countries."
"The Union estimates that reduction profiles in the order of 15 to 30% in relation to the Kyoto reference values will be required of the developed countries by the year 2020; the long-term aim, according to the conclusions adopted by the Council of Environment Ministers, would be to achieve reductions in the order of 60 to 80% between now and 2050."
"In the course of the European Council meeting in Brussels, we discussed a number of matters in the field of foreign affairs."
"I know you could scarcely contain your delight at what we said about reforming the United Nations."
"We took the occasion of the Council summit to return to the painful subject of Lebanon, a country which goes from one ordeal to another and which deserves the solidarity of Europeans."
"Accordingly, we called on Syria to implement rapidly its pledges to withdraw all its troops and intelligence services from Lebanon."
"Mr President, I should have liked to present a more comprehensive picture, but I shall fill in the gaps at the end of the debate, if there is to be a debate."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, honourable Members, I am delighted to come here today to share with you the Commission’s analysis of the conclusions of the Spring European Council and to explain how the Commission intends to follow up the important decisions taken there."
"I broadly welcome the conclusions of the Spring Council, which were particularly significant, given that this Council was held at such a crucial time and that the EU needed to demonstrate that it is capable of addressing the main social and economic challenges currently facing Europe."
"I believe that we have responded satisfactorily to this challenge and that the Commission has given the necessary impulse and political guidance."
"I must take this opportunity to praise the efforts and skills of President Juncker and, more broadly, of the Luxembourg Presidency, throughout this process."
"At this point, I should like to draw your attention to an idea, with regard to this Council, that I consider essential, both today and for the Union’s future: the idea of convergence between the main institutions."
"Indeed, the first paragraph of the conclusions is clear on the Commission’s strategic objectives for the period 2005-2009, which I myself put forward: ‘The Heads of State or Government took note and welcomed the close agreement between the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission on the Union’s priorities, particularly with regard to legislative activity for the coming years’."
"It is this spirit that will help us overcome the difficulties that the Union expects to face in the future."
"On the practical side, I should like to point out that the decisions taken at the European Council on the Stability and Growth Pact and the relaunched Lisbon Strategy will enable Member States to redouble their efforts to achieve the triptych at the June European Council, and hopefully to conclude the agreement on the Union’s future financial perspectives."
"I would now like to comment in more detail on the three main subjects which, as you know, were discussed at the Spring European Council."
"Firstly, the Stability and Growth Pact."
"As we all know, consensus on the Pact broke down in November 2003."
"A new consensus on a proper fiscal framework has now been reached."
"The Commission made a very important contribution to this end."
"The Commission launched debates in its 2004 public finance report and in September 2004 the Commission adopted a communication on strengthening and clarifying the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Since then, the Commission has actively contributed to the debate on the reform of the Pact and supported the presidency in its efforts to find a consensus, while preserving the essence of our budgetary framework."
"The European Council’s agreement was a very positive outcome, restoring credibility to the Pact and preserving the Commission’s prerogatives."
"Under this agreement the Treaty principles are maintained."
"The budget deficit of Member States cannot exceed 3% of GDP and government debt is still limited to 60%."
"To avoid excessive deficits any overstepping of these limits can only be temporary and only in exceptional circumstances."
"A new feature is that Member States are being asked to exercise more discipline."
"They must step up their efforts to reduce deficits in growth periods, while a degree of flexibility has been introduced for periods of economic difficulty."
"The Commission intends to present its proposals for amending the relevant regulations before the end of this month so that reform can be completed by June."
"It is in everyone’s interest that we make rapid progress on finalising the reform of the Pact in order to offer greater transparency and predictability regarding public finances and budgetary developments."
"This is an ambitious timetable but one that can undoubtedly be achieved with the cooperation of all the players involved: the Member States, the European Parliament, and the European Central Bank."
"I am sure that I can count on your cooperation in attaining these objectives."
"The Commission will do what is necessary to ensure the success of this joint project and is ready to work closely with you to do this, as requested in the joint motion for a resolution."
"In order to be effective, the Pact must count on the broadest political support, which is why wide support within Parliament is of the utmost importance."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thanks to the very active role played by the Presidency, the recent meeting of the European Council has generated the political impetus that was needed to relaunch our pursuit of the Lisbon aims."
"We have put this strategy back on track by giving it clear objectives, namely growth and employment, together with targeted and effective initiatives and simplified instruments while respecting, needless to say, the permanent aims of the Union, particularly sustainable development."
"The Commission is extremely satisfied with this outcome, because its proposals were the starting point for the deliberations and conclusions of the European Council."
"Personally, I am delighted that the Heads of State or Government approved and validated our approach so unanimously."
"This bears eloquent testimony to the role of playmaker that the Commission – supported, of course, by the European Parliament, whose major resolution on the subject deserves mention – can perform in fields which, we must recognise, are largely a matter for national governments."
"The substance of our messages was well received."
"The discussions among the Heads of State or Government showed that the Member States had truly taken our ideas on board."
"In deciding now to relaunch the Lisbon Strategy, the Member States were also responding to the Kok report, which was discussed by the European Council in November."
"Their next task is to designate national coordinators and to prepare, by the end of the year, reform programmes setting out in detail the measures to be taken to boost growth and employment."
"The realignment of the strategy towards growth and employment within a context of sustainable development won broad support."
"All available national and Community resources pertaining to the three strands – economic, social and environmental – must be exploited if these goals are to be achieved."
"The European Council provided the necessary clarification regarding the Lisbon objectives and their relationship with the sustainable development strategy."
"Improved governance, accepted as essential to implementation by the Member States, was also an important aspect, because it really served to test the credibility of the new Lisbon Strategy and to establish whether the Member States were genuinely disposed to accept a stronger system of governance."
"Their response was favourable."
"The main elements of this system will be the integrated guidelines and the national reform programmes to be presented at the end of 2005."
"The task for the Commission now is to continue this work by formalising the follow-up to the conclusions of the European Council."
"I distinguish four key milestones for the coming months."
"The first milestone was the adoption by the Commission yesterday, on 12 April, of the integrated guidelines which were presented to the House this afternoon by Vice-President Verheugen and Commissioners Almunia and Spidla."
"This is an important exercise through which the Commission confirms the sharper focus on growth and employment and provides the Member States with a single coherent framework for the preparation of their respective programmes."
"The European Council will be asked to validate this politically at its June summit."
"Our approach creates added value in three respects."
"Firstly, it serves to enhance the consistency of the actions and reforms to be carried out in the macroeconomic and microeconomic spheres and in the field of employment, shedding necessary light on the process of economic governance and safeguarding the essential balance between the operational strategy and political visibility."
"Secondly, it initiates the preparation of the first element of the new three-year Lisbon cycle."
"Lastly, it provides the political and strategic framework within which the Member States are to construct their national reform programmes."
"The second milestone in this process will be the presentation of a Community Lisbon programme."
"The European Council expressed the wish that the Commission present a Community action programme as a counterpart to the national programmes."
"This document, which is to be prepared for the coming summer, will list the actions that were enumerated in the document accompanying our communication of 2 February on the revision of the Lisbon Strategy."
"The Commission will also implement this Community programme rapidly by presenting the numerous major initiatives which we identified and which were confirmed by the European Council, such as the reform of state aid, the creation of a European Technology Institute and the i2010 initiative."
"The third milestone will be a communication in the form of a methodological guide to national reporting."
"In this way, the Commission will provide initial guidance for the preparation of national reports."
"The fourth and final milestone will be the preparation and analysis of the national programmes, which, we envisage, will take place in the second half of the year."
"We have therefore seen, and we can now confirm, that this was truly more than a mere political declaration, that the European Council really sought to reclaim the Lisbon Strategy and that we are already in the process of putting it into practice."
"On the fringes of the discussion on the Lisbon Strategy, the European Council reaffirmed the importance of an internal market in services as a means of achieving the key aims of growth and employment while emphasising the need to preserve the European social model."
"The European Council asked that every effort be made in the framework of the legislative process relating to the services directive to build a broad consensus behind each of these objectives."
"I must emphasise once again, as I did on 2 February, that the Commission believes it is possible to achieve this consensus."
"In this respect, your Parliament naturally has a crucial role to play."
"The third major issue discussed by the European Council was sustainable development."
"I am gratified that the conclusions of the spring summit served to reaffirm the importance of the sustainable development strategy while making it clear that the Lisbon Strategy contributes to the pursuit of the broader aim of sustainable development."
"In this context, it is also important to note that the European Council acknowledged the immensity of the challenge of climate change, specifying in particular that the global annual increase in surface temperatures must not exceed two degrees Celsius in relation to the pre-industrial era."
"I also note with satisfaction the warm welcome given to the Commission’s communication entitled and the request that the Commission continue its cost-benefit analysis of strategies for the reduction of CO2 emissions."
"This will help the Union to devise a medium- and long-term strategy designed to reduce emissions in industrialised countries by 15 to 30% by the year 2020."
"The Commission intends to continue its activity through the second phase of the European programme on climate change."
"Lastly, I am pleased that the European Council has clearly signalled the will of the Union to reinvigorate the international negotiations by exploring options for a post-2012 arrangement."
"The European Council wishes to see the adoption in June of a declaration on the guiding principles of sustainable development and intends to examine the revision of the sustainable development strategy in the second half of this year."
"In this domain too, the Commission will make appropriate proposals for the achievement of the Council’s aims."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me say in conclusion that the outcome of the spring meeting of the European Council, as you will surely agree, is an excellent platform from which to work towards reflation of the EU economy in the far broader framework of the quest for sustainable development."
"Much work, however, remains to be done before the objectives and decisions adopted by the European Council can be fully achieved and implemented."
"This will require the mobilisation of all interested parties, and I can assure you that the Commission, for its part, is fully mobilised to render its contribution without delay."
"I am counting on your participation and active support."
"I shall finish as I started, by referring to the idea of convergence between the institutions, convergence on medium-term objectives, and I believe that it is this same spirit of convergence – which was also present yesterday, by the way, when I addressed the Temporary Committee on political challenges and budgetary means of the enlarged Union – which must prevail in the period ahead."
"The European Council managed to make significant progress at its spring summit, revising both the Lisbon Strategy and the Stability and Growth Pact."
"The next hurdle we must clear is the Financial Perspective."
"To this end, cooperation between the Commission and Parliament will be essential – as, of course, will be the work we do in close cooperation with the European Council."
". – Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats welcomes the results of the spring Council with respect to the Lisbon Strategy."
"We believe that it has found an appropriate way of expressing its thinking, while the objectives are ambitious, but also realistic."
"Like the Council and the Commission, we are of the opinion that our objective must be to improve the competitiveness of the European Union, that our objective must be to achieve more growth, and that we must also make use along the way of improved competitiveness and stronger growth to create more jobs."
"In doing so, it is the joint task of the Commission, the Council and Parliament to formulate our European legislation such that we do justice to this objective."
"This applies in particular to all the legislation connected with REACH, in other words to legislation on chemicals, where we, the European Parliament and the Council, have a huge legislative task to complete."
"I call on the Commission to also make its own contribution to this."
"Within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy, we give a very explicit welcome to the good cooperation that now prevails, not only between the Commission, the Council and Parliament, but also – and more importantly – with the national parliaments."
"The President of this House suggested the – to my mind – very good initiative, that we here in the European Parliament should consult with our national counterparts on the Lisbon Strategy."
"That is good for the matter in hand, for the Lisbon Strategy, and also for cooperation between the European Parliament and the national parliaments and it should also serve as an example in other political sectors."
"As far as the stability of the European currency is concerned, the great majority of our group would have welcomed our adhering to the rules hitherto."
"We stress very emphatically that confidence in the stability of the European currency is the basis for the confidence of Europeans among themselves and in the process of European unification."
"One must, however, acknowledge – and here I speak in particular to the President-in-Office of the European Council with his experience; I think he was the only person here who was at Maastricht and signed the Treaty – that care was taken to ensure that no cutbacks were made to the 3% and 60% criteria."
"Hence, the interpretation that we could go to 4% or perhaps even more is absolutely incorrect."
"The conclusion expressly states that debt, if above 3%, should be close to 3% and that this is not or an excuse for new, unlimited debt."
"I call on the Commission on behalf of our group to continue to resolutely perform its role as the guardian of law and stability in future."
"As far as the Croatia issue is concerned, although our group does not believe that Croatia is being treated fairly, we do welcome the efforts being made, especially by the President-in-Office of the European Council, to ensure that, ultimately, not only the International Criminal Court in the Hague will decide or hand down a preliminary ruling on whether negotiations should begin, but also that a commission will be set up to examine the situation in Croatia."
"I recommend that we start work quickly, so that negotiations with Croatia can commence."
"I emphatically support what was said on Kyoto."
"We stand alongside all those who are resolutely promoting the reduction of emissions."
"In our joint resolution, Parliament's compromise resolution, we also take a stand under paragraph 35 on the weapons embargo with respect to China."
"Our message to the Heads of State or Government is that this House – and I believe that we are united in this – or at least this Group, would refuse to agree to the lifting of the weapons embargo on human rights and other grounds."
"The top priority over the next few weeks is to adopt the European Constitution."
"We call on everyone involved to make their contribution, so that we achieve a majority in the referendums in France and the Netherlands, so that we also have a good basis for all subsequent referendums, because the Constitution is the top priority and we need the European Constitution for the future of Europe."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, honourable empty Chamber, I have listened to Mr Poettering with excitement."
"We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament were most interested to hear how he is coping now with the fact that a series of Christian Democrat Heads of Government hold a different opinion from the overwhelming majority in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in this House."
"He trotted out relatively elegant turns of phrase in order to conceal this rift in the conservative family of parties between the bloc in the parliamentary group, which itself is very heterogeneous rather than homogenous, and the Heads of Government."
"What are the issues here?"
"Mr Poettering began with Lisbon and emphatically welcomed the Lisbon Strategy."
"On that we are absolutely agreed."
"He was right to say – as were the President of the Commission and the President-in-Office of the Council – that signals were given at this summit about Lisbon and the implementation of the Lisbon objectives."
"That is also what we were hoping for, that is the good news from this summit; it is what gives us heart."
"On that we are absolutely agreed."
"It will only be in the combination of the reform of the Stability Pact – and the need for greater flexibility which this also engenders for the national governments – and the defined objectives of the Lisbon process that the summit and its outcome will be correctly understood, Mr Poettering, because those who want to invest and should invest in the Lisbon objectives must also be in a position to invest in these objectives as states."
"It is in the combination of the instruments needed to bring about greater flexibility now contained in this pact and the objectives of the Lisbon process, as described, that the particular attraction of the outcome of this summit lies."
"That is why we, the PSE Group, can emphatically agree with the results."
"This is also expressed in our resolution today, which we shall adopt with broad support;"
"I assume that the sceptics in the PPE-DE Group will now agree to the wording on the Stability and Growth Pact, which is almost identical to that which we called for before this summit."
"We hope that they will do that, and take especial pleasure in it."
"I listened with equal attention, Mr Poettering, as you spoke in favour – and I understand perfectly well why – of negotiations with Croatia commencing quickly."
"We shall see this afternoon just how much reliance can be placed on the statements by the PPE-DE Group when it comes to drawing conclusions during accession negotiations."
"If, however, those in Croatia putting their hopes in the reliability of your statements are perhaps treated this afternoon in the same way as Bulgaria and Romania, then we should tell them in advance in Zagreb that they should have another word with Mr Poettering."
"The PSE Group emphatically welcomes the fact that the Council conclusions give hope in particular in a further area."
"In recent years, as far as Europe's role in the world is concerned, we have placed our emphasis as social democrats – in our demands – on sustainable development and climate change."
"The resolutions now being adopted – the President of the Commission referred to them once again – point the way."
"We must say to the citizens – I refer to your apt comments with respect to the referendum in France – that no country in this world and no European country, not even a highly industrialised country, will be able to meet the challenges of the 21st century alone."
"For Europe, that means in the Community alone: in the economic, monetary and social community and in the community which Europe can develop as a force, as a community for sustainable development and for reducing environmental dangers."
"These are global challenges and there is no France, Germany, Great Britain, Belgium or Portugal which can face them alone."
"It is the task of Europe as a continent and of the EU as the political form of organisation of that continent to counter these risks."
"That was a message from this spring summit which should not be underestimated."
"The social democrats in this House are also grateful for that and that is why we can agree to our motion for a resolution in the happy expectation of broad support, in good conscience, from the members of both the PPE-DE Group and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe."
"Mr President, it often seems to fall to the smaller Member States to rescue Europe from the problems created by their larger partners."
"Mr Juncker, I fear you find yourself once more the victim of high expectations."
"The European Union is now facing major challenges which will test not only its capacity to provide for the hopes and needs of its citizens, but its very capacity to hold together."
"The challenge which occupied the European Council is that of re-energising our economic growth potential."
"Our economy has stalled since the Lisbon Strategy was launched in 2000; it is almost as if a millennium bug of continental proportions has afflicted our competitiveness and depressed our determination to take tough decisions."
"The summit was billed as a relaunch of the ten-year Lisbon Agenda, yet it left Liberals and Democrats with the impression of Europe’s leaders sleepwalking their way forward."
"The lofty language of the Council conclusions is unsupported by the dignity of disciplined thought."
"The text was high on rhetoric but low on action."
"Calls for undertakings to build new competitive factors, for consumers to benefit from new goods and services and for workers to acquire new skills were combined paradoxically with a demand for the Commission to rewrite a key piece of internal market legislation enabling growth in the services sector."
"The draft services directive can be improved, but it will be done in a serious manner by Parliament and the relevant sectoral council rather than by Heads of State playing to the gallery and pandering to nationalist sentiment."
"The European Council conclusions speak of financial perspectives to provide the Union with adequate funds to carry through its policy commitments, especially the Lisbon priorities, yet Member States still call for a restrictive budget in one breath, while tying up foreign spending for seven years in the next breath."
"Liberals and Democrats in this House do not share Mr Barroso’s satisfaction with the Spring Summit."
"Mr Juncker, we offer your presidency two cheers on ‘mission impossible’: your legendary ability to craft compromise has saved the shreds of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Yet its loose wording and its get-out clauses send shivers down the spines of orthodox economists and Mr Berlusconi’s use of his new-found flexibility to offer tax breaks ahead of a general election shows the contempt with which irresponsible leaders will treat their eurozone partners."
"What has happened to Europe’s leadership?"
"Where is the sense of common purpose?"
"Is it any wonder that French or British citizens show little enthusiasm for a new treaty, when two of our longer serving leaders have abjectly failed to explain and justify the Union to their compatriots?"
"The vacuum in leadership at national and European levels threatens to derail not just the Constitutional Treaty, but the whole project."
"If the Constitution is not ratified the blame will lie fairly and squarely on those leaders who sacrifice longer term European Unity to short-term national popularity."
"President-in-Office, I cannot escape the conclusion that your European People’s Party is failing our Union."
"You have failed to use your majority in the Council to build a coherent economic strategy at home."
"You are unable to marshal your troops here to see through our commitment to Bulgaria and Romania, to say nothing of their attitude towards Croatia that we have just heard."
"We are humiliated abroad when our Union conveniently discards its scruples to secure favoured trading status from totalitarian regimes in Russia or in China; when we turn a blind eye to such suffering in the Sudan; when we are silent in the face of American overreaction, imprisoning our citizens without charge, and denying airspace to our airlines."
"Under these conditions the European Union does a disservice to its citizens."
"Europe needs and deserves better."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for once there is also some good news for the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance in the conclusions of a European Council."
"It does not happen often, and perhaps that is why President Barroso said that the Greens are outside the system or anti-system."
"I do not believe that, and I hope to use the years and months that are left before the end of the parliamentary term to change his mind."
"I also say that because we are not particularly pleased to note that the Commission held back precisely on the four points in this summit that we considered relatively positive, because it had taken a different position."
"The points are these: reform of the Stability Pact; precise target figures for the Kyoto Protocol, which the Commission unfortunately decided not to mention; redressing the balance of the Lisbon Strategy in terms of environmental and social sustainability, albeit still in a vague and imprecise way; and a kind of new-found understanding of reality with regard to the Bolkestein directive – although it is very hard to admit, even here in Parliament, that a directive on services of general interest needs to be drawn up before the Bolkestein directive is approved."
"Even we believe that the reform of the Stability Pact has been a good thing and that it is now much more able to take account of the general economic situation and specific national situations."
"Of course, these positive aspects are strongly counterbalanced by the fact that the rules on the quality of spending are still too vague."
"For instance, choosing to invest up to EUR 700 million a year in building the international experimental thermonuclear reactor when even the most optimistic commentators do not expect that it can be used before 2050 – if ever – means not recognising the urgent need to implement the Kyoto Protocol or the potential of renewable forms of energy, and not investing in the latter sector."
"We see that as a serious mistake."
"In addition, unfortunately, we have to recognise that during the European Council no account whatsoever was taken of the fact that a healthy macroeconomic environment must include taxation reform, so that the tax burden that today falls on employment is shifted onto environmental degradation, helping to make regular employment more attractive."
"That is what Jacques Delors was saying in 1992, and we have not made any progress at all since then."
"President Barroso, Commissioner Verheugen, I think we should really learn something from the sad story of Italy’s economy and its Government, which came to power promising a new economic miracle by cutting taxes and environmental rules, and today the country is bottom of the table for growth and competitiveness in Europe."
"We believe, President Barroso, that the European Union needs to make itself seen and heard, partly to win the Constitution referendum in France and to convince citizens that European added value really exists, so that the Commission’s initiative in the framework of the Lisbon Strategy can result in new legislation."
"We are not happy with the fact that the Commission is content to play a coordinating role."
"We do not think that is enough, because it means that for French voters and others the only message coming out of Europe is that of the Bolkestein directive, the patentability of software and policies in the economic and social fields."
"That is not what we want."
"We believe that we need to move in a different direction and, above all, we call on the Presidency and on President Barroso to take more notice of what we – and also the Commission – have called ‘the ecoefficiency revolution’."
"The ecoefficiency industry and companies of this kind are growing at a rate of 5% a year at the moment, and we believe we should be investing much more in this sector and taking it more seriously."
"Lastly, I agree with everything Mr Watson said, with just one exception: my group and I do not believe that hurrying and pushing and fighting with our backs to the wall for the accession of Bulgaria and Romania will help us to convince the Bulgarians, Romanians or Europeans of the feasibility of the project."
"– Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the recent downgrading of growth estimates announced by the Commission, and the capitulation that that implies in light of already low growth rates in 2004, demonstrates that restrictive budgetary and monetary policy at both European and Member State level has held back internal demand, public investment and economic recovery."
"This has had an adverse impact on unemployment, poverty, social exclusion and the increase in social and territorial inequality, borne out by the 20 million unemployed and the 70 million or so people living below the poverty line, whilst the large corporations in the EU saw their profits rise by 78% in 2004, and profits as a proportion of GDP in the euro zone are currently close to a 25-year high."
"Against this backdrop, how can anyone accept the so-called relaunch of the Lisbon Strategy, when it is based on competitiveness and on creating a workforce that is more attractive to companies, when it places the accent on deepening liberalisation in areas such as services, on increasing the flexibility of the markets, on reducing workers’ rights, on extending the number of sectors paying low salaries, when it seeks to keep proposals for directives on the organisation of working time and on creating an internal market for services?"
"We do not accept it."
"How can anyone accept the fact that the Council’s conclusions make only passing reference to social inclusion and refer only to children suffering from poverty, without putting forward a multifaceted and integrated programme to combat poverty and social exclusion?"
"How can anyone accept that, despite the announced revision of the Stability and Growth Pact, the emphasis continues to be placed on meeting restrictive, albeit somewhat flexible, targets, while prioritising the dismantling of public, universal-access social security, when we know that public investment and maintaining public social security systems are essential factors in combating poverty and social exclusion?"
"Accordingly, we wish to stress the need to remove proposals for directives on working time and on the internal services market and to revoke the Stability and Growth Pact, replacing it with a Growth and Employment Pact. That way, priority can be given to creating 22 million high quality jobs with rights by 2010, to meeting the targets set at the Lisbon European Council and to halving poverty and social exclusion, as adopted in the 2000 Lisbon Strategy."
"We believe that fighting inequality of income, promoting equal rights and opportunities and fostering genuine convergence should be at the top of the EU’s economic and social agenda."
". Mr President, after all that Mr Juncker said a month ago in this House and elsewhere to the effect that the Stability and Growth Pact was dead or at best needed to stagger on as it was, we now hear from the European Council that it lives again."
"Lazarus indeed strikes once more."
"But it is not living, it is fudging."
"In a year’s time this rotten pact will have to be fudged or dumped, as I suggested last time."
"The meeting, however, was remarkable for something which it did not discuss: the UK’s budget rebate."
"Mr Chirac at least commented on it after the meeting, saying to reporters that it could no longer be justified, that it was from the past."
"Mr Barroso echoed those statements."
"Perhaps you would like to justify the fact that the UK would pay into the EU 14 times more than France without the rebate, and, even with it, two-and-a-half times the French contribution."
"Mr Barroso also said that 70% of Commission spending was on agriculture when the rebate was agreed, whereas new proposals would reduce it to one-third."
"In fact, the proposals are that three-quarters of future spending will go to agriculture in poor regions."
"That is where the Commission’s priorities lie."
"That is of no comfort to the UK, rebate or no."
"Our Foreign Secretary said that the Commission’s proposal could mean a 35% hike in the budget, but he said our rebate remains a veto."
"We have an election in the UK on 5 May."
"I would advise you not to try to join the flight from London to Brussels the following day."
"You would be caught up with party officials and government ministers, of whatever colour, as they rush over here to seek a compromise."
"It will be a milestone on the way to Britain’s exit."
"Worse is better because, in monetary terms, the EU will then be 14 times as bad for the UK as for France."
"Heaven knows, even with Mr Chirac’s desperate efforts, current polls show that the EU is becoming less popular in France every day."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it really is a case of saying that the governments have at last understood that the Stability Pact must not act as a brake or even an obstacle to economic growth."
"The results of the Brussels European Council have underlined the need for Europe to add a little flexibility to the rules that are paralysing the economy through too rigid and schematic an interpretation of the Stability Pact, which in the end has checked the development of many Member States."
"With the downturn in the world economy and the new international situation, Europe needed to decide at last to overcome its inability to look to the future with the necessary flexibility."
"It is no longer possible to imagine Europe being competitive on the international stage when its growth rate is only half that of the United States. It is no longer possible to believe that the value of stability, although a good thing in itself, is enough to overcome the inflexibility that has frozen growth for the last decade."
"We are delighted that the European Council has achieved a broad consensus on reform of the Pact, and we highlight the agreement reached on the structural reforms specifying the corrective policy that Member States must adopt to comply with the Pact criteria if their deficit exceeds the limit."
"The pension system, the research and innovation sector, training, and major structural and infrastructure works are investment commitments that are not always compatible in accounting terms with the limits set by the criteria."
"While there is no doubt that the Pact must be applied fairly in the countries that have signed up to it, it is equally true that the economy of the European Union of the 25, which is characterised by considerable heterogeneity and diversity, requires a richer, more structured, common framework that can allow its differences to be better understood, without negating the objectives laid down in the reference criteria."
"I should like to remind Mr Watson, to whom I listened very carefully, that there is no economic strategy because there is no political strategy, and because we are still using the economic and financial rules of the last century to face the new horizons of this century."
"Mr President, other Members have exceeded the time allotted to them more than I have, and so the rules should be enforced either for everybody or for nobody."
"The rules are the same for everybody, Mrs Muscardini."
"Mr President, the European Council is very fond of declaring that the Lisbon Strategy is its main priority, and true to form, it has done so again."
"I am reminded of a saying in the work of Nikolai Gogol, along the lines that ‘the old have not yet died, the young are still unborn, but they all pose a threat to the living’."
"The old strategy is in its death throes, the new one is still in short trousers, but they are both threatening Europeans with bouncing cheques, contradictory priorities and empty words."
"The President of the Council has stated today that Europeans do not take the trouble to read the Strategy, and that they do not like it, but that is not their fault."
"The reaction to many of the Council’s proposals is ‘yes, but…’ and the ‘but’ is only strengthened upon closer reading."
"This is true of the Framework Programme for Research and Development, for example."
"It should open wide the doors for research across the whole of the old and new Union."
"It must not, however, become a back door through which membership contributions of the richest Member States can be renationalised."
"Competitiveness figures prominently in the most recent Council documents."
"It is there on paper, but in practice, in real life, the services directive has been sidelined, when that directive was all about strengthening competitiveness and putting it into practice."
"Does the Council wish to have its cake and eat it?"
"Asia should rejoice as it sees how Europe, its main competitor, is flagging."
"It is obvious what action should be taken, instead of generating fear within the Union."
"Small firms in Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Lithuania should receive the same treatment as firms in the old Union."
"You are all aware that this is not the case, ladies and gentlemen."
"The Council has referred to the reallocation of aid, and I am concerned that in practice this might mean less funding for the new Member States."
"The Council has not allayed these concerns."
"The Council has referred to reforming the system for regional aid."
"I am concerned that, to put it plainly, this might be an excuse to entrench the division of Europe into a poor new Union and an old rich one."
"The latter would be only too happy to forget about the principle of solidarity that is supposed to underpin the European Communities."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, things being as they are, I have only two minutes’ speaking time, and so I shall confine myself to the Stability and Growth Pact and say that the existence of a political agreement within the Council to revamp certain aspects of this Pact is good news."
"The Luxembourg Presidency can pride itself on a success which was by no means straightforward."
"Be that as it may, this reform agreement brings us to a rather paradoxical situation, because, while the new version of the Pact comprises very sound innovations, particularly on the prevention side, it must also be recognised that it meets with only lukewarm approval."
"In order to dispel misgivings, there is a paramount need to tackle the key task of restoring confidence in a pact which has been mismanaged for too long and re-establishing its credibility."
"There are still too many grey areas, which makes it inevitable that interpretation disputes will resurface with renewed vigour, enabling each government to interpret the rules as it sees fit."
"Too many doubts remain about the resolve of the Member States to adhere to a set of principles they have established for themselves."
"It is primarily a matter for the Commission, Mr President, to clarify these principles by incorporating the basic amendments laid down by the Council in its regulations of 1997, which form the framework of the Pact."
"In these circumstances, the work on these proposals assumes particular importance, and greater attention to detail is imperative."
"I shall restrict myself to two examples."
"What specific commitments will arise from the preventive provisions of the Pact, which are to some extent a bargaining chip for the relaxation of rules in other areas?"
"How can the reaffirmed need for simplicity, transparency and fairness in the procedure for dealing with excessive deficits be reconciled in these instruments with the sophistication of the mechanisms that are beginning to emerge?"
"As far as confidence and credibility are concerned, it is up to the Member States, of course, to render accounts and to demand consistency."
"Not even the most benevolent of observers will have failed to notice that the debates on reform of the Pact have mostly been more akin to pleas before an industrial tribunal than to discussions with even a hint of objectivity."
"I have to say that this detestable attitude has had devastating psychological effects, not only inflicting severe damage on the principle of equal treatment for all Member States but also apparently eroding the foundations of a community based on the rule of law."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the spring summit has been a success."
"The Presidency deserves our congratulations for securing a decent compromise on the Stability and Growth Pact and relaunching the Lisbon Strategy."
"Our Union is in a strange situation."
"We are the world’s principal exporter and the main market for the rest of the world."
"Our Union is a haven of peace, an attractive political entity to which more and more countries want to accede."
"At the same time, we are engaging in a sort of self-flagellation, wallowing in the predicted decline of the House of Europe."
"The facts, however, refute this pessimistic view."
"Seen from outside, our Europe is a model of the good life."
"It combines a high standard of living with almost unprecedented social and environmental standards."
"Europe is creating jobs – 6.5 million over the past four years."
"Nevertheless, the unemployment rate remains excessively high in some of our largest countries."
"Yes, our growth is slower than that of China, but an economy that accounts for almost a quarter of global GNP will invariably grow more slowly than a new economy taking off in a country that has experienced a century of stagnation."
"Even with a growth rate of only 2%, the economy of our Union expands every year by the size of the entire Taiwanese economy."
"The prevailing theory is that Europe is being left behind by the United States in terms of competitiveness and productivity."
"On closer examination, it emerges that the American productivity gains are derived chiefly from particular parts of the service sector, such as wholesaling, retailing, real estate and financial intermediation, which are not in any way engaged in direct competition with their European equivalents."
"Conversely, Europe admits to lagging behind – and there is a genuine gap here – in the fields of semiconductors and office machinery."
"Quite surprisingly, our businesses have a productive edge in the fields of communications and computer services."
"Indeed, Europe outperforms America in 37 out of 56 areas of economic activity."
"It is true that Europe is lagging behind in terms of research, and the private sector bears the brunt of the blame: whereas 80% of the 1.2 million researchers in the United States work for the private sector, only 48% of European researchers are employed by private companies."
"The refocused Lisbon Strategy can and must provide responses to all of these problems."
"In order to maximise its success, the European Union needs a favourable macroeconomic framework."
"The reinvigorated Stability and Growth Pact, by allowing public-spending policies to be adjusted in response to cyclical trends and by enhancing the impact of investment, will help to promote growth."
"Stability is unquestionably a public asset."
"The fact is, however, that the Union, and particularly the euro area, has never known such a high degree of stability."
"Inflation is no longer a problem, the currency is strong, and interest rates have reached an all-time low."
"We do need more growth and more domestic demand, particularly in some of our largest countries."
"The fact that Britain, Sweden and Denmark are achieving faster growth than the euro area, even with their higher interest rates, should give the European Central Bank food for thought."
"The Socialists certainly support the President-in-Office of the Council, even though he is an eminent member of the European People’s Party, when he reminds the European Central Bank that, while it bears sole responsibility for monetary policy, the conduct of European economic policy is the task of national governments."
"This is another area where we need to insist on the ‘separation of Church and State’."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate the Luxembourg President-in-Office of the Council on the conclusion of work to reform the Stability and Growth Pact last month."
"In its new form, the pact demonstrates a series of positive aspects."
"The preventive aspect of the pact has been strengthened; the Member States have an incentive to put something away for a rainy day."
"At the same time, greater attention is being paid to the level of debt of the Member States."
"The differing economic situations in the individual Member States have been taken into greater account than in the past."
"In this respect, there is a good chance of working in future on realistic solutions to problems, if deficit and debt criteria are exceeded."
"The reform of the pact should help in reconciling the economic policies of the Member States and, at the same time, highlight the need for a sustainable financial policy."
"I do have my doubts, though, as to whether these positive aspects are sufficient to push the eurozone forward."
"I fear that these reforms will not be able to restore the lost confidence of the citizens."
"The reformed pact has too many weak points, in my opinion."
"In future, the European Central Bank alone will be responsible for ensuring the euro remains stable as, to all intents and purposes, the pact will no longer function as a second stability pillar."
"The increased margin for interpretation and the unspecified special circumstances will tempt many Member States to run up new debts."
"This might soon force the European Central Bank to raise interest rates and jeopardise what is already only weak growth in the eurozone."
"The Commission has emerged from the reform process weakened rather than strengthened, in my opinion."
"It seems questionable to me whether it will be able to effectively play its part as guardian of the pact."
"Consistent application of the sanction mechanism provided for in the pact in the event of infringement of the pact appears to be less probable today than ever before."
"I hope that it manages, despite these misgivings, to avert possible damage to the eurozone."
"Revision of Regulations Nos 1466 and 1467 must include the clarification of unclear wording."
"The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe expects the European Parliament to be actively involved in the process of editing these regulations and supervising compliance with the pact."
"Mr President, yesterday an opinion poll was published in Scotland that included a question about the draft EU Constitution."
"Scots in favour of signing up to the Constitution: 35%; those against signing up to the EU Constitution: 49%."
"Five years ago, a much more positive response would have been delivered from Scotland."
"Indeed, historically, Scotland has been much more positive about engagement with our European partners than certain other parts of the UK."
"But, in spite of all the talk since the fall of the Santer Commission about reconnecting with citizens, many of our policies and directives are still seen as insensitive and inappropriate to real life in our communities, not least in Scotland with the disastrous failure of the common fisheries policy."
"But I think the services directive has the potential to further undermine public confidence and I do not think it has been sensitively handled so far by the Council or the Commission."
"It is widely seen as a further attack on essential public services."
"Much has been said about the potential effects of the country of origin principle, but, if we are to be sensitive to the reality, there is much more to it than that."
"For example, in the UK, Scotland’s legal and regulatory system is entirely separate from that of England and Wales, and so on. I would like to see more recognition than we have to date not only of sensitivities at Member State level, but of differences within Member States as well."
"– Mr President, despite the fact that the President-in-Office of the Council has left and the President of the Commission is engaged in conversation, I shall say what I have to say."
"Unfortunately, Lisbon puts social policy in second place."
"With the changes proposed to the Stability Pact and to the Lisbon Strategy itself, the Lisbon Strategy cannot be made into a pro-grass roots strategy."
"It is a paradox and it is absurd for us to talk about creating the most productive economy on the planet and, on the other hand, to want to cut budgets, in other words to have less cohesion."
"Only with a series of radical measures, which also include other levels, could Lisbon become a pro-grass roots strategy."
"The Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left disagrees in its entirety."
"We are calling for a real social state to be introduced in Europe with the objective of full employment."
"For a strategy to be introduced with the objective of a high standard of living, without being sacrificed in the face of the need to increase competitiveness."
"For so-called flexible working times, which rot the social fabric, to be abolished."
"For a proper 35-hour week to be introduced without any reduction in wages, which would mean recruiting more people."
"We are against a strategy of unilateral growth for the benefit of big business and the private sector."
"We shall continue in our efforts to get those in charge at the European Commission and in the Council to take a stand at long last which will do away with the accountant's approach in favour of an approach which puts people first."
"This can only be achieved through radical changes to the Stability Pact and to the Lisbon Strategy."
"Mr President, the European Council has declared that the services directive should be given a more social dimension."
"After all, it cannot be the intention to take advantage of workers from Member States where working conditions are less strict, or to compete unfairly with service providers in Member States where strict working conditions apply."
"Failure to comply with current labour law will lead to unwanted situations and this concern has caused anxiety among the public."
"The directive allows for the fact that, in accordance with European rules, service providers are bound by the labour law that is applicable locally."
"That does, however, presuppose that this labour law is enforced effectively; if it is not, people will definitely be taken advantage of and competition will be unfair."
"To date, the guarantees of enforcement provided by the proposed directive have been inadequate."
"In the proposal, the task of enforcement was assigned to the country of origin rather than to the country of destination, which leads to an unworkable situation."
"Indeed, one cannot expect Polish authorities, for example, to check whether Polish workers in the Netherlands do their jobs in accordance with Dutch working conditions."
"We need a different approach to establish a workable system for enforcing working conditions in all Member States."
"The country of origin will at least need to declare that its citizen will become active in the country of destination."
"It follows that the exchange of information is the first step in making the enforcement of labour law possible."
"I assume that the Commission will include this duty to report in the directive."
"Eight environmental organisations drew attention to this directive’s implications for nature, the environment and health, and they were right to do so."
"It seems as if the integration concept in the EU Treaty, with sustainable development as its ultimate goal, has been temporarily overlooked."
"All in all, the Council has not made it clear what direction it wants to take and how the directive can be afforded a more social and more environmental dimension, which was, after all, the object of the Lisbon process."
"The fact is that it was up to Parliament, rather than the Council, to make the next move in the legislative process."
"Despite this, the Council put the services directive on the agenda to accommodate specific interests of individual Member States, which has knocked the institutional framework off balance."
"It appears that at the moment, the Council sets great store by giving this social dimension greater prominence, given the debate surrounding the European Constitution in France, even though there are more appropriate arguments that could be used against this Constitution."
"Mr President, when we assess the results of the European Council we are forced, unfortunately, to conclude that discussion of the Services Directive occupied centre stage there."
"The result of debate on the Services Directive, which the Commission in its former composition has bequeathed as its legacy, is noticeably diminishing enthusiasm for the attainability of the Lisbon Strategy goals as rewritten by the current Commission."
"The directive was intended to increase competition in sectors which are open to competition, in order to gain consumers, and provides support to small and medium-sized enterprises for whom cross-border operations are at the moment impossible."
"In its proposed wording, the directive was rejected as a threat to Europe’s social model."
"To a surprising degree, most of the criticism was directed towards the application of the country of origin principle to the provision of services."
"This is the guiding principle in all internal market legislation and the European Court of Justice has consistently upheld it in its decisions."
"The Commission is losing one of the few existing instruments at its disposal and what is currently one of the most important cornerstones of the reinvigorated Lisbon Strategy."
"Reform of the Stability and Growth Pact from an economic viewpoint is understandable, but would be fully justifiable only if the European Union were a unified state."
"As they say, it is difficult for the hungry man to understand a man who has eaten well."
"Thus, the Stability and Growth Pact, which was adopted in good times, is inconvenient in difficult times."
"In the good times the policy designers lacked the will to save up for a rainy day, and in the bad times the wish to carry out structural reforms is lacking, so no alternative remains but to change the terms of the pact."
"Reforming the pact reduces Member States’ fiscal discipline and does not encourage them to improve it in good times."
"The difficulties created by a weaker common currency and higher lending rates will, however, be shared by all the Member States, including those which behaved well during both the good and the bad times."
"The decisions of the European Council will have a knock-on effect in every respect."
"I would like to hope that the attitude towards the Lisbon Strategy will differ from the Council’s reception of the Services Directive, that the positive aspects included within the Lisbon Strategy will provide the hoped-for impetus, and that a lack of fiscal discipline and of structural reforms will not endanger the European social model."
"Mr President, it cannot be denied that the past European Council was actually dominated by an external factor, that being the referendums on the European Constitution that are due to be held in various European countries."
"It is in the context of those referendums that we should see the decision to review the services directive."
"It is, in fact, very much open to question whether this Bolkestein directive will actually be re-examined or amended once the referendums are over."
"It is, after all, a fact that European decisions are taken over the heads of the public almost as a matter of routine, and that there was, in the past, more than one occasion when such old-fashioned concepts as truth and democracy were not taken entirely seriously."
"As far as the Bolkestein directive is concerned, we have to say that it has ambiguity written all over it."
"Even European law specialists hold fundamentally different views about how this matter can, or will, actually be fleshed out in reality."
"It is a fact that the very broad definition of the concept ‘service’, coupled with the country of origin principle, will lead to drastic changes to states’ – and in some cases federal states’ – powers and responsibilities."
"Moreover, the proposal undeniably impacts on states’ powers and responsibilities in terms of social security, health care and education – all areas to which, in my modest opinion, the principle of subsidiarity should strictly apply."
"According to Mr Bolkestein, only the rules of the country of origin apply to the service providers."
"It is a complete mystery to me how it is possible to avoid distortion of competition or even social dumping with those rules, and I also wonder whether this is of real benefit to the European consumer."
"Allow me also to be particularly sceptical about the hundreds of thousands of new jobs that this directive is supposed to create in Europe."
"Along with everyone else, I am still waiting for the millions of jobs that those self-same economists promised us would be created when the euro was introduced."
"I would reiterate that I have no faith whatsoever in the Council’s promise to make subtle changes to the Bolkestein directive."
"I have no faith in the sudden conversion to the ‘own people first’ principle of so many Left-wing politicians who are anxious about the outcome of the referendums on the European Constitution."
"As in the case with Turkey, EU policy is often a string of deceit and shameless lies, and I fear that, with the Bolkestein directive, we are getting more of the same today."
"Mr President, let me begin by addressing my congratulations to the President-in-Office of the Council for the role he played at the spring summit in achieving the necessary consensus among all the Member States at an extremely delicate period in the history of Europe."
"As far as the Stability and Growth Pact is concerned, I believe it is important, because it guarantees the stability required by the single currency."
"What Europe needs, however, is criteria rather than dogma, and numerous voices in this Chamber had been calling for more flexibility."
"What we really need is economic governance."
"This pact is also a growth pact, so why should some countries be penalised if they invest more in research, defence and infrastructure than other countries?"
"This is nonsense and is in glaring contradiction to the Lisbon Strategy."
"On the other hand, uncontrolled and unwarranted increases in deficits and indebtedness must be severely penalised, and the national parliaments must immerse themselves fully in their role as scrutineers of their governments’ budgetary activity."
"These are the same governments with which we must deliberate on the advent of a generation of senior citizens very advanced in years."
"We shall have more and more centenarians."
"We can only welcome such a development, but it does imply a transformation of both our social and our economic systems."
"Mr President-in-Office, Mr Barroso, we shall listen carefully to the proposals you make at the Council summit in June on the sustainable development strategy in conjunction with the economic and social reinvigoration demanded by the Lisbon process."
"Climate change presents Europe with another challenge."
"Lastly, let me say that I welcome the commitment to start work on the construction of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) in Cadarache before the end of 2005."
"We must regain the trust of the European people, who are anxious that we should avoid any social and fiscal dumping."
"This is what we shall be trying to do here in Parliament in connection with the services directive, and I was astonished to hear the previous speaker expressing doubts about the role that Parliament can play in this respect."
"Let me remind you, ladies and gentlemen, that legislative power is shared between the European Parliament and the Council."
"What is actually lacking in this Europe of ours are enthusiasm and self-confidence."
"It is up to all of us to reassure and convince people, and that is what will enable our fellow citizens to embrace the Constitution which is indispensable to a Union of twenty-five Member States."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, seldom has a Council document – even in this House – been so well received, and this is also reflected in our resolution."
"In fact, I see a certain convergence between the Council conclusions, the Commission's conclusions and the views of the majority in this House."
"The issue here is a social Europe in global competition."
"This needs to be highlighted, because many members of the public have gained the impression over recent years that it was indeed all about competition, but not about a social Europe, or that social Europe was getting lost on the way."
"One speaker today voiced the opinion that the political leadership in many countries was to blame for the Constitution being seen in such a negative or critical light."
"I do feel, though, that this was perhaps because many people could not identify with this Europe, because they felt that the social aspect was being neglected or left out."
"What this Council has achieved with the reform of the Stability Pact – and on this I should like to give the Luxembourg Presidency our warmest congratulations – is not opening the door to more debt; it is taking account of the individual situations of certain countries and it is greater flexibility."
"What was said about the market in services – admittedly on a global scale – concerns the opening of a common market, not social dumping, as Mr Juncker mentioned last time."
"That is also our line."
"I am delighted – including about what Mrs Grossetête said, and I hope that goes beyond the date of the referendum in France – that we are finding a common line here, in order to achieve an opening for Europe which takes account of the social model."
"Too little perhaps was said about the Youth Pact."
"It is very important that we send our young people the signal that their Europe should be a Europe of employment and a social Europe."
"Taking account of social questions does not exclude the fact that we need to move forward on several reforms."
"One point which I should still like to mention in conclusion is research and development."
"We have a new proposal for a research and development programme."
"I hope, Mr President-in-Office, that you and, more importantly, your successors will manage to invest enough money, initiatives and energy in this research programme because, if we want to keep up with the competition, we must promote research and development."
"Mr President, we are very worried about the current growth rate of the European economy, the high unemployment rates and all the social and environmental problems we have to deal with. Therefore I am glad that a couple of weeks ago Parliament adopted a resolution on the Lisbon process and that a lot of its suggestions were taken into account at the spring summit."
"However, I am still very worried."
"I shall give some examples on law-making and on policies."
"Firstly, with regard to the Reach Programme, it is very important that we come to a decision."
"That is what Parliament declared unanimously a couple of weeks ago."
"Uncertainty is very expensive."
"Secondly, with regard to the social services directive, Parliament is much more agreed on the necessity of that directive than the Council."
