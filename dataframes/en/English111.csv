"On reading its content, we could question why this majority in Parliament has not also proposed making the future agreement dependent on a clause ensuring respect for democracy and human rights on the part of the EU."
"How useful and educational it would be for the EP, for example, to 'ask' the Member States and the EU to refrain from collaborating with and/or whitewashing the criminal CIA flights, to respect the human rights of immigrants, flagrantly violated in the 'return directive', to respect the democratically and sovereignly expressed will of the French, Dutch and Irish people who rejected the proposed 'Constitutional'/'Lisbon' Treaty, to respect international law, particularly with regard to Kosovo, and to stop pretending that they can give lessons to the world ..."
"What would happen if Vietnam were doing all this?"
"Would the EP agree to negotiate under those conditions?"
"Would it agree to reciprocally apply this clause?"
"Obviously not, because 'dialogue' and the 'clause' are only for others ..."
"in writing. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on democracy, human rights and the new EU-Vietnam Partnership Agreement."
"Dialogue between the European Union and Vietnam needs, in fact, to translate into concrete improvements in human rights, which are too often brutally violated."
"I firmly support this motion, as Vietnam must put an end to censorship of the media and repeal legal provisions restricting freedom of worship and political and religious freedom if it wants to take an active part in the international community."
"Furthermore, Vietnam must cooperate with the United Nations on the subject of these rights and freedoms."
"I therefore back this motion and echo the call on the Commission to establish clear benchmarks for the evaluation of the current development projects in Vietnam in order to ensure their compliance with the human rights and democracy clause."

"Draft general budget 2009 (Section III) - Draft general budget 2009 (Sections I, II, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII and IX) (debate)"
"rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the preparations for the first reading of the European budget for 2009 are pretty much complete."
"I would therefore like to start today's debate by thanking the members of the Committee on Budgets, and all the members of the specialised committees who have worked so closely with me, most sincerely for their cooperation and for all the time they have devoted to this."
"As I said right at the start of the 2009 budget procedure, and I am happy to say again, a budget rapporteur is only as good as the sum of the members working with her, so I am very grateful to you."
"I also need to thank the team in the secretariat of the Committee on Budgets: without the consistently excellent work of the secretariat staff, we Members would, with the best will in the world, be nothing, so thank you!"
"Yes, I agree, a round of applause would be quite appropriate."
"(Applause)"
"My thanks also go to my personal assistant and to the staff of the groups: it takes many heads and many hands to do a good job."
"The preparations for the first reading of our budget, during which we had to read, understand and evaluate 1 400 amendments, were greatly affected by the financial crisis."
"Although our budget of around EUR 130 billion looks ridiculously small set against the hundreds upon hundreds of billions that the Member States, acting both jointly and separately, have spread out as a safety net under both the banks and the real economy, our meetings to prepare for the first reading were nevertheless much shaped by contributions on precisely this subject from all the groups involved."
"In so doing, we were basically already anticipating the Council's reaction to our budgetary requests."
"What, then, are our requests?"
"First of all, there are the payments."
"We pointed out back in July that we could not approve a 15% gap between commitment appropriations and payment appropriations, which the Commission proposed in the draft budget and the Council increased still further."
"In our opinion, that does not fit in with the principle of budgetary accuracy and clarity."
"Moreover, when we compare this gap in the third year of the current Financial Perspective with the gap in the third year of the previous Financial Perspective, which was only 3%, we simply do not see how such an enormous gap can be justified."
"We have therefore increased payments: we could not close the gap completely, but we have halved it, to leave a gaping hole of 8%."
"We did not increase payments by acclamation or at random, but in those budget lines that help to fund Parliament's priorities: action to combat climate change, the social dimension in terms of growth for jobs, shaping globalisation and support for small and medium-sized enterprises, and also certain lines that improve the safety of citizens."
"In total, we have increased payments from 0.89% of gross national income - which was the level proposed by the Council - to 0.96%, rounded, of gross national income."
"Secondly, we decided to make full use of the options afforded us by the Financial Perspective."
"Under subheadings 1a and 3b, we want to distribute all the money to the budget lines that are important to us, and not leave any margin."
"We want the title of subheading 1a, 'competitiveness for growth and employment', not just to be purely rhetorical, but also to include specific measures."
"We do not want the title of subheading 3b, 'citizenship', to be an empty phrase - we want to bring it to life, as, after all, this subheading brings together policies that directly affect citizens at local level, and that the European Union is particularly good at making visible."
"Thirdly, we have given the package of pilot projects and preparatory measures, which was agreed between all the groups and has already been evaluated by the Commission, a range of impulses for new policy elements, new Community actions and possibly new legislation."
"Fourthly, we have followed our political judgment."
"Nobody can expect good administrative work, be it from the Commission or from decentralised agencies, if they do not provide a large enough budget for staff, and we therefore cannot accept the Council's cutbacks."
"We have restored the approach taken in the preliminary draft budget, and in return the Commission could not only thank us, but also be on our side in disputes with the Council."
"Fifthly, I would like to turn to the biggest problem, namely Heading 4, grandly entitled 'EU as a global partner'."
"When this heading was established back during the negotiations on the Financial Perspective, it was already hopelessly underfunded."
"That is why, in each year's budget debates, we have stressed the same thing: how are we going to fund everything that is looking for funding and, at the same time, leave ourselves enough breathing room to be able to react to unforeseen events during the financial year?"
"I can say right here and now that there has been, and still is, no satisfactory solution."
"For our assistance in Kosovo, Afghanistan, Palestine and now Georgia, what we really needed was long-term programmes, not this continual hand-to-mouth existence."
"This is nothing new, but this year the Commission gave us a new challenge: in view of the enormous global increases in food prices, in July it proposed what it called a food aid facility for the less developed countries, with a budget of EUR 1 billion for 2008 and 2009."
"If the Commission had been diligent, it should immediately have suggested transferring the necessary resources from Heading 2 to Heading 4."
"It did not do so, though, because not only is it not diligent, it is afraid."
"It was afraid of not getting approval from the Council, and now we are saddled with the problem. We need to convince the Council not just to sermonise about the need to help the poorest of the poor, but to work with us to find the resources - yes, and where from? - so that we can provide direct food aid and buy seed and fertiliser."
"It was quite clear to the Committee on Budgets that we would not be able to find the necessary money in the budget lines under Heading 4, and so we created what is known as an 'asterisk amendment', containing EUR 250 million for food aid, 40 million for Kosovo, 80 million for Palestine and 20 million for Afghanistan."
"This asterisk amendment, which makes it quite clear that we want to spend more than the money available according to the Financial Perspective, should be seen as an invitation to the Council."
"Let us hope that the Council will actually see our note as an invitation or demand, and enter into negotiations with us without delay."
"We have no time to lose - we should not leave everything to the last minute."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is over to you."
"(Applause)"
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I am very happy to see how quickly and efficiently Parliament has finalised its first reading and that it is ready to vote tomorrow."
"This huge job was done by the Committee on Budgets, by their leaders and coordinators and, of course, by the political groups."
"This largest portion of the job to be done forms the basis for our future negotiations."
"We will be starting serious engagement between the two arms of the Budgetary Authority and the Commission in the next two months."
"The Commission in general very much appreciates and shares the political priorities for which the European Parliament proposes budget reinforcement and restorations."
"Regarding payments, the European Parliament intends to approve the level of appropriations up to the ceiling."
"However, this is not convincing enough for us, because we think that the preliminary draft budget corresponds better to the actual absorption capacity, notably in Member States."
"I will this week send out the information on the execution of the budget, and you will see that our calculations are based on very serious grounds."
"The Commission is largely in agreement with the new process on the pilot projects and preparatory actions proposed by Parliament."
"On this occasion I would like to stress my appreciation for the excellent collaboration between our institutions, which is thanks to a new and successful approach promoted by the general rapporteur, Mrs Haug."
"This is the first time in our history of negotiations that we have already been able, before the summer, to receive and agree on the broad scope of these pilot projects."
"I would also like to draw attention to a number of issues which still, at first reading, give rise to serious concerns for the Commission."
"The first and most important concerns Heading 5."
"We appreciate that Parliament has restored the amounts requested by the Commission for staff salaries."
"However, at the same time, EUR 37 million have been put in the reserve, subject to certain conditions for its release."
"On top of that, an additional reserve of some EUR 16 million for two specific policy areas, namely transport and environment, has also been reserved."
"It will, of course, be very difficult for the Commission to respond to this, especially the last one, because there is only one employer in the Commission - namely the Commission - and it is not possible, for example, to stop payments for one or two DGs and continue to pay the others."
"These reserves - in total about EUR 50 million - would stop the recruitment of 250 posts received for enlargement and prevent the replacement of retiring staff as from next January."
"But of course we understand that our negotiating and explanatory skills will come into play with your people as soon as possible after the first reading."
"We will try to give all the necessary explanations and to fulfil all the conditions set on these reserves."
"Regarding the administrative support for operational programmes, this year Parliament has followed the Council and confirmed the cuts."
"I understand that additional technical explanations will be needed, and we will try to solve this via negotiations about these lines in general."
"Another problem we see is that Parliament has not restored the appropriations requested for publication of procurement notices."
"This, we think, undermines the Commission's ability to meet its obligations stemming from the public procurement directives, especially in the current environment."
"We are solving and trying to solve state aid and other problems in Member States in this fluctuating economic situation, and this can place the Commission at risk of legal challenge in the courts."
"To sum up, the Commission will analyse in detail each amendment adopted by Parliament and will give its reactions in early November through the 'letter on executability' - as it does every year - explaining all the necessary details."
"Before the conciliation in November, and before the second reading, we will try to solve as far as possible anything that we still consider to be a problem in the first reading."
"As usual, the Commission will try to be the honest broker between the two budgetary authorities, especially in negotiating the problems which arise in Heading 4, in Heading 5 and in the total ceilings of payment appropriations in the budget."
"We will try to be helpful by seeking favourable conditions and a good budget for the whole of Europe, especially in these difficult times that we are facing together."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. - Madam President, it is an endless political bone of contention that Heading 4 is chronically underfinanced."
"It prevents us from fulfilling our external commitments in crisis areas: in Kosovo, Palestine, Afghanistan and Georgia."
"We are completely unable to build up a solid common foreign and security policy on a long-term basis as long as the Commission and the Council keep on adopting this budgetary strategy of under-financing external relations and just giving ad hoc responses to the latest crisis, which attracts all resources and attention, such as Georgia today."
"The latest priority overshadows the previous one."
"For the EU to become a global player, more money is needed in Heading 4."
"With the current financial envelope, it is impossible to satisfy the needs of the different budgetary lines."
"This is the reason why the Committee on Foreign Affairs strongly supports the strategy of the Committee on Budgetary Control seeking to restore the PDB on all budget lines and thus increase the budgetary lines for Kosovo by EUR 40 million and Palestine by EUR 139 million."
"We also support the asterisk amendment."
"In other words, the Council and Parliament must allow utilisation of the flexibility instrument, and of all other available instruments provided for in the Interinstitutional Agreement, to allocate EUR 250 million on the food facility instrument, EUR 40 million on Kosovo, EUR 80 million for Palestine and EUR 20 million for Afghanistan."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development. - (NL) I am speaking as a member of the Committee on Development, and would, on behalf of my committee, like to make three comments, firstly, about the food crisis, secondly, about the system for assessing development policy and thirdly, about the lack of resources under Heading 4 - foreign expenditure that has been discussed before."
"I should like to start with the food crisis, which is, of course, a huge problem, as millions of people are in danger of losing their lives, and a joint European approach is desperately needed."
"We do, however, need an approach other than the one which the Commission suggested in the first instance. The budgetary agreements will need to be respected, while the powers of the Council and the European Parliament may not be overlooked."
"I am therefore pleased that the Commission is willing to review the first proposal - to use unused agricultural funds for this."
"We need to achieve food security for the countries involved."
"Needless to say, food aid is needed for people who are in immediate peril of death, but ultimately, it is about the long term, which is why food production should return to the EU's development agenda as an area of attention that should be given priority."
"We will, in this context, also need to talk about a re-evaluation of the thematic programme on food security, and we will need to look at how we can grant small farmers better access to crucial production factors."
"This is why we are glad that the proposal has met with approval for a trial project for micro-credit, because this will probably make it easier for small farmers to fund food production."
"Secondly, the system for assessing development policy needs to be improved."
"The assessment is focusing too much on where the money is going and too little on results."
"If we wish the public to continue to support development cooperation, we will need to gain more insight into the results of our work."
"Thirdly, the lack of resources for foreign expenditure, Heading 4, has been discussed previously."
"This concerns not only resources for development cooperation, but also for Kosovo, the Middle East, and so on."
"We have great ambitions."
"Rightly so."
"This is why this item deserves a structural increase"
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to raise two points regarding Mrs Haug's report."
"The first is that, at Parliament's initiative, a separate budget line has been included under the heading 'trade policy for trade-related aid' - in other words 'aid for trade' - amounting to EUR 1 billion per year."
"Unfortunately, the Commission has not yet been able to provide us with any detailed information on how these aid commitments will be implemented and whether they are operational."
"It is heartening that the Committee on Budgets has incorporated an amendment proposed by the Committee on International Trade, withdrawing the Council's proposed 50% reduction in the figure for aid for trade."
"My second point relates to the support for developing countries in pharmaceuticals-related technology transfer and capacity-building."
"Over the last year, Parliament has taken specific steps to help the poorest countries with the supply of pharmaceuticals, and corresponding financial aid is clearly a part of that."
"Unfortunately, it is clear that neither the Commission nor the Council shares this view, and, if I understand it correctly, the Committee on Budgets has, regrettably, also not included an amendment in that connection."
"On Mr Lewandowski's report, my committee has raised an important aspect of the EP's work in the field of international trade relations: its involvement in the Inter-Parliamentary Union in the World Trade Organisation in Geneva."
"As our Parliament is one of the organisers of its annual meetings, and given that important ministerial conferences will undoubtedly be on the agenda in the coming year in connection with the Doha round, it would be worth boosting funding for this in order to ensure that we have appropriate infrastructure options for participation."
"In addition, we are particularly keen to assist representatives of the ACP countries to pay their travel and subsistence expenses in connection with the Parliamentary Conference."
"Both of these elements can, and should, help to increase transparency and strengthen dialogue between parliaments, governments and the general public, and ultimately lead to greater fairness and legitimacy in the negotiations and decisions as part of the discussions within the WTO."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - (FR) Madam President, Mrs Grybauskaitė, Mr Jouyet, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I would like to express satisfaction, regret and hope."
"My satisfaction stems from the fact that the Committee on Budgets agreed to take up our proposal, namely that supervisors, whether for banking, insurance or securities, need greater funding in order to work together better."
"This goes without saying, and even those who are not members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs will agree that it is vital."
"My regret is that in the current crisis, the euro is our cornerstone, our very foundation, yet the Commission has drastically cut the resources for communication activities relating to our wonderful currency."
"My hope is that tomorrow, the plenary will realise that the resources of the Eurogroup, regardless of the level it meets at from now on, should be increased."
"It must not be a lightweight structure, without substance."
"It has become a reality."
"This is why I hope that tomorrow, Parliament will agree to vote in favour of the principle of increased resources for the Eurogroup."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. - (DE) Madam President, I would like to start by thanking the members of the Committee on Budgets for the fact that they broadly share the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs' approach to the budget."
"Nevertheless, I would like, once again, to make the case for increasing funding for social dialogue appropriately, as we proposed."
"We cannot keep talking about how social dialogue is a pillar of our European social model, and then on the other hand reduce funding in exactly this area."
"At this point, I would also call on the Council to work with us to find a solution for the problem of the degressivity clause."
"It has a particularly dramatic effect on the work of the trade union institutes, and, over the long term, continual funding cuts are simply no longer sustainable."
"With regard the Committee's two pilot projects, allow me to say one thing: there was a broad consensus in favour of a pilot project relating to posted workers, and I am sure that the results of this project will bring us important insights for our future political decisions on the Posting of Workers Directive."
"We will therefore certainly pay close attention to ensure that the Commission, in turn, turns its attention to those aspects that are important to us in this project, to prevent wage dumping and social dumping."
"The second project relates to violence against the elderly."
"This project confronts a taboo subject, and this is particularly important."
"Thank you very much, Madam President, as the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety regarding the EU budget for 2009, I wish to express my satisfaction with the material before us."
"One of the most important changes is that next year, there will be 10% more resources available for environmental purposes than in 2008."
"Thus, we will be able to allocate EUR 14 billion to environmental uses."
"I welcome in particular the fact that one of next year's priorities is climate change."
"Europe must retain its leading role in the international struggle against climate change, as President Sarkozy also emphasised yesterday."
"I would like to emphasise as well that the budget for LIFE+ will also be increased by 9%."
"I also welcome as outstanding opportunities the launch of so-called preparatory, or pilot projects, for which three of our proposals this year on environmental and public health topics are to receive support from the European Commission to the tune of EUR 7.5 million. Never have so many projects devoted to climate change or its effects been launched in the course of a single year."
"From the perspective of the agencies, I consider the figures recommended by the Commission fundamentally acceptable, and I am pleased that the extent of support to both human resources and tools has increased; nevertheless, I would recommend adjustments on two points."
"The first has to do with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, for which we would advise freeing up the 10% in reserve, since only then will that agency be able to fulfil its mandate."
"The second case is that of the European Food Safety Agency, where our initiative is the exact opposite, that is, we recommend putting 10% in reserve until the agency can demonstrate that it is operating appropriately."
"My suggestions in this regard have also received the support of Parliament's Committee on the Environment and the Committee on Budgets."
"I call on my fellow Members to likewise lend their support with their votes at the plenary sitting."
"Finally, I wish to thank Jutta Haug, the rapporteur, and László Surján, the shadow rapporteur for the European People's Party, for their valuable assistance in my work. Thank you very much."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. - (RO) The budget is not a policy issue; it is not a technical problem, but an extremely profound political problem."
"Through the budget, we establish what resources are required to meet the objectives."
"We also give a measure of sincerity to the commitments we are undertaking."
"The provisions relating to the internal market seem to be adequate."
"We would like to thank Mrs Haug for her enormous efforts in coordinating the extremely diverse requests submitted with more general political objectives."
"Problems persist, however, in spite of these efforts."
"The financial market is showing its limits."
"We can see the shortcomings that are hidden behind rules which ordinary citizens find difficult to understand."
"They are still showing a certain fragility."
"The proposed amendment, which is calling for resources to be allocated to educate consumers on financial matters, has been rejected by a majority in the Budget Committee."
"The reason for this is not to make savings."
"A larger sum than was requested has been approved for an unspecified purpose linked to consumer protection."
"We would like to ask the committee to consider the use of the sums approved for the relevant chapter on financial education programmes."
"The lack of information affecting some people provides a condition for promoting speculation on the market and for making others rich."
"However, this is not the time to be removing protection."
"It is preferable for well-informed citizens to defend themselves on their own."
"I would first like to thank both the rapporteur, Mrs Jutte Haug, and the coordinator for a highly sensitive approach to the needs of EU citizens and also for accepting the recommendations of the Regional Development Committee, of which I am a member."
"The policy of cohesion must continue to be a medium-term budgetary policy of the EU."
"When I, as rapporteur for the Regional Development Committee, drafted its opinion on the EP report into the aforementioned budget, I also wanted to contribute towards solving a problem which the Member States were trying to solve through their development programmes in the absence of a consolidated European approach in this area."
"It concerns the problem of integrating the Roma communities within the European Union."
"In proposing a pilot project which might assist in solving this problem at a European level, my aim is to encourage European awareness of the possibility of addressing the problem from a regional development perspective."
"This matter is particularly apparent in the new Member States, where small enclaves of Roma communities constitute a serious developmental and social problem."
"The project should also cover the development of adequate resources at European institutions, without which the problem will continue to be left to the Member States, leading to a situation where millions of European citizens of Roma nationality may become victims of patchy economic and social development and very poor integration."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. - (FI) Madam President, Heading 2 in the Commission's Preliminary Draft Budget, which the Council cut again, did not reflect Parliament's priorities."
"In it, direct agricultural subsidies and marketing costs were overly conservatively estimated at EUR 2 027 million below the ceiling for the multiannual financial perspective."
"The Committee on Agriculture proposed that the Committee on Budgets revise the estimated expenditure, which it did."
"New features of the budget are the distribution of fruit and vegetables to school children and the Structural Change Fund for the dairy industry."
"For the former, the Committee set aside EUR 181 million, with EUR 600 million being set aside for the latter."
"As there is a huge reserve of outstanding commitments, or RALs, in the rural development programmes, EUR 9 billion in total, and because the Commission's proposals showed a 30% discrepancy between commitments and payments, the Committee increased payments by EUR 898 million."
"The Committee recommends providing some prompt food aid and for it to be financed under Heading 4, depending on its nature. This means there will have to be interinstitutional talks."
"I want to start by congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs Haug, on her efforts in preparing Parliament's position."
"The overall appropriations allocated to fisheries over the years must be considered a negative development given that previous budgets already represented the minimum necessary to implement a common fisheries policy and a maritime policy with the requisite resources."
"For the fishing industry, the increased external economic pressure of fuel price increases and the stagnation and reduction in fishery product prices are resulting in substantial losses for the sector and critical social problems for fishermen in general."
"Although the Commission proposes restructuring the fisheries sector in line with the current macroeconomic situation, concrete measures are needed to help ensure the survival of the sector."
"The draft budget and Parliament's current position make provision for major cuts, particularly in the areas of fish stock monitoring, international cooperation, fisheries research staff and data gathering."
"On the other hand, I welcome the fact that Parliament's current position includes the pilot project that I presented for a fisheries market price observatory and continues to support the European maritime policy and all related projects by increasing the appropriations for research."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, back in 2004, at a major cultural conference in Berlin, President Barroso stated that European cultural policy was all about a soul for Europe."
"However, the culture budget shows us that these great challenges have met with little success."
"It is true that we have now managed to launch a pilot project to provide more money to promote artist mobility, and we also want to increase spending on lifelong learning and youth exchanges, but seen against the fact that we need to inspire European citizens to get to know Europe, we spend far too little in this area."
"As Mr Barroso has already stated, the people of Europe are not exactly thrilled with the single market, but they do want to learn more about Europe's cultural treasures."
"We have just awarded Parliament's prize for European cinema."
"We also need to spend more on European film production, because we need to give our citizens a better understanding of the European narrative and European visions of Europe's history and future."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, justice that is slow, scarcely accessible and unclear is hopeless."
"We believe that the staff of the Commission, of the European Parliament and of the Court of Justice should be increased and reinforced in the areas of legal management, monitoring of the application of Community law and in better regulation in general, precisely because the current procedures are too lengthy and too opaque."
"We feel that the Commission does not yet have a clear enough understanding of the need to invest in adequate staff in these sectors and it seems entirely inappropriate that the Commission continues to leave us completely in the dark over the number of people working specifically on infringement procedures and continues to claim that everything is going swimmingly."
"As regards the European Parliament, I would like to point out the problem posed by the legislative quality of our texts and the need for more and better investment in the work of lawyer-linguists."
"The same applies to the whole issue of internal reorganisation with regard to monitoring the application of European law."
"Finally, we call on the Commission to report to us and to quantify, including from an economic point of view, the measures taken to make our institutions more green and sustainable."
"Madam President, I firstly want to thank the Committee on Budgets for having supported our amendments."
"Due to time constraints, I will just briefly mention two points."
"The first concerns the traditional amendment of the Frontex budget."
"As you all know, due to the Commission's lack of initiative, and particularly due to the Council's inconsistency, Parliament has had to define Frontex's scope of action through the budgetary procedure."
"This year, we have agreed to increase its budget by EUR 10 million and to try and ensure that its missions remain permanent."
"To this end, not only are budget appropriations needed, but also, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the Member States must fulfil their duties in this regard."
"My second point concerns the approval of a pilot appropriation for the integration of the Roma."
"The European conference organised this month by the Commission cannot mark the end, but rather the beginning, of a coherent policy on the integration of the Roma into our European society."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. - (FR) Madam President, I shall speak in my capacity as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs but also as a socialist member of the Committee on Budgets."
"It is for this reason, moreover, that I have two minutes instead of one."
"(EL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as far as the Committee on Constitutional Affairs is concerned, what we have unfortunately observed is that, in a year in which we had the referendum in Ireland on the Constitutional Treaty, which demonstrated - apart from its result - the need for politicians to communicate with the citizens of the European Union, the Irish tell us that the main reason for the 'no' vote was precisely a lack of communication."
"Obviously, therefore, we need more communication in the run-up to the forthcoming elections."
"Most of our proposals were accepted."
"However, the fact that the proposals to strengthen two basic new political institutions, namely the European political parties and the European political institutions, were not accepted is unsatisfactory."
"Next time perhaps."
"I have a few political comments to make on the actual budget which we are voting on this year and I say political, because the political role of the budget should ultimately be to allow us, through the budget, to play our part as the European Union."
"As Commissioner Almunia said yesterday, and I quote him in French because he spoke in French, 'Il faut commencer à imaginer le budget de l'Europe'."
"We have barely started to imagine the budget and we need to do so."
"So what do we see this year?"
"We see a budget of low payments, with a huge gap between commitments and payments and with an unsatisfactory answer to the actual political priorities of the European Union."
"Yes, there are problems and yes, as Minister Jouyet said, we must leave a margin so that we can respond to the crisis."
"However, the actual political choices of the European Union are important."
"For example, I do not believe that, in an election year, so little money should be earmarked for communication and that, in a year of geopolitical crisis, so little money should be earmarked for foreign policy."
"In view of the ambitious aims the European Union has set itself, the further reduction in the already low budget for 2009 by the Council is surprising."
"These cuts will lead to a greater imbalance between the level of undertakings and paying for them, which is contrary to the principle of a balanced budget."
"The amount approved by the Council - a mere 0.89% of GDP - for appropriations for payments, does not tally with the many political priorities and commitments of the European Union."
"The result will be that only some of the important pilot projects which will benefit citizens will be implemented in practice."
"As draftsman of the opinion on the 2009 budget for the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, I am concerned by the unsatisfactory use of the budget for the needs of existing programmes such as the Progress or Daphne programmes."
"The European Commission should also make considerable steps towards implementing the principles of equality in planning its budget, while the Member States must effectively promote these when using structural funds and the European Social Fund."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Petitions. - Madam President, I would also like to thank the rapporteurs for their diligent and very efficient work in what is a difficult task, and speak specifically on the issue of the Ombudsman's Office, where there will be an increase of almost 6% in the budget."
"This, we believe, is appropriate, recognising that half of this may not be required if there is no actual change in the Office after the elections in 2009."
"I think we should also recognise that there has been some work within the Office of the Ombudsman to reorganise staff and resources in a more efficient way."
"While I am on my feet, as a member of the Committee on Agriculture I should just like to say that the issue of food aid - and I say this also to the public who are gathered here - is something which touches people really deeply."
"I think that the public would like us to help in a generous way with food aid."
"I can understand that there are budgetary concerns, rightly so, about the rules."
"Perhaps this says something about the work we do in the background, before we pronounce, so that we do this in a good way and send out the proper message to the public that we are supporting the developing world and the hungry and the needy."
"But it is also worth pointing out that our development aid in the past did focus on agriculture and food production, as other speakers have mentioned, and, tragically, in latter years we have drawn away from looking at the importance of production agriculture in the developing world."
"Perhaps we are missing that point here too in the European Union."
"If this food crisis has done one thing, it has alerted us to the fragility of food production and the need to nurture it within the developing world."
"Finally, on this particular point, a colleague of mine, Esther De Lange, and I are supporting a pilot project to link up young farmers in Europe and the developing world."
"I think out of this we might see some good results because they need help and we need to understand their plight."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, on behalf of my group, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work and his cooperation."
"The budget is a joint task, and the result meets with the demands of several political groups."
"The message of the People's Party is as follows: let the lives of EU citizens be more secure."
"Security means many things, not only the protection of the borders of the Schengen zone, the prevention of illegal immigration, the struggle against terrorism, but, in particular, the preservation of jobs by means of increased support to small and medium-sized enterprises along with research and development, as well as food safety and food security."
"In the interests of security, we need several mutually independent sources of energy."
"All this requires more money than has provisionally been set aside by the Council."
"In order to secure banking operations, a few days was enough to come up with EUR 2 000 billion."
"Fine."
"However, we should realise that it takes the EU 20 years to spend that sum of money."
"Parliament is planning on less than EUR 10 billion additional funds for next year's programmes, all of which serve the real economy, and that is still 1.5 billion below the amount we provided for in the seven year framework budget."
"It is not inappropriate therefore if, in the current situation, instead of budgetary restraint, we spend 10 billion more on growth, job creation and the safety of our citizens."
"The crisis is not only a financial, but also an economic issue."
"The Council should be our partner in more vigorous economic development."
"Members States, for their part, should abolish those obstacles - such as excessive demands for their own share - with which they artificially render more difficult the use of support for European development."
"The EU must help our citizens who are in trouble as a result of the worldwide crisis."
"Let us demonstrate that the European Union can not only prevent wars from breaking out in Europe, but can also overcome the financial and economic crisis affecting Europe. Thank you for your respectful attention."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I should like to begin by thanking all of the rapporteurs, and especially Mrs Haug and Mr Lewandowski, as well as the entire budget team, elected representatives and administrators alike, for this traditional financial exercise for the year 2009."
"This is the third financial perspective, and it demonstrates just how much the annual budget procedure has become an unnatural and somewhat surreal exercise faced with the situation in Europe."
"It is an exercise in juggling the accounts, making it impossible to provide a genuine Community-wide solution to the problems of our society."
"After the Commission's very modest draft, the Council did what it invariably does and sent us a limited proposal that does not enable any of the promises it made during the year to be fulfilled."
"You are right, Mr Jouyet, the European budget has been under-utilised since 1988."
"As in sport, regular training leads to better performances, and, as an athlete, the EU budget, by becoming smaller, becomes more inefficient and more under-used."
"This is the vicious circle that leads to political disasters."
"Admittedly, we cannot spend without calculating such expenditure, but, in view of these continued promises, it is commitment appropriations, not payment appropriations, that are being recorded."
"This is the beginning of budget fraud!"
"We ought therefore to know whether the European Union wants to achieve its objectives and whether the Member States are willing or not to contribute to common policies."
"Faced with this impossible task, Parliament, through the work of our rapporteur, is assuming its authority."
"The budgetary framework is very tight, and the Commission's lack of initiative has led the European Parliament to create new PPs and APs that will underpin future innovations."
"However, it is vital that, at a time when Europe is deciding to inject EUR 1 700 billion to help the euro zone's banking sector, we manage to find EUR 250 million for the food facility for 2009."
"Parliament is very attached to this food aid fund."
"Thus, on 21 November, the ball will be in the Council's court."
"Parliament has respected the authorised procedures in all their forms: respect for the Financial Perspective, the call for flexibility under the EUR 530 million ceiling and the call for an emergency aid reserve that features in the financial perspective."
"We are acting within the scope of our prerogatives and we therefore expect the Council to adopt a responsible political attitude that is similar to our own."
"This is crucial when it comes to ensuring the credibility of Europe's work in the eyes of each and every citizen."
"Mr Jouyet, I appeal to you: politics is about anticipating;"
"Prove that you are equal to your commitments!"
"Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Haug for her sterling efforts in keeping all the different aspects of this budget procedure together."
"The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe support the result of the vote in the Committee on Budgets."
"For the ALDE Group, energy and climate policy, as well as research and innovation, were important priorities for the 2009 budget."
"We share Mrs Haug's view that climate and energy policy are not adequately reflected in the budget, and we look forward to the Commission coming up with a clear proposal in the spring as to how this area can be given budgetary support at EU level."
"In view of Russia's invasion of Georgia, it was important to the ALDE Group both to secure reconstruction aid for Georgia and to support the development of the Nabucco gas pipeline, which is intended to ensure a supply of gas to Europe outside Russian control."
"We are pleased that a majority has supported these priorities."
"The present draft budget eliminates a number of the Council's savings and gives a more realistic assessment of the needs for payment over the coming years."
"We will hit the ceiling in the multi-annual agreement for the budget in three headings, namely 1a for research, education and transport and Heading 3b for legal policy, and we will go beyond the ceiling in Heading 4, foreign policy."
"The budgetary ceilings for foreign policy go on being too restrictive, and every year we have to fight to fund new priorities."
"It is strange to see heads of state writing out bills for the EU budget that their own finance ministers will not honour."
"The Commission has proposed funding the food facility for developing countries using the money saved from the EU's export refunds."
"The money has, of course, been saved as a result of the high food prices which, in turn, create problems of starvation in poor countries."
"The idea is right, but in terms of the budget we must do things differently so that we comply with the agreements entered into between the institutions."
"Therefore, we are now proposing that the food facility and extra appropriations to Palestine, Kosovo and Afghanistan be found by using reserves, for example, the flexibility reserve."
"It is not fair to obtain this money by cutting down on important programmes for poor countries."
"The ALDE Group has tabled a proposal to place 12% of the funds from the Structural Funds programmes in reserve."
"The background to this proposal was that we wanted to pressure the Commission into doing more to avoid the errors in the region of 12% that emerged during the debate for the discharge of the 2006 budget."
"It was our intention for this reserve to be used as an instrument to follow up on the 2006 discharge, but we could not get sufficient support to take this path, and so we will have to take note of this, but I hope the Commission will take action."
"Mr Lewandowski had an interesting task in preparing Parliament's and the other institutions' budget."
"I think he has managed to obtain a good compromise in which Parliament's budget stays below 20% of the administrative expenditure."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union's budget for 2009 can only yield minor successes, because we are working within the straitjacket of the Financial Perspective."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance made it quite clear, when we voted on it, that the Financial Perspective bore no relation to the new challenges and tasks with which we were faced."
"We have just from heard from all the speakers that the European budget for foreign policy is underfunded."
"However, with regard to the challenges of global climate change as well, our European budget does not even begin to allow us to respond appropriately."
"I would like to remind you all of President Sarkozy's great speech yesterday, in which he pointed out how much needed to change in the European Union in view of the economic crisis and the climate change disaster."
"The 2009 budget reflects all of this to only a very limited extent, and that is our shared problem: our European budget is simply not up to the challenges of the present time."
"In agricultural policy, too, it is high time for energy generation to be linked to environmental targets, and we must also - as Mr Barroso said yesterday - do more for research and development and, above all, in educational policy."
"After all, those are Europe's assets."
"We need to get away from a reactive budget, towards a proactive budget and a new political concept."
"Finally, we need to do more to combat hunger: in Africa, in the sub-Saharan region, famine is once again on the rise, and that is unacceptable."
"We also need to do more to promote fair trade, so that the developing and emerging countries finally get a fair chance."
"I now come to the political result."
"As Mr Sarkozy said yesterday, we need to relaunch capitalism in green form; we need a Green Deal."
"Only then will we also be able to relaunch the European budget."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the draft budget for 2009, like previous draft budgets, not only fails to meet our expectations, but more importantly, does not meet the expectations of our electorates."
"Its main failing is too few appropriations for payments."
"If we want to meet all expectations, it should be at least twice as much."
"The Council of Europe has limited funding and made it necessary to reduce a number of items - these cuts affect Section III in particular, which includes agriculture and rural development - but also affects the European agencies and the remaining sections."
"It is unlikely that there is any committee or political group in the European Parliament which will be satisfied by this budget."
"Although the political priorities for 2009 have been set, it has not been possible to keep any of the priorities at such a level as to make it clear that they have been favoured financially."
"Officially the budget retains all the indicators set out in the multi-annual financial framework, but we all expected it to be higher."
"That is why the draft budget proposes returning to the original draft, and removing the reductions made by the European Council."
"In voting for the proposed draft, we are counting on pushing through an increase in the reduced budgetary expenditure."
"We may succeed."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it can be rightly said that next year's budget shows budgetary discipline."
"The low national income it proposes will bring law and order to the EU."
"The expenditure under external actions in Heading 4 is inadequate by any budgeting criterion."
"We all know that this is not enough money for everything the Council considers important, as Parliament has its own legitimate preferences for the use of these funds."
"We in our group are not very anxious to support the growth in external expenditure in itself."
"We are not in favour of Georgia's rearmament after its attack on the civilians of South Ossetia and Russian peacekeepers, and its pitiful defeat later."
"We do not support the Council's priorities for a Common Foreign and Security Policy. We do not agree that a Common Foreign and Security Policy should be developed in the direction of a European Security and Defence Policy, as if the Treaty of Lisbon had not been rejected."
"Let the Member States be satisfied with the Athena Financing Mechanism for that."
"We do not support the assistance of Iraq, Afghanistan and Georgia, via international organisations, without the possibility of monitoring the use of the Union's money."
"Obviously, we are in favour of aid for oppressed nations, such as the Palestinians, but at the same time we say that the Council's priority areas are eating into the reserves for the targets of financing that Parliament deems important."
"All those who were involved in drafting the budget know that the ceiling for external actions will not hold up but collapse during the budgetary procedure, the way the ceiling in this House did last August."
"Let us be able to stay under the ceiling."
"If that is done by cooking the books, that goes against good budgetary practice and is a culture of governance that is not transparent for EU citizens, the people who have to foot the entire bill."
"Although our group believes that there is no great sense of confidence among us in the Union's external actions, we want the facts to be recognised."
"That is now a job for the Council."
"Mr President, this is, in a certain sense, a well worked-out draft budget."
"The skilled and thoughtful rapporteurs deserve all credit for their work within the current framework."
"All this is nonetheless completely wrong, however - for what should the EU in actual fact do?"
"In this context, at least two thirds of the money goes on agriculture and on structural funds, including waste and corruption."
"What the EU should invest money in, for example, large-scale research such as the fusion project in Barcelona, or common infrastructure such as Galileo, or the separation and storage of carbon dioxide etc., are small fry in this budget."
"What we find here is a Globalisation Fund that now gives EUR 2.4 million to Portugal and EUR 10 million to Spain."
"In both cases, we are concerned with fractions of a per mille of these countries' gross national products."
"There is no reason why they should receive money from other countries in this connection."
"We have a Solidarity Fund from which EUR 13 million is going to France following the havoc wrought by Hurricane Dean in Martinique and Guadeloupe."
"Again, this is a fraction of a per mille of France's Gross National Product."
"The whole thing makes no sense."
"We are talking about rich countries that would have no difficulty dealing with these matters, without receiving scraps from other Member States."
"Why is this being done?"
"I would maintain that it is because it is PR money designed to be used as advertising for the EU."
"There is no other obvious reason for it."
"Next time, funds will no doubt go on snow clearance."
"I repeat: we are on completely the wrong track."
"We are debating a budget that is technically well designed, but politically idiotic."
"(SK) Last year, we were similarly appalled at the low levels of expenditure in the EU budget for 2008."
"As a fraction of Gross Domestic Product, it amounted to 0.95%."
"At the time, I compared the curved line of the year-on-year decline to a falling leaf."
"We thought it could not get any lower. We were wrong."
"Expenditure for 2009 represents 0.89% of GDP."
"This is no longer a curved line: it is free fall."
"Who cares that the level of expenditure is far out of line with the political priorities and obligations of the European Union?"
"Who cares that there is a growing gap between levels of obligations and payments?"
"The total volume of unpaid obligations today represents EUR 139 billion, which is more than the annual budget of the Union."
"The internal discord in the policy of the European Council has been revealed for all to see."
"The governments of most Member States will not manage to secure a full drawdown of EU funds in the current year."
"The aforementioned gap has translated into a reduction in expenditure in the budget for next year."
"The gap is widening between the financial framework for the years 2007-2013 and the actual budgets, to the detriment of citizens and the regions, which are not receiving the necessary resources, especially from the structural and cohesion funds."
"This is also a matter of the weakness of the European Parliament."
"We will not find in our own countries an effective way to put pressure on governments, ministries and other bodies within the public administration to direct appropriate levels of funding into these areas."
"I support an increase in expenditure from the EU budget, as is proposed in the excellent report of Jutta Haug."
"At the same time, however, I wonder whether we are just tilting at windmills."
"(ES) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, rapporteurs, ladies and gentlemen, what is the ultimate goal, the raison d'être, of an EU budget in a year of real and total financial crisis?"
"The first goal is to ensure that this budget does not simply represent an added burden on national purses."
"In other words, it must not be a superfluous expense, but must go only where the Member States cannot or must not go."
"The second goal is to ensure that it is a budget which provides added value."
"The programmes for which financing is approved must be adequately supported by the political authority - the Council and Parliament - and technically supported by the executive authority, which is the Commission."
"The Commission's role has never been more important than in this year of deep crisis."
"Its responsibility is greater than ever, because we must squeeze every possible drop of return from every euro invested by European taxpayers."
"Thirdly, at a time when liberal is becoming social democrat and social democrat is tending to become liberal, the EU budget must be effective and even contracyclical."
"A study headed by the Spanish economist, Rafael Flores, has proven that the public expenditure with the greatest impact on public investment and employment is expenditure on transport infrastructures and communications."
"What is good for my country should also be good for the whole of Europe."
"The EU Structural and Cohesion Funds are the key Community component for reinvigorating European infrastructures and, consequently, employment."
"For that reason, my Group supports, among other aspects, more funding for the trans-European networks irresponsibly forgotten by the Council, in particular, more funding for the energy networks, and also more funding for payment appropriations under the convergence heading."
"(NL) Mr President, the budgets of the other institutions boast a reasonable balance between the ever huge demand, an almost chronic demand, for more staff and the need to restrict expenditure."
"The European Parliament, being the cautious budgetary authority that it is, remains within the agreed boundaries (one fifth of the budget of the institutions), but invests in knowledge nevertheless, by increasing staffing levels within the groups and by increasing capacity in the library."
"This is necessary, because the questions we are faced with are invariably complex and related to globalisation and worldwide issues."
"The foundations are being laid for the introduction of the Members' and Assistants' Statutes, and this is a question of social justice that has been a long time coming."
"There will be more staff to liaise between the European Parliament and national parliaments, which is essential, even though the numbers involved are small."
"It is about exchange with national parliaments, which needs to improve."
"In our capital cities, there is often a huge lack of knowledge about Brussels' agendas and about issues of subsidiarity, while the European citizens, more so than before, are asking critical questions about what should be regulated at national level, and what at European level."
"As for the other institutions, allow me just to say this: access for citizens should be paramount."
"This is why it is important to increase the staff of the Ombudsman, just to mention one aspect."
"The European Union must be open to every citizen, not least, and particularly, for citizens who have complaints."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, many thanks to our two fellow Members from the Committee on Budgets - Mr Lewandowski and, of course, Mrs Haug - who have overseen our work passionately and effectively."
"Firstly, I should like, very briefly, in the time I have available to me, to say to you that I am delighted overall with a number of guidelines that have been preserved within the framework of a budget that is very constrained, even tight, as some of our fellow Members have said."
"Fundamental guidelines relating to growth, employment and climate change have been preserved, and we even have an increase in the total level of payments on these priorities, at any rate."
"Moving on, secondly, I am delighted with regard to a more specific point: the fact that we have managed, through the Committee on Budget's proposal, to make lines concerning research and innovation and all that which concerns the Structural Funds more understandable, thereby providing our fellow citizens with practical answers."
"In this time of crisis, the scale and effects of which are stressful and will unfortunately be long-lasting, I should like to highlight the importance of Europe's coordinated response."
"The latter is not only more obvious now than it has ever been before, but it is also crucial when it comes to providing support for investment in major infrastructure projects, in order to stimulate our European economy."
"(FR) Mr President, it is clear that we will unfortunately not have the Treaty of Lisbon in force next year, but, for all that, we will nevertheless require regulation."
"There may be no new treaty but there are new needs, all the same."
"There are tasks that do not follow the institutional tempo. We need only look at the news, with the financial crisis and the environmental crisis."
"We will need resources in our flow chart."
"The year 2009 is also a little bit special since we have an appointment with a very sensitive animal known as the European citizen, namely the electorate."
"Thus, we should not skimp on resources for communication and cooperation."
"On this subject, too, let us find the proper resources for our Web television, the electoral campaign, the visitors' centre, the citizens' forums, and so on."
"In terms of buildings, we now own nearly all our buildings."
"I am referring here to our three main work sites."
"Regarding the one that we do not yet own, the Luxembourg site, we are going to start work there in the next few weeks."
"This is a large, very ambitious construction site where we are going to build one of the largest buildings in the world, with a fully autonomous energy supply."
"We can be proud of this, we can be proud of our property, but, as this room can testify, property requires upkeep!"
"Thus, as owners, we are now going to have to find the resources to have high quality property."
"With regard to environmental policy, in 2008, we were one of the first institutions to receive EMAS certification - we can be very proud of that."
"We have had the result of our study on our carbon footprint for two days now."
"This House consumes 200 000 tonnes of CO2 each year."
"If we want to meet and achieve the objective of less than 30% in 12 years, we will need some resources."
"I shall conclude simply by commending the quality of the work done by our friend, Mr Lewandowski, because, in the new conciliation method we have put in place, we have been very, very lucky to have him as a leader."
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, in this debate there are four matters to which I would like to draw your attention."
"Firstly, even though the expenditure in the budget of EUR 124 billion for appropriations is the highest in the history of the European Union, it is the lowest in terms of the Gross National Product of the 27 Member States."
"This, incidentally, is the level proposed by the European Parliament's Committee on Budgets, as the European Commission proposed even lower allocations, and the Council made even more cuts to this modest budget."
"In the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013 the ceiling for appropriations for payments was 0.97% of Gross National Product, in other words, we are dealing with a significant discrepancy between what we intended to fund three years back, and what the Union wants to fund now."
"Fourthly, we can have neither a larger Europe, nor deeper integration, for so little money, nor can the European Union be a reliable global partner, as it is threatened by the failure to meet its own commitments in this area."
"(PT) This debate on the Community budget for 2009 should be marked by the decisions not taken by the European Council this month."
"What absolutely should have been discussed was the urgent budgetary measures needed to effectively support small-scale and family-based agriculture, fisheries, the textile and clothing industry, the shipbuilding industry, and micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises."
"In addition, other measures are urgently needed to defend the productive sectors of each Member State, particularly the cohesion countries, employment with rights and decent wages for workers."
"What absolutely should have been discussed was the necessary break with the Community budget policy."
"This policy underpins an economic policy that is one of the causes of the structural crisis which has been dragging on for so long in the European Union and which lies at the root of the downgrading of the productive sector, unemployment, precarious work, increasing social inequalities and deep differences between the Member States."
"Mr President, I see that millions of euros of public money are still being allocated to social engineering and to buy popular support for the EU itself in candidate countries, Member States and elsewhere."
"We still have roads and bridges that lead nowhere, we are replacing the pavements in Karínia outside the Turkish casinos no less, and EUR 400 million provide electricity in Kosovo, where the subsequent receipts simply disappear."
"These are highly questionable political uses of public money."
"No wonder the taxpayers in net-contributor countries like mine are increasingly objecting to EU funds being given to countries whose tax burden is lower - sometimes much lower - and which effectively replace the lack of local tax revenues."
"Given the nature of these irregularities, I wrote to the Court of Auditors recently to clarify the legality of payments from public funds which are being qualified under international financial accounting standards."
"(NL) Mr President, one of the main advantages of speaking late is that you can leave out a considerable number of things that have been said before."
"This is why I shall immediately cut to two points that are particularly close to my heart."
"Firstly, now that there are an increasing number of obese children in Europe, we as a society will need to invest more in teaching healthy eating habits."
"The increase in the budget for school milk, as proposed by us, fits in perfectly with this ambition."
"With the additional EUR 13 million we should like to set aside, we should like to increase the number of schools and also extend the range with a number of healthy products."
"What is unfortunate is that the Commission's response to initiatives such as the school fruit programme is, in my view, too slow."
"The European Parliament would have liked to have had money in the kitty for this programme in 2008."
"It will now be 2009 before fruit will be provided in schools free of charge, and a mere EUR 1.3 million has been earmarked for networking and the provision of information."
"This is regrettable to my mind."
"School fruit will not simply rain down on schools after the summer break."
"A great deal of groundwork will need to be done for this programme, and money will be needed for this next year as well."
"A little more dynamism would certainly not go amiss therefore."
"Secondly, I should like to draw your attention to a proposed investigation into returns in the food production chain."
"For example, were you aware, Commissioner, that the economic return on this apple is 22% in your supermarket, and 23% in the distribution trade, while the primary producer of this apple, the farmer, without whose efforts this apple would not have been here, has, over the last few years, suffered a negative return of -4%?"
"Via the study we propose, we would like the position of farmers to be monitored."
"After all, if we want to retain agricultural production in Europe, we will need to monitor the positions of the primary producers and concentrations of power in the chain, such as large supermarkets."
"I hope, Commissioner, that together with your colleague for Competition, you will want to get your teeth into this issue."
"(SV) Mr President, as the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy's rapporteur for the budget, I should like to thank Mrs Haug for having listened so carefully to our priorities, which genuinely make their presence felt in the budget."
"To my fellow Swedish Eurosceptic Member, Mr Lundgren, who spoke just now and who characterised the budget as idiotic, I would just say that it is not improved by the fact that he himself proposes the total discontinuation of some of the best parts of the budget, relating to, for example, the maritime safety authority and the Youth In Action programme."
"Certainly, the EU budget has problems, however."
"The threefold crisis we are experiencing shows what is at issue."
"I am talking about the climate crisis, the food crisis and the financial crisis."
"The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy proposes increases of at least 5% in all the operational appropriations relating to climate and energy, but this is still a drop in the ocean."
"As a socialist, I see the need for Food Aid, but the debate on funding shows the weaknesses in the budget system."
"It shows how difficult it is to engage in more significant re-prioritising."
"President Sarkozy yesterday pointed out the need for common efforts directed at European trade and industry as a result of the crisis, but there are no such resources in the EU budget."
"The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy indicates the need for more funding for small and medium-sized enterprises, but this, too, is a drop in the ocean."
"Instead, we are forced to invent one temporary instrument after another."
"We have flexibility instruments, the Globalisation Fund, the Solidarity Fund and Food Facility, and we shall soon have a special mechanism for looking after the income from the future auctioning of emissions rights."
"I think it is time to carry out a more ambitious and forward-looking review of the long-term budget."
"Now that we are to carry out a mid-term review, we have the opportunity to ensure that it is better adapted to dealing with the ever more complicated reality in which we live and in which radical measures are required. (debate)"
"Mr President, the most important aspect of this budget is how it aids and supports the economy of Europe in its entirety, as well as developing and strengthening the economy - something which is really needed at present."
"That is why I welcome the support in the budget for research programmes and the development of new technologies, because without the development of such technologies, we cannot hope for competitiveness in our economy."
"I would also like to see this support being made available to all regions throughout Europe, not only in more urban areas, but also in rural communities."
"I would also like to see strong support for the CAP health check in the coming years in order to ensure a healthy food supply locally and not to have to depend on food imports from faraway lands."
"(EL) Mr President, in an election year, the budget should have two distinctive characteristics: firstly, resources that reflect the ambition of the European Union and, secondly, responses and political messages to the expectations of the average citizen, especially in the current difficult economic climate."
"If we evaluate the draft budget before us against these criteria, the amount, which corresponds to payments of 0.96% of Community GDP, is basically adequate, but only if the Council does not chop it down at second reading."
"I trust that the minister will pay particular attention to this point."
"Things are better in terms of political messages and political targets, where we have indeed covered society's basic priorities."
"Without going into greater detail, I should like, if I may, to mention one particular major issue which concerns my country and other countries in the south of the European Union, namely the question of illegal immigration."
"At present, thousands of Iraqis, Kurds, Afghans and Georgians are collecting in Turkey and trying to enter the European Union en masse."
"Greece and other countries in southern Europe have to make a huge effort with scant resources to control illegal immigration."
"In 2007 alone, we had 110 000 illegal immigrants in Greece and there have been over 80 000 up to September of this year."
"I am therefore delighted that, for the first time, the Community budget has a separate point for the solidarity of the European Union with its Member States in the south and I trust that we shall make a good start and maintain it over time."
"(FR) Mr President, on the very day in which the political declaration 'Communicating Europe in Partnership' has just been signed by Parliament, the Commission and the Council, with the latter thus indicating their common will to enhance and to harmonise information on the European Union that is intended for the citizens, we are debating the 2009 budget and the 'Communication of the institutions' budget."
"For this electoral year and at a time of growing scepticism regarding the Union, raising the citizens' awareness of European issues is crucial."
"We hope, in actual fact, that there will be a very strong turnout at the elections."
"For this to happen, all initiatives designed to explain Europe and its added value in terms of everyday life and of preparing for the future are important."
"The forthcoming visitors' centre in Brussels is part of this, but I fear that certain amendments adopted in committee will delay its highly anticipated opening."
"On behalf of my group, I should like in fact to point out how keen we are to see substantial investment in all communication initiatives concerning the citizens and the media, especially at local level."
"Parliament and the Commission must be encouraged in all policies designed to increase support among the citizens for the European project."
"(DE) Mr President, I will focus on Heading 4, which relates to the EU's external activities."
"In current or former conflict zones such as Georgia, Kosovo, Palestine, Afghanistan or Pakistan, we want to achieve improvements for people, and peaceful and humane development."
"As our financial plans have not provided sufficient funds, in 2009 we once again need to obtain additional resources from the Member States for our increased work."
"In particular, there must be no cutbacks in our commitments and payments in our immediate neighbourhood: it is important for candidate countries, our east European neighbours, and our partners on the Mediterranean, to see the EU as a reliable partner that they can count on."
"Looking at the implementation of the 2008 budget - for example, for Palestine alone - and the number of amending letters, I can already tell that we are going to end up in a similar situation in 2009."
"I would therefore make an appeal to the Presidency of the Council, in relation to the conciliation meeting."
"On 21 November, we will, together, be mobilising the flexibility instrument in line with our proposals, which means that, next year, we will not be so easily available for amendments."
"As you know, we have elections coming up, so you also do not know who may be sitting before you following the elections."
"We have placed additional emphasis on the field of foreign affairs, which I think is a positive move."
"We have allocated additional resources so that we can publish European news in Farsi, the language of Iran and Afghanistan."
"I believe it is important to disseminate our political viewpoint in these areas, so that the people know what position Europe is taking."
"On another issue, I would like to ask the Commission to change their policy."
"As you know, there is now a network of political foundations covering five political groupings, and it is unfortunately our experience that these groups are effectively locked out of the implementation of our policies and of support for democracy."
"I hope that this situation will change next year."
"(ES) Mr President, we have before us a draft general budget for 2009 which is attempting to reinforce the social and environmental dimension of the European Union as an area of peace and progress."
"I must particularly highlight, due to their symbolic value, two parliamentary proposals incorporated during the discussion process."
"The first concerns the funding earmarked for European space research, focused on global monitoring of the environment, citizen security and the International Year of Astronomy."
"The second is the pilot project on social tourism which will try to find ways of meeting the requirements for new forms of leisure."
"We regret that the draft budget does not include a special fund for rehabilitation and reconstruction in countries affected by hurricanes and typhoons in the Caribbean and Asia."
"We do not want the current economic and financial crisis moving around the planet to adversely affect the EU budget."
"(SK) I am responsible within the socialist group for financial matters under the heading of 'Other Institutions'."
"From this standpoint, I can state that the process of drawing up the budget and ensuring the efficient use of funding is heading in a positive direction."
"Here too, however, there are reservations, for example, over the policy on fixed assets."
"Only a longer-term view coupled with planning measures can help us to achieve greater financial savings."
"A further reservation concerns the use of studies into the energy consumption of buildings."
"The most recent studies into the carbon footprint of the European Parliament mention a carbon dioxide equivalent of 114 000 tonnes a year."
"We must adopt a series of measures aimed at reducing emissions by 30% by 2020."
"The main sources of pollution are heating and electricity in the buildings themselves, as well as the transportation of people between home and the workplace and also between the three main workplaces."
"Before the end of the year, I am expecting the Secretary General of the European Parliament to submit an action plan based on a number of studies, so that we can take steps as soon as possible which will lead to financial savings and a cleaner environment."
"(FI) Mr President, first of all I want to thank both rapporteurs for this excellent work, and it is interesting that this term we have been able to find consensus, perhaps even politically, and more so than in former years, even though the elections are forthcoming."
"That is excellent."
"I would like to raise one matter, which is that the Committee on Budgets has now presented its own budget line for the Baltic Strategy."
"That is extremely important."
"The Commission is preparing its own Baltic Strategy for next year, but no strategy has any significance unless it also has funding, and funding has to be organised this way."
"The issue here is mainly the environment."
"The Baltic is almost a dead sea."
"In this sense it is a blot on the European landscape."
"We have a lot of work to do."
"This is about our relations with Russia, energy policy, shipping, the economy: all very important matters, and we can use this budget line to help ensure that these issues will be put right."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the two rapporteurs: Mr Lewandowski, who has worked with great deliberation and composure to draft Parliament's budget; and Mrs Haug, who has worked with great commitment to present us with a very effective strategy for the Commission's budget."
"The broad agreement that we will, I hope, achieve in tomorrow's vote should send a very clear political message, in particular for the conciliation on 21 November."
"It is abundantly clear that, particularly in the current climate, growth, jobs, trans-European networks, lifelong learning, the fight against climate change, European transport networks and the security of external borders must be shaped as we have set out."
"In foreign policy, too, a consistent neighbourhood policy and a global development, crisis management and integration concept for the European Union are more vital than ever."
"Hence, Commissioner, the question concerning payments."
"At the end of the process, the level of payments will be evaluated very differently depending on the category."
"You mentioned the issue of the reserves, and I simply note that, apart from that, you have no objections to Parliament's priorities and focuses."
"That is a good sign for the negotiations."
"We are delighted that the French Presidency is here today, Mr Jouyet, because the Presidency has not always been present for October's debate on the budget."
"This is evidence of the good cooperation we have begun."
"Of course, you had to start off by speaking like a finance minister: everything is far too expensive, everything is far too high."
"We are operating here, including with regard to what we are voting on, far below the ceiling of the multiannual financial plan."
"Between the lines, though, it has become clear that you are prepared to negotiate, as you have said: with regard to the food aid facility, and, I would stress, not only there but also in the other foreign policy priorities - GASP, Kosovo, Palestine, Afghanistan and Georgia - it is a matter of negotiating, and finding, the optimum combination of instruments."
"We are prepared to do so, using all the options open to us under the Interinstitutional Agreement and the budgetary principles."
"In this connection, we are looking forward to constructive negotiations."
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, 2009 will be a very special period, as it will relate to the proper implementation of investments related to cohesion policy."
"It will be the third year in a row based on the n+3 principle."
"This means it will be a period in which we will pin our hopes not so much on signing agreements, but in the complete realisation of very concrete undertakings, which makes any attempt to reduce financing, when it comes to cohesion policy, very dangerous."
"I would also like to draw attention to the fact that there are voices in the European Parliament that associate the results of the audit of the European Court of Auditors with budgetary planning and, as a result, some very well-known comments on the dozen or so percent of unqualified expenditure are now impinging upon the budgetary debate."
"I hope that neither this House, nor the Commissioner, will accept any associations and allocations to reserves of this nature."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have already gone on for too long, but, really, this debate was quite fascinating."
"I would like to say that we agree on the priorities as they have been expressed by your rapporteurs, and as they have been expressed by Mr Böge, and that it is in fact our wish to cooperate very closely."
"I regret that I am unfortunately not speaking as a finance minister, Mr Böge, but, well, in this Presidency, that is how it is, in fact, and I can simply assure this House that we wish to reach an agreement within the scope of this procedure."
"I wish to assure you, too, that the Council will demonstrate, within the limits that I mentioned, the constructive attitude that we are in fact aiming for, within the framework of the priorities mentioned - I am addressing the Commission and this House here."
"I observed the emphasis that was placed, in particular, on external policy, on communication, and on subjects relating to financial regulation and to the euro."
"I noted these various points, as well as the needs of your institution, which have been pointed out, and that we need to single out two elements at the end of this debate."
"The first is the discussion on the future of the European budget."
"I heard Mrs Guy-Quint and the others, but many of the observations raised need to be debated within the context of the clause for re-examining the financial framework."
"It is within this context that the Commission, the European Parliament and the Member States must take a stand and design the future multiannual financial framework."
"We had spoken about this with Mr Böge."
"Current circumstances have meant that we, as the Presidency, have also focused on other urgent matters."
"The second is the issues at stake in the 2009 budgetary procedure."
"In this regard, we must work out a realistic and balanced budget and find solutions for financing the food facility - I say this on the record - as this remains an objective that we share."
"This is an important political priority for all the Community institutions today and, on this matter, too, we hope to ensure an optimum combination of the various resources."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, I am grateful to all those who have taken part in this debate."
"To you, Commissioner, I would like to say that I know, as do we all, that the Commission is never particularly happy when the Parliament sets reserves."
"We do understand that, because you feel the pinch, but this year we wanted - and we will see this in the vote tomorrow - to lay down conditions for releasing the reserve that you will be in a position to meet quite independently."
"These conditions are not a cloud cuckoo land where you have to rely on and badger other people in order to get your money - Parliament has been very reasonable here."
"In the great majority of cases, we will be able to release these reserves relatively quickly, by the second reading, because you will have met the conditions we have imposed - I am firmly convinced of this."
"Mr Jouyet, I realise that you cannot make us any specific promises here and now, but I assume that you were serious about what you said about both recognising and wanting a climate of cooperation."
"Allow me to make one comment regarding your plea to take account of the financial policy context in which we are operating: I think this context is one digit too large."
"Our budget runs to just under EUR 130 billion; together, we have room for manoeuvre of a few hundred million."
"We can argue about that here, but it bears absolutely no relation to the larger context to which you referred."
"Once again, I am much obliged to all my fellow Members."
"We will, I believe, be able to bring a well-prepared debate to pass relatively quickly tomorrow."
"Mr President, I would like to use the extra time to speak in support of the many voices of Members of the various political groups regarding the critical situation under Heading 4 of the budgets, which are for funding the European Union's international ambitions."
"I well remember the end of the negotiations on the Financial Perspective well, and the verdict of Parliament was clear - that this part was inadequately funded."
"This happens year after year, and every time there are new sticking points in the budget negotiations."
"The situation has been the same this year too, when we have huge commitments regarding food aid, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Palestine, which have been mentioned frequently in this House, as well as Georgia, where the question is not just of the country's orientation, but also of the security of alternative energy supplies, has been raised."
"The response must be an agreement to revise the Interinstitutional Agreement rather than patching up edges of the financial rules every year when our backs are to the wall."
"I thank everyone who has spoken on the issue of the Parliament's and other institutions' budgets."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, 23 October."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - The question is whether the EU has sufficient resources and will create enough funds to adequately implement measures on mitigation, stabilisation and adaptation on emissions."
"Generally speaking, the EU budget, in its present format, cannot deal efficiently and effectively with issues related to climate change."
"With the exception of a number of initiatives and programs, the EU budget does not have a clear and integrated strategy to address climate change issues."
"In this respect, therefore, I am arguing that the creation of a specific ''Climate Change Fund'' or a dedicated budget line would significantly improve the EU's capability to effectively address climate change issues from a budgetary and financial perspective."
"The main source of funding should be coming from the auctioning of emissions under the European Emissions Trading Scheme."
"It is estimated that the scheme would have the potential of generating annually billions of euros in terms of revenue."
"This scheme would be dealt with and coordinated by the EU, thus ensuring regional arbitrariness."
"Cross border pollution is best managed at supranational level, especially when it comes to allocation of resources and support, which should be based on needs and highest impact, not pre-allocated to countries or regions."
"EC-Bosnia Herzegovina Stabilisation and Association Agreement - EC-Bosnia Herzegovina Stabilisation and Association Agreement (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on"
"the report by Mrs Pack, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the proposal for a Council and Commission decision on the conclusion of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, of the other part - C6 0255/2008 -;"
"and the Council and Commission Statements - EC-Bosnia and Herzegovina Stabilisation and Association Agreement."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I read recently that Bosnia is a well-meaning state, but a state that is not working."
"This country has to live with the Dayton Agreement which, thank God, ended the war in 1995, but which contains too little for the state as a whole to function and too much for it to perish."
"The country has a political class which is as good as useless when it comes to taking responsibility."
"Two politicians in the country dominate the political scene and affect each other like interconnecting pipes."
"One wants to return to the pre-1999 days; in other words, he wants the break-up of the two entities."
"The other wants to make his entity into a state within a state."
"However, the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina can only function if everyone faces the facts and realises that constitutional reform is only possible with the agreement of all three ethnic groups."
"Both entities must strengthen the state as a whole."
"Therefore, Bosnian politicians themselves all need to set about constitutional reform through the competent institutions, especially parliament, and ensure that they involve civil society in the process."
"The Muslim-Croat Federation could set an example."
"The unworkable configuration of communities, ten cantons and a federal government was not its fault, but it is a nonsense."
"Decision-making levels must be reduced to the absolute minimum and brought as close to the citizens as possible, if the requirements of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement and for accession to the EU are to be met."
"Around 167 ministers and all that entails are the biggest drain on the state."
"The rivalry between the two aforementioned politicians and their hangers-on is having fatal consequences."
"They are setting the ethnic groups against each other in the tried and tested manner by fomenting anxiety and mistrust."
"The ethnic divide has become wider rather than narrower."
"Instead of going all out to tackle a common energy supply, create a functioning common market, improve the general education system and attract investors to the country with credible policies, party political bickering and boundless mistrust rule current politics."
"Does Sarajevo still need the High Representative?"
"He has not used his wide powers for a long time."
"No one any longer fears his command, even if it were to come; we can therefore ask ourselves if there is any reason why the EU Special Representative should not take over his position and take care of the EU conditions, so that Bosnian politics can finally start on the most important reforms needed to push the country forward."
"The politicians could not be more inactive than they are now, even after his departure."
"It only remains to hope that perhaps then they will wake up and take their fate into their own hands."
"The EU has been trying for years, with funding and know-how, to release the country from its agony, but the results are not overwhelming."
"The people who want to return are unable to do so and, as a result, the ethnic divide is becoming more and more entrenched."
"Obscure privatisations and corruption, the lack of freedom of the press in parts of the country, the intimidation of NGOs: all this is making people lose heart and turn their back on the country."
"The endless discussion about political reform ruled the political scene for over three years, until agreement was reached on a highly insubstantial bill."
"Nonetheless, the EU clutched at this straw and signed the agreement, so that other important political projects in the country could finally be pushed ahead."
"We here in Parliament also support this step and are waiting for the politicians to take advantage of this opportunity."
"I should like to emphasise once again that only the overall state of Bosnia and Herzegovina can become a member of the EU."
"Anyone who undermines its ability to function does not want to achieve this objective, whatever they may say."
"I can therefore only appeal to all members of parliament in the region to come to their senses once and for all and predicate their policies on the welfare of their citizens."
"Mr President, Commissioner, dear Mr Rehn, Mrs Pack, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking Mrs Pack very much for the quality of her report and for what she just said, as it will allow me to be more brief with regard to this difficult subject."
"As you know, the Council sets great store by the European perspective on the countries of the Western Balkans, as I can confirm today."
"This movement in favour of the European integration of the Balkans was moreover launched on the initiative of the French Presidency, which remains very supportive of this objective."
"The movement was launched in 2000 when the European Union, for the first time, gathered together all of these countries at the Zagreb Summit and recognised their aspiration to join the Union."
"Each of the Balkan countries has such a perspective today, which guarantees the stability of the region and the development, both political and economic, of each of the countries."
"Moreover, this perspective has meaning, and particular meaning with regard to Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is the country of the region that - need I remind you? - has suffered the most from the conflicts resulting from the break-up of the former Yugoslavia."
"However, today - as you pointed out, Mrs Pack - this country is at a crossroads between adopting the European perspective that will take it as far as accession to the European Union and withdrawing into itself, on the basis of backward-looking nationalist rhetoric."
"It follows that the remarkable progress made during the first quarter of 2008 has enabled the Union to take the historic decision to sign this Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"This was the sign that, with will and determination, this country's politicians were capable of reaching a consensus and of undertaking the necessary reforms."
"It is this determination that the Council wished to recognise by signing this agreement in June, once the four conditions had been met."
"I shall remind you of these four conditions: good overall cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia; the reform of public broadcasting; the improvement of public administration; and the launch of a police reform."
"The signing of the agreement and the interim agreement, in Luxembourg, on 16 June, was a particularly important stage in the relations between the Union and Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"This should give fresh impetus to the country's efforts to join the European Union."
"It is impetus that should be capitalised on without delay."
"I would remind you that the interim agreement came into force on 1 July."
"This is a first step, but I would say that it is not the end of the beginning!"
"Much remains to be done."
"This is what we and Commissioner Rehn, who is present in this House, said to the country's officials when we met them on the fringe of the United Nations General Assembly and during the meeting of the Troika."
"In key areas of the agreement and of the European partnership, we need not only to consolidate the progress made but also, as you emphasised, Mrs Pack, to accelerate the reforms."
"It is extremely important that the momentum of the reforms concerning the rule of law, on compliance with democratic rules and on matters relating to the reform of the police, as well, be much stronger than it is today."
"Let it not be said to us that there are problems concerning a split between the politicians and the public in Bosnia and Herzegovina, because all the surveys show that the European aspirations of Bosnia and Herzegovina's population are extremely strong."
"Over 80% of this population genuinely want to join the European Union!"
"What is it that is stopping Bosnia and Herzegovina's politicians from responding to the legitimate aspirations of the country's people?"
"For our part, within the context of the Union, we are doing what we can to support this country economically and financially, to help it to advance, to help it to progress on the road to security, and to help it to progress on the road to modernising the police force with the police missions we have put in place, together with the military missions."
"The experience of the last accessions - and I shall conclude here - shows that the efforts made in relation to the European agenda do pay off."
"I would like the political leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina to understand the following: the Stabilisation and Association Agreement provides a solid foundation and a lever for a profound commitment from this country."
"We will not give up helping them, but we have accomplished what it was our responsibility to accomplish."
"It is up to the politicians of that country to really understand what its commitments are and to fulfil them, in order to guarantee that which is the only possible route to take, namely an unbreakable commitment to closer links with the European Union."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Doris Pack for her excellent report."
"I welcome the opportunity to discuss Bosnia and Herzegovina with you today at a very crucial moment for the country and its European aspirations."
"The signature of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) last June was a significant step forward for Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"Together with the start of the visa dialogue, it gave a clear signal to the people of that country that their future lies in the European Union."
"The EU was able to initial the SAA last December and sign it in June because the country's political leaders pulled together and reached consensus on the main conditions, particularly on police reform."
"This proves that progress can be achieved and crises overcome when the political will exists, as Mr Jouyet rightly pointed out."
"However, this consensus has since collapsed and reforms have been halted."
"Nationalist rhetoric ahead of the local elections in October was one factor in this deterioration."
"Yet the country's political problems run much deeper than that."
"The lack of a common vision among the country's leaders about its future and the absence of consensus on EU reforms seriously harm its European prospects."
"There is also open disagreement on most political questions, while there is no sense of urgency or responsibility to overcome this political stalemate."
"I expressed my serious concern to the Presidency of the country during my visit to Sarajevo a few days ago."
"I underlined that Bosnia and Herzegovina now needs to put EU-related reforms at the top of its political agenda and address the priorities of the European partnership, including state- and institution-building."
"Your resolution sends a strong signal to the leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina to get on with the reforms and to get their country back on the road to Europe."
"Likewise, Bosnia and Herzegovina must be able to speak with one voice to advance in European integration."
"Another litmus test of the country's ability to deliver on EU integration is the census."
"From an EU perspective - as we all know - census data are vital for social and economic planning and development and for most Community policies."
"The Commission will offer its assessment on the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Progress Report on 5 November."
"Like you, we shall also point out the fact that the leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina can either continue to quarrel and fall behind their neighbours, or get on with reform and move forward towards the EU."
"Your resolution underlines that closing down the Office of the High Representative (OHR) and strengthening the role of the European Union should remain our ultimate objective."
"I agree."
"The future of the OHR is a matter for the Peace Implementation Council to decide, but it is clearly in the interest of Bosnia and Herzegovina to reach a point where the OHR will no longer be needed, thus paving the way for a stronger EU presence and for realising the EU perspective of the country."
"In other words, as we move into the next phase of our relations, Bosnia and Herzegovina itself must assume full ownership of the reform process that underpins its EU perspective."
"The signature of the SAA this summer provided an opportunity that should not be wasted."
"The challenge for Bosnia and Herzegovina's leaders is to achieve a degree of political consensus such as has delivered progress on EU integration elsewhere in the Western Balkans region."
"They have done it before so they can do it again."
"I hope our messages will now be heard."
"Mr President, in June of this year, Bosnia and Herzegovina signed a stabilisation and association agreement with the EU."
"The country thus took a substantial step forward on its way towards membership of the EU, but the work is very far from complete."
"The EU's commitment cannot and should not decrease in the belief that everything will now arrange itself automatically."
"A whole series of challenges remains."
"The constitutional reform has not been implemented."
"The issue of state property in the Brčko district is still unresolved."
"There are clearly widely different views, both in Bosnia itself and within the international community, as to when and how the High Representative's office should be closed."
"I firmly believe that the closure of this office cannot be an objective in itself."
"Rather, the objective should be that the requirements and conditions imposed on Bosnia by the Council for Peace Implementation should be fulfilled so that it is possible to transform the High Representative's office into the office of the EU's special representative."
"In this connection, as in connection with the range of other challenges faced by Bosnia, it is very important that the international community should stand united."
"To believe that the local parties in Bosnia itself will be able to agree on, for example, constitutional reforms, is naïve and, I would say, downright dangerous."
"The new constitution needs to lead to a strong and common state if the country is to be able to continue to draw closer to the EU."
"The political dialogue in Bosnia does not, however, indicate any interest in achieving this."
"It is just as dangerous to believe that the commitment of the international community can decrease now that Bosnia has made a certain amount of progress and that the international military presence is continually being reduced."
"On the contrary, it is now that the EU itself is assuming yet more responsibility."
"Certain measures, such as making it easier for people to travel and study abroad, together with help in developing democracy and implementing the necessary reforms, are just a couple of examples of areas in which the EU can and should become more active."
"Our commitment and the way in which we handle the situation in Bosnia over the next few months and years will be decisive, not only for the future and security of Bosnia but also for the future and security of the region as a whole."
"The Stabilisation and Association Agreement is the first comprehensive international agreement between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the European Union."
"The agreement should facilitate and speed up Bosnia and Herzegovina's transition to a fully functional legal state and also to a fully functioning economy."
"The fulfilment of this agreement will put in place the essential preconditions for Bosnia and Herzegovina's full membership of the EU in future."
"The speed with which this agreement comes into effect, however, will depend mainly on the common desire and willingness of the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina and their political leaders."
"The agreement has been signed with Bosnia and Herzegovina as a whole and not with its separate entities."
"If Bosnia and Herzegovina is to become a member of the European Union one day, it is in the interests of both entities and of all three groups to work together to create a united and properly-functioning state."
"The combined forces of Bosnians, Serbs and Croats, through their main political parties, should therefore aim to strengthen the administration of the country at all levels."
"One important part of this process is the question of future institutional arrangements."
"The international community, including representatives of the EU, can offer a helping hand here."
"Any institutional arrangements must, however, be the result of a voluntary agreement between the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina themselves."
"In my view, it is also important for the association process to take account of the country's economic performance."
"Here, too, there is a need for cooperation between both entities in order to create a common internal market for the whole of Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"It is an inconceivable situation for a country to be applying for membership of the common European market whilst its own market remains fragmented."
"I would like to end by expressing my appreciation for the report of Doris Pack and by calling on the Member States of the EU to ratify this agreement quickly."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, tomorrow, we will be voting on the resolution on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the EU and Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"While my group endorses the agreement, we do want it to be used to ensure that that country will reform and modernise in a number of crucial areas."
"Bosnia is not ready for EU membership, not by a long shot."
"In terms of form of government and jurisdiction, a great deal needs to be done in Bosnia."
"Also, more attention should be devoted to tracing and trying war criminals, and the fight against corruption and international crime."
"More than anything, as has been said a number of times here, what really needs to be tackled is the internal structures, bureaucracy and internal cooperation."
"I have to confess that, on my recent visit to Sarajevo, I was absolutely shocked at the lack of responsibility on the part of the politicians in that country."
"The Commissioner touched upon this earlier, and Mrs Pack devoted much attention to this aspect in her fine report."
"One is left with the impression that all the problems besetting that country are caused by the outside world and that therefore, all the solutions should come from the outside world."
"It is as if the internal ping-pong game that is being played there at different levels and in different dimensions is the fault of the outside world and that we should therefore solve it."
"This is not how it works, though."
"It is not only in our interest to get things back on track in Bosnia and for Bosnia to meet us halfway in its European fate, it is also in Bosnia's interest."
"What I did find positive, and I should like to make a point of saying this, is the efforts on the part of all kinds of entrepreneurs, companies large and small, who try to get something off the ground economically over there - even though this is being made very hard for them due to a lack of an internal market - NGOs that pull out all the stops and do good, and particularly Europe's contribution in that country: the European troops over there, the High Representative and, not least, the Commission's work there."
"I think the Commission is doing a fine job there and it makes me proud to be European."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, first my thanks to the rapporteur for the usual excellent cooperation."
"This resolution should send a strong signal to our partners in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a clear cross-party 'yes' to the continuing EU integration process, a clear recognition of the progress made, but a clear 'no' to further nationalistic or even separatist trends with which officials defend their position and under which the people suffer."
"For many years, serious return programmes have only been agreed on paper."
"The actual and political will to implement them in practice is rather under-developed."
"The right to and the possibility of return, reconciliation projects and the prosecution of war crimes at all levels are the basic precondition to the hoped-for peaceful, democratic development of the rule of law in this part of Europe."
"The deciding basis is the replacement of the Dayton Agreement by a constitution passed by democratically elected members of parliament in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with the involvement of civil society, not hatched between party leaders."
"I have a request to make of the Commission: leave the well-trodden path and be as flexible as possible, so that EU funds can be used more efficiently and in a more targeted manner."
"Allow me to make one more final appeal to the Member States: ratify the Stabilisation and Association Agreement as quickly as possible, in order to prove your reliability."
"Mr President, it is our duty to speed up Bosnia and Herzegovina's accession to the European Union."
"The European Union should feel some guilt and take some of the blame for keeping quiet, taking shameful or inadequate action, or failing to act at all when, in the 1990s, blood was shed in the Balkans, including Bosnia and Herzegovina, and thousands of people lost their lives."
"That is why today we need to help Bosnia and Herzegovina, and make its march towards the Union easier, knowing at the same time that the road to Brussels is an uphill one that is not economically or nationally straightforward."
"We should not discourage Sarajevo but, at the same time, we should keep an eye on the authorities there."
"Let us show the green light to the Bosnian vehicle."
"Let us hope that Bosnia does not have an accident along the way, and that we as a Union will not have to impose penalty points on it, and let us not prejudge whether the vehicle that reaches Brussels will be the same one that set out."
"Let us give the peoples living there the right to decide their own future."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Mr President, 16 years after the collapse of Yugoslavia, Bosnia and Herzegovina is still a protectorate with a foreign supervisor and foreign military presence."
"There is no agreement among the three peoples and their main political parties about the future government structure."
"Every effort by the European Union to impose a structure of this kind has failed and will do so in future."
"Serbs, Croats and Bosnians will have to find their own way."
"Anyone who wishes to keep this pocked-sized Yugoslavia together will need federal or confederal solutions in which all three peoples are equivalent and carry their own responsibility for government and for their areas."
"My group supports the association agreement which, in our view, should have been approved much sooner and without the requirement for administrative reform."
"In the Committee on Foreign Affairs, my group has submitted amendments to look for long-term solutions that are carried by each administrative unit and for protection of the domestic economy."
"This will ensure a quick withdrawal of the European Union from every domestic area."
"A majority rejected these solutions and wishes to stay in Bosnia."
"This means, unfortunately, that my group is unable to endorse the final outcome of the Pack report."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, allow me to start with a general comment."
"The two Dutch parties that I represent are very much in favour of a European prospect for Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"I have two questions for the Council and Commission."
"Last Saturday, an article appeared in the Dutch press with an alarming headline: 'Bosnia about to explode'."
"The article was an interview with an insider, a real authority on the Bosnian situation."
"I would ask the Council and Commission if they agree with this alarm signal that Bosnia is actually about to explode, also on account of the widespread possession of arms in that country."
"The second point I wish to make is even more serious, to my mind."
"I have, for some time, been reading up on the phenomenon of Salafism and Muslim radicalism in Bosnia and Herzegovina, supported by scientific research, including in my own country."
"I would ask the Council and Commission how they view Bosnia as a refuge and operating base for radical Muslims in the Balkans and in Europe."
"Experts claim that the European institutions simply disregard this serious problem."
"Caution is therefore called for."
"What I would like to know from you is how you view this problem."
"This is, after all, quite serious: Bosnia is about to join and with these radical Muslims..."
"Internally, externally, also active in EU Member States, including Austria, the Netherlands, Scandinavia - we should not go over this lightly."
"I would appreciate your reaction to this."
"(NL) Mr President, I believe that we should exercise extreme caution and should reconsider whether it is wise to offer Bosnia and Herzegovina the prospect of EU membership."
"It was pointed out a moment ago that many of the conditions have yet to be met."
"Even though it is self-evident, I should like to mention the problem of the growth of Islamic fundamentalism in Bosnia."
"It is becoming more and more apparent that the Salafist networks are being developed with financial and logistical support from Saudi Arabia."
"Not only do these networks form a threat to peace in the country itself, they also put the safety of the whole of Europe in the balance."
"I would therefore like to endorse the questions raised by Mr Belder."
"Could the Council and Commission respond to the measures that are being taken to prevent the problem of possible terrorist networks from spreading to the European Union?"
"(DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the conclusion of the Association Agreement is, without doubt, a good thing for both sides - for the European Union and for Bosnia and Herzegovina - but only under certain conditions; namely if it is ratified quickly and, most importantly, if the implementation of reforms - especially of the administration in Bosnia and Herzegovina and of the political decision-making processes - takes hold quickly."
"We all know that the Dayton Agreement has, on the one hand, brought peace; on the other hand, however, it has created a very complicated structure with various governments and parliaments and has again taken account of ethnicity."
"In other words, you have another ten cantons and need about 13 home secretaries to pass an asylum law in this country."
"The political process would probably take some beating in terms of complexity."
"These difficulties became apparent during the reform of the police."
"It took years to remove the barriers and get to the point of implementing these police reforms as one of the preconditions."
"For me this means that Bosnia and Herzegovina must develop the will to cooperate over and above the limits which have applied to date and implement reforms themselves at all levels."
"Following the police reform, we now have the opportunity in Bosnia and Herzegovina to take real precautions in relation to border protection, to decide on a visa regulation and to coordinate the fight against organised crime and drug and people trafficking better than before."
"Security and stability are vital if the citizens are to put their trust in the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"That is why, for me, Bosnia and Herzegovina need to overcome the internal barriers that still exist."
"The European Union has shown with the Association Agreement that it was and is prepared to help, but the real progress must come from the country itself."
"(DE) Mr President, firstly I should like to offer my hearty thanks to Mrs Doris Pack for her report and, most of all, for her commitment."
"I should also like to reject the charges made by some Members that Bosnia and Herzegovina are to be seen solely from the point of view of alleged or actual Islamic terrorist networks."
"That is absolutely unfair and it is also telling that our fellow Member who then asked the Commission what can be done about this has already left the Chamber."
"That is how seriously this problem is being taken."
"Commissar Rehn has also said that 2009 could be a decisive year for the Balkans."
"Macedonia will hopefully begin to negotiate, Croatia will hopefully close negotiations, Montenegro, Serbia and, possibly, even Albania, will achieve candidate status."
"Then one asks oneself, what will become of Bosnia and Herzegovina?"
"It would truly be a shame for the many committed people in this country if it were given no opportunity to take a leap forward here."
"I would like to underscore what Mrs Pack said: the ability of the country to function must be established."
"As some honourable members have already said, the country must not be taken hostage by either Mr Dodik or Mr Silajdžić or anyone else."
"The starting point, including as far as the entities are concerned, must be the status quo, but reforms must be implemented."
"The preconditions must be created for the country to be able to join the European Union, whereby it goes without saying that only the whole country can join the European Union."
"As far as the High Representative is concerned, I can only agree with what has already been said."
"It is not a question of the country no longer needing someone who effectively sees to the country's preparations for accession, but this duty can probably no longer be performed by the High Representative, who should be replaced by the European Special Representative."
"This is a task for the European Union, which must perform it with the support of this Parliament - specifically of Doris Pack and others who will continue to dedicate themselves to this country."
"We shall soon see that this country too has the possibility of joining the European Union."
"(SL) The return of refugees is a matter of crucial importance for all the countries of the Western Balkans, so I offer my sincere support to the amendments proposed by the rapporteur and by Anna Ibrisagic regarding the return of refugees to the Posavina region."
"This also applies to the return of refugees from all communities to all other areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"If our appeals and our efforts are to meet with success, we also require additional measures and, in particular, investment in job creation."
"Too many times, refugees and IDPs return temporarily with only one aim: to sell their property and go elsewhere."
"They leave also because they do not have adequate health protection or pensions and the political conditions are tense in their place of return."
"They also leave because of the delay in depoliticising and reforming the police and the lack of general security."
"Those responsible for war crimes must be removed and barred from working in the police."
"Hence, the ALDE initiative to declare 11 July an international day of remembrance for the victims of genocide from Srebrenica."
"The draft text was delivered last week by the President of the Mothers of Enclaves of Srebrenica and the Žepa Association."
"This is something we really need for their relief."
"(DA) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Jouyet, I see Bosnia's future in Europe."
"The creation of peace and stability in this country must, and shall, succeed where centuries of its history have combined to achieve this."
"However, there is a long way to go."
"Often, a good place to start is, however, with practical improvements and cooperation in connection with solutions to quite general and practical everyday problems such as trade, the structure of the police force, the energy supply and, in particular, allowing the many internally displaced people to have a home again."
"It is therefore important to invest in young people."
"They must be given a belief in a future in this country."
"Good educational opportunities must be ensured, including opportunities for practical and educational placements, both in existing EU Member States and in neighbouring countries."
"I believe that it is essential that young people in the Western Balkans see themselves as Europeans, because it is in a European context that the solution to the future of the area lies."
"From the EU's point of view, we must be prepared to encourage this process and reiterate that the perspective from which this must be viewed is membership of the European Union."
"The Stabilisation and Association Agreement is a tool to be used along the way."
"However, Bosnia's population and politicians must be active and positive, fellow players if our common hope and vision are to succeed."
"(DE) Mr President, I should like to join in the thanks which numerous Members have already quite rightly extended to the rapporteur, Doris Pack."
"In her, we have someone who is hopefully not wasting her time and effort and who truly is investing a great deal of time and effort in this area."
"I rejoice with her and with those who have also said that there has been some progress, including in the area of police cooperation."
"That is important if actual life on the ground is to be able to run along reasonable lines."
"Nevertheless, I believe that we must keep pointing out to our counterparts in Bosnia and Herzegovina that they personally and their side still needs to do a great deal, even more than is already being done in numerous areas."
"Internal cooperation and a willingness to enter into internal cooperation between the ethnic groups is something which we must permanently demand."
"We do not want everyone trying to go their own way."
"Involvement in regional cooperation in the Western Balkans is also important."
"(FR) Mr President, they all lived in one of the most cosmopolitan cities in Europe, Sarajevo."
"Sarajevo was, at that time, the symbol of an open Bosnia, populated by Muslims, Serbs and Croats."
"Meanwhile, nationalism struck blindly, massacring men and women, and indiscriminately destroying cultural symbols such as the library - the so very rich library - of Sarajevo, a victim of the folly of mankind."
"That was a very long time ago - 16 years."
"If I take the liberty of recalling these tragic events, it is in order to assess the progress made, it is to put into perspective this long road towards the Stabilisation and Association Agreement."
"Everyone should therefore be delighted with this situation."
"True, 2 500 Eurofor soldiers remain in that country."
"True, in a country still guided by the fear of political domination by another community, the result of the municipal elections of 5 October is yet another reflection of the domination of the nationalist parties."
"However, this afternoon's gesture reflects, on the part of the European Parliament, a sense of confidence and a future in the easing of tensions, a rediscovered cultural diversity, and a willingness to accept the peoples representing such cultural diversity."
"It is this message of hope that we must remember today, since let us never forget the words spoken by President Mitterrand in this House: 'nationalism is war'."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the signing of this agreement, as it is going to contribute to the political and economic stability, not just of this particular country, but of the Balkans as a whole."
"Bosnia and Herzegovina has overcome an atrocious interethnic war, while Bulgaria has been cited as an example in the Balkans of the wisdom shown by its civil society, wisdom that has made reconciliation possible."
"The role of education is not insignificant."
"It is necessary, therefore, for the Bosnian authorities to focus on the teaching of peace."
"Moreover, they must promote intercultural and interfaith dialogue, to prevent conflicts between refugees, people who are returning to their own country and the local population."
"The unemployment rate must be reduced by means of more importance being attached to training programmes and the brain drain among young people being reversed."
"Regional cooperation is extremely important when it comes to integrating the State into European structures."
"Improving the infrastructure must be a priority."
"I believe that the establishment of a free trade area may be beneficial and may prepare the country with regard to adopting European standards."
"(LT) Recently I spent some time in Kosovo and I would like to draw your attention to the parallels between the situation in that country and those in Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"As we know, the European Union and the majority of Member States recognised Kosovo's independence, but the situation in that country is especially difficult, particularly in the northern part."
"Parallel structures have emerged there and conditions do not allow the forces of law and order to operate."
"There is increasing talk of the possible division of Kosovo."
"I would like to ask both the Minister and the Commissioner: does such a situation in Kosovo not echo the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina?"
"If we failed to glue together the fractured state model in Bosnia and Herzegovina, what is the European Union prepared to do in such a case?"
"(DE) Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to ask Commissioner Rehn another question."
"Could you please advise us of the state of funding for demilitarisation and disarmament and for ensuring that surplus arms are legally destroyed?"
"Mr President, dear Mr McMillan-Scott, Commissioner Rehn, ladies and gentlemen, many thanks for this rich and interesting debate."
"I should like once again to thank Mrs Pack, who has shown herself to be very active, who has a very sound knowledge of the region, who is also very present on the ground, who has listened the most to what the local leaders have to say - we therefore need her cooperation - and who is involved in bringing about a rapprochement with the European Union, but without any concessions being made in terms of values."
"Like her, the Council is concerned - as I said before - about the political situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina as it has been described by several speakers."
"This country - as you emphasised - is at a crossroads and caught up in controversy with regard to relations between the central State and the bodies and with regard to the path that will lead to the European Union, as I said."
"Its leaders must assume their full responsibilities regarding the country's development and must ensure in this way that the stabilisation of the entire region is consolidated."
"For all that, I shall respond to the question put to me, and the answer is that the security situation remains calm."
"Neither the independence of Kosovo nor the arrest of Mr Karadzic has caused unrest in the country."
"The deadline for the municipal elections of 5 October having lapsed, the European Union must henceforth apply pressure so that Bosnia and Herzegovina focuses on its European agenda."
"Mr Swoboda was entirely correct in his response concerning the superficial comparisons made between terrorist fears and the multiethnic character of Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"The latter is precisely what makes this country rich and what could be its contribution to the European Union."
"Looking to the future, we shall be careful to prevent any suggestion that the European Union has abandoned Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"I should like to reassure Mr Czarnecki on this point: the European Union must give its verdict on the future of the Office of the High Representative, in the knowledge that we desire neither the premature closure without conditions nor the artificial extension of this Office."
"On the subject of the future of the EUFOR-Althea military operation, we cannot extend it indefinitely."
"The Union will have to re-engineer this operation, and the foreign affairs ministers will have to debate it at the Council of 10 November."
"To conclude, and to respond to several speakers, I would say that the Bosnia and Herzegovina situation needs to be placed within a regional framework."
"Our objective is to enable the entire region to progress towards a rapprochement with the European Union. A number of positive developments must be highlighted in this regard."
"The fact that Croatia has entered into an active phase of negotiations is a good thing."
"The fact that, in Serbia, we have for the first time a government that is committed to forming closer links with the European Union and that, with the arrest of Mr Karadzic, has pledged its commitment, is an entirely positive element and one that must be commended."
"The Bosnian leaders must take care not to stay on the sidelines of this development, by thinking only of settling scores inherited from past wars."
"Like Mr McMillan-Scott, I too heard the speech made by François Mitterrand in this House."
"I, too, remember his words, but it is important in fact to go beyond these conflicts, in the name of the same principles as those that were emphasised by President Mitterrand at the time."
"To conclude, the aim of the reforms requested by the European Union is not only to enable this country to form closer links with the European Union but, above all, to ensure that its entire population benefits from the progress that we are trying to encourage."
"I agree entirely with Mr Maaten."
"It is clear that we can be proud of being Europeans, proud of what the Commission and the other institutions are doing to help Bosnia and Herzegovina on the only route with any substance, that is to say the route to rapprochement, in line with the values, with the European Union!"
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, firstly I would like to thank you for a very substantive and responsible debate on the political situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"I also want to thank you for your broad and strong support for the conclusion of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the country."
"It is indeed essential for the economic development and political stability of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as for its European objectives."
"There were two issues in particular which came up in the debate today that I would like to comment further on."
"The first is the rule of law and its importance in underpinning the whole society and the economy."
"The rule of law and legal certainty are the cornerstones of the European model."
"This is, unfortunately, another Achilles heel of Bosnia and Herzegovina today."
"Despite some progress which we recognise, organised crime and corruption remain a serious concern in the country and it should address these challenges as a matter of urgency."
"Secondly, on constitutional reform, we all know that it is both necessary and delicate."
"From the Commission side, I can say that we envisage constitutional evolution rather than revolution, which can be done and should be done in respect of the Dayton-Paris Peace Agreement."
"The Commission does not have a blueprint for a certain kind of constitutional reform in Bosnia and Herzegovina but, at the same time, we are certainly stakeholders as the European Union."
"We are all stakeholders in this constitutional reform in the sense that it is absolutely essential that Bosnia and Herzegovina be able to speak with one voice as a future Member State, as a candidate country, with the European Union and in the European Union, and that the country needs to have an effective and functional state structure, institutional structure, which is capable of implementing and enforcing European laws and rules throughout the country."
"This is what its citizens want and what they deserve."
"It is up to the political leaders and citizens of the country to decide what kind of constitution they want, but I can assure you that the Commission is willing to assist a constitutional reform with both legal and constitutional expertise and with financial assistance."
"In a nutshell, Bosnia and Herzegovina today needs urgently to overcome the current political stalemate, to move seriously towards the European Union."
"We cannot do this for them, but we can make the point to the citizens and leaders of the country that we want and expect them to succeed and we support them in this interval."
"The Commission, and I, will therefore continue to work with the presidency, with Javier Solana, with the European Parliament and all other partners and stakeholders to reinforce our engagement so that next year, 2009, could still, after all, be a year for the Western Balkans, and also a year for Bosnia and Herzegovina to make progress towards the European Union."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I should like to say to our fellow Member, who is no longer here, and perhaps also to Mr Belder, that we should be cautious here: we should not localise the terrorist threat to Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"One can also go over the top, but this exaggeration only plays into the hands of the extremists and nationalists."
"I remember that it was precisely this sort of exaggeration that Mr Milosevic took in the same direction as he took everything else."
"We need to bear that in mind."
"The path to the EU requires, among other things, a decisive fight against corruption, against organised crime, for transparency during privatisation and the creation of a common market, including an energy market."
"Only politicians who really want this and act accordingly deserve the trust of their citizens and the trust of the European Union."
"We should give the others a red card now and then."
"That is the only thing they understand there."
"I sometimes see with horror that Bosnia and Herzegovina are choosing, at the crossroads described by Commissioner Rehn, to take the path towards isolation."
"The countries neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina - as Hannes Swoboda said - will most probably reach the target more quickly, which is why it is our job to keep helping Bosnia and Herzegovina to find the right path and to then join the European Union once the conditions have been met."
"The stability of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which lies in the middle of the European Union, is also our stability."
"I sometimes wish that the politicians in Bosnia and Herzegovina had as many sleepless nights as I do when they think of their country."
"Perhaps then they would do a better job."
"I have received one motion for a resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday 23 October 2008."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"I would first of all like to congratulate Mrs Pack for her efforts in carrying out the far from easy task of producing this draft resolution."
"The Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, of the other part, demonstrates the EU's determination to continue to play an important role in the Balkan region, contributing to the region's political, economic and social stability."
"This agreement offers Bosnia and Herzegovina a new prospect for economic development and especially, new opportunities for European integration, providing the region not only with stability but also opening up economic exchanges, marking a major step towards integration in the European market."
"in writing. - I welcome the recent signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"EU enlargement to the Western Balkans is another crucial step in uniting Europe and ensuring that past escalations of violence will not be repeated in the region."
"Therefore, I also urge the authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina to pursue the reforms in a consistent and transparent way to ensure fast integration with the EU."
"I note with concern attempts by some regional politicians to destabilise the country, and call upon the EU to demonstrate its political will and commitment towards Bosnia and Herzegovina to prevent any conflicts based on ethnicity or religion."
"Considering that obtaining a visa for the EU still poses a great problem for the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I call upon the Commission to continue with the dialogue and to do its utmost to implement the road maps with the objective of establishing a visa-free regime with Bosnia and Herzegovina as soon as possible."
"I suggest that the Member States reduce the bureaucratic obstacles to a minimum when applying for a visa and set up a simplified system for granting visas to students and to civil society actors."
"When you mention Bosnia, you are actually talking about another page in the history of the long-suffering Balkan peninsula."
"The war in Bosnia destroyed more than 75% of the country, caused the death of more than 200 000 people and resulted in 1.8 million refugees."
"The signing of the Association and Stabilisation Agreement with the EU has taken place 13 years after the end of the war."
"'The agreement offers an open door to a prosperous future for the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina while, at the same time, it calls on Bosnian politicians to leave the past behind them and move on,' stated Sven Alkalaj, the country's foreign minister, at one time."
"They certainly have something to move on for."
"Just think of Sarajevo, the one-time host of the 1984 Winter Olympic Games, the old Mostar Bridge, included on UNESCO's World Heritage List, the Kravica waterfalls, Sutjesk National Park or the mountains of Jahorina and Bjeslanica, where some of the Olympic competitions took place - so many places inviting you to travel to Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"This is a country, however, which needs, inter alia, to speed up its reform of the state and non-discriminatory access."
"Question Time (Commission)"
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0475/2008)."
"The following questions are addressed to the Commission."
"Part I"
"Subject: Anti-drugs strategy"
"The implementation of the strategic anti-drugs campaign is grounded in two action plans, for two distinct periods, i.e. 2005-2008 and 2009-2012."
"Also foreseen is an 'impact assessment' in 2008, to precede the action plan for 2009-2012, on the basis of a clear timetable."
"The current state of affairs regarding drugs in the EU is disturbing, and the specific means chosen to fight the problem need to be extremely rigorous, firm, persistent and consistent."
"What is the Commission's diagnosis, on the basis of the reports for 2005, 2006 and 2007, of the current situation, and what has been the level of execution of actions between 2005 and the present?"
"What is the state of play as regards the impact assessment which is to be concluded in 2008?"
"What is the Commission's forecast for the period 2009-2013, especially concerning new instruments for combat and cooperation in police and legal terms, and also the participation of civil society?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, it is clear that nobody can be complacent about the issue of drugs."
"The Commission adopted on 18 September 2008 a proposal for a European Union Drugs Action Plan 2009-2012, and a report on the final evaluation of the EU Drugs Action Plan 2005-2008 was annexed."
"This is the impact assessment which was mentioned in the question."
"Both documents were made available to Parliament on that date."
"The evaluation was conducted by the European Commission in the first half of 2008 in line with Action 45.3 of the subsequent Action Plan."
"The evaluation provided important input for the new Action Plan."
"Findings include the following:"
"Regarding the implementation of the new EU Drugs Action Plan, the conclusion can be drawn that progress has been made on nearly all specific objectives and actions with varying degrees of success."
"The EU Drugs Action Plan is adequately reflected in the national policies of the Member States and has been translated into national policy and/or these objectives were already reflected in existing documents."
"Member States report that the Action Plan reflects the main policy fields at national level."
"The evaluation shows that the Action Plan supports a process of convergence between Member States' drug policies, which the Commission considers quite important."
"Regarding the drug situation, there has not been a significant reduction in the prevalence of drug use but the use of some of the most prevalent drugs seems to have stabilised and/or fallen slightly."
"The use of cocaine is showing an upward trend in some Member States."
"The long-term EU trend in the prevalence of drug-related infectious diseases, especially HIV and AIDS infections, is that these have been reduced in recent years, as have drug-related deaths."
"New trends in drug use, especially poly-drug use, have emerged in recent years."
"The numbers and size of cocaine seizures are rising while for herbal cannabis, heroin, ecstasy and amphetamines, seizures appear to be stabilising."
"Prices for illicit substances in general have fallen, while purity levels seem to be fairly stable."
"Regarding the impact of the Action Plan on the drug situation, the impact assessment to which the honourable Member refers is, I presume, the evaluation report regarding implementation."
"The on-going reduction in drug-related infectious diseases and drug-related deaths, on the one hand, and the EU-wide implementation of harm-reduction measures, on the other, suggest a clear correlation with the Action Plans, even though such a link is notoriously hard to prove beyond any reasonable doubt."
"Some Member States have achieved dramatic reductions in drug-related health harm after the introduction of harm-reduction measures."
"Similar conclusions can be drawn in the fields of supply reduction and European coordination and cooperation in anti-drugs law enforcement."
"(PT) Thank you, Madam President. I must particularly thank the Commission representative, mainly for having answered my question, but also for the quality of the answer."
"I have very carefully read the Commission documents."
"Firstly, I must say that we agree with the strategy and the Action Plan which primarily addresses supply and then demand."
"It is on supply that I should like to give my opinion."
"In terms of supply, we are extremely concerned about the abundance of cocaine and also about the abundance of synthetic products."
"In addition, we are extremely concerned about the local disputes occurring between gangs which, in some Member States, are fighting for control of the drugs market."
"I would ask you to clarify for me, as far as possible, what specific actions are proposed with regard to cooperation between the Member States and between the police and judicial authorities of the Member States, on the one hand, and between the Member States and the producing countries, in particular, the cocaine-producing countries, on the other."
"This is an area of the strategy that we are very concerned about and on which we should like to hear concrete answers from the Commission."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, animal- and public-health rules applying to the export of poultry meat from China ensure an equivalent level of protection to those of the EU."
"These import rules guarantee that all imported products fulfil the same high standards as products from the EU Member States, not only with respect to hygiene and all aspects of consumer safety but also regarding animal health status."
"The principle according to which food must be safe, irrespective of its origin, is at the core of the EU approach."
"The official control system in China was verified on the spot by three Commission inspections."
"The outcome was published on the website of DG SANCO."
"The inspections have shown that the competent authorities, in particular in Shandong Province, are sufficiently well structured to guarantee compliance with Community legislation as regards heat-treated poultry meat products."
"Furthermore, these inspection missions have also verified that the competent authorities are capable of enforcing the Community's import requirements."
"As a result of this exercise, the Chinese authorities have demonstrated to the Commission services that they can certify that consignments of heat-treated poultry meat products being exported to the European Union were produced in accordance with Community requirements and come only from Shandong Province."
"All approved plants in the Community list of establishments from which imports of heat-treated poultry meat is authorised are located in Shandong Province."
"This was verified by the three fact-finding missions on the spot: one in 2004; two in 2006."
"According to the WTO agreement on sanitary and phytosanitary measures, any third country may request authorisation for export for the totality or part of its territory to the Commission, which is considered and evaluated according to the relevant Community requirements."
"If the guarantees given by a third country are deemed satisfactory and are effectively verified, such requests from third countries are accepted and authorisation for export granted."
"Any risk of distortion of competition towards EU poultry producers is prevented by the fact that the measures in place provide for sufficient guarantees that the heat-treated poultry meat products from certain regions are compliant with the level of protection that the EU deems necessary."
"Informed choice by consumers would be the answer to competitive pressure."
"The Chinese authorities expressed interest in the approval by the Commission of the imports of heat-treated poultry meat from Jilin Province."
"To get this approval, the Chinese authorities will have to guarantee that the sanitary conditions applied to the production of heat-treated poultry meat in Jilin Province meets EC requirements, and the Commission will verify these guarantees by on-the-spot inspections."
"(HU) Thank you very much, Commissioner, for your reply."
"The problem is that this year, there were supposed to be six inspections conducted in China, and of these not one has been carried out to date."
"Now, in October, there was supposed to be an inspection of poultry, but this did not take place either, because the Chinese had no time for it."
"My question is, if we have been unable to carry out a single one of the six scheduled for this year, and yet we have planned 15 for next year, how will these 15 be carried out?"
"If the Chinese do not cooperate with their European trading partner, then why are we opening our gates to imports from China, and why are we ruining European poultry breeders?"
"If China does not cooperate, then we need not open our gates to their imports - that is my opinion. Thank you very much."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - First of all, I want to say that China is willing to cooperate, and we have no indications that China is not willing to cooperate."
"Secondly, as regards the inspections and missions, these missions have been considered satisfactory so far."
"Whenever there are doubts or questions, we will have new missions."
"The time between the last missions and this year was due to administrative activities in China between two ministries."
"However - at least on the Commission side - we cannot say that there is any reluctance to cooperate with us concerning standards and the quality of the products."
"If there are indications, the Commission is ready to organise new missions."
"So far, these have not been considered necessary."
"Commissioner, I hear what you say but it does have echoes of the Brazilian beef controversy when, for months, the Commission stood where you stand today and assured us that all was well, and then was finally driven to the position of having to impose a ban."
"You have said that this meat will be subjected to similar tests."
"Can you say, without reservation, that every piece of meat imported will be equally subjected to the same rigorous veterinary tests as are required of our own producers?"
"Will the same ratio of production be tested, and how will you know if the product is truly from Shandong Province?"
"Is it enough if it is merely processed there?"
"Those are the issues that give rise to resentment by our producers, that they are subjected to all sorts of requirements, including the phasing-out of cages."
"Will that happen in China at the same rate?"
"They believe themselves undercut by cheap imports."
"(PT) Many thanks, Madam President, I will be brief."
"My question is along similar lines to that of the previous Member."
"I agree that there has recently been an effort to inspect and monitor products and it is essential that this inspection and monitoring effort continues."
"However, surely there cannot be any relaxation of the rules?"
"Rather there should be a reinforcement, with precise and clear rules being set by the European Union which should apply throughout China, and not just in some of the provinces, as the Member has just mentioned. I would appreciate clarification on this."
"Many thanks, Commissioner."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - So far, all products produced in this province have been labelled."
"The authorities in this province are responsible for quality and also rules of origin."
"Of course, there is always the question that not every chicken can be checked - this is also the case in the European Union."
"But what the Commission can do in its inspections - and I was told that the next inspection will take place next year, so it has already been planned - is to verify that the administrative systems are capable of controlling how this poultry is produced and what the level of animal health protection is."
"So far, the answers have been found to be satisfactory."
"Of course, there will be a continuous checking of facts, but these are the World Trade Organisation's rules, and we always have benefited from openness."
"Quality is important; standards are important."
"So far, we are convinced that the quality of poultry products from China is satisfactory, and the next province is, as I have already mentioned, also willing to come."
"Subject: Implementation of the European Social Fund in the Member States"
"The European Social Fund (ESF), as one of the EU's Structural Funds, was set up to reduce differences in prosperity and living standards across EU Member States and regions, with the aim of promoting employment as well as economic and social cohesion."
"Over the period 2007-2013, some €75 billion will be distributed to the EU Member States and regions to achieve its goals."
"Member States finance a number of different programmes, and in this regard it is important to know how the Member States, especially the new ones, are using the available funding and what results have been achieved in raising living standards and promoting employment."
"Is the Commission planning to publish a communication on the implementation of the ESF in the Member States and if so, when can we expect such a communication?"
"If the Commission plans to release such a communication, can we expect to see both qualitative and quantitative analyses of the use of the ESF funds?"
"It is of crucial importance to know not only how much money was spent on implementing various programmes but to ensure that the EU citizens enjoy tangible and sustainable benefits as well."
"If the Commission is not planning such a communication, why is this, and how can the Commission then guarantee transparent and efficient use of the ESF?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - The Commission recalls that Article 146 of the EC Treaty establishes the European Social Fund in order to improve employment opportunities for workers in the internal market and thereby to contribute to raising the standard of living."
"The Social Fund also pursues actions leading to the strengthening of its economic and social cohesion."
"The Commission agrees with the honourable Member on the importance of reporting on the concrete benefits of the European Social Fund."
"In this context, the Commission intends to present a series of thematic reports on the European Social Fund's support and activities, the beneficiaries reached and the results achieved."
"The first set of reports should be available in early 2009."
"In addition, Article 159 of the EC Treaty provides that the Commission shall submit a report to the European Parliament, the Council, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions every three years on progress made towards achieving economic and social cohesion."
"The last Cohesion Report was published in 2007 and paid particular attention to the issue of investment in people."
"The next Cohesion Report will be presented in 2010."
"In addition, the Commission will publish a so-called 'Progress Report' in the intervening years."
"I am very satisfied with your very precise and concrete answer, so thank you very much indeed."
"I do appreciate that the Commission considers that the question I raised is important, not only to parliamentarians, but to the Commission as well."
"I believe, however, that this is the most important to our people."
"They have to know about the transparency of use of these funds and the efficiency of use of these funds."
"I will, therefore, be waiting for the report in early 2009."
"Could you please advise me which DG will prepare this report in 2009?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - It is DG Employment, under my good colleague Mr Špidla, that is responsible for these reports."
"The numbers are interesting and we give training to nine million people in Europe every year, so the benefits are there."
"(SK) Expenditure related to construction or reconstruction can be controlled."
"In projects financed from the European Social Fund, the target groups obtain know-how, new skills and expertise and therefore the balance sheet is dependent on the subjective views of officials. The insolvency of NGOs and independent bodies caused by the bureaucratic practices of the Member States often prevents the recipients of funding from the European Social Fund from getting involved in other activities within the framework of this programme."
"What instruments does the Commission have in its hands for ensuring that Member States do not erect excessive administrative obstacles when reimbursing the costs associated with projects financed from the European Social Fund?"
"Could I ask the Commissioner if he might, in these times when recession is snapping at our heels, look at the possibility of the Social Fund cooperating with local development partnership boards where these exist in Member States like the Republic of Ireland, but in other Member States as well?"
"In that regard, he might have discussions with the OECD, which has carried out a study of the effectiveness of local development in promoting training, education, micro-job creation and an improved environment for people who find themselves unemployed."
"I do not expect the Commissioner to be able to answer all of that today, but what I am really asking is that he would look at this possibility and perhaps consult with the OECD to see how the Social Fund and social partnership and local development partnerships might work hand in hand to improve the community training and employment needs of our citizens, particularly in urban areas."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Firstly, about bureaucracy and the administrative burden: they exist, no doubt."
"As I said, my colleague Mr Špidla is responsible for spending the money, and I am responsible for discharge: ensuring that no money is wasted."
"This is always a dilemma."
"We try to be as flexible as possible but, at the same time, the benefits and possible outcomes are also carefully audited by national authorities, by paying agencies and probably by the ministry responsible."
"This also includes the European Court of Auditors and our DG, so there are different layers of control as well."
"The result is assessed by large public participation, and projects must be seen, so now we have an obligation to have everything published on the website about the financing so that everyone can follow it."
"The Social Fund, however, is mainly financing training."
"In response to the next question: there is cooperation between different sources of financing structural funds, including the Social Fund and regional development funds and, in my country at least, they are in very close cooperation with each other."
"This cooperation depends on national authorities."
"We can only support good cooperation and the efficient use of money."
"Part II"
"Subject: Community co-financed projects and Siemens' slush funds"
"The Greek and German judicial authorities are continuing to investigate the case of the Siemens' slush funds, which were used by the firm to bribe political parties and persons in authority in order to obtain major public sector works and supply contracts."
"The German courts have already convicted a former senior executive of the company, who has admitted that slush funds also existed in Greece."
"Given that these bribes may well relate to Community co-funded projects, will the Commission say whether OLAF or any other of its services is investigating the legality of the award procedures and implementation of such projects?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - These issues are always very complicated and serious."
"The European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) is competent to investigate, where EU funds are involved, when there are sufficiently serious suspicions of fraud or irregularity having been committed against the financial interests of the European Union."
"In cases where projects are co-funded by EU funds - such as is the situation with structural funds - the Member States and the Commission share the responsibilities in the management of these funds."
"In this regard, it is the Member States that are primarily responsible for distribution of the expenditure and the necessary controls."
"Moreover, resulting from such controls and investigations and the communication of possible cases of fraud or irregularity to OLAF, the honourable Member may be aware that there are regulatory arrangements in place under Regulation (EC) No 1681/94, which provides that the Member States shall report to the Commission, at the appropriate stage, the details of their investigation into such possible cases of fraud or irregularity."
"Moreover, whenever it is deemed appropriate, OLAF liaises closely with the competent national authorities on progress in such matters."
"In the matters referred to by the honourable Member, the Commission has been informed by OLAF that it is aware of on-going cases in Germany and Greece but that, until now, OLAF's direct assistance in matters involving Siemens in Germany and/or Greece in respect of structural funds has not been requested by the judicial authorities of either Member State."
"In addition, the Commission would refer to the reply already given to the honourable Member's written question, which stipulated that, according to Article 3 of Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96, economic operators are not being controlled by both the Commission and Member States' authorities at the same time and on the basis of the same facts, according to Community sector regulations or national legislation."
"Besides, the Commission may, at any moment, start an infringement procedure against the Member States, on the basis of Article 226 of the EC Treaty, if there are sufficient elements indicating an infringement of Community public procurement law."
"In respect of the particular matters referred to by the honourable Member, the Commission has no such elements that could justify the opening of an infringement procedure."
"(EL) Commissioner, that is precisely what I am asking you."
"You know full well that Siemens, which is a large and historic company, has obtained contracts worth several million euros from co-funded programmes."
"It is based in Germany and has obtained contracts in Greece and elsewhere."
"Accusations and admissions have been made of its using bribery and corruption."
"How can you be so sure that it did not use the same methods and the same slush funds for co-funded programmes?"
"Commissioner, how long do you intend to hide behind the investigations being carried out in Germany and Greece?"
"You can act on your own initiative."
"Do you intend, as the competent Commissioner, to ask OLAF to investigate the matter or do you intend to do nothing, because you are afraid of the colossus called Siemens?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - No, I am not afraid of Siemens and I will happily send OLAF to investigate these cases, but of course there is a clear legal framework in which we can operate and can go to investigate."
"We are following the situation, as I said, and we can urge Member States and we can demand that they inform us (they have, anyway, the obligation to inform us) and move actively."
"But there must, at present, be an indication and request from Member States for OLAF assistance."
"So far this has not been the case, but we will follow the situation."
"We have clear and sometimes very sensitive divisions of responsibilities and obligations between Member States and Community bodies."
"This is particularly the case where the investigation rules are very precisely defined."
"As the author of Question 44, Mr Heaton-Harris, is not present, that question falls."
"Subject: Administrative affairs and the Lisbon Treaty"
"Could the Commission detail the changes to the EU competences held by DG Admin that the Lisbon Treaty would have brought in?"
"Does the Commission have any plans to introduce any of those reforms?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - The Lisbon Treaty contains three main provisions of the amended Treaty on the functioning of the European Union which deal with administrative affairs: Article 197 on administrative cooperation, Article 298 on an open, efficient and independent European administration and Article 336 on the Staff Regulations."
"Article 197 provides for the Union to take measures, excluding any harmonisation, to support the efforts of Member States to improve their capacity to implement Union law."
"Article 336 is amended to change the procedure for adopting the Institutions' Staff Regulations to ordinary legislative procedure - that means normal codecision - currently, the Council acts by qualified majority vote on a proposal from the Commission, after consulting the other institution."
"The new Article 298 requires the adoption of regulations ensuring an 'open, efficient and independent European administration', which is what we are already trying to do without waiting for the final entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty."
"Can I thank the Commissioner for his very clear answer and congratulate him on implementing an open and efficient way of running the Commission, in spite of the fact that the Lisbon Treaty will never see the light of day?"
"But, having said that, does the Commission have any plans to introduce any of those reforms which may not need the Lisbon Treaty to be enforced - for example, on improving the capacity to implement EU law on the Staff Regulations?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - I must say, honourable Member, that we are trying to improve the work of the administration every day, and at this moment I am having intensive debates with our staff unions about the regulations concerning parliamentary assistants, which is also part of the Staff Regulations."
"This definitely brings more transparency and more clarity to this - so far - problematic field."
"So we are very happy that we have opened many websites which tremendously improve the transparency of our activities."
"So this work is on-going."
"Concerning the Staff Regulations - which is a solid document - this is a huge and complicated project if we really aim to make changes."
"We will probably discuss with Parliament possible changes during next term, but small reforms are on-going."
"Internally we have just changed the rules on the so-called 'career development reviews'."
"So there are on-going changes every day, practically."
"(DE) Commissioner, you referred to the fact that the Commission must, and will, make permanent changes and improvements to its Staff Regulations."
"One development over recent years which is a real cause for concern is that a great deal - in fact more and more - is being outsourced to agencies and other administrative units."
"Does this not breach the principle of a uniform administration, especially the uniformity of political control of the administration?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - I must first say that the Commission has no indications that there are more cases of fraud than in other organisations."
"The Commission points out that the British House of Lords concluded in a special report that there was no evidence of widespread corruption within the Commission and that the level of fraud against the EU budget is no higher than in comparable public spending programmes, including in Great Britain."
"On average, OLAF opens around 40 internal investigations per year involving officials from all Institutions."
"In around half of these cases it concludes there is a need for follow-up, which can be administrative, disciplinary, judicial, financial or even legislative or a combination of several of these."
"The Commission's policy of zero tolerance and a formal obligation for officials to report serious wrongdoings without delay contributes to increased vigilance towards possible fraud or corruption."
"It may also lead to the opening of a significant number of investigations in which the initial suspicions ultimately prove to be groundless."
"As concerns the Commission, 15 members of staff were subject to disciplinary measures in 2007, compared to an average of five staff members between 2004 and 2006."
"In 2007, sanctions were imposed in seven cases for a variety of breaches, including for external activities not in accordance with the dignity of the function, unauthorised absences and financial irregularities."
"The staff rules provide a well-developed disciplinary system, with possible sanctions ranging from a simple warning to downgrading and, in the most serious cases, dismissal with or without reduction of pension rights."
"In addition, a member of staff may be held personally financially liable for the damage incurred by his or her serious personal misconduct."
"(PL) Madam President, Commissioner, you did not need to take such a defensive position."
"The present Commission can clearly be proud that compared with Mr Santer's Commission, it is on a par with St Francis."
"However, there is another point I would like to make, and that is to ask whether any European Union administrative staff have been arrested and prosecuted, rather than simply dismissed from their jobs."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - As I said, we have some cases running but so far we have not completed any criminal cases during the last six years."
"No European Commission official has been convicted."
"We have some on-going cases but these are all in national judiciaries."
"In addition, since 2002, the Commission has lifted immunity."
"If an official is to be investigated, the Commission makes the decision to lift immunity."
"We have lifted immunity - for criminal cases in courts - from 35 people, and so far half of them have been acquitted and the cases have been closed."
"Some cases are still running and there have been no criminal convictions yet."
"This is the situation regarding criminal cases against Commission officials."
"We are quite convinced that there will also be some convictions, but in some national judiciaries it takes a very long time."
"We are definitely cooperating with all these investigations."
"(DE) Commissioner, you just referred to the fact that, as an offence punishable through the courts, corruption too has to be followed up and prosecuted by the national judiciaries."
"Are most of these cases - and I assume they are - Belgian cases or are officials in other Member States being prosecuted for corruption?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Most, maybe all, the cases are in the Belgian courts, because the officials are located in Belgium."
"Therefore most of the cases are in Belgium - and Luxembourg as well."
"As they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together:"
"Subject: CCCTB impact assessment"
"In his address to the ECON Committee in June of this year, Commissioner Kovacs referred to a CCCTB impact assessment, which he described as 'crucial' for his proposed legislative proposal."
"Can the Commission give us more details about this impact assessment and confirm that if it proves unfavourable to the CCCTB proposal the Commission will shelve the plans for such a legislative proposal?"
"Subject: CCCTB"
"What is the current situation with regard to the deliberations on the introduction of a common consolidated tax base and, in light of the concerns expressed by the Irish electorate in the Lisbon vote on this matter, has the Commission modified its approach in any way?"
"Member of the Commission. - An impact assessment of the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB) is currently being carried out."
"This assessment will cover a number of possible options for an EU-level reform of the corporate income tax system."
"In accordance with the current practice of the Commission, a proposal of this nature has to be accompanied by an impact assessment drafted in compliance with the key analytical steps laid down in the Impact Assessment Guidelines."
"The key analytical steps are to identify the problem, to define the objectives, to develop main policy options, to analyse their impacts, to compare the options and to outline policy monitoring and evaluation."
"The assessment will provide a description and evidence of the existing cross-border company tax obstacles on the internal market, and will define the objectives to be achieved by the reform."
"A number of alternative policy options, including the CCCTB, that could address the obstacles will be analysed and their respective economic, environmental and social impacts assessed."
"As regards the most relevant types of impacts of the various policy options, the assessment will aim to assess: (a) the economy-wide effects of the alternative tax reforms on the competitiveness of the EU, on growth of the EU economy and welfare; (b) their respective effects on companies' compliance costs; and (c), notably, their respective impacts on national corporate tax bases and on tax administration costs."
"Significant progress has been achieved in preparing the impact assessment but the work is not yet completed."
"Once the impact assessment is finalised, and the different options assessed, the Commission will draw the necessary conclusions."
"The fact that the Commission carries out an impact assessment does not necessarily mean that a proposal will follow."
"To say that I am disappointed in the answer is to put it mildly: that is exactly what you told us last June."
"You told us that we would have this in September."
"I have to say that there are very strong rumours that you have received an interim report on CCCTB."
"You have not officially accepted it, but I gather that this report is not favourable towards the idea of CCCTB and the reason we cannot see it is because you have not formally accepted it."
"I would like to ask you if that is the case, because it is extremely unfair since this is an issue that has been debated for some considerable time now."
"There is a lot of very strong feeling on both sides on it, and I believe that you should show us that report, or interim report, so that we can have a look at it to see where exactly that report stands on this very, very important issue."
"I would strongly ask you to do that."
"I think it is wrong if you have received an interim report and you are not showing it to us because it does not show what the Commission wants on this issue."
"I want to echo Mr Ryan's comments."
"The specific question that was asked was: if the assessment proves unfavourable, will you shelve the plans for implementing CCCTB?"
"And that question was not answered."
"Also, there have been a number of other assessments - not, obviously, carried out by the Commission - which have shown that, in many ways, CCCTB would collapse under its own weight."
"But, given that you have not answered the question that was asked, I want to put one or two others to you."
"Would you not agree that it is not simplification?"
"At present, we have 27 tax bases."
"With CCCTB, we would end up with 28."
"If it were to operate, would you not agree that it would damage Europe's capacity to attract direct foreign investment, in that tax payable by multinationals in one country would no longer be determined by the law of that state but by reference to a complicated formula which can only be computed in retrospect?"
"So, in other words, no policy certainty, and that will scare foreign direct investment like nothing else."
"I just want your view on that, please, Commissioner."
"Member of the Commission. - Yes, it is true that we have been aiming to make a proposal in the autumn of this year, but you have to understand that, in a project as ambitious as the CCCTB, it is not possible to predict exactly when we will be ready to make the proposal, as the timing of the proposal depends on the finalisation of the impact assessments and its evolution by the Commission."
"As far as the correlation between the Irish referendum on the Lisbon Treaty and the CCCTB is concerned, I want to emphasise that the Commission is taking a measured approach based on wide consultation and detailed study of all aspects of the CCCTB."
"The Commission is aware of the issues raised by the electorate during the referendum in Ireland relating to the Lisbon Treaty."
"However, I would point out that the provisions of the Lisbon Treaty do not have any direct influence on the process whereby Member States would eventually decide on any proposal on a possible Commission proposal for CCCTB."
"(Interjection from the floor by Eoin Ryan)"
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, may I take the liberty of answering Mr Ryan's comments very briefly?"
"I just want to tell you that you will soon receive a full, legally based answer from the Head of my Cabinet Office."
"Then you will understand our position."
"Concerning the second issue, customs cooperation is an important part of the EU-China strategic partnership."
"The EC-China Agreement on Customs Cooperation and Mutual Administrative Assistance with China provides the legal basis for this cooperation."
"The EC-China Joint Customs Cooperation Committee meets once a year in order to manage and oversee the implementation of the Agreement."
"Under the Customs Cooperation Agreement, the EC and China are developing substantial interaction in key customs areas, organised clearly to reflect the interest of the European Community."
"The problem of counterfeiting is our key priority in relation to China, which is the number one source of fakes entering the EU external borders."
"During my visits to Beijing in January and April 2008, I agreed with my Chinese counterparts to develop an ambitious Action Plan for IPR enforcement with concrete objectives and measures to be adopted by the EU-China Summit in December."
"It should include, among other things, an information exchange system on IPR risks, an exchange programme of operational officials, and collaboration on the development of partnerships with business communities in China and the European Union."
"Securing the supply chain is another essential aspect of EC-China customs cooperation."
"The joint pilot project on Safe and Secure Trade Lane has been running since November 2007 with the participation of three ports, Shenzhen in China, Rotterdam in the Netherlands and Felixstowe in the United Kingdom."
"This project aims at strengthening security while facilitating trade between the EC and China through the use of modern technology and the exchange of advance information."
"At the same time, it will help to better target the traffic in illicit goods."
"Furthermore, the pilot project aims at preparing the ground for a future agreement on mutual recognition of security measures and the Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) and its Chinese opposite number."
"It involves cooperation in such important fields as alignment of the Chinese security legislation, information exchange and risk analysis."
"China has, in the meantime, adopted and implemented, as of 1 April 2008, its own AEO legislation that appears very similar to the European Community concept."
"The EC and China are also enhancing cooperation in other important areas."
"An EU-China agreement on coordinated controls of trade in drug precursors is expected to be signed at the upcoming EU-China Summit that will allow us to combat trade in illicit drugs more effectively."
"We agreed to further enhance our cooperation to fight fraud through the established mutual assistance mechanism."
"The European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) has posted one of its agents in China in order to support the anti-contraband and anti-counterfeit activities of the office, in particular, in relation to cigarette smuggling."
"The EU is ready to continue to assist China in customs capacity building, including through the application of the recently published customs blueprints."
"While we have made considerable progress in enhancing customs cooperation with China, further steps need to be taken, particularly with regard to combating counterfeiting and piracy."
"Proper implementation of the above-mentioned initiatives, in particular the proposed IPR enforcement action plan, will determine the level of effectiveness of this cooperation."
"(EL) Thank you, Commissioner, for your reply."
"The trade deficit between the EU and China totalled EUR 160 million in 2007 to the detriment of the European Union."
"To a large degree, this deficit is the outcome of incomplete customs cooperation between the EU and China."
"Apart from the language of numbers, we are also very interested - as is only reasonable - in public health, the protection of European consumers and, of course, the competitiveness of European products."
"I believe that these controls will be stepped up in the near future so that we can protect the public interests to which I referred."
"Member of the Commission. - I fully agree with your concern - in my view, counterfeiting is much more than a financial problem."
"First of all, it is a legal issue: the violation of intellectual property right."
"Second, it is a financial or economic problem as it undermines the revenue of the Member States and it also undermines the profit of the manufacturing company of the original products and it can even result in the loss of jobs in our Member States."
"But third - and this is my real concern - it is a new threat to the safety and to the health - and even to the life - of our citizens, so, as you very clearly emphasised, it is an issue of consumer protection."
"When I first got the information that EU customs seized some consignments of medicines, pharmaceuticals, against cardiovascular diseases, and the capsules contained brick powder and yellow paint, I was really shocked."
"So it is much more than a financial or legal issue."
"It is a problem of the safety of our citizens and we have got to do our best."
"May I say that I am now more optimistic: in April, I met my new counterpart, the new minister responsible for customs in China."
"Even with my former counterpart, I felt some positive changes in the Chinese style, the way they negotiated."
"Since 2005, it has become more and more concrete, more and more to the point and China has made some steps."
"For instance, they even changed the legislation concerning combating counterfeiting."
"But, you are right that it is still not working in an optimum manner."
"That was the reason why we initiated an action programme and I made it very clear to my new partner that what we expect from China is concrete measures and concrete results in the market and I think that he understood the message."
"One or two more reasons about why I am optimistic: first, China, which is an emerging power, which is playing a more and more important role in the world economy and world politics, I think simply cannot afford to be related, to be judged as the number one source of fake products."
"Second, China is more and more a target country."
"Quite recently we heard about Chinese fake milk powder which resulted in the death of some Chinese children."
"So they are not only a country of origin, but they are also a target country, a target of counterfeiters."
"As a member of the European Parliament's Delegation for relations with the People's Republic of China, I have noted with interest your response."
"Has there been any improvement at all in China's appalling record on counterfeiting or the stealing of intellectual property since it joined the WTO, and what pressures are being put on China to improve in this area?"
"You mentioned the EC-China Joint Customs Committee."
"Who is on it from the EC side, and what are the qualifications to become a member?"
"My final point: does this joint committee have terms of reference to handle trade of various waste products from Europe to China for dumping?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Madam President, in keeping with the commitment made in Article 22 of Regulation No 300 of 2008 on common rules in the field of civil aviation security and repealing the previous regulation, in December of this year, the Commission will present a report on the financing of the costs associated with security measures in European airports."
"In light of the situation, the Commission is reviewing the results of the consultation with the interested parties and with the Member States in order to determine the content of a new legislative proposal on this matter."
"The Commission will present its conclusions in the report in question and, to address some of the questions raised during the consultations, the Commission may also be called on to take further action on this subject."
"Madam President, I would like more information."
"What exactly does the Commission intend to do to assist the airports affected by this cost?"
"There are five airports in my constituency of Ireland North West and they find it very difficult to survive economically due to the pressure exerted on them."
"These include two international airports, Shannon Airport and Ireland West Airport, along with three other regional airports."
"What can the Commission do to assist the survival of those airports and allow them to function economically?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Mr Ó Neachtain, I am afraid that I cannot give you an immediate, concrete response as you would like."
"However, the Commission is reviewing the results of a consultation it held in order to examine the results and thus decide if, how, to what extent, with regard to Member States, if it is up to the Member States alone, we need to finish reviewing the consultations."
"As soon as we have finished reviewing the consultations, if you would like, I will inform you straight away, and in any case we will be presenting our report on this whole sector before the end of the year, as I said earlier."
"It is only a matter of waiting a few weeks for our officials' final assessment of all the consultations."
"My office and my staff are available to provide you with all the necessary information to enable you to report to your electorate."
"(EL) Commissioner, bearing in mind what you have just said, will it be possible to evaluate the security requirements of each Member State and of regional airports - because that was the question - where there is a large number of them, such as on the Greek islands and in Italy, Spain and Portugal?"
"You obviously know how many islands and how many such areas there are; as such, will funding from your overall budget be proportionate and differentiated?"
"(DE) We know that the costs are obviously passed on to passengers."
"That is why we also need to differentiate."
"There is not that big a difference nowadays between using the train, for example, be it the TGV or some other high-speed railway, or an aeroplane."
"If you look at the security precautions at train stations and in airports, there is perhaps room for harmonisation here."
"Do you think it possible to introduce identical legal provisions here?"
"Commissioner..."
"(Interjection from the floor by Jim Higgins)"
"I am very sorry, Mr Higgins, I have taken two supplementary questions, which is all I can take, and we have dealt with it as appropriately as we can."
"(Interjection from the floor by Jim Higgins)"
"The Rules provide for two supplementary questions."
"I am sorry but I cannot get into a discussion with you."
"It is unfair to those who have questions waiting to be heard."
"Madam President, I would like to say to those Members who cannot, due to the rules of procedure, receive answers to the questions they would like to ask, that my offices are available to provide any information they may require that it is in our power to give in response to their queries."
"As regards the question from Mr Mavrommatis - in essence he asked whether the Member States can adopt more stringent security measures than those imposed by Regulation No 300 of 2008 - the Member States can, of course, choose to apply more rigorous measures than those set out in the regulatory framework."
"These more rigorous measures may, however, have repercussions for the internal aviation market insofar as they often vary from one Member State to another."
"In the report that will, I assure you, be published very soon, the Commission will consider whether these more rigorous measures distort competition between airlines and airports."
"As regards the issue of island airports, the Commission is also reviewing this issue in the context of the answers that have been given."
"Island airports are, of course, included in the study, which concerns the general airport system."
"You know how much the Commission values regions, such as the islands of your own country of origin, but also in countries that I myself am more familiar with, that can only be reached by plane or boat."
"The Commission therefore gives much consideration to these links."
"As far as Mr Rübig's question is concerned, the Commission is reviewing the various options."
"It is possible to use public funds, which is one of the possible solutions for financing the costs of aviation security."
"Therefore it has not been said that ticket prices should be raised."
"Other forms of financing could also be used."
"However, to be honest and to give an answer that is more than just a formal response, I would like to emphasise that the Commission is examining carefully all the information gathered and, as soon as it has all been examined, reviewed and balanced, we will try to draw up a proposal that is balanced and is in keeping with the interests of European citizens."
"Mr Rübig, I would say the same thing to you that I said to the other honourable Members, that my offices are always available to all Members for any clarifications and to arrange any meetings you would like to have with me on questions relating to the transport sector."
"Subject: High quality transport and small island regions of the European Union"
"What steps will the Commission take to ensure that the European Union has sustainable and high quality transport systems and to protect the rights of its citizens and their safety?"
"How will it contribute towards establishing a reliable system of transportation (boat-aeroplane-helicopter) which covers the small island regions of the European Union?"
"Madam President, this is, in some ways, a continuation of the question asked by Mr Mavrommatis."
"In order to guarantee sustainable, high quality transport in Europe and to protect the rights of citizens and their safety, we are proposing an appropriate legal and regulatory framework to the European Parliament and to the Council and, once the legislators have adopted it, we will ensure that it is implemented."
"Allow me to give three examples: passenger rights, sustainable transport and passenger safety."
"You also asked me to be more specific about how these efforts will contribute towards establishing a reliable system of transport by boat, aeroplane or helicopter for the small island regions of the European Union."
"The fundamental challenge in this proposal is the funding. Thus, we return to the subject of the previous question."
"Honourable Members - I could almost say fellow Members, since I am always aware of having been an MEP myself for many years - we must be clear on this point."
"It is up to the Member States and regional authorities to decide on the quantity and quality of connections within the small island regions and between these regions and the continent."
"Our role, the role of the Commission, is secondary and consists of two very distinct tasks."
"On the one hand, the Commission implements the European cohesion policy, which supports the development of regions with geographic and natural disadvantages."
"Within the framework of the cohesion policy, the Community can provide cofinancing to improve the accessibility of the island regions."
"On the other hand, the Commission has a duty to ensure that the financial support awarded to transport providers does not distort competition on the internal market, against the common interest."
"This safeguard is guaranteed by Community legislation on the internal transport market."
"State aid for quality transport to and within the island regions cannot be authorised by the Commission, in particular in the form of compensation for a public service obligation."
"Legislation governing the internal market in the maritime and air transport sector leaves Member States ample scope to choose how to organise the public transport services that link the islands to the continent and to one another, provided that all potential transport providers have equal opportunity to provide the public service in question."
"Commissioner Tajani, since you have spoken in Italian I am tempted to do so myself, but I will hold back and speak in Greek instead."
"(EL) Commissioner, my question did not relate so much to the question of funding, which my honourable friend Mr Mavrommatis has covered; it related to three specific points to which you referred and on which I wish to comment specifically."
"The first is the standard of transport, which is a very important matter."
"The second is the special case of the small islands; as you know, my country has an abundance of very small islands which are a special case, and the third point is the state of mind of the residents of these small islands, who feel a bit isolated, in this particular instance, from the rest of Greece and from Europe in general when we fail to attach particular importance to their problems, especially in terms of transportation."
"My question is therefore a political question which goes beyond financing: do you believe that the European Union should also play a political role here?"
"I would like to thank the honourable Member for having replied to me in my own language."
"I am tempted myself to reply to you in ancient Greek, having studied it for many years - my mother taught ancient Greek for many years as well, but perhaps I would make some mistakes and risk not being understood by you."
"Thank you all the same for the gesture."
"Mr Botopoulos, I said this myself when I was a member of parliament, having been elected in a constituency that also included many small islands, and so I am well aware of the serious connection problems they face, far from terra firma, particularly during the winter."
"Since many of these islands are tourist destinations, during the summer there are boats transporting visitors and also the people who live on those islands, who therefore do not have difficulties for two or three months (June, July and August)."
"The problems start in September, and then there is a real risk of feeling isolated."
"I believe that the European Commission, not being able to decide directly on the matter - I mentioned this in my speech, we are always mindful of the principle of subsidiarity - can provide support, for example, by cofinancing certain transport systems, without distorting the internal market, to enable these citizens, who are European citizens and who have the same rights to mobility as those living in big cities or on the mainland, specifically to have the right to travel and to receive deliveries, because the issue also concerns the supply of food, as well as water for some islands."
"Honourable Member, I share your concern and support it."
"The European Commission, with its sights set on protecting the rights of all citizens at all times, intends, wherever possible and insofar as provided for by current legislation, to work hard to support those living on the smallest islands, offering practical solutions to the needs of these citizens who do indeed experience unfavourable conditions, particularly during the winter months."
"I am available to you and to all Greek MEPs - and not just Greek MEPs, of course - should you wish to discuss any initiatives you want to adopt in order to give practical answers to the citizens of small islands."
"Could you elaborate further on the content of the appropriate regulatory framework which you indicated was in the pipeline, particularly in relation to economic sustainability of access transport to small island regions?"
"Can I get assurances from you, Commissioner, that the present public service obligation regime will not be impacted in any way by this future regulatory framework that you have in mind?"
"That is essential for the economic sustainability of these peripheral regions."
"Madam President, Mr Mavrommatis is always very active and always involved in issues regarding transport."
"The Commission's proposals are always accompanied by an impact assessment."
"This is true in particular of the November 2005 proposals on the third maritime safety package."
"The Commission's proposals in this sector take particular account of the relevant international conventions."
"In the majority of cases, the purpose of the legislative proposals is to invite the Member States to ratify the conventions or to implement them within the Community."
"They are never born out of an attempt to acquire new competences."
"I would like to clear up a common misunderstanding: the Community already has the necessary competences for maritime safety within the framework of the common transport policy."
"It is, however, inevitable that when the European Parliament and the Council legislate, Member States' ability to act in isolation at international level is therefore limited."
"Nonetheless, this is not to Member States' disadvantage."
"Indeed, it serves to strengthen our collective influence within the international community, thereby increasing the level of protection of the life of citizens and of the environment."
"Sometimes, Europe must simply take the initiative."
"This happened, for example, when we introduced the accelerated withdrawal of single-hull oil tankers and our decision was then followed by a similar one on the part of the International Maritime Organisation."
"Mr Mavrommatis, you are well aware of the problems with the International Maritime Organisation: we cannot always take decisions on our own."
"There are competences that do not concern Europe, and continual comparison with this organisation is therefore necessary, not least because our seas are frequented by vessels flying the flags of countries that do not belong to our Union."
"With the proposed new legislation on maritime safety, the Commission hopes, though, to redress the balance of the global dimension of maritime transport, which calls for global solutions while taking account of the limitations of the global legal framework."
"Mr Mavrommatis, Community action is a tangible expression of the collective effort and commitment of the Member States, not an imposition from the outside, running counter to their interests."
"Thanks to our efforts and yours, the number of vessels in European waters that do not comply with current standards has dropped dramatically."
"The Commission will continue to pursue a balanced but proactive policy, with the protection of the life and livelihood of our citizens as its main objective."
"Commissioner, you know how much I enjoy our discussions and debates."
"Moreover, you always have an answer for me."
"Naturally, I would like to thank you for those points that concern all the countries of the European Union."
"(EL) At a time when European citizens are particularly sensitive about the sovereign rights of their own country, especially in a sector under great economic strain, such as shipping, do you not think that seeking to establish sole Community competence and acquire new powers for the Commission will do more harm than good overall?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Mr Mavrommatis, I do not think there is a risk of inflicting damage, but the aim is to try to harmonise, within a framework, that which is always complicated in maritime law because, unfortunately, we always find ourselves faced with IMO decisions and, as I have said, thankfully Europe sometimes takes the lead and the international organisation follows us."
"Our intention, I repeat, is not to limit the rights of Member States but merely to try to achieve harmonisation that can serve only to provide EU citizens with faster and more robust responses."
"I was wondering if the Commissioner is satisfied that enough action is being taken by Member States in relation to implementing existing legislation and regulation."
"I had my own experience in acting in a legal capacity where a very serious accident occurred, and, even 12 months after the accident, the shipping company still had not complied with the regulations that were then in place and had been in place for over three years."
"Madam President, the topic of urban transport, I would like to inform the honourable Members - 'fellow Members' always comes to my mind first, it must be force of habit; I have only been a commissioner for a few months whereas I was an MEP for many years and evidently I still feel part of this Parliament - was one of the topics at the informal Council in La Rochelle on 1 and 2 September 2008, and was discussed at length."
"The Commission and the Member States gave the issue a great deal of attention, inviting experts, mayors of large and medium-sized cities and specialists in the sector to talk about urban transport."
"I spoke on this subject myself at the Road Safety Day that took place a few days ago in Paris - the official Commission and Council day during Road Safety Week - emphasising that road safety must also mean a good urban transport system: our roads will become safer, above all in big cities, if there is a good urban transport system."
"In my view, this will inevitably reduce the number of victims of accidents that occur in big cities, where there is the greatest number of accidents and the greatest number of victims."
"The Commission is drawing up an action plan on urban mobility based on the consultations that followed the publication of the Green Paper."
"We intend to present the plan before the end of this year."
"This plan will include proposals for definite actions at European Union level for the coming years."
"Clearly the European Commission does not have jurisdiction on this: these are areas that concern the Member States, but we, on the basis of the principle of subsidiarity which, as you all know, is derived from the word subsidium, want to help the Member States and the mayors of large cities."
"The former mayor of Milan, Gabriele Albertini, Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, can testify to all this: through this action plan, we will ensure that all of the information we have, all of the advice, all of the ideas, all of the suggestions, can be made available to all cities, above all the big cities with traffic problems."
"The action plan will also assist policy makers at local, regional and national level, in full respect - I repeat, full respect - of the principle of subsidiarity."
"The actions we will propose will help to cut costs, to guarantee the proper funding of the single market and to create new markets for new technologies, developing sustainable urban mobility."
"It is no coincidence that only yesterday evening, the debate was concluded and a vote taken on a directive that should encourage, that is aimed at encouraging, local authorities to purchase means of public transport with reduced harmful gas emissions."
"Today, however, it is still too early to outline or be specific about the content of the action plan, but we nonetheless expect, and you can expect, it to cover the breaking up of rules on access to green areas, urban goods transport and logistics, better information on public transport systems in European cities or broad plans on sustainable urban mobility and proposals on ways to integrate urban planning and mobility."
"The action plan may also include proposals on information sharing and for improved data collection and research practices, and may even tackle the issue of funding, which is an extremely delicate question."
"This, I repeat, will all be based on respect for the principle of subsidiarity."
"(EL) Commissioner, we shall await the action plan you propose with great interest and then we shall have an opportunity to talk again."
"However, I would like to hear your personal opinion on the following matter: there is a great deal of discussion about the congestion charges which have been introduced in cities such as London, Rome and Stockholm and which appear to have helped reduce congestion and increase the number of passengers using public transport."
"In other cities, however, where there is no organized network, there is still scepticism and I should like at this point to hear your personal opinion, as an experienced Commissioner, as to if and to what extent you are or are not in favour of congestion charges."
"Honourable Member, the question is an extremely delicate one: if Mr Albertini, who is always very generous, would like to buy us a coffee, we could discuss it and hear the experience of a mayor of a large European city."
"There can be no easy answer to this question."
"I was a municipal councillor in Rome for five years whilst I was an MEP and I dealt with these same issues."
"These things have to be looked at on a city by city, case by case basis, because some cities - I am thinking of Rome - have an historic centre with very narrow streets, where it is difficult for traffic to circulate."
"Other cities have a different urban environment and so it is not easy to have one rule for everyone."
"I think that, always using the principle of subsidiarity, mayors should choose, with the consensus of municipal councils, to impose a congestion charge if they think it useful and if the city they administrate needs to restrict traffic because in very old cities, the centre becomes congested very easily."
"Therefore the situation varies from city to city and it is difficult to find a solution."
"I would definitely say that it is not an option to be disregarded, even if it can sometimes cause confusion."
"You have to look at where the perimeter would be."
"I would reiterate that it is a choice to be made by individual cities."
"Personally, I am not against it in principle but, in certain cases, it can be unfair to impose it whilst in others, it can be entirely appropriate."
"Given, therefore, the diversity of European cities, I believe that especially in this case, the final decision should always be left to local authorities, although in the action plan, we will still offer suggestions and ideas."
"The important thing is that citizens are always informed and that they know what is going on and the decisions that are taken, because when it comes to paying taxes, it is always good for citizens to understand what they are paying for."
"I regret that I cannot give a definitive answer of principle."
"I truly believe that we have to examine the facts and the impact, including on the urban environment, and take the decisions one case at a time."
"To conclude, I would like to say again that, in principle, I am not against it, but that there could be cases in which it would be pointless to impose a tax of this kind."
"Commissioner, I was struck by two words that you used: that finance is a 'delicate' issue; and you repeated 'subsidiarity', which is important."
"Is the Commission concerned that the economic difficulties in Member States will impede the necessary investment in effective public transport systems?"
"At the same time, Member States might be imposing congestion charges in large cities on hard-pressed motorists who have no choice."
"(DE) My dear Mr Tajani, we are of course delighted to have the opportunity here of asking questions, especially on invitations to tender for urban transport."
"Are there any plans to put urban transport out to tender, as has happened in numerous cases in Sweden, where there is now competition in urban transport?"
"Secondly: are there really plans for uniform control systems throughout Europe?"
"When you arrive in a foreign city, it is often difficult to understand how their system operates and perhaps a Commission proposal is needed here."
"Madam President, thank you for the question."
"First of all, I think that in the action plan we are to present, we should insist on the need to give information to European citizens when they move from one city to another, so that they know what the situation is and what they will find when they travel from Stockholm to Madrid as opposed to from Rome to Vienna; so that they understand the set-up, what taxes they may need to pay, and can organise their trips, be they for work or as a tourist."
"This is already important and I believe we have work to do."
"Of course, honourable Members, I would stress the issue of the principle of subsidiarity, because it is not for the European Union to intervene in matters that fall strictly within the remit of local authorities."
"The same goes for financial aspects; the Commission has no place to intervene."
"Funding is a problem."
"Of course, in our action plan, we will seek to gather all the suggestions that have been put forward at the various hearings, in order to provide a service and assistance to local authorities, who are then at liberty to accept or reject them."
"Our aim is to try to harmonise the system, at least in terms of information for citizens, and to provide the different local authorities with as much information as possible regarding experiences from other cities, for them to make use of if they wish."
"This is important."
"As regards funding, I believe that each local authority is free to do as they see fit, without, of course, disrupting the market or the free movement of citizens."
"In each case, the most suitable solution must always be chosen."
"As regards the last question from Mr Rübig, however, the directive on public service obligations leaves local authorities the freedom to decide whether or not to call for tenders."
"I think that the European Union, from this point of view, has once again insisted on the principle of subsidiarity."
"I think that this is right, because our work should not be invasive: we should not regulate everything and anything, we should be concerned with the big issues, giving big answers and, if anything, helping local bodies and Member States to solve problems, where they can, perhaps with the aid and support of the European Union, without this support being dominant or invasive."
"In my opinion, in local public transport, this should be a principle that we all keep to, and I believe we want to do so."
"That concludes Question Time."
"Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will be answered in writing (see Annex)."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.45 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"Commemoration of the Holodomor, the Ukraine artificial famine (1932-1933) (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the commemoration of the Holodomor famine in Ukraine (1932-1933)."
"I should like to take this opportunity to welcome to the European Parliament a delegation from Ukraine headed by the Ambassador."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, honourable Members, I am honoured to take part in this debate to commemorate the great famine of 1932 and 1933, which was one of the great tragedies of the 20th century."
"After many years of silence, testimonies of the suffering call for our attention, together with the accounts of many survivors who found themselves caught up in that terrible event."
"It is vital that the experience of the Holodomor is not forgotten."
"The story of the great famine illustrates not only the tragedy of the Ukrainian people, but also reminds us again of what human beings are capable of."
"The Holodomor has something important to teach us, however: the sacrifice of so many has not been in vain."
"Their sacrifice reminds us never to accept that any state should subjugate individuals, whatever the cause or purpose for what takes place."
"That disastrous famine has shown the superiority of a constitutional state over one in which no form of dissent is permitted."
"Tragedies like the Holodomor only happen in those human societies that violate the rights of citizens, the rule of law and democratic principles."
"The European Union rose from the ashes of war and numerous totalitarian regimes, those dictatorships that deeply scarred the history of Europe and of the whole world."
"Out of those same tragedies and catastrophes, however, sprung forth the democracies of Europe and, in the last fifty years, a season of peace has been built on those ruins, a peace that we have a duty to defend, and to carry beyond the borders of the Union: fifty years of peace that have been the greatest achievement of a united Europe."
"Today, Ukraine has also changed."
"As an independent country, a member of the Council of Europe and signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights, as well as many other international instruments for the safeguard of these fundamental rights, Ukraine has an extraordinary opportunity to consolidate itself, to bolster its position as a democratic state that respects human rights and the rule of law."
"It is certainly an ambitious and difficult task."
"We have witnessed many troubles; many political battles have marked recent years in the history of this country, which has become stronger in its democracy."
"At this historic time, we must all lend our political support and encouragement to the independence of the judiciary."
"It is important that Ukraine continues to fight corruption and to take account of the results of the recent elections so that democratic principles are complied with."
"Nor must it omit to safeguard the most weak and marginalised, whatever their race, ethnicity or religion, or indeed their sexual orientation or state of health."
"The European Union will continue to support Ukraine in these important efforts."
"At the same time, we will continue to work together with our Ukrainian partners to raise the prosperity of all the citizens of that nation, by opening new markets and increasing the prospects for economic activity and investment, in addition to deepening relationships between our citizens."
"I would like to add, as Commissioner for Transport, that as regards trans-European networks, we should remember that these can serve not only to strengthen our internal market, but also as a tool to extend the frontiers of Europe, to open Europe up to new horizons and to strengthen links with near and friendly countries which border the European Union, like Ukraine."
"For the victims of the Holodomor there can be no better tribute than the creation of a prosperous, stable and democratic Ukraine, founded on solid institutions and on an engaged civil society."
"Only if this goal is reached will the sacrifice of so many innocent victims not have been in vain."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, the European Union is founded on reconciliation: the belief that we can create a better future by acknowledging our past in all its brutality."
"Germany has rightly confronted and sought to atone for the unspeakable horrors of the Nazi era and the Holocaust."
"The newer Member States of our Union are finding their own ways to seek truth and reconciliation through a frank and uncompromising analysis of their Communist totalitarian past."
"But some countries still seek to hide from their history."
"Turkey, for example, in my view still denies the genocide perpetrated on the Armenians and the Assyrians under cover of World War I. Russia has also struggled to come to terms with the brutality of Stalin's Communist dictatorship."
"The purpose of this resolution tonight is to express our horror at the Holodomor, the period of deliberately engineered famine in 1932-1933."
"The resolution reflects our determination to remember its millions of victims, some of whom are still alive today to tell their gruesome tale."
"Their evidence is vitally important, because soon they will all have gone."
"Only by reminding ourselves of such heinous crimes against humanity can we try to ensure they never happen again."
"This resolution does not contain the word 'genocide', because other political groups in this House do not think the strict definition of that term should be applied to the Holodomor."
"After all, it was only after the Second World War that the Genocide Convention was actually established."
"But also, perhaps - and perhaps more regrettably, in my view - because of a fear of offending modern-day Russia."
"But none of us wish to belittle the unimaginable suffering inflicted upon Ukraine."
"No word or words can properly describe the atrocity of the Holodomor."
"What is important is not so much the text that we use but the sentiment that we are trying to express in our resolution - solidarity with Ukraine on the 75th anniversary of the massacres perpetrated on its long-suffering people."
"One lesson that history teaches us is the importance of robust international law and judicial structures, which are now extant, if the authors of such misery are ever to be punished."
"Nuremberg was the start of that long, drawn-out process."
"The war crimes court for the former Yugoslavia, which is soon to try Radovan Karadzić, shows that these principles are as important today as ever."
"Yesterday this House voiced its strong support for bringing the leader of the Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda, Joseph Kony, before the International Criminal Court."
"Tyrants, wherever they are, in this case it is Joseph Stalin we are debating tonight, bent on mass murder and destruction, should have no sanctuary anywhere."
"Ukraine has borne much grief throughout its history, and I do hope now that the next stage in that glorious history involves Ukraine rightly taking its place, in the not-too-distant future, as a full member of the European Union."
"After the crisis in Georgia, there can be no doubt that many Russian nationalists are not happy about, for instance, Ukrainian sovereignty over Crimea."
"But I am sure that, if we all stand together in solidarity with the Ukrainian people, one day it will take its place in the European family of nations."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, this is a very special debate."
"As a political body, the European Parliament is asked to legislate and to provide executive decision-makers with political guidance for properly coping with the challenges, opportunities and dangers of our present times."
"In other words, we are history-builders and not historians."
"We are not asked to judge the past, but to build the present, and are supposed to be judged by the future."
"Therefore, the Socialist Group reluctantly accepted to subscribe to a resolution which apparently aims to establish a historical truth about a tragic event that took place in Ukraine in the past."
"We did that, however, because we understood that solidarity with the Ukrainian people and their sufferings could mobilise Ukrainians in their efforts to unite their country, to democratise it, modernise it and bring it inside its natural family which is the European Union."
"At the same time, we understood that if the tragedies and crimes of the past are forgotten, the danger of their being repeated is overwhelming."
"Historical condemnation of crimes cannot provide reparation for the victims thereof or their heirs, but it is moral compensation."
"Moreover, it is an intellectual and political guarantee against repetition of the crimes and resurrection of the bad instincts that lay at their origin."
"By condemning old totalitarian crimes, we not only shame the criminals of the past, but also those who might think to apply the same criminal methods in the future."
"Awareness that impunity is impossible might very well stop them doing so."
"We must proclaim today that there is no state rationale, no social objective and no ideological principle that can excuse a crime such as the Holodomor, the artificial famine which caused so much suffering for so many innocent people in a crazy attempt to destroy the moral dignity, national pride and biological existence of the great Ukrainian people."
"At the same time, while condemning the crimes, expressing solidarity with the victims, and denouncing this attempt to destroy a whole people, we cannot put the blame for those crimes on another people."
"The Holodomor was the product of a totalitarian political regime."
"All the peoples that were subject to that regime were victims of various similar crimes and hardships."
"The discussion today should not only remind us that we must always stay united against totalitarianism, but also that the present Ukrainian generation, on behalf and in the memory of the Holodomor victims, must eliminate from their country and their history all authoritarian instincts, inclinations and practices."
"They have to consolidate their national unity and accomplish together their democratic ideals."
"Likewise, our expression of solidarity should inspire the Ukrainians to solidarity and reconciliation, both inside and outside their country."
"Inside, with their countrymen, who belong to different ethno-cultural groups, and outside with our neighbours."
"That is one of the best ways in which they could become members of the European Union, and, if they choose to take that way, it means that our debate this evening has not been futile."
"EU membership for Ukraine would be the best historical reparation that the Ukrainians themselves can offer to the victims of Holodomor."
"Madam President, the Holodomor, or the artificial famine in Ukraine, is one of the largest-scale crimes committed in Europe during the 20th century."
"In order to prove that collective economies worked, and to destroy the main threat to the communist Soviet Union, Ukraine's independent farmers, Stalin's regime effected an artificial famine which resulted in the deaths of several million Ukrainians."
"All the food people had was confiscated."
"The famine drove large numbers of peoples from the countryside to the towns, which the authorities blocked by issuing internal passports and banning rail travel."
"Those who remained in the villages were forced to forage illegally for food in the fields of the collective farms, which carried a sentence of imprisonment or even execution."
"They were not allowed to keep a single handful of grain for themselves."
"A rule of 'five ears of grain' was imposed, by which anyone who picked more than five ears of grain faced the death penalty."
"Unfortunately, the Holodomor, or the great famine, is an event in history that is still practically unknown in many countries of Western Europe."
"Until recently, these historical facts were completely denied by the USSR."
"Any mention of the matter was, before the fall of the Soviet Union, treated as a crime of 'anti-Soviet propaganda'."
"Active means of disinformation were used against Western journalists."
"Only recently have documents from the population registers come to light, revealing the numbers affected by the mass starvation."
"The famine in Ukraine has been recognised as genocide by the governments or parliaments of 26 countries, including Poland."
"I am deeply convinced that the European Parliament will not remain inactive on this issue."
"We have to recognise that the Holodomor was a crime against the Ukrainian people and a crime against humanity, and firmly condemn the actions of the Stalinist regime against Ukrainian farmers."
"I also believe that it is high time that all information on the famine is made public."
"The countries of the former Soviet Union should open their archives on the Holodomor in Ukraine in 1932-1933 to scholars so that impartial studies can be carried out."
"This year is the 75th anniversary of this shocking crime."
"I would like to use this opportunity to extend my deepest sympathies to the Ukrainian people, which had to undergo this huge tragedy."
"Madam President, I have chosen almost the same introduction to my speech as Mr Tannock."
"That does not happen very often."
"'The past is the prologue of the future' is the maxim displayed at the entrance to the National Archives in Washington and with good reason."
"This phrase encapsulates the hope that people can learn from history."
"Sometimes they do, but not always."
"We can but try."
"I have noticed time and again - and the motion on the Holodomor was an occasion to do so once again - that not all chapters in the history of eastern and western Europe in the last century are equally common knowledge."
"When the groups were debating whether or not to in fact table today's resolution, the overriding opinion was initially one of scepticism; when questioned, most Members admitted to having no idea as to what Holodomor actually means and what it stands for."
"Perhaps this is the start of a joint learning curve about such a terrible moment in history which took place at the heart of Europe not even a century, just a little over half a century ago, and which will give us the chance to write history accurately with the help of the survivors."
"For the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the commemoration of the victims of this tragedy needs to be the focal point of the avowal we make in signing this resolution."
"We believe that proper commemoration of the victims depends on our knowing about this tragedy, this massive crime on the part of the Soviet regime."
"Secondly, we hope that this history will be processed jointly in Ukraine and Russia."
"What we do not want - and I say this as a German born in the 1950s - is for this processing of history and this proper writing of history to deepen the rift between nations."
"We do not want that either within Ukraine or between Ukraine and Russia."
"I therefore believe that opening up the archives is an important prerequisite."
"This is the demand that must be met."
"The Council of Europe should also discuss this, so that Moscow opens up these archives."
"I am delighted that the European Parliament has managed to find a position of unity."
"I truly hope that the writing of history and commemoration of the victims is the main focus in Ukraine and that this catastrophe is not manipulated for political purposes."
"Then we will have taken a big step towards making the wish that people really would learn from the past come true."
"Madam President, this year we mark the 75th anniversary of the famine in Ukraine in 1932-1933."
"The famine was not a natural disaster, but the result of Joseph Stalin's genocidal plan by which, having dealt with the Ukrainian intelligentsia, he aimed to destroy the rural population of Ukraine."
"Some 10 million men, women and children died as a result of this genocide."
"It was a purposeful and systematic extermination carried out by the authorities of the Soviet Union."
"The criminal intentions of the communists were clear."
"While Ukrainians were starving to death, the Soviets exported millions of tonnes of grain, and sealed the borders of Ukraine to prevent the devastated population from entering Russia."
"They turned down offers of international humanitarian aid, claiming that the famine did not exist."
"In the present Russian Federation, there is hypocrisy over the history of communist crimes, and Stalin is presented as an effective manager."
"Some Western countries kept quiet during this huge tragedy for the Ukrainian people, as they were in the process of establishing diplomatic ties with the Soviet Union, which they wanted to make dependent on economic cooperation."
"Today we cannot keep quiet, and it is our duty to honour the memory of the victims of the Holodomor."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, I speak to you as someone who has spent many years of his life in Ukraine, who has lived there and who is therefore, naturally, very emotionally involved."
"There is not one reason, not one excuse for qualifying or justifying the famine in 1932 and 1933."
"It affected Ukraine, Russia, especially areas along the Volga, the Don and the Kuban, Western Siberia, the Southern Urals and the northern part of Kazakhstan."
"Millions of people of various nationalities, Ukrainians, Russians, Kazakhs, Jews, Germans, Belarussians, Tartars and many others, starved to death."
"We must commemorate these victims and clearly state that this famine was the expression and result of an inhumane policy, of the crime of exporting cereals while allowing one's own people to die of starvation."
"Why then can I not agree with this resolution?"
"Firstly, because this resolution links this catastrophe and this crime to Ukraine and people of Ukrainian nationality alone."
"As I said at the beginning, this does not reflect the historical truth."
"Anyone who does not consider the other socialist republics of the Soviet Union and the other various nationalities at the same time is guilty of racism and of contempt for the suffering of all those affected."
"Secondly, this resolution recognises the Holodomor as genocide."
"Genocide is defined as extermination according to ethnic criteria."
"This applies in particular to the Holocaust."
"To equate one with the other undermines the argument of the singularity of the national socialist crime of the annihilation of Jews in Europe, the recognition of which has, to date, been the subject of broad democratic consensus."
"The severity needed in condemning these events in the Soviet Union requires no such equation."
"I am convinced that this was the main reason for the declaration by the Israeli ambassador to Ukraine, Mrs Kalay-Kleitman, who stated in an interview with the Serkalo Nedeli that Israel cannot recognise the Holodomor as an act of ethnic genocide."
"Thirdly, 10 December 2008 marks the 60th anniversary of the UN Declaration of Human Rights."
"Human rights are universal and indivisible."
"You cannot take a selective, circumstantial or expedient approach to them."
"The 20th century saw a devastating multitude of horrendous crimes which are not comparable but which nonetheless caused the death of millions of innocent people: the First World War, the fascist invasion, the aggression of Japan towards China and Korea, the atomic bombs dropped by the USA on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Stalin's policy against his own people, the ravages of various colonial powers in their spheres of influence, the terror of the Khmer Rouge, the slaughter of Tutsi and Hutus."
"This horrifying list is almost endless."
"The European Parliament should have an interest in castigating such inhumanity in all its permutations."
"Fourthly, there should never be starvation ever again - either for political or for economic reasons."
"In view of the billions given to aid the banks, Ingeborg Schäuble, the outgoing chairwoman of Welthungerhilfe, has called for a rescue package against world hunger."
"EUR 14 billion a year are needed for agriculture in development countries in order to achieve the Millennium Goals and halve the number of hungry people by 2015."
"In 2007, this figure stood at 923 million people."
"We must do everything so that hunger is eradicated like the plague."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Madam President, holodomor is an amalgamation of the Ukrainian words holod (starvation) and moryty (put to death) and therefore means 'death by starvation'."
"Holodomor refers to the death by starvation of 6 to 7 million people, 3.5 million of whom were in Ukraine, 2 million in Kazakhstan, and hundreds of thousands in the North Caucasus by the Volga and in Western Siberia in 1932 and 1933."
"Holodomor stands for the forceful despoilment of the Ukrainian farming population of their cereal harvest by Stalin and his henchmen as effective Bolshevist means of educating the people in the country in the spirit of forced collectivisation of agriculture."
"Holodomor stands for the deliberate denial of the acute famine in Ukraine and elsewhere in the Soviet Union by the Stalinists, so that millions of victims remained cut off from any form of internal or external aid."
"Holodomor stands for uninterrupted cereal exports by the Soviet leadership during the years of starvation 1932-1933, even though these would have fed about one and a half million people for a whole year."
"Holodomor stands for the genocide of Ukrainian villagers by adopting a starvation policy pure and simple in the form of a complete economic blockade of the Ukrainian countryside by meting out penalties in kind, and by introducing a freeze in supplies and blacklists on the basis of the Decree of 18 November 1932, as prescribed by Molotov, Stalin's then envoy in Charkiv."
"Holodomor stands for Stalin's paranoia about Ukrainian nationalism, which the great leader considered to be the main cause for what he saw as insufficient cereal supplies from Europe's granary."
"Holodomor stands for Stalin's intentions of dashing all Ukrainian dreams of autonomy, or even independence, for ever."
"Today, we know that he failed in his demonic plan."
"(FR) Madam President, from Lenin's Soviet Russia to Kim Il-Sung's present-day North Korea, via Mao's China, Mengistu's Ethiopia and Pol Pot's Cambodia - and this list is, unfortunately, not exhaustive - it can be said that famine is consubstantial with communism."
"However, the famine that killed almost 10 million Ukrainians between 1932 and 1933 was not only the result of the economic and social absurdity of communism, or of the hatred that it feels towards the peasant community, but was planned by the Soviet authorities who, on the one hand, requisitioned all the peasants' food stocks, including their grain, and, on the other, used the police to prevent, by all means, the departure en masse of Ukrainians who were trying to escape death as a result of the requisition."
"This is what is still happening today in North Korea."
"Article 6 of the Statute of the International Criminal Court defines genocide as the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, as such, and also, I quote, 'deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part'."
"The extermination by famine, the Holodomor, decided on by the Soviet communists in 1932, fits this definition, whatever the view of our fellow Member, Mr Markov."
"On 28 November 2006, the Ukrainian Parliament described the Holodomor as a genocide."
"It is regrettable that the United Nations, due to the Russian veto and the cowardice of the French and United Kingdom Governments, has refused to give it this description."
"The latter does not, moreover, call into question the honour of the Russian people, who were also victims of communism, but it does denounce the horror of this totalitarianism, which has killed 200 million human beings worldwide, and which we are, it must be said, denouncing very belatedly."
"(ES) Madam President, today's debate is intended to commemorate (meaning to keep alive in our memories) the sacrifice of so many millions of people who fell victim to a demographic disaster, unprecedented in peacetime, due to Stalin's policies."
"Madam President, I believe that the famine suffered by those people was a direct attack on the Ukrainian peasantry who were firmly opposed to collectivisation."
"As recalled in this House, in particular by Mr Bielan, this was a deliberate act because the 1932 harvest, although below average, would have been sufficient to feed the entire population, as proven by the fact that in that year, the Soviet Union exported more than one million tonnes of grain to western Europe."
"The result, as highlighted by all the speakers in this debate, was the deaths of between six and eight million people in the whole of the Soviet Union, and between five and six million in Ukraine."
"The gravity of this event stemmed not only from the deaths of so many people, but also from the silence and concealment."
"That is why I believe, Madam President, that it is vital for the European Parliament, as other institutions such as the United Nations or the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly have done, to today raise its voice in homage and to keep alive in all our memories the sacrifice of all those people who fell victim to a totalitarian and criminal ideology."
"However, Madam President, and this too has been said in this House, the most important thing is to look to the future and ensure that the children being born today in the great country of Ukraine have to resort to newspaper libraries and history books to discover the horror experienced by previous generations in the Holodomor."
"(PL) Madam President, today the European Parliament is marking the 75th anniversary of the mass famine in Ukraine, one of the greatest crimes against humanity of the 20th century."
"The famine in Ukraine, the Volga region, Kazakhstan and other parts of the Soviet Union in 1932-1933 was not the result of natural causes, but of Stalin's system of wielding power."
"Forced collectivisation of agriculture and fighting against private ownership in the countryside, destruction of the middle classes and private enterprise under a totalitarian dictatorship, violence by the state against farmers, meant defeat, starvation and death in horrifying circumstances for millions of people."
"The European Union honours the victims of this crime, and salutes those who survived it, the last living witnesses to this tragedy."
"The great famine affected the Ukrainian people in particular."
"Stalin's policy in Ukraine involved, on the one hand, the inhumane conditions of collectivisation and, on the other, the destruction of national culture, churches and repressions against the intelligentsia."
"Many Ukrainian writers were shot, imprisoned or sent to labour camps during the 1930s."
"In 1932, the existing writers' groups were dissolved."
"Many national cultural figures perished."
"The Rozstriliane Vidrodzenniya ('Firing-squad Renaissance') symbolised Ukraine in the 20th century."
"The mass famine in Ukraine, as well as in other regions of the Soviet Union, is a fundamental research task for historians, political analysts and scholars of totalitarianism."
"The great famine cannot be the subject of ideological manipulation or other nationalist policies."
"All archives on the Stalinist system must be opened, and meticulous studies carried out to determine the numbers of the victims, with precise academic descriptions of the causes, the course and the consequences of the famine."
"Knowing the truth about the past will serve unity, the establishment of democratic culture as a permanent foundation for Europe."
"I would like to use the occasion of this debate to remember the great works of the Polish emigré, Jerzy Giedroyc, whose Kultura published in Paris brought understanding between Poland and Ukraine."
"I would like to hold up the Ukrainian language anthology published in Kultura in 1957 concerning the persecution of Ukrainian writers, Rozstriliane Vidrodzenniya, which was edited by Lavrinenko, and the Polish-Ukrainian chronicles from 1952 written by Professor Bohdan Osadchuk in the same journal, to the European Parliament as an example of Europe working together to overcome historical fatalism, and to create agreement between the nations regarding a future democratic community."
"(LT) Ladies and gentlemen, the great Holodomor famine which occurred in Ukraine is an episode in the history of Europe which we must not forget."
"I am convinced that the famine must be recognised as an act of genocide implemented by the Soviet Union against the Ukrainian nation."
"This is one of the worst crimes against humanity committed during the period of the Soviet Union."
"The tragedy of the people of Ukraine was a guarded secret; even in Europe, few people know that one of the most savage crimes of the 20th century was committed not in some distant land, but here in Europe and during peacetime."
"Millions of Ukrainians became victims of the famine engineered by the Soviet authorities."
"The annihilation of the peasants by the Soviet totalitarian regime also represents an identity crisis for Ukraine."
"Thus, firstly, we have to condemn the defenders of the regime in the former Soviet republics who deny this and other crimes of the Communist period; secondly, we must support Ukraine's aim, the aim of our future colleague to have this genocide of the Ukrainian nation recognised at an international level."
"Thirdly, the Holodomor is just one of the crimes of communism, communism whose crimes inevitably must still be heard at a second Nuremberg."
"(DE) Madam President, the European Union, together with numerous other countries, has recognised the catastrophe known as the Holodomor which took place in Ukraine in 1932-1933 as a crime against the Ukrainian people."
"Even the United Nations passed a resolution at its General Assembly in 2007 commemorating the victims of the Holodomor and condemning the regime."
"The Stalinist regime in the Soviet Union artificially provoked a food shortage to force Ukraine - but not only Ukraine - into its planned agricultural economy."
"This objective was prized more highly in the eyes of the rulers of the time than preserving human life."
"No consideration whatsoever was given to the people and millions suffered an agonising death."
"This means that the Holodomor was not a natural disaster; it was planned by man and executed in cold blood."
"I welcome today's debate."
"Consistent rehabilitation and the publicising of crimes are the only way to come to terms with the past."
"Opening up archives is a first, important step in the right direction."
"This applies not only to Ukraine, but to all other countries which lived under Soviet communist rule and, of course, to Russia itself."
"As experience from dealing with archives has shown, general and public access alone does not suffice."
"On the contrary, support needs to be provided during the search for information."
"This can be achieved, for example, by opening documentation centres and employing historians."
"Crimes cannot be undone, but they - and more importantly their victims - should never be forgotten."
"The worldwide recognition of the Holodomor as mass murder of the people of Ukraine and elsewhere is of huge significance to world politics."
"This could create a precedent for many other nations in whose past mass murder was committed."
"In all events, the European Union is sending Russia a clear message by recalling the crime committed and deeply condemning it, thus making it perfectly clear for the forthcoming partnership and association negotiations that one of the basic pillars of the EU, namely respect for human rights, is non-negotiable."
"(PL) Madam President, in 1932-1933, the authorities in the USSR started forcibly requisitioning food from collective farms in Ukraine, leaving the farm workers without food."
"This resulted in the famine known as the Holodomor and the deaths of millions of inhabitants of a country which had previously been a breadbasket."
"Given that the object of this operation, for which Stalin and his minions were responsible, was Ukraine's farmers as a social group and as a nationality, the Holodomor meets the definition of genocide contained in the UN Convention of 1948."
"The resolution we have drawn up for the 75th anniversary of the Holodomor is a compromise which largely concedes the truth of this crime."
"All it lacks is clearly calling the Holodomor a crime of genocide."
"This is the result of a number of groups in this House."
"During the compromise negotiations, I noticed that the group of socialists is generally opposed to historical debates."
"This is a fine stance to take when you consider how the European socialists are always eager to condemn Nazism and General Franco, while they emotionally refuse to do so in the case of the Soviet authorities or the Spanish republicans."
"During these negotiations, I also heard how commemorating the victims involves deference, thereby avoiding words such as genocide."
"This kind of moralising and selective memory among the European socialists shows that historical materialism has been superseded by hysterical relativism."
"I remain hopeful, however, that this does not apply to all members on the left of this House."
"I also heard that the socialists are against voting on historical truth."
"That is the honest truth."
"The problem is that here we are not talking about the truth of the Holodomor, but only voicing the truth about our own selves."
"A resolution on matters of history is always an acknowledgment of values, while the lack of position is also, in itself, a position."
"It means that the phrases spoken are hollow."
"How is it possible to express one's relation to values other than by assessing events from the past?"
"Genocide is genocide, regardless of whether it was perpetrated by Hitler or Stalin, or of how the present Russian government sees it."
"If anybody today said that the victims of the Holocaust deserve less attention than the gas chambers, they would put their credibility in question."
"We are all equal before the law and the truth!"
"(EL) Madam President, the arrow of the famine in Ukraine is being withdrawn from the quiver of anti-communism in order to serve the needs of the anti-communist campaign and rewrite history, to criminalise the communist ideology and ban actions by communists."
"There are, moreover, numerous examples which we could cite of countries in which the symbols of, and action by, communist parties are still banned, countries which belong to the European Union."
"Thus, an undisguised attempt is being made to distort historic facts and interpret them in an arbitrary and unscientific manner because, quite simply, the basic objective is to underpin the strategic defamation of socialism and communism."
"Anticommunism has always accompanied the harshest and most savage attacks against the people."
"As the anti-grassroots attack by the European Union against the fundamental rights acquired by the working class through hard struggle and sacrifice becomes stronger, as its exploitation by capital becomes more savage and barbaric, as the imperialist policy of the European Union against countries and nations becomes more aggressive and criminal, so anticommunism, the reactionary defamation of socialism we saw in the 20th century, and the attack on the vanguard of the working class and the oppressed sections of communist parties intensify."
"This vulgar propaganda is a sequel to the attempt to use coarse lies and slander in order to blacken, in the eyes of the mainly young people, the massive contribution of the socialist system; its contribution to the defeat of fascism and to the construction, for the first time in the history of mankind, of a society free from the exploitation of man by man."
"An attempt is being made to equate socialism, that is, everything progressive born of human thought, with the reactionary and inhumane fascism which is the true child of the barbaric capitalist system."
"This specific famine in Ukraine was mainly due, as all objective historians agree, to massive sabotage by the rich peasants who, in reaction to the new Soviet power and collectivisation of the land, first caused a civil war and then destroyed machinery, killed animals, set fire to the property of the kolkhoz and generally sabotaged the sowing and harvesting of crops in any way they could, and to the huge drought and typhus epidemic which broke out in that area of Ukraine at the time."
"Obviously, a debate such as this to uncover the historic truth cannot be held in this manner."
"If you really think that you have arguments, organise a debate in which all the scientific facts which will help to uncover the truth can be expressed."
"(PL) Madam President, the Holodomor is a fact and symbolises one of the most inhumane methods of slaughter."
"An ideology called upon to serve the ordinary people took a form which today beggars the imagination."
"It was a simple method - it required no armaments or men, no gas chambers."
"All it took was to gather up everything the earth had given, and the ""disobedient"" population would disappear from its villages, because it did not fit into the system."
"People were pushed into a Utopian vision, and despite its horror and its cost, many still find it attractive and it is defended by some members on the left side of this House."
"The Bolshevik ideology used methods which cannot be justified in any way."
"My PhD on Ukraine dealt with the traumas of people who had survived this socialist horror, even though survivors were the exception."
"The accounts provided by survivors reveal that starvation led to cannibalism; for example, we are aware of the case of a mother who sent her six-year-old son into the forest in winter, because he would not have survived in the village but been eaten."
"On the one hand, we have the 1930s, with Joseph Stalin, the wise father and friend of the peoples heralding world revolution and, on the other, we had millions dying in the streets with swollen stomachs."
"It must have been a horrifying sight even for the political commissars serving the authorities."
"That was how it was in eastern Ukraine."
"10 years later, however, a tragedy of the same nature befell the Poles in what was then eastern Poland, albeit on a lesser scale."
"The nationalist ideology of the Ukrainian UPA, which colluded with the Nazis, resulted in the ethnic cleansing of Poles."
"The methods were equally savage: burning alive, cutting open pregnant women's stomachs, beheading children with axes."
"The men were at the front then."
"Today, this Golgotha of the east, as the survivors call it, is a subject of taboo and embarrassed silence and, most ironically, statues are now being erected to the nationalist leaders of that time."
"Perhaps now is an occasion - and there are observers from Ukraine here - while honouring the victims of the Holodomor - also to honour the Poles and Ukrainians who were so savagely murdered for not agreeing with that ideology."
"It is not easy to admit to such facts, but failing to do so will make it difficult to bring peoples closer together, to accept Ukraine into the sphere of the European values for which we strive in this House."
"I understand Russia's protests against the European Union."
"If we are going to speak of the Holodomor, as they propose, we should also talk about the extermination of the Indians in the New World by the colonists."
"The Holodomor is worthy of particular condemnation."
"However, let us also add the millions sent to labour camps, i.e. death camps, in Siberia during World War II - Ukrainians, Poles, Tartars."
"Just for the benefit of this gathering, I would like to add that of the 100 000 POWs of General Paulus' army sent to Siberia following Stalingrad, only 5 000 survived up to 1955."
"For the sake of Europe, its Parliament cannot trivialise these tragedies of the 20th century."
"(HU) The greatest Hungarian poet of the 20th century said that 'We must confess the past!'"
"Yes, we must confess the past, but not in order to foster tensions between peoples and countries."
"Every people must face its own sins; the way in which the Germans have faced their own role in the Second World War is exemplary."
"Mr Zaleski, as a Pole, alluded to the fact that many people have sins to confess, and that the Holodomor is not the only one."
"I speak as a representative of a people whose parliament in 2003 was the first to condemn the Holodomor."
"At the same time, I would very much like it if this debate was not an anti-Russian one, because those present in this House, those who take the floor, should be familiar with the ethnic map of Ukraine, and should know which counties were affected by this Stalinist horror, by means of which the Communist dictatorship strove to exterminate the peasantry - for the most part those who died were Ukrainians, but not exclusively Ukrainians."
"In those town and cities - Donetsk, Dnepropetrovsk, Odessa - there were also Romanians, Russians, Jews and other groups who died."
"In these places, it was the peasantry that they sought to exterminate."
"We must recognise that this was genocide, but not on ethnic grounds."
"Based on the principles of an unacceptable, failed 20th-century Stalinist, Communist dictatorship, they sought to wipe out an entire class, the peasantry, the peasant farmers."
"The victims of this campaign were mainly Ukrainians, but we must pay tribute to all the victims, regardless of nationality."
"What Mr Roszkowski said is not true, namely that the Social Democratic group is trying to whitewash something."
"No, we are simply honouring the facts, and insisting on the facts, because by taking sides on behalf of the Holodomor, we are not prepared to take part in a condemnation of Russia - although Russia has a lot of soul-searching to do on account of Stalinism, the massacre at Katyn - but neither should we forget that the Russian people suffered at least as much from the Stalinist dictatorship, and had as many victims as other peoples."
"Therefore, I say that we should pay tribute, but let us also try in these debates to show some respect for historical facts."
"We bow our heads before the victims of the Holodomor, but we cannot serve Ukrainian nationalism; rather, we must work to ensure that Russia, Ukraine and every country face its past and make peace."
"(HU) Madam President, after many years of denial and silence, no one today disputes that the Holodomor was one of the most serious, deliberately caused and politically motivated mass murders of the 20th century."
"The European Parliament is fulfilling a longstanding obligation when it bows its head in memory of the victims."
"The closest ally of sin is indifference and forgetfulness."
"We must not forget!"
"Millions died in order that Stalin might fulfil his dictatorial plan."
"That plan was not only to collectivise agriculture forcibly - that was one of his aims - but equally to break Ukrainian national self-awareness and destroy the institutions of national identity."
"During the years of the Holodomor, and in the course of the 1930s, 80% of Ukrainian intellectuals were killed."
"The independent Ukrainian church was abolished."
"The Ukrainian language was squeezed out of public life."
"Therefore the Holodomor is an indelible part of Ukrainian national identity and collective memory."
"We must recognise the sacrifice that Ukraine's citizens made in order to live in freedom and be able to decide on their own future."
"The European Parliament recognises Ukraine's European ambitions."
"By adopting this resolution, we are sending the message that not only Ukraine's past, but its future is also inseparably bound up with that of Europe."
"Thank you for the floor."
"(LV) Ladies and gentlemen, the artificially provoked famine in Ukraine, or genocidal famine, is one of the greatest crimes against humanity in world history."
"According to all the criteria, it meets the definition of genocide."
"Firstly, it is of an ethnic nature, since it was directed against the rebelling Ukrainian people, who had displayed their opposition to Russification on more than one occasion."
"Secondly, it was also a social genocide against prosperous Ukrainian farmers, although the famine killed everyone, regardless of their level of prosperity."
"This crime was completely cynical."
"Stalin's totalitarian Communist regime found the cheapest way of killing a large number of people."
"Millions died in Ukraine at the hands of the slow, terrible famine."
"Now, documentary evidence is accessible which shows that the Nazis themselves in the 1930s went to Moscow to acquire experience in the organisation of mass murder."
"The decisions at that time about the expropriation of food were taken in Moscow."
"The decisions about the 2006 gas war between Ukraine and Russia were once again taken in Moscow."
"Contemporary Russia, through its conception of foreign policy, is clearly demonstrating that it is recapturing its position in its part of the world."
"Moscow's court historians are not ashamed to say that the artificially created famine in Ukraine was exclusively man-made."
"It is to be hoped that Ukraine will not be the next state, after Georgia, upon which Russia will be able to inflict brutal aggression."
"We must clearly say that the events in Ukraine were genocide."
"My country, Latvia, has already done so, just as many other states have also done, through statements by their parliaments."
"I would like to stress, once again, that the crimes of totalitarian Communism ought to be considered to be subject to condemnation in just the same way as Nazi crimes."
"We need another Nuremberg, because innocent victims are victims, regardless of who has committed crimes against them."
"Although our peoples have varied experiences, nonetheless a uniform understanding of historical events in the European Union is an absolute necessity."
"In fact, this is the foundation of our common future."
"Thank you."
"Madam President, artificial, man-made famines were used systematically as a tool by Communist totalitarian regimes."
"Seventy-five years ago, Stalin decided to uproot the Ukrainian national identity and resistance by creating such a famine in the very bread-basket of Europe."
"Regions struck by famine were not merely denied assistance."
"Even worse, hundreds of villages were cordoned off by the Red Army."
"Starving people were denied the most elementary human right - the right to escape from certain death."
"People who tried to flee were hunted down like wild animals and shot."
"Only today are we reacting to one of the most appalling crimes by the Communist dictatorship."
"An authoritative assessment of such crimes is long overdue."
"All victims of the crimes against humanity deserve the same status."
"There cannot be first-class Nazi victims or second-class victims of Communism just because Europe still lacks an integrated approach to all totalitarian regimes and has hesitated to take a concrete stand on crimes that took place in the eastern part of the continent."
"We have a duty to know what happened under Stalin just as well as we know what happened under Hitler."
"We need to extend not only our solidarity to the Ukrainian nation and, indeed, to all nations that have suffered under totalitarian crimes, but also to pass a moral verdict."
"Only in this way can we reach the goal of these debates: to guarantee that this monumental, destructive disregard for human lives and dignity will never be repeated in any part of Europe."
"We need an all-European reconciliation, a reconciliation that can result only from truth and justice."
"Our duty is to make sure that the famous 'never again' will equally apply to the Ukrainian nation."
"(PL) When asked whether it was worth risking nuclear war to overthrow capitalism, Mao Zedong said it was worth sacrificing even a hundred million lives so that the rest of humanity could live happily under communism."
"Joseph Stalin had the same gruesome, criminal logic."
"When resistance against collectivisation among the peasants grew, he decided to physically eliminate those living in the most rebellious regions."
"These regions were inhabited by Ukrainians."
"Eliminating these also solved the problem of nationality, because as Stalin said on another occasion, 'the problem of nationality is basically a peasant problem.'"
"Hence, as a result of the planned criminal campaign, in Ukraine itself, millions of people died."
"It is telling enough that official population statistics for Ukraine put the population at well over 31 million in 1926, while in 1939, despite significant natural population growth, the population was only 28 million."
"It was not only the population of Soviet Ukraine that died."
"Administratively-ordered food requisitions, accompanied by bans on food imports from other regions, resulted in famine in the Volga region, the Kuban and the northern Caucasus."
"The majority of the population of these areas was Ukrainian, but there were also Russians."
"Today, we are also raising the issue of the famine in Ukraine to manifest our conviction that this fragment of the dramatic history of our common Europe is still not sufficiently well known."
"(Applause)"
"(PL) Madam President, the last century saw huge numbers of terrible massacres."
"Some were conducted by shooting, gassing, with axes and pitchforks, while others were committed through starvation."
"In the territory of the then Soviet Ukraine, it took the form of condemning millions to starvation in an area that has the richest soil in the world."
"This was done deliberately, and not caused by the weather or natural disaster."
"It is worrying that, over the years, this genocide against Ukrainians, Poles and Russians was not called by its proper name, as it is worrying today that the genocide committed against hundreds of thousands of Poles, Jews and Ukrainians who resisted the fascism of the Ukrainian nationalists on the former and present territory of Poland during World War II is not termed genocide."
"It is also all the more worrying that a lack of condemnation today justifies and legitimises organisations which refer to the heritage of these murderers."
"These organisations are operating legally in Europe today."
"There is no politically justified genocide."
"All must be named and condemned."
"Madam President, we are talking about this man-made famine now, 75 years after the events, because, if we do not talk about it now, then it could become like the dark midnight of justice."
"It is still two hours to midnight now, but we are building the future."
"We cannot build that future on wobbly foundations."
"It has to be built on a solid foundation, and a solid foundation means the truth."
"The future cannot be built on lies, which would be like building it on sand."
"It does not really matter how many people died in Ukraine."
"What matters is that the victims of that man-made famine - the Ukrainian populace - feel that justice is being done, because we have to restore people's faith in justice."
"Otherwise, we cannot build a just society and they cannot believe in a future."
"All victims' cries have to be heard, regardless of whether they are the victims of Nazism, apartheid, slavery or Communism."
"This House stands for the fundamental values of humanity."
"We cannot send out an ambiguous message."
"That is why we have to be truly unbiased, however painful that might be politically for us."
"Otherwise we are not defending human dignity."
"It is very alarming that, in Russia today, history is being rewritten, so how can we build a common future?"
"It is a fitting time for us to discuss Ukraine now, because at this very moment, in 2008, Ukraine needs help."
"It needs hope for a better future, which means accession to the EU one day."
"(CS) The famine was the result of a carefully planned systematic policy of J. V. Stalin aimed at a clear set of objectives: the voluntary surrender of land ownership, the establishment of agricultural collectives, the diversion of all agricultural products and seed stocks to feed the Russian army and the deliberate starving of Ukraine's towns and cities."
"The main aim was to suppress and destroy Ukraine as a nation."
"It was genocide."
"It involved the persecution of the civilian population within the country for reasons of politics and race and it therefore meets the legal definition of a crime against humanity."
"This is not simply a question of commemorating the famine."
"It is a question of symbolic redress for the victims, of careful study, analysis, knowledge and acceptance of shared responsibility and along with that a shared closing of accounts at a European level."
"Communism is a crime against humanity."
"Its consequences are comparable with those of fascism and Nazism."
"Let us therefore establish a European Institute of the European Conscience and let us also celebrate 23 August as the Day for Victims of All Totalitarian Systems."
"Let us understand communism as a terrible part of our common European history."
"Only through a shared recognition of responsibility for the past will we find the way to the future."
"Situations such as those faced by Iraqi society, and other parts of the world today, for example, teach us that the deeper the damage to the fabric of society the more painful, costly and difficult in human terms it is to repair it."
"Ukraine still bears heavy scars."
"Let us offer her our help."
"(PL) Madam President, today the European Parliament is remembering the victims of one of Stalin's greatest crimes, the victims of the famine that was deliberately caused by the despotic Bolshevik regime that ruled the Soviet Union and whose intention was to weaken and destroy the Ukrainian nation, and thereby strangle its desire for freedom and to establish its own, independent state."
"Ukraine, as well as certain regions of southern Russia, the northern Caucasus and Kazakhstan, saw scenes of appalling, horrifying despair, suffering and desperation by entire families that were starving to death."
"Today, we want to pay our respects to all those who were killed during the great famine in Ukraine."
"The victims of mass killings, military massacres and ethnic cleansing equally deserve to have their memories honoured, and for the wrongs committed against them to be remembered."
"Regardless of the cause for which they were committed, and the ideological goals that drove these actions, the constant element in them is the suffering of the victims."
"Let us show solidarity with the Ukrainian people, but let us also ask Ukraine to come to terms with the dark pages in its history."
"In 1939-1945, nationalists of the Ukrainian National Army brutally murdered 150 000 Poles, mainly women and old people."
"The husbands and fathers exiled to Siberia may have been living in Gehenna there, but had the hope that their families in the eastern borderlands were safe."
"Unfortunately, these families fell victim to the nationalists, who saw no place for their Polish neighbours in the new Ukrainian state."
"The victims of the massacres in the eastern borderlands are waiting for the day when their fate is also written into the common conscience of Europe, as today the victims of the great famine have been."
"Madam President, coming from Ireland, a country that also suffered a tragic famine over 150 years ago, I understand the Ukrainian desire to have the victims of their artificial famine from 1932 to 1933 commemorated."
"This resolution of Parliament follows previous commemorative resolutions from other international organisations such as UNESCO and OSCE."
"Our resolution on the commemoration of the victims of the Holodomor in Ukraine was adopted at the 34th session of the UNESCO general conference, which was supported by Ireland among others."
"At the Madrid OSCE ministerial meeting in November 2007, 30 countries associated themselves with Ukraine's statement commemorating the 75th anniversary of the Holodomor."
"European integration must continue to be based on a readiness to come to terms with the 20th century's tragic history."
"This present European Parliament resolution makes an important call on countries originating from the Soviet Union to provide full access to archives on this tragedy for comprehensive scrutiny in order to unveil and fully investigate the causes and consequences of this famine."
"Present-day relatives of the victims are seeking closure and should, therefore, have the right to access such information in order to come to an understanding of the greatest catastrophe in Ukraine's modern history."
"I add my voice to this expression of sympathy to the millions of Ukrainians that suffered this calamity and, in particular, to the relatives of those who died as a result of this artificial famine."
"(SK) My father, Štefan Kányai, who spent over ten terrible years in Russian gulags in the Urals, Karaganda and Kazakhstan, often said to me: 'There are witnesses still living who saw and remember Stalin's genocide, a mass murder that was committed without weapons."
"Stalin's regime ripped out many pages from the annals of European history and your duty is therefore to open archives in the former Soviet Union and to replace those missing pages."
"The memory of the victims is sacred and therefore you must act!'"
"I feel enormously moved that my name, together with the names of my colleagues in the PPE-DE Group and the names of colleagues from other political groups, is to be found at the head of a resolution through which we confirm that European integration is based on a readiness to come to terms with the tragic history of the 20th century."
"May this resolution, coming as it does in 2008, the 75th anniversary of the famine, be a mark of our fellow feeling for the people of Ukraine and especially the survivors of the famine, as well as the families and relatives of the victims."
"May this resolution be a lesson for a new generation which has not experienced persecution."
"Freedom is precious and must not be taken for granted."
"Evil still exists and must be confronted."
"(PL) Madam President, it was only after the collapse of the eastern bloc that we started to become aware of the horrifying truth about what had gone on in Ukraine and other parts of the Soviet Union under Stalin."
"Totalitarianism had prevented the world from finding out about these repulsive crimes against humanity."
"The great famine in Ukraine in 1932-1933 is a historical fact which was denied by the communist authorities throughout the existence of the Soviet Union."
"We now know about countless innocent humans who were condemned to die slowly of starvation."
"Although many years have passed since the Holodomor, we are far from knowing exactly how many people were killed by Stalin's policies."
"I would like to emphasise that any acknowledgment of the great famine as genocide or exposing Stalinist totalitarianism, is not directed against the Kremlin, as it is often misrepresented."
"It is simply paying our respects to the victims of a totalitarian system."
"The European Union, as an international institution which is so dedicated to human rights, should clearly and unambiguously state its position."
"If we want to honour the memory of the victims with dignity and as befits them, we should adopt a resolution which clearly shows the historical truth, and expresses the solidarity and sympathy of the European Union."
"(PL) Madam President, today it is hard for us to imagine what mass starvation means."
"It is also difficult for us to imagine how it was possible for millions of people in Ukraine, which was capable of feeding the whole of Europe, to die of starvation."
"It was a result of totalitarian communism, and took the lives of children, women and men, Ukrainians and of other nationalities living in the then Soviet Union."
"What should we call this crime that was committed 75 years ago?"
"There is only one name for it, and that is genocide."
"For stealing five ears of grain from a collective farm, people were put to death or sent to camps for years."
"Today when we talk of this event, we are not speaking against Russia."
"We want to pay our respects to the victims of communism, and say loudly and clearly: never again such crimes."
"Madam President, honourable Members, I do not know what more can be said in condemnation of a crime as atrocious as that perpetrated by the Stalinist dictatorship, one of the two criminal dictatorships that ravaged Europe last century."
"No further words are needed because those Members that have spoken have done so in a convincing and worthy manner."
"I would like to conclude this debate, Madam President, by reading a few words penned by the great writer Vasilij Grossman, who described the most tragic moments of the Holodomor in his novel Forever Flowing."
"I read it as though it were a sort of secular prayer, a remembrance for millions of victims, with which to associate the memory of so many other innocent victims whose sacrifice, I say again, must not be in vain for Europe."
"The death, last century, of millions of people at the hand of cruel dictatorships must be the seed from which democracy must continue to germinate."
"They must have the opposite effect to the one the criminal dictators intended."
"The European Union, as I said in opening, was born to build peace and to guarantee peace."
"We cannot, however, forget the sacrifice of so many innocent victims."
"I will read to you the simple words with which Grossman recounted that tragedy of many years ago: 'Starvation raised the country to the ground."
"First it took the children, then the old and then the middle-aged."
"In the beginning they dug graves in which to bury the dead; then they stopped when they no longer had the strength."
"The dead lay in the courtyards and in the end stayed in their huts."
"All sank into silence and the whole country was decimated."
"I do not know who was the last to die.'"
"Nous n'oublierons jamais."
"We will never forget those innocent victims, as we seek to build a different future."
"I have received four motions for a resolution under Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"This emotional debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday 23 October."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
", in writing. - (HU) It is my conviction that in addition to deepening integration, the European Parliament must also strive systematically to confront the darkest eras of our common history."
"It is for this reason, then, that I consider it gratifying that today's sitting provides the opportunity to draw attention to the Ukrainian famine, one of the saddest, incomprehensibly forgotten memories of the 20th century Communist dictatorships."
"The arguments surrounding the famine that cost some 3 million human lives are a good illustration of the fact that to this day, that period of history has still not fully been addressed."
"We do not share the opinion of those who attribute the catastrophe purely to the worse-than-average crop yields, the resistance of the Ukrainian population or indeed a few erroneous economic policy decisions."
"We must state explicitly that the Ukrainian tragedy was the direct consequence of a policy of terror raised to state level."
"By putting a stop to forced collectivisation and the confiscation of food stocks, the leaders of the Soviet Union could have saved millions of human lives, but they did not do so."
"It is precisely for this reason that the events of the early 1930s in Ukraine are no different from the most terrible genocides of history."
"In my view, all dictatorships, whether we are talking about the cruelties of National Socialist or Communist systems, spring from the same source."
"We need to seize every possible tool to strengthen the new generations' awareness of the horrible deeds of Communism."
"The creation of a European research institute and memorial to the history of dictatorships could play a significant role in this process."
"in writing. - (PT) It was 75 years ago that the Stalinist machinery set in motion one of the worst crimes that Europe has ever known: the Holodomor, the great famine which took the lives of over three million Ukrainians."
"Having been deprived, as they still are, of important defining elements of their collective identity, Ukrainians were deliberately deprived of food, in a cruel demonstration of 'real socialism' and in a context of forced collectivisation and sovietisation campaigns conducted by one of the most homicidal regimes in history."
"Ukrainians, together with all other Europeans, are today remembering the Communist brutality, tyranny and violence that rained down on them and that constituted, under international law, a clear case of genocide."
"The intention of 'deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part', in the exact words of the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, is absolutely clear."
"One year ago, the President of this Parliament described the Holodomor as a 'terrible crime against humanity'."
"I wholly subscribe to that view and bow my head in memory of the victims."
"I salute all Ukrainians, particularly those who live and work in my country, Portugal."
"Airport charges"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading by Ulrich Stockmann, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on airport charges (08332/2/2008 - C6-0259/2008 -."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after this very moving issue, we now move on to more technical matters."
"We want to pass the directive on airport charges at second reading tomorrow and, after the clear vote in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I am certain that we shall be able to do so."
"What is this directive about?"
"It introduces uniform principles and procedures throughout Europe for levying airport charges."
"This means that transparent bases for calculation, non-discrimination against airlines and a set consultation procedure are some of the factors used to establish fair airport charges."
"An independent supervisory authority can resolve conflicts which arise on the basis of clear rules."
"This will strengthen the systemic partnership between airports and airlines and prevent any possible abuse of market power."
"What was the starting point?"
"Over the past 15 years we have made two attempts to reconcile the conflicting interests of airports and airlines in this area."
"One of the reasons they failed was because we have totally different procedures and structures in the Member States."
"In the United Kingdom, for example, there is a strict regulatory authority which can set ceilings, in five Member States we have airport networks and the practice of cross-subsidy, we have parliaments which decide on airport charges, decentralised competences in Germany and much more besides."
"Nonetheless, we have managed to negotiate a sustainable compromise with the Council."
"What now are the components of this compromise?"
"We have set the scope at airports with over five million passengers a year, plus the largest airports of a Member State."
"At present that means that the directive applies to 69 airports in the European Union."
"We have introduced a compulsory procedure for regular consultation between airports and airlines and, at the same time, we have laid down a structured arbitration procedure with deadlines and, of course, set up the supervisory authority I referred to."
"What do we now mean by fair charges?"
"Airport charges should have a stronger cost reference in future, must be substantiated by transparent calculations and must refer to the agreed level of service."
"At the same time, there is a strict ban on discrimination."
"What this means in principle is that we have the same charges for the same services for every airline at the same airport, with the possibility of differentiation."
"What pleases me is that we have allowed this, first and foremost, for noise and pollution."
"Some countries will continue to have common charging systems for the aforementioned airport networks and for what are referred to as airport systems in towns and conurbations, but these too must meet the transparency requirements of the directive."
"We have tried, by providing for pre-financing of infrastructure through charges, to respond to certain concerns of our colleagues from the eastern European Member States."
"This will be possible, even if difficult on the basis of national criteria, provided that ICAO standards are met."
"What do we expect from the effects?"
"More competition between the European airports, more competition between the various airlines at an airport, perhaps gradually falling ticket prices if the airlines pass the lower charges on to passengers."
"The directive has to be implemented in two years' time."
"My thanks to all the shadow rapporteurs for our successful negotiations and to the Slovenian President-in-Office of the Council and the Commission."
"Madam President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Stockmann, for his excellent work: he has described very well the content of a text, a proposal for a directive, that we are about to adopt."
"It is a proposal that aims to include in Community law certain principles to which all Member States have already subscribed within the framework of the ICAO: non-discrimination, transparency and consultation."
"The framework established by the directive will enable us to structure dialogue between carriers and airports for the setting and collecting of charges."
"For example, the directive will oblige airports to consult the airlines before taking decisions with regard to airport charges."
"I myself proceeded in a similar manner, consulting the airlines and airports before drafting this proposal, which has, in essence, been approved by both parties."
"As Mr Stockmann mentioned, the directive introduces the idea of national independent supervisory authorities."
"These bodies will play an influential role since they will be responsible for ensuring that the basic principles I outlined are respected."
"These are, in broad terms, the aims of the proposal."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur again for the work he carried out at second reading in order to seek agreement with the Council."
"The result, it is true, has taken a lot of work, many meetings and a commitment from us all, but I believe that we have succeeded in producing a good document."
"The results of the negotiations are to be found in a number of amendments that the Commission requires in order to subscribe to it in full."
"I am very pleased that the Committee on Transport and Tourism has also unanimously supported this agreement."
"I am, of course, ready to follow the debate carefully and to take note of all your comments."
"Thank you, Madam President."
"Commissioner, in spite of the rain, this could be a nice day."
"I would like to congratulate both the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur since, by joining forces with the Commission, the Slovenian and then the French presidency, we have succeeded, following lengthy discussions, in achieving a good compromise."
"We, too, are taking a leap in the dark, and so I would appreciate it if Member States were to begin implementation of this directive as soon as possible, and not only after the two-year period that has been negotiated."
"This will allow us to gauge effectively what our legislative activity is worth, and to make the necessary adjustments at the time of the four-year review."
"I hope that the Member States understand this and quickly complete the necessary institutional developments, where needed."
"I trust, as well, that the directive will result in transparent charges and moderate price increases, so that we can prevent predatory airlines from abusing their superior power to gain an advantage over their competitors by offering the same service for lower prices at airports crying out for customers."
"At the same time, we could also ensure airports do not arbitrarily raise their charges in an untransparent manner and, as is often done, by leaps and bounds."
"In both cases, the aim is to ensure that European consumers pay only for what they have actually used."
"This is another reason why we have not allowed the costs of security or of assistance to disabled passengers to be included in the charges."
"I consider it a good compromise that whether or not revenues from an airport's commercial activities may be taken into account is left to the discretion of the Member State in question."
"Similarly, a good result was achieved through the agreement reached regarding airport networks, whereby a common managing body is acceptable, but participants will be subject - as promised by the Commission - to the rules of competition when it comes to setting charges, even if there is a danger of market distortion with respect to nearby airports in other countries."
"The compromise regarding spheres of authority is a good one."
"In addition to having airports whose annual passenger traffic is over 5 million and the airport with the highest passenger movement in each Member State, I myself would have preferred that smaller and possibly competing airports nearby had also been included."
"In order to reach an agreement, however, I abandoned this position, although at the next review I would like to examine this element as well."
"I accept, even if I am not happy, that we have confirmed in the recitals the possibility of pre-financing, referring to ICAO policies, although I would have preferred to see these in the main body of the text."
"I hope that gradual increases in charges, instead of sudden price rises, will be perceived by passengers in a more benign manner, but this too will need to be looked at upon review."
"The result is transparency in financing by the State or other public authorities."
"This is an important factor in the competition between airports, and so is taking into account the perspective of environmental protection."
"I see as the most significant result the fact that each Member State must establish a strong, independent national authority with considerable powers."
"I am proud that the principle whereby, in the event of disputes over establishing the charges, there should not be an endless process of conciliation, was accepted and included in the report."
"Instead, an interim decision should be taken, which can set in motion the conciliation process."
"Thank you very much, Madam President."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, I welcome the report of my colleague, Ulrich Stockmann, and I thank him for his hard work on this difficult dossier."
"All through the process of this report, the concern of my group has been to ensure that the system of airport charges throughout the EU is both fair and transparent, and that a detailed appeals procedure was in place in case of dispute."
"Often people think of aviation as a single industry but, when one examines issues like airport charging, it soon becomes apparent that the airport and airline sectors have different views and aspirations."
"The report before us offers a balanced solution, favouring neither the airlines nor the airports."
"Whilst, personally, I would have preferred the scope to be based on a percentage of national passengers rather than an arbitrary figure, the rapporteur in his report has ensured that the figure is at a reasonable level of five million passengers - not the Commission's ridiculously low figure of one million - and the major airport of a Member State has to be included."
"A key element in the whole of our discussions has been whether certain airports enjoy a dominant trade position."
"My group believes that, where this is the case, airport charges need to be regulated."
"However, many airports are in a competitive situation and airlines are free to choose where they fly into."
"In my region, Manchester Airport has 22 million passengers a year but faces competition from eight airports all within a 150-km radius."
"Clearly, in these circumstances, the market itself is a good regulator."
"I therefore welcome that the UK will be allowed to maintain its present system of monitoring airport charges, because it has in place a regulatory framework that encourages competition and regulates charges through its own supervisory body only at those airports that have a dominant position."
"It may be that other countries could follow this regulatory framework as a way of delivering a fair and transparent airport charges system."
"I hope now that we can agree this directive at its second-reading stage."
"This should help us deliver a directive that will put an end to secret meetings setting charges for airports in a monopolistic or dominant trading position."
"I seriously hope that airlines also recognise that we will now have a transparent system with a detailed appeals procedure, with full consultation, to end the constant complaining about airport charges and work with the airports to deliver a cost-effective, value-for-money service for users and passengers alike."
"Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that no one doubts the need for transparency and justifiability in the European Community's airport charges and costs if, for no reason other than the fact that some of the airports in the Community enjoy a natural monopoly."
"However, from the moment the document was first discussed, the European Parliament has considered very carefully the Commission's proposals and wishes to control more than 150 of the Community's airports."
"When participating in the preparation of various documents, Members of the European Parliament often face the dilemma of deciding how much control and regulation is necessary before they become an end in themselves and paralyse the actual controlling activities."
"This is especially relevant in the current crisis, when sensitivity in considering questions important to business is a true necessity."
"I believe that in the document which is to be voted on tomorrow, the European Parliament has managed to find and defend a happy medium by establishing the number of airports which need to be controlled."
"I am pleased that the Council was also of a similar opinion and the Commission demonstrated the flexibility necessary to find a constructive compromise."
"The other equally important matter was to find a balance between the main players operating in this sector, i.e. the interests of airports and airlines."
"I believe that here we also showed ourselves to be quite capable of satisfying the expectations of both sides."
"All the more so because any one-sided, unbalanced proposal would somehow or other affect EU consumers' opportunities to use the safest means of transport."
"All this was achieved thanks to the professional efforts of the rapporteur."
"Mr Stockmann has always distinguished himself as an impartial politician who listens to all sides."
"This is the fourth time we have worked together in the preparation of air transport regulation documents."
"This time, once again, he did not disappoint, only further enriching me with new experience."
"I would like to thank and congratulate Mr Stockmann and my other colleagues as we end the discussion of this document in the European Parliament."
"I would also like to wish the European Commission success, as it now has the difficult task of implementing and monitoring the effectiveness of this directive, and would like to wish all representatives every success."
"Thank you, Madam President, Mr Tajani, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Stockmann, and all the shadow rapporteurs on the compromise reached with the Council at second reading."
"In my view, the agreement concerning the directive's scope is also to be welcomed, since it will affect every Member State, by regulating at least their main airports."
"I hope that in two years' time, when this directive enters into force, it will no longer be possible in the European Union to have a repetition of such legally incomprehensible court decisions as the one recently handed down by a Lithuanian regional court against a Latvian aviation company and its main airport."
"Through this decision, the court of one Member State is seizing property belonging not only to another country's airport, but also to another country's aviation company in another Member State."
"The court's decision was based on unaccustomed discrimination on airport charges in Latvia's main airport."
"I very much hope that this directive will render such legally unclear interpretations impossible in the future, as they have a detrimental effect on the aviation business."
"Thank you."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, this report is supposed to prevent individual airports from abusing their dominant position in the market, and to create a level playing field for operators and safeguard consumer interests."
"How many times have we heard those kind of arguments before?"
"If implemented, this harmonisation of airport charges is likely to be as successful as the harmonisation that brought us the common agricultural policy, the common fisheries policy and the ever-increasing burden of EU regulation on businesses, which costs the UK at least GBP 26 billion per annum."
"What it will do is require a completely unnecessary change in British law relating to airport charges and transport-related matters."
"It will require the setting-up of a supposedly independent supervisory authority that will add yet another layer of bureaucracy, and the inevitably increased costs that will follow."
"There is, of course, existing price-cap regulation in the UK, designed to incentivise airport operators to achieve cost efficiencies."
"The objective of this continual torrent of legislation is to harmonise every aspect of life in the European Union and bring it under the ultimate authority of the European Union."
"Any other consideration is secondary or unimportant."
"What we can be absolutely sure of is that these measures will mean increased costs to the air traveller."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I think that the previous speaker has simply not understood the dossier."
"What we are doing here is laying down rules for transparent provisions governing the levying of airport charges, the purpose of the whole exercise being to ensure that airport charges are set objectively and to reduce them for the benefit of users."
"That is our job."
"There are in fact two different situations."
"Some airports are so dominant that airlines basically face a monopoly situation and possibly pay overly high airport charges."
"At other, possibly small airports, an airline can decide whether or not to use the airport on the basis of how low the airport charges are, which is a totally different situation."
"I must therefore say that what Mr Stockmann has achieved in his report - and my thanks to him - is a good list of criteria for establishing correct, properly substantiated airport charges, which also have to be borne by passengers, with a national supervisory authority acting as the control body."
"Mr Vice-President, you will, of course, have to ensure over the next two years that the national supervisory authorities truly are independent."
"This means that national supervisory authorities must not be linked to airports or married to airlines."
"We insist that the supervisory authorities strike a fair balance between airlines and airports for the benefit of users."
"Secondly, using these new criteria, we also want to foster fairer competition between airports."
"In some cases, there are airports in two different Member States just a few kilometres from the border between them."
"We want to be sure that there is no unfair competition here."
"I believe that the new criteria are correct."
"Allow me to close with a question to you, Mr Vice-President."
"I believe that nearly two years have passed since the Commission issued guidelines for regional airports."
"Over the last few months, you have been investigating whether there have been illegal subsidies at some airports, by which I mean state subsidies for specific airports that distort competition."
"We should all like to know what your conclusions were."
"We hope that you can promise us today that you will present the investigation on illegal or legal regional aid soon, because there is one overriding issue here: we want fair competition between airports for the benefit of passengers."
"(RO) I would like to congratulate Mr Stockmann for his efforts in achieving a common position for the Council with a view to adopting the directive which sets down common principles for the levying of airport charges at Community airports."
"For airport users, the proposed legislation now gives a framework for charge setting which involves them in making the decisions, which is transparent and which allows appeals."
"The Council accepted Parliament's proposal to limit the scope to airports with more than 5 million passengers annually and the largest airport in each Member State."
"Differentiation in airport charges has to be based on transparent, objective and clear criteria."
"In accordance with the common position, airports need to operate on a cost-efficient basis and incentives will be allowed for new routes to disadvantaged and outermost regions."
"However, these incentives must be granted on the basis of transparent criteria."
"We support the idea, according to the information from the Commission in accordance with Community legislation, that Member States can authorise an airport managing body to apply a common, transparent charging system to airports which serve the same city or conurbation, provided that each airport fully complies with the requirements on transparency set out in the directive."
"In addition, environmental criteria will become grounds for adapting airport charges."
"The airport managing body will publish decisions on modifying the charging system at least two months before they enter into force."
"With regard to pre-financing airport investments, Member States should refer to ICAO policies or establish their own safeguards."
"Parliament considers that it is necessary for independent supervisory authorities to be able to delegate to other independent supervisory authorities, at their entire responsibility, the application of the directive's provisions, subject to compliance with the same standards."
"(PL) Madam President, Commissioner, I would also like to join those congratulating Mr Stockmann on the result of his work."
"The issue we are discussing needs regulation, and such regulation does not disturb my liberal spirit, nor do regulatory institutions."
"We can see now, after the financial crisis, that the free market should work and does work, but we must create systems which are capable of regulating in a modern economy the mechanisms that occasionally get stuck or go beyond the usual mechanisms of economic competition, of pure free-market competition."
"We are now debating the final draft of a certain document, of a work which we all realised right from the outset would be a long road, as regulating any natural monopoly - and airports are, for obvious reasons, usually subject to the rules of natural monopolies - is difficult."
"It is a step forward in the interests of our citizens, in the interests of the citizens of the European Union, who will once again receive something tangible which affects their life from this House and the work of the European Commission."
"I congratulate those who participated in its work and, hopefully, in the two years during which the system is implemented, Member States will measure up to the task."
"(PT) Many of us here in this House use the Internet to book our flights and buy our tickets."
"However, I believe that most of us do not know how the airport charges that are paid together with the tickets are set."
"As I know, however, that not all charges mentioned on the ticket are airport charges, I would ask you to humour me in a little exercise: if a passenger flies from Lisbon to Brussels, for example, by Brussels Airlines, the charge mentioned on the ticket is EUR 48; if he travels by the Portuguese airline TAP, the charge is EUR 2 less."
"However, in the other direction, this difference disappears and the passenger is treated to EUR 15 extra in charges per journey."
"Why?"
"However, if our imaginary passenger travels to London by Brussels Airlines, flying from Brussels to Gatwick Airport, the charges for a return journey are EUR 124, but if he uses BMI to fly to Heathrow, he only pays EUR 65 in charges."
"If he travels to Heathrow with BMI and returns with Lufthansa, he now pays EUR 70 in charges."
"Why these differences?"
"Sometimes he pays one amount on the outward journey and another amount on the return journey."
"Sometimes airlines all charge the same amount for the same airport and sometimes they do not."
"In some cases, you might not even know how much you have paid."
"The existence of different airport charges is not a bad thing, however."
"Different services must have different charges."
"What is not desirable is for the same charges to apply to different services and, conversely, for apparently identical services to be subject to different charges."
"In particular, what we want is for these charges to be comprehensive and to be set according to clear and transparent criteria."
"That is our ultimate goal."
"We want to ensure fair and transparent competition between the major European airports and, in this way, not only help to refine the internal market, but also reduce the costs incurred by passengers when they buy their tickets."
"That is why, with hope in our hearts, we support this proposal for a directive."
"(ES) Madam President, I must firstly congratulate my colleague, Mr Stockmann, on his magnificent report, and particularly on his patience and tenacity in taking this forward."
"It is a text that will help us to create a common airspace and prepare, with particular emphasis on transparency and non-discrimination, for what will become the great leap into the single European sky."
"Through this common system for the collection of user charges, we will be able to maintain the necessary conditions for fair and transparent competition."
"We will also be preparing for the future due to taking account of environmental criteria in the modulation of charges and also due to excluding charges for assistance provided to passengers with disabilities."
"In this respect too, we are preparing for the future."
"I must also highlight the consideration given to the need to avoid an excessive burden on small airports, through the setting of a minimum limit of five million passengers per year."
"Finally, we are delighted that the management of airport networks by a single body has been recognised, given that this has been proven to work well - as in the case of the Spanish airports authority, AENA - and that other ways of controlling and setting charges subject to legislative scrutiny have been taken into account - which is also the case in my country - in addition to through the independent supervisory authorities."
"I am therefore pleased that these proposals have been taken into account."
"I must also congratulate the rapporteur on having set firm deadlines for the publication of decisions."
"This will avoid legal uncertainty and offer guarantees to users as to when these decisions will be implemented."
"This is also positive because parliamentary scrutiny is taken into account in these deadlines and decisions."
"Madam President, I welcome the increased transparency introduced by these new rules on airport charges."
"Too often, airports are secretive about the deals they strike, even when they are owned or part-owned by public authorities."
"The public has a right to know how such airports are raising and spending their money."
"But I am disappointed that the threshold for greater reporting has been set at five million, with no reference to percentage national market share."
"This threshold will hit particularly hard regional airports such as Newcastle."
"With six million passengers a year, Newcastle comes above the threshold, yet it is a minnow compared to the giants of Heathrow and Gatwick."
"Since regional airports compete mainly with their nearest neighbours, it would have been fairer to have had a system which treated all small and medium-sized airports in the same way."
"I therefore regret that the Council did not pursue the option of confining the scope of the directive to airports with over five million passenger movements per annum and over 15% of national passenger movements."
"Such a threshold would still have ensured that Europe's big airports could not dictate airline charges behind closed doors."
"I hope that, when the Commission reviews the directive, it will look carefully at whether regional airports like Newcastle are suffering from market distortion."
"(PT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by congratulating Mr Stockmann on his openness and readiness to compromise during the preparation of this excellent report, which will directly apply to airports with over five million passengers and, in particular, to the airports of Faro and Lisbon in my country."
"This proposal must be adopted by this Parliament and by the Council because it guarantees non-discrimination in airport charges, except where necessary and compatible with the Treaty."
"A compulsory procedure for consultation between airport managing bodies and airport users should be put in place."
"Any differences in charges will be transparent and based on clear criteria."
"Airports will levy the same charge for the same service, although discounts may be granted to airport users based on the quality of a service used, provided that all airport users can benefit from this discount under public, transparent and objective conditions."
"Discounts may also be granted to users who open new routes in accordance with competition law."
"A national independent supervisory authority should be established which will intervene in the event of disagreement over a charging decision."
"Incentives should be permitted for the launch of new routes linking the least-favoured and outermost regions."
"Finally, Member States should be able to authorise the managing body responsible for an airport network to introduce a charging system common to this network."
"Madam President, with this new directive, future airport charges levied at our airports, and even in outermost regions such as the one that I come from, will guarantee universal access for all to air transport."
"This is particularly important in a region such as mine where air transport is the only way of arriving or departing."
"That is why I hope that this proposal will be adopted tomorrow and that the Commission and the Council will duly accept it."
"Madam President, I echo the thanks of my colleagues to Mr Stockman for what I think he described as a workable compromise in the interests of 69 European airports."
"I also share the words of Mr Becsey, and indeed of my colleague Brian Simpson, about fair and transparent competition."
"I am happy that this report, as it is presented now, is a good deal, not just for London's three airports of Heathrow, Stansted and Gatwick, but for the airports of the rest of Europe, whether it is Mr Zīle's Latvia, Mrs Ţicău's Romania, or Portugal, and indeed for the Commissioners - Italian airports, and I believe there are airports in Germany as well, although not many people go to them."
"But I think, also, it is a good deal for Europe's passengers and, of course, airports are nothing without the citizens, the passengers."
"They are our priority, as - equally - is the environment, which I think is addressed by this report."
"Mr Batten, my London colleague, in what could best be described as his hit-and-run contribution (because he has gone away), suggested that there were going to be new bodies set up and all sorts of other scaremongering."
"But those bodies - the Civil Aviation Authority - exist already."
"So I think that is a misunderstanding on his part - to be polite to him."
"And, to Fiona Hall, I am not sure that Newcastle is in direct competition with London."
"There is a good distance between the two of them, and anybody who chooses to go into London rather than Newcastle has still got a tremendous distance to go."
"So I think you are not comparing like with like there."
"I think that this is a good, workable compromise."
"I think all the original concerns that we wanted to address have been covered and, as a package, it does provide the balance - in the interests of airlines and in the interests of passengers - that we were looking for, whilst allowing the airports sufficient freedom to operate in a competitive environment."
"I live in hope that, as a result of this, we might one day - you never know, colleagues, you never know - we might just get a decent service into Strasbourg."
"It is a long shot, but you never know - and it is worth working for."
"(PL) Madam President, I would like to start by voicing my thanks to Ulrich Stockmann, our rapporteur."
"He has got through a great deal of work, starting with the draft directive, which he approached in an innovative way, as he wanted to properly prepare the report in collaboration with the Commission and the Council, in which he was successful."
"Above all, I would like to emphasise his initiative in refining the definition of airport charges, and secondly the airports we are covering, and the service levels of airports and their correlation with the obligations of airport operators."
"Of equal importance, especially for the new Member States, is the funding of new infrastructure projects."
"We are delivering a draft directive which, from the passenger's viewpoint, will allow those of us in Europe who use, run or pay for services to know how much we will have to pay, why, and where the money is going."
"This is a major step towards creating a real European system and European airlines network."
"I thank you for this, and deeply believe that this draft directive will serve civil aviation well."
"(CS) Smoothly functioning airport services are important to the functioning of the internal market of the European Union."
"Both passengers and airline companies criticise the lack of transparency and sometimes also the excessively high airport taxes which add to the cost of travel to an unjustifiable extent."
"We are finally responding to this with the passing of this directive at its second reading."
"The regulations will oblige airports with more than five million passengers to make their fees transparent and to justify their costs."
"It will also simplify disputes between airport users and airport operators."
"I firmly believe that this will lead to a reduction in charges and that it will improve the competitive environment."
"I am delighted that the Council has also recognised the opening up of the bidding process, which will contribute to the opening of new routes to disadvantaged and more out-of-the-way destinations, and that it has been possible to arrive at a common definition for the networks of airports which will be operated by the same management bodies."
"I congratulate the rapporteurs on these results."
"(PL) Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Stockmann deserves our gratitude."
"This is indeed a good compromise."
"I congratulate him."
"Today we are finalising work on airport charges."
"In short, in two years' time, we will have a consolidated system for levying these charges throughout the European Union."
"It will affect airports with more than five million passenger movements per annum, and the largest airports in a particular country."
"They may still be debatable, but I believe the figures are good."
"As far as I am aware, this will affect some 80 airports in the European Union."
"A particular virtue of the regulations adopted are their transparency, which will help the supervisory authorities."
"Airports in unfavourable regions will be able to apply the relevant preferences."
"It also considered the environmental aspects and the situation of disabled people."
"I hope that the directive will provide not only fair competition at airports, but also result in increased passenger safety, and protect passengers from excessive take-off or landing fees."
"Madam President, I think the debate has shown that Parliament and the Commission have done a good job, and the praise directed at Mr Stockmann serves only to confirm that he has taken the right course."
"I would like to thank him publicly once again for his work and cooperation with the Commission in finding a successful compromise solution which, as far as I can see, has been appreciated by all those who have taken the floor."
"I believe that the proposal for a directive that we are examining, and which I hope can be adopted by this House, as Mrs Ayala Sender said, is non other than a step towards achieving the single sky, a goal that, in my view, the Commission, with Parliament's support and then with the backing of the Council, must be pursued in order to send out a strong message before the end of this parliamentary term."
"I endorse all the choices and judgments made on the establishment of the independent authority, which already exists in many countries of the Union."
"I think that we should pursue this; it is a positive choice we have made together."
"Before I conclude, I would again like to thank all the Members who have contributed to the debate, and to answer the question asked by Mr Jarzembowski."
"There are seven regional airports being considered."
"The proceedings, lasting 18 months, were opened in July 2007."
"I therefore do not expect the results to arrive before the end of this year or the beginning of next year."
"Naturally, the results will be made public, but it would be unfair and improper of me to make any comment before the work is completed."
"However, as soon as it is, and as soon as the Commission has made a decision, Parliament will be informed and then Mr Jarzembowski will have a full answer, in addition to the information I have been able to give, relating to the Commission's proposals for the seven - I would emphasise this, the seven - cases being examined."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, I should like once again to thank all my fellow Members for their truly constructive cooperation and for our exciting discussions."
"I am counting on a great deal of support tomorrow."
"It is late and enough words have been exchanged."
"Let actions follow tomorrow."
"I would be delighted if we could complete the legislative procedure at second reading."
"(Applause)"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday 23 October."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (RO) A European framework for regulating airport charges is of major importance in terms of reducing the cost for people travelling within the European Union and therefore, of increasing workers' mobility, especially those who are highly qualified."
"Worker mobility is actually a key element in an effective labour market, in the context set out in the relevant chapter of the Lisbon Strategy, aimed at economic growth and increasing the number of jobs."
"Furthermore, facilitating the movements of highly qualified workers would lead to an increase in information flow and in useful knowledge in the production areas with high added value, in keeping with the aim of the Lisbon Strategy to transform the European economy into the most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world."
"Ladies and gentlemen, a compromise has been reached between the Council and our institution, thus making it possible to conclude this matter at second reading."
"I am delighted with this agreement, which should in particular prevent abuses of a dominant position and facilitate the balanced development of the European airport sector."
"This directive on airport charges is a real step forward: by making relations between airports and airlines more transparent, it will enable what are often opaque and conflictual relationships to be enhanced and improved."
"Moreover, the introduction of an independent authority is going to make it possible to resolve any conflicts between the partners objectively."
"The beneficiaries of these new rules should, ultimately, be air transport users, and I am delighted about that."
"Thank you for your attention."

"Annual report on the European Ombudsman's activities in 2007 (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Zdravkova, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the annual report on the European Ombudsman's activities in 2007."
"Ombudsman. - Madam President, thank you for this opportunity to address Parliament on the annual report of the European Ombudsman for 2007."
"I also wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Zdravkova, and the Committee on Petitions for their excellent and constructive report."
"My report records progress in handling complaints, promoting good administration and providing knowledge about the Ombudsman's role."
"The number of admissible complaints increased, in both absolute and relative terms, from 449 (12% of the total) in 2006 to 518 (16% of the total) in 2007."
"We therefore met both of the objectives which Parliament has consistently emphasised: increasing the number of admissible complaints and reducing the number of inadmissible complaints."
"The main types of maladministration alleged in admissible complaints were: lack of transparency, including refusal of information; unfairness or abuse of power; unsatisfactory procedures; avoidable delay; discrimination; negligence; legal error; and failure to ensure fulfilment of obligations."
"Three hundred and forty-eight decisions closing inquiries were made."
"That represents a 40% increase compared to 2006."
"In 95 cases, the inquiry revealed no maladministration."
"Such a finding is not always negative for the complainant, who at least has the benefit of a full explanation from the institution concerned."
"Even when maladministration is not found, I may identify opportunities to improve the quality of administration provided by institutions."
"If so, I point them out in a further remark."
"Many of my inquiries result in a positive sum outcome that satisfies both the complainant and the institution complained against."
"One hundred and twenty-nine cases were settled by the institution concerned to the satisfaction of the complainant."
"That is double the number of cases settled in this way in 2006, and reflects a growing willingness on the part of institutions and bodies to regard complaints made to the Ombudsman as an opportunity to recognise and put right mistakes that have occurred."
"When I find maladministration, I try to achieve a friendly solution."
"In some cases, this can be achieved by the institution or body concerned by offering compensation to the complainant."
"Any such offer is made ex gratia, or in other words without admission of legal liability and without creating a legal precedent."
"When a friendly solution is not possible I close the case with a critical remark."
"A critical remark is also appropriate if it is no longer possible for the instance of maladministration to be eliminated."
"It confirms that the complaint is justified and indicates to the institution or body concerned what it is has done wrong."
"Such a criticism is intended to be constructive, so as to help avoid similar maladministration in the future."
"It is important for institutions and bodies to follow up critical remarks and to take prompt action to resolve outstanding problems."
"To better monitor the impact of my criticism, I launched a study of the follow-up to all critical remarks, and to the cases involving a further remark, made in 2006."
"The results of that study, published on my website and sent to all the bodies concerned, should provide encouragement to the European public service to improve practices and further develop a culture of service to citizens."
"In cases where it is still possible to eliminate the instance of maladministration, I normally make a draft recommendation to the institution or body."
"If it fails to respond satisfactorily, I may send a special report to Parliament."
"I submitted one such report to you criticising the Commission for not dealing with an infringement complaint concerning the European Working Time Directive."
"I welcome Parliament's support, as expressed in your resolution of 3 September 2008, based on Mr De Rossa's report."
"This year, I have again included star cases in my annual report."
"These are cases where I consider that institutions or bodies involved responded to my inquiries in an exemplary fashion."
"Seven such star cases are highlighted."
"Four of these concerned the Commission, one concerned the Council, one the European Central Bank and one the European Aviation Safety Agency."
"I have continued to make every effort to ensure that EU institutions and bodies adopt a citizen-centred approach in all their activities, by seeking every opportunity to achieve friendly solutions and by launching more own-initiative inquiries in order to identify problems and encourage best practice."
"I would now like to mention some other activities undertaken with a view to ensuring the best possible service to citizens."
"I have continued my efforts to improve the quality of information concerning rights under EU law, provided especially through the European Network of Ombudsmen."
"That network, which includes the Petitions Committee, cooperates in case handling and in sharing experiences and best practice."
"One of the purposes of the network is to facilitate the rapid transfer of complaints which are admissible for me to a competent ombudsman or similar body."
"When possible, I transfer cases directly or give suitable advice to the complainant."
"During 2007 I was able to help 867 complainants in this manner."
"A further important initiative which should come to fruition within the next quarter of the year is that my office is developing an interactive guide to help citizens find the most appropriate avenue of redress for their grievances."
"This guide should enable an even greater proportion of complainants to address directly the body best equipped to deal with the complaint."
"Complaints which are inadmissible for me will therefore be resolved more promptly and effectively."
"My institution will then be better able to fulfil its core role - to help citizens who are unhappy with the way they are being treated by EU institutions and bodies."
"The Ombudsman cannot work alone."
"Ensuring a top-class administration is a task that must be fulfilled proactively in cooperation with EU institutions and bodies."
"The increased settlement of cases and friendly solutions is a source of encouragement and serves as an indication of our mutual efforts to contribute to building citizens' trust, vis-à-vis the Union, at a point in time where that is greatly needed."
"I am also deeply grateful for Parliament's support and guidance, both in terms of the budgetary resources you provide my institution with and in terms of the positive relationship I enjoy with the Petitions Committee."
"With your continued support, I will endeavour to build on the achievements of this past year."
"Finally, as this is the last occasion during this parliamentary term that I have the honour of presenting my annual report to this House, I would like to put on record my deep appreciation for the close cooperation and good advice that I have received from Parliament and individual Members during the past four and a half years."
"(Applause)"
"You are absolutely right."
"This Parliament has shown confidence in the Ombudsman."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, on behalf of the Commission and of my colleague, Vice-President Wallström, let me thank the rapporteur Mrs Zdravkova for her excellent work."
"We welcome the Committee on Petitions' report about the Ombudsman's annual report on his activities in 2007."
"As you know, this Commission has made a strong commitment to improving its administration, and we are improving."
"We can see that, both from the Ombudsman's Annual Report and from the Committee on Petitions report."
"In 2007 the number of cases in which an institution or a body actually put an end to maladministration practices as a result of a complaint lodged with the Ombudsman doubled."
"This reflects the willingness of institutions - including, definitely, the Commission - and bodies to regard complaints as an opportunity to correct errors and cooperate with the Ombudsman in the public interest."
"Also, the number of cases in which no maladministration practice was established increased."
"The Commission is happy about this, since we are the institution that receives most of these complaints."
"I also want to underline the fact that the Ombudsman has been proposing an increasing number of friendly solutions in order to settle disputes and that, overall, the Commission has been cooperative and appreciative of this type of proposal, wherever possible."
"In 2007, only one special report concerning the Commission was submitted to Parliament by the Ombudsman, and the Ombudsman mentioned this."
"But I would like to remind you that this special report concerns the Working Time Directive, and it was only last month that you had a discussion on that with my colleague Vladimir Špidla."
"Let me conclude with three specific points which are touched upon in your report as well as the Ombudsman's Annual Report."
"First, on infringements."
"As you are aware, the Commission has reorganised its decision-taking on infringements, with a view to facilitating the progress of cases."
"This was presented in the 2007 communication 'A Europe of results - applying Community law'."
"We are following up cases more actively and organising the work more effectively for citizens."
"Also, an EU pilot project has been launched."
"More solutions to problems should be found more quickly."
"Second, on the call for EU institutions and bodies to adopt a common approach towards a European code of good administrative behaviour."
"I want to draw your attention to the fact that the Commission has its own code of good administrative behaviour, adopted in 2000."
"This code still constitutes a modern and very effective instrument."
"Its implementation is well established."
"I do not want to prejudge the future, but for the time being we want to keep things that way."
"Third, regarding the communication policy."
"The idea of launching an information campaign for European citizens to help them find out more about the duties and competences of the European Ombudsman is definitely welcomed by the Commission."
"Each institution, including the European Commission, also has its own website, where complaints and petitions may be lodged."
"The Europa website is common to all EU institutions and has links to all other EU institutions, including the Ombudsman's website."
"In this way, citizens are easily and smoothly directed to the bodies able to settle their grievances and complaints."
"The idea of an interactive manual designed to assist citizens in identifying the most suitable forum for resolving their problems is well worth studying much more closely."
"Because in all this, we should never lose sight of who comes first and who we do all this for: the European citizens."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Mr Diamandouros, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur Mrs Zdravkova on her report, which I believe is her first."
"It forms an excellent foundation for the debate and the discussion on the results of your work over the past year, Mr Diamandouros."
"This report follows on, to a certain extent, from the report which I produced for the European Parliament at the same point two years ago."
"At that time, you had just launched the network of national ombudsmen and committees on petitions and it seems clear from the report that this network has been extremely well received by the citizens of Europe who are the main focus of your work."
"In addition, your education campaign, which has resulted in more admissible complaints being received, is a successful example of the fact that efforts to educate citizens about their rights and their opportunities for obtaining help are well worthwhile."
"I also strongly welcome the fact that the report, in a similar way to the report produced by Mr Mavrommatis a few years ago, highlights the success of the informal procedures which you want to concentrate on more closely."
"This success is due to the fact that the time spent on formalities can be reduced."
"It is good for you to continue with this citizen-centred approach."
"Some examples of your work over the past year demonstrate your ability to act, but also your sensitivity towards the general public in Europe, both in relation to the European Working Time Directive and the internal organisation of the European Parliament."
"Of course, it is not always easy for you to find the right words."
"However, weak points must be exposed by the Ombudsman with a certain amount of advance notice and appropriate restraint."
"In the end, it is all about us working together to serve the citizens of Europe."
"You have made a very positive contribution towards this over the past year, Mr Diamandouros."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (GA) Madam President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Zdravkova, for her work on this report."
"The office of the Ombudsman is clearly improving."
"We have long complained that there are too many complaints being made to that office which do not relate to its function."
"Last year, for the very first time, that number has reduced and I congratulate him for that work."
"The Ombudsman's interactive handbook is a creative solution that assists citizens in finding the proper institution for their complaint and I think it could be used more widely."
"If we are to demonstrate to the citizens of the European Community that this Union is working on their behalf, we must ensure that they get answers and solutions to their problems."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on a very comprehensive report and also the Ombudsman and his staff on the many positive steps that they took in 2007."
"What I find most encouraging is that the Ombudsman works at so many different levels: it is not just about processing complaints, which is central to his work, but also about how resolutions or solutions are arrived at."
"There is an increasing number of friendly solutions, more informal procedures, where relations with the institutions are such that a growing number of cases are solved rapidly."
"That is real progress and must be built on."
"Citizen-friendly solutions are where we want to go."
"I am also pleased to see that better communication at all levels is central to the agenda of the Ombudsman."
"The adoption of the European Network of Ombudsmen statement and increased cooperation in this area are vital, and we look forward to the launch of the new website, which will include an interactive guide to assist citizens."
"However, this brings me to my final comment, which concerns citizens, and refers to the proposed oral amendment on paragraph 23."
"That paragraph reads: 'Proposes that the Ombudsman take measures to reduce the number of complaints (a total of 1 021) in relation to which no steps have been taken by him at all'."
"The oral amendment seeks to change that final phrase - 'in relation to which no steps have been taken by him at all' - to the statement 'in such cases where no action is possible'."
"From the perspective of the Ombudsman, no action is possible; but from the perspective of the citizen, no action is taken - and those are two very different perspectives."
"So I have a question: is it made clear to the 1 021 citizens that no action is possible by the Ombudsman, with a clear explanation given with further advice where possible, or is it the case that simply no action is taken?"
"If the former is true and citizens are given reasons, I have no problem and, indeed, I am very pleased."
"But if the latter is true and no action is taken, then citizens will be frustrated and angry."
"So I would like clarification on that point, please."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DA) Madam President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for her splendid report."
"It is a fine piece of work, and we were particularly delighted with the considerable willingness there was to cooperate."
"I also wish to thank the Ombudsman for his brilliant annual report."
"The institution of the Ombudsman is, of course, incredibly important for the EU."
"Its work shows that the EU is closer to Europeans than it is reputed to be, listening as it does to criticism."
"Happily, it is on the right lines."
"Far more complaints than last year were resolved to the complainants' satisfaction through the EU institution itself making proper allowance for them."
"It shows that the EU system is coming to understand the need to serve people as best as possible."
"Unfortunately, there are institutions that do not comply with the recommendations."
"In such circumstances, all that the Ombudsman can do is place the matter before Parliament - an option he can hardly be accused of misusing, since only one case was presented last year to the Committee on Petitions."
"When a case comes before us in Parliament, we are clearly obliged to say that we are willing, at least in principle, to go to the European Court of Justice if the institution concerned does not comply with the Ombudsman's decision."
"In that way, we can give the Ombudsman the necessary clout and authority in the system."
"On behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I have tabled a couple of amendments, the sole purpose of which is to clarify the concept of maladministration."
"It should be possible to identify those cases in which the Ombudsman can observe that an institution or other EU body has not complied with the rules and principles applicable to it."
"However, there is no maladministration in cases in which the Ombudsman merely notes that there is room for improvement in the way in which the institution handles matters."
"It is that distinction that my amendments are aimed at clarifying."
"Finally, I have a similar question to that raised by Mrs Harkin, concerning when cases are rejected."
"We should like to know why they are rejected."
"The reason should ideally be given in the answers to the complaints, and I want to ask if that is in fact the case, as otherwise matters would be very frustrating, as has already been pointed out."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (EL) Madam President, the report on the European Ombudsman's activities affords us an opportunity to ascertain how citizens view the workings of the institutions of the European Union and gives us practical ideas and examples as to how the institutions of the European Union can improve how they operate and how they serve the citizens."
"I in turn should like to thank the European Ombudsman, Mr Diamandouros, for his exceptional work, and our rapporteur, Mrs Zdravkova, on her very interesting report and take this opportunity to underline certain points:"
"Firstly, the fact that the number of complaints received by the Ombudsman is increasing is a very good thing, but it contradicts the Commission's self-satisfaction in terms of constant improvements to its administration and greater transparency."
"I would advise the Commission to be more honest and more modest."
"It is also a good thing that the number of complaints admitted and the efficacy of the interventions of the European Ombudsman have increased."
"However, the large majority of complaints still concern matters which do not come directly within his jurisdiction."
"There is a large proportion of citizens within the European Union who want greater transparency and sound management both from the European institutions and in the application of Community legislation in general and, unfortunately, they do not always find it."
"That is why the European Parliament has repeatedly called for all the institutions and organisations of the European Union to be given the financial and human resources needed to ensure that citizens receive immediate and in-depth replies to their complaints, questions and referrals."
"We also need cooperation between the European Ombudsman and the ombudsmen in similar organisations at national, regional and local level in the Member States."
"We also need to give a broader, more expansive interpretation to the term 'maladministration', so that it also includes cases in which the administrative authorities demonstrate sloppiness and negligence or a lack of transparency in the performance of their duties towards the citizens."
"This will result in more material interventions on the part of the Ombudsman, which is in the citizens' interests."
"It is also extremely important for the Ombudsman to be able to take up cases relating to all the institutions of the European Union, including those which operate under the third pillar."
"Finally, I should like to reiterate once again the call to all the institutions and organisations of the European Union to adopt a common approach towards a European code of good administrative behaviour."
"It is not enough for us to speak highly of the European Ombudsman...."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Madam President, together with Volvo and IKEA, the institution known as the Ombudsman is Sweden's best-known contribution to the global community."
"It is a very important institutional innovation for democracy in general and the EU institutions in particular."
"Why?"
"Well, because an Ombudsman is there to ensure that people can demand their rights in political and bureaucratic structures that are becoming ever more complex and, thus, non-transparent."
"Nowhere in the democratic world is complexity and non-transparency more dominant than in the byzantine power structure that the EU has established and that it is constantly extending further."
"It is rare for me to feel any enthusiasm for the reports presented here in the European Parliament."
"Whenever I do so, the reports concerned are those relating to the internal market or an environmental issue of some kind. Mrs Zdravkova's report is another exception to my rule, in which we see a picture emerge of the Ombudsman working pretty effectively to fortify individuals against the byzantine hegemony that is unfolding."
"I am thinking of information provided to the general public via a properly updated website, information sheets, networks of national and regional ombudsmen, conferences and, especially, meetings and other contacts with the system's eurocrats, designed to make the latter see that they are there for the benefit of Europeans, rather than Europeans being there for the benefit of them."
"At the same time, it is regrettable that Europe's powerful elite pursues a European project associated by most people with impenetrable and byzantine bureaucracy."
"In anticipation of a grassroots reaction against this development, we in the European Parliament should strengthen the institution of the Ombudsman."
"We should therefore vote in favour of Mrs Zdravkova's report and, especially, welcome the demand that the Ombudsman have full access to EU documents in the course of his investigations."
"(DE) Madam President, the Ombudsman's work is undoubtedly fundamentally good."
"However, you have a blind spot, which is the administration of the European Parliament."
"For example, in April 2007 Mr Eduardo Bugalho, one of the Secretaries-General here, made a firm promise of a position to an employee, Martin Ehrenhauser."
"Then the relatively new Secretary-General Harald Rømer intervened and suddenly the position no longer existed and things were continually put off."
"This has had an effect on me."
"I am probably the only Member of this Parliament who has no member of parliamentary staff available to him at all. Instead of taking up this issue, you have turned a blind eye."
"However, you yourself talk about trust in the institutions of the European Union."
"I was elected by 14% of all the citizens of Austria and I am unable to work in the same way as almost all my fellow Members."
"So you should not be surprised that the level of criticism is growing and that, in Austria in particular, the criticism of the EU as it currently stands - not of Europe - is reaching epidemic proportions."
"Madam President, rather than dealing with the history I will congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report and the Ombudsman for his presentation today and his cooperation with us, and indeed the Commission statement."
"Could I ask, in particular, for consistency in how the Commission deals with citizens?"
"I am concerned that in some cases when an individual brings a case to the Commission the needs and rights of the individual are overtaken by the involvement of the Member State, almost like a victim in a court case being ignored by the prosecution."
"I shall give you an example."
"A constituent of mine complained about the Irish planning laws as they apply in rural areas."
"The action of the Commission in handling that case was exemplary in their dealings with the citizen in meeting and engaging."
"However, as the case moved on, I am afraid that declined - I believe, in favour of the Member State to the absolute frustration of the citizen."
"I know this person and they were very pleased initially and are now very frustrated."
"In other words, the citizen who brings forward the information, who provides the impetus for action is forgotten about in the ongoing process."
"I think, Commissioner, when you asked the question 'Who comes first?', you said it was the EU citizens."
"I am not so sure."
"Madam President, I am extremely satisfied with the work of the Ombudsman as explained in his annual report and in his speech."
"The European Ombudsman is a vital part of the democratic structure and functioning of the Union."
"The largest proportion of the Ombudsman's inquiries concern lack of transparency and refusal to provide information."
"This is an area of our activities that we must improve if we are to become more credible in the eyes of citizens."
"It is important that we support the work of the Ombudsman and that of the Committee on Petitions."
"Both deal with the handling of complaints and petitions on EU matters from citizens that help us to find out what is not working at European level and to take corrective measures."
"Cases being brought to the Ombudsman and to the Committee on Petitions are of increasing complexity and therefore require greater investment of resources by the institutions in order that citizens' concerns are properly addressed."
"If these concerns are properly addressed, then we will be making some progress towards improving the credibility of, and confidence in, the Union as a whole."
"(BG) Ladies and gentlemen, the European Ombudsman's report for 2007 demonstrates how beneficial its activities are as a champion of citizens's rights when these have been infringed, or the European institutions threaten to do so."
"I welcome the fact that the number of admissible complaints has increased, as this proves that Europe's citizens are becoming increasingly aware of the real power of the Ombudsman."
"I believe that this institution must have the necessary financial and human resources to enable it to effectively and fully carry out its mission."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European code of good administrative behaviour are and must continue to be a model and a basis for the activities of the public protector of the principles of good administration such as transparency, accountability, legality and fairness on the part of the European institutions."
"In this respect, we need to increase information campaigns among citizens by the Ombudsman to raise awareness of their rights and the Ombudsman's powers to stand up for them, and its cooperation with national Ombudsmen in exchanging good practice."
"The introduction of an internet manual is a helpful initiative, but setting up a public on-line register for complaints would increase transparency and help increase the trust of citizens."
"- (PL) Madam President, certain European Union citizens seem to treat the European Ombudsman as if he were a God, requesting him to resolve issues and deal with matters that are clearly outside his competence."
"This is underlined by the fact that, for procedural reasons, the Ombudsman can only consider one in six of the complaints he receives."
"We must conclude that there is a total lack of knowledge as to what the European Ombudsman's function and remit are, and how far the scope of his action extends."
"The citizens of the Member States are not to blame for this situation."
"The blame lies with the Union's institutions, which have not succeeded in informing public opinion in the Member States about the scope of the Ombudsman's remit."
"Unless something is done about this, citizens of the Member States will continue to write to the Ombudsman and then be surprised that he cannot intervene."
"The fact that more than one thousand of the complaints addressed to the Ombudsman were not considered and no action was taken on them is also cause for concern, as was mentioned in the report."
"(NL) Madam President, the report by the Committee on Petitions is, in essence, very constructive and very positive about the work of the European Ombudsman, and I can personally endorse this view to a large extent."
"I would, however, take the opportunity that is being given to me to draw the Ombudsman's attention to the systematic way in which the European Parliament itself, and, in fact, the Commission to an even greater extent, are ignoring and infringing a number of very clear legal rules, and, in a number of matters, indulge in hidden and therefore, if you think about it, undemocratic decision-making."
"More specifically, in my view, the European Ombudsman should in next year's report, and I would ask him to do this, focus on the way in which the rejection of the Treaty of Lisbon as a result of a democratic referendum in Ireland, rendering this Treaty legally null and void, is deliberately and repeatedly ignored in documents and in decision-making by all European institutions."
"I hope that the Ombudsman is prepared to take on this task and as such ..."
"(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, the Ombudsman is an independent institution and a mechanism for controlling the administration of the European Union."
"The fact that the number of admissible complaints received by the Ombudsman increased in 2007, while the number of inadmissible complaints fell in 2007, compared with 2006, is proof of the fact that European citizens have started to understand the remit of this institution."
"Furthermore, I in turn welcome the efforts made by Mr Diamandouros to improve the standard of information provided to citizens in connection with their rights under Community law during his time in this position."
"Mrs Zdravkova also deserves hearty congratulations on having achieved unanimous decisions and cooperation in her first report for our committee."
"The European Network of Ombudsmen, to which the Committee on Petitions of the European Parliament also belongs, has approximately 90 offices in 31 countries."
"Consequently, even at this level, the cooperation of both the network and of the European Ombudsman are valuable in achieving the objective of transmitting complaints to the competent Ombudsman or agency as quickly as possible."
"Finally, the European Parliament and the Committee on Petitions should help the Ombudsman to achieve his twin objective of promoting sound administration by the institutions and improving communication with the citizens. Thank you."
"Madam President, I should like to say to the Ombudsman that it has been a really interesting debate: sniped at by Hans-Peter Martin, lauded as a god by another."
"I think it shows that he has probably - just about - got it right."
"Ombudsman, Parliament does not always place you in a very comfortable position when you are called upon especially to rule on decisions that we take and the actions of this House."
"I see that I have excited Hans-Peter Martin - how wonderful!"
"But let me just tell you, Ombudsman, that you always carry out your work in a constructive way and absolutely within your competences."
"Probably the reason why we have seen an increase in your workload is because you have been so effective in promoting your work and your office, and I congratulate you on that."
"It leaves me nothing more than to say that it is an excellent report."
"I look forward to contributions from other colleagues, but also I enjoy working with you, not the least in relation to access to documents, but also as Vice-Chair of the Committee on Petitions."
"(Applause)"
"(FI) Madam President, my thanks go to the Ombudsman and his entire office for the valuable work they have done to deliver excellent administration and transparency."
"It is very important for our citizens that when there is a grievance, they can lodge a complaint about it and can be sure that the matter will be dealt with properly and satisfactorily, and that is what happens."
"I also wish to thank the Ombudsman for having shown the strength to fight, almost in vain one might say, for greater transparency in the administration of the European Union."
"We know that there is really a lot to do with regard to this."
"Progress is slow, but let us be glad about each small step and let us keep banging our heads..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(MT) Thank you Madam President."
"I also wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Zdravkova, as well as the Ombudsman for all his hard work."
"I believe that what unites us in this debate is simple: it is the defence of our citizens, the fact that we can all agree that we must stand guard over our citizens' rights; that we act as their shield, and that when they find themselves having to deal with unfair authorities and unjust bureaucratic procedures, they should not be made to feel abandoned."
"On the contrary, they should have every faith that we stand behind them."
"Therefore, since these are the common factors that bring us together, let us go on working together."
"In times like these, when our citizens are feeling rather detached from the European Union, it is essential that the Ombudsman, the Commission and the Committee on Petitions work towards building up the consumer's trust towards the European Union, brick by brick. Let us go on working together to prove that we are indeed worthy of that trust."
"(EL) Madam President, Ombudsman, I have noted the rapporteur's phrase expressing her support for the role of the Ombudsman as a valuable source of constant improvement to the European administration."
"The more citizens who know about the institution of the Ombudsman, the better Europe will be; it will be a Europe which is not frightened to address and rectify its weaknesses."
"That is why it is particularly important for the code of good administrative behaviour to be applied by all the institutions and organisations."
"That is why a broad interpretation of the concept of maladministration is particularly useful."
"If we speak of active citizenship, we cannot at the same time, when citizens take recourse to the institutions of the European Union in order to enforce their rights, be unable to give a basic response to their concerns or, even worse, be unable to safeguard the fundamental values of the European Union."
"- (PL) Madam President, despite the overall increase in the number of admissible complaints received by the Ombudsman in 2007, he handled 17% more than in the previous year."
"In this connection, it should be emphasised that the number of inadmissible complaints has decreased dramatically in comparison to 2006, which suggests that complainants are better informed about the Ombudsman's competences."
"It emerges from the report that last year the Ombudsman carried out his duties in an active and balanced manner."
"This is true of his consideration of petitions, of his work maintaining constructive relations with the European Union's bodies and institutions and also of his efforts to encourage citizens to exercise their rights."
"Nonetheless, there is still a lot of work to be done to ensure that the citizens receive swift and accurate responses to their questions, complaints and petitions."
"Above all, the causes of the complaints must be addressed."
"That involves substantial improvement as regards increasing the transparency of decision-making processes and the functioning of the European Union's administration."
"Those are the areas generating the majority of the citizens' complaints."
"(ES) Madam President, I too want to congratulate Mrs Zdravkova on her excellent report."
"I would also congratulate all of us, including the Ombudsman, Mr Diamandouros, of course, on the progress and improvements that have been made in his work."
"Among the 'star cases', I should like to highlight those connected with European transport, specifically the improvement of information on passenger rights and the replacement by the European Aviation Safety Agency of a contested decision."
"The own-initiative investigations are, I feel, very positive as they have focused on the issue of Commission payments and also on non-discrimination of people with disabilities."
"We should like this collection of know-how, 'star cases' and good administrative behaviour to be specifically included in the campaign supported by Parliament."
"To end, I must also mention in particular the sixth seminar of the European Network of Ombudsmen which introduced, for the first time, the participation of ombudsmen from the regions."
"I must also mention the excellent statement made by the European Network of Ombudsmen which both the Ombudsman, Mr Diamandouros, and we ourselves would be advised to use."
"(RO) The European Ombudsman is an institution which is something special, a bit of a novelty for citizens from those countries admitted into the European Union in the last two waves."
"However, it needs to be promoted more actively, with a very clear indication as to what the European Ombudsman can and cannot do."
"We also think that the number of own-initiative inquiries should be somewhat higher."
"If the organisation does not have enough staff of its own, we recommend calling for volunteers in an effort to promote the European Ombudsman institution, especially volunteers from the countries from the last wave or two of enlargement, including Members of the European Parliament."
"(DE) Madam President, the gap between the European Union and the citizens of Europe should not be as large as it has become."
"We must ensure that this gap is reduced."
"The Ombudsman has a very important role to play in this respect, in particular in areas where and at times when he does his job well."
"The most important thing is that we can count on the Ombudsman's commitment and sense of proportion."
"We must not raise excessive expectations which no one can meet."
"On the other hand, it is also about ensuring that abuses which occur in the administration of European bodies are actually dealt with and, where possible, that sensible solutions are sought which will satisfy the citizens and ensure their security."
"Until now the Ombudsman has shown that he takes this task seriously and performs it well."
"We can only hope that this will continue to be the case and thank him and the rapporteur for this report."
"(RO) I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and to emphasise the importance of the European Ombudsman."
"I would like to mention in particular the positive consequences of his recommendations concerning the use of the languages of the new Member States in the recruitment and selection process organised by EPSO."
"I would also like to stress the importance for the internal market of the recommendation made by the Ombudsman which requested the Commission to avoid, in the future, unjustified restrictions with regard to the official languages which can be used to submit bids based on invitations to tender."
"Bearing in mind the importance of protecting personal data, I would like to welcome the cooperation between the European Data Protection Supervisor and the European Ombudsman."
"I would just mention, on this point, the Community regulations on the passenger register as part of international flights."
"This type of cooperation will become even more important in the future."
"I also welcome the resolution of the SOLVIT case where a Bulgarian doctor has been given a certificate of conformity, which allows him to practise his profession in France and ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"- (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, my compliments to the rapporteur."
"As a member of the Committee on Petitions, on the basis of the information contained in the report as well as my own personal experience, I would like both to extend my thanks and to make a request."
"My thanks being for the clear progress made compared to the previous year: the number of admissible complaints rose from 449 to 518, that is from 12% to 15% of the total, and there was also an increase in inquiries carried out."
"I therefore believe that we are on the right track."
"However, and here I come to my request, we still need to up our efforts in terms of communication."
"Let us examine together effective strategies, perhaps starting with our schools, to guarantee quality information for citizens on the person, role and powers of the European Ombudsman."
"There are promising projects of this kind, to begin this year, which must be implemented and supported."
"Then we will undoubtedly see a further improvement in today's already impressive figures."
"Ombudsman. - Madam President, we are under great pressure because you have to vote in about six or seven minutes, so I will offer my excuses to all the people who spoke."
"I would like to thank all the Members of Parliament who have been gracious enough to comment favourably on my report, and I will only try to address very specific cases, if I may."
"Let me very briefly thank Mrs Jäätteenmäki and Mr Schwab for what I take to be their particular support and their plea for the Ombudsman's efforts to increase transparency."
"This is something to which I remain committed, and I pledge to redouble my efforts to do that, with the support of this body."
"I need your support to do that, and I ask you for it."
"Mr Martin, I would be very happy to meet you personally so that I might be able to have a chance to listen to the case and be able to respond to it."
"I would like to thank Mr Cashman and Mr Busuttil for their comments and encouragement."
"I would also like to thank the Members who have spoken very favourably about the actions of the Ombudsman concerning strengthening the activities and the rights of citizens in the new Member States, who are in fact in greater need of becoming more familiar with the practices of the Ombudsman and the Union."
"Let me now address directly the questions from Ms Harkin, Ms Auken and Mr Czarnecki, concerning the cases that have not been addressed."
"To avoid any misunderstanding, let me make very clear that every single case we have received has, in fact, been addressed."
"There has not been a case that has not received a response."
"There has never been a case in which we have not written back to the complainant."
"We wrote and we informed the complainant why the European Ombudsman could not deal with the complaint."
"The 1 021 cases listed as 'no action possible' are cases where we could not help the complainant by opening an in-depth inquiry, by transferring the case or by offering useful advice."
"After this came in I checked and I have some reports."
"In one third of all these cases the complainant had already contacted the authority that was competent to deal with the complaint, such as a national original Ombudsman or the Committee on Petitions of the European Parliament."
"In 20% of the cases they received, the case had already been handled by the court and I could not handle it."
"In 17% of the cases there was no competent body in existence that could possibly handle it."
"In 13% of the cases the only appropriate advice would have been to contact a lawyer, but the complainant had already done so."
"Therefore I have tried to cover all the cases."
"I would like to assure you that there has never been any case in which the Ombudsman has not written, explained and provided written information."
"I hope this addresses the questions that you raised."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would just like to reiterate my support for Mrs Zdravkova's report and to thank the Ombudsman for his cooperation."
"Regarding those concrete cases mentioned, we will provide additional information."
"It is true that, when we address a complaint, the complainants are not always completely satisfied with the solution proposed."
"However, the Commission always tries to deal with each and every case in a very constructive spirit, and we will continue to do so."
"rapporteur. - (BG) I would just like to take this opportunity to once again thank all speakers for their kind words about my report, my work and for the work of Mr Diamandouros."
"This has been a useful, and, above all. a positive discussion, and I am sure that it will encourage Mr Diamandouros to make even greater efforts towards closer cooperation with the institutions, and above all encourage better communication with our European citizens."
"I can see that there are many visitors in the hall, and I hope that this discussion has been useful and, above all, of interest to them."
"(DE) Madam President, I should like to start by thanking the Ombudsman for the opportunity to speak."
"I am happy to accept."
"I have, in fact, asked to speak because Mr Cashman has made attacks and insinuations which I would like to reject out of hand."
"They simply indicate how nervous people become when there is a question of increasing transparency."
"However, you, Mr Diamandouros, are in favour of more transparency."
"I can only encourage you to keep to your convictions with regard to travel expenses and other similar matters, where the majority of Parliament gets you into trouble."
"I believe that you are on the right track, Mr Diamandouros."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11 a.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 11.05 a.m. and resumed at 11.10 a.m.)"
"Announcements by the President"
"Ladies and gentlemen, Twenty years ago in 1988, the European Parliament instituted the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, which has been awarded every year since then."
"Over the course of the last twenty years, we have honoured outstanding organisations or figures who have dedicated their lives to defending human rights and fundamental freedoms and who have fought against intolerance, fanaticism and oppression in their own countries and throughout the world."
"The first person to be awarded the prize was Nelson Mandela, whom I will be meeting next week in Johannesburg as part of an invitation to speak before the Pan-African Parliament."
"This year the Conference of Presidents has decided to award the Sakharov Prize 2008 to Hu Jia 'on behalf of the silenced voices of China and Tibet' as it states in the proposal for a decision from the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"(Applause)"
"Hu Jia was born on 25 July 1973 in Beijing and is one of the most passionate defenders of human rights in the People's Republic of China."
"This dedicated activist is subject to accusations because of his commitment to the environment, his fight against the dangers of HIV and AIDS and his efforts to ensure that human rights are respected."
"On 27 December 2007, Hu Jia was placed under house arrest on charges of inciting subversion."
"On 3 April 2008, he was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison."
"In his solitary prison cell, Hu Jia is now fighting his illness."
"He suffers from cirrhosis of the liver, but as far as we know he is being denied regular medical care."
"The arbitrary arrest and conviction of Hu Jia has caused outrage throughout the world."
"By awarding the Sakharov prize to Hu Jia, the European Parliament is demonstrating forcefully and with determination its recognition of the daily fight for freedom carried on by all defenders of human rights in China."
"(Applause)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have another brief statement to make."
"Tomorrow, on 24 October, we will be celebrating the 63rd anniversary of the United Nations."
"On this occasion, I would like to highlight the extent, the commitment and the success of the collaboration between the European Union, the European Parliament and the various programmes and institutions of the United Nations."
"Not long ago a publication entitled 'Improving Lives', of which you have all received a copy, presented a summary of the collaboration over the years."
"In recent weeks, we have seen the start of a difficult period throughout the world, in particular in relation to the financial crisis and its drastic effects on the world economy."
"In this context in particular, the European Union's fundamental values of multilateral understanding and solidarity are of great importance."
"This also applies to our commitment to and responsibility for the developing countries."
"The international conference on development financing which will be held in November will also play a decisive role in this respect."
"Despite the fact that we are faced with considerable challenges, we must not lose sight of the interests of the developing countries."

"Draft general budget of the European Union - 2009 budget (vote)"
"- Before the vote"
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, the explanation process is the same as it is every year."
"Before the vote I need to inform Parliament about some technical adjustments."
"I know that this is not very interesting for my fellow Members, but we need to record it in the Minutes."
"Firstly, as already indicated in the voting list, the vote on amendment 783 to budget line 22 02 04 02 only concerns payment appropriations."
"Secondly, the explanations concerning the global energy assessment do not belong on budget line 08 03 01, where they have mistakenly been included, but on line 08 05 01."
"Therefore the vote on amendment 936 to line 08 03 01 must be made without the comments on the global energy assessment."
"These will be included instead in amendment 938 to line 08 05 01."
"I know how enthusiastic everyone is about this."
"Thirdly, the reinstatement of resources in the Preliminary Draft Budget for the decentralised agencies with their titles in lines 1 and 2 also includes, of course, the reinstatement of their establishment plans."
"This applies to the European Medicines Agency, the European Chemicals Agency, the European Aviation Safety Agency, the European Maritime Safety Agency, the European Railway Agency, the European Environment Agency, the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training, the European Food Safety Authority, the Community Fisheries Control Agency and the Community Plant Variety Office, whose establishment plans are not specifically included in the documents accompanying the amendments."
"Fourthly, as the result of a comment from the Legal Services an explanation included on several budget lines must be slightly modified."
"This concerns the sentence which begins 'The Commission may' up to 'and to transfer to the internal auditor of the Commission' in the following amendments: Amendment 994 to line 19 04 01, amendment 1011 to line 21 02 01, amendment 1015 to line 21 03 01, amendment 1016 to line 21 04 01, amendment 1026 to line 23 02 01 and amendment 785 to line 23 02 02."
"The correct version of the explanation is detailed in the voting list."
"Fifthly and finally, the budget line 19 06 06 with the title 'Consular cooperation' is not included in the amendments, although it was adopted as part of the amending letter No 1/2009."
"This new budget line will therefore be included using a token entry (p.m.)."
"If none of my fellow members have any objections to all of this, the sittings service will include it all as we have decided."
"Mrs Haug, as we have great confidence in you, we can now vote on this."
"(Parliament approved the rapporteur's proposal)"
"Before the vote on Amendment 111"
"- (FR) Mr President, I do not believe we have voted on the second part of 106."

"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group I would like to introduce a motion."
"In Parliament, we quite clearly agree on two points."
"On the one hand, we want to be involved in the procedure for these new technical variants and this cannot be decided without Parliament."
"I would like to thank Commissioner Tajani, who has ensured that this is the case."
"Secondly, it is clear to all of us that this new technical measure must be considered with a great deal of sensitivity."
"We have a number of concerns about it."
"The criteria for the possible application must be carefully controlled and everyone in the House agrees on this."
"I would like to move on behalf of the PPE-DE Group that we give ourselves an extra four weeks and postpone the vote until November, because Commissioner Tajani has stated that there will be a major hearing on the subject in November."
"The PPE-DE Group is of the opinion that we should hear all the facts before we come to a decision."
"I hope that we will have a majority in favour of this."
"This is why we are moving that the vote be adjourned until November."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to oppose this motion for the following reason."
"It is true that Mr Tajani's hearing will give us the opportunity to acquire additional information and to define our position."
"However, what we are doing with this decision is to tell the Council, which has already reached a resolution during the last Council of Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs, that in our view, and this applies at least to my group, security and security measures are absolutely essential."
"However, the use of scanners or display devices which show people completely naked is totally unacceptable."
"This is a violation of human dignity and it is not accompanied by any increase in security."
"(Applause from the left and from the centre)"
"This is the perfect example of the mania for security which is going on here."
"With our decision we want to send a clear signal that we are opposed to measures of this kind, which are also extremely controversial on medical grounds."

"Explanations of vote"
"Explanations of vote"
"(FI) Madam President, first of all let me say that I am pleased that the budget package was voted on and got through."
"Of course, as Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Culture and Education, I followed matters relating to this area in particular, and I am glad that one important project, the European Youth Olympic Festival in Tampere, was voted through."
"It is important to ensure that we use the budget to press ahead with projects that are close to the public."
"Then people can see and experience how the Union is working in their region."
"The budget is a strong one, but it has to be said that under one Heading, which mentions the European Union as a global partner, that is, point 134, I suspect that I voted wrongly, because I was following the group list and I do not agree with it in all respects."
"It is perhaps worth pointing this out, but in other respects I can say that I am satisfied with this draft budget and I am happy that it went through."
"Madam President, I abstained on vote 134 of the draft general budget for 2009, as the intellectual dishonesty and cynicism of the movers of this amendment are preying on the genuine concerns and fears of many of our citizens by trying to imply that, at present - and in the past - EU development funds have been given to governments and organisations for programmes that include, I quote: 'coercive abortion, forced sterilisation and infanticide', all of which we would condemn outright."
"That should not even need to be said."
"So they justify the wording of this emotive amendment, the text of which is already being used with one eye on next June's European election."
"The amendment is being portrayed as, I quote: 'an attempt to exclude such projects from receiving EU funds in the 2009 EU budget'."
"As EU funds have never been used in such a way, but always according to the Cairo ICPD, and as there is no such proposal in this year's budget to do so, the political mischief of the movers has to be acknowledged by all fair-minded and intellectually honest commentators."
"(BG) I supported the 2009 budget as well as the proposal to increase it compared to what had been proposed by the Commission."
"Although it is not enough to meet the huge demands of all Member States, or to fully implement all priority policies, I believe that it lives up to the fundamental principle of the EU, which is solidarity."
"By directing funds towards the more poorly developed countries and regions, the financial instrument has established itself as an important factor in achieving balanced development."
"In this regard, the Cohesion Fund plays an important role, as it is aimed at those Member States which need to close the gap between the levels of economic and social development through this fund."
"It is particularly important for the new Member States, which really do need the financial resources of the Community."
"I do not believe that these resources should be subject to conditions which are any stricter than the approved rules and procedures of the European Union."
"They are of great importance in helping Bulgaria catch up in its development and to reach the European Union's average standard of living."
"The vote against the proposal to put Cohesion Fund resources into a reserve is a good decision."
"The proposal was tied to vague criteria, particularly regarding the reimbursement of withheld funds."
"In my view, the European Commission and Parliament have sufficient control mechanisms at their disposal to ensure that the funds are spent effectively."
"(NL) Madam President, I have voted against the draft budget for 2009, and the Commission's budget in particular, for the very reason that I should like to make a political statement by not in any way approving of the Commission's actions."
"In general, I consider the Commission to be an institution which, by definition, as far as its principles are concerned, works in an undemocratic way, since it is made up of a board of purely politically appointed high officials, whose behaviour, despite this, is reminiscent of some sort of European mandarins who barely tolerate supervision and who, in effect, cannot be penalised either."
"Politically, as far as the 2009 budget is concerned, I am, for starters, opposed to the Commission's incessant efforts to continue, by hook or by crook, on the damned path of accession of the Islamic and non-European Turkey to the European Union."
"I do not intend to endorse this policy."
"Madam President, we voted to support the thrust of Mrs Sinnott's Amendment 134, on preventing Community assistance being given to any government, organisation or programme which supports or participates in the management of a programme involving human rights abuses such as coercive abortion, involuntary sterilisation or infanticide."
"However, we feel it important to question Mrs Sinnott's justification for proposing such an amendment."
"In her press statement this week, she cited such countries as China and Vietnam, where she claims that EU funding, channelled through the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), is presently being used for coercive abortions, involuntary sterilisation and infanticide."
"I spoke to the Director of the UNFPA office in Brussels this morning, who said that the UNFPA, the United Nations population programme, does not support coercion or abortion."
"It follows the mandate of the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development, which clearly states that reproductive health-care programmes should provide the widest range of services without any form of coercion."
"In addition, the global community has decided that abortion should never have been promoted as a method of family planning."
"China's citizens have benefited from the presence of the UNFPA and the initiatives that it has brought to the nation."
"In the parts of China - and other nations - where the UNFPA works, women are given more options for their reproductive health decisions, and more information about reproductive health care is available to them, as is the freedom of access to it."
"Madam President, this was a complex vote and a complex budget."
"I regret that Amendment 133 did not succeed, as it would have given more focus to the needs of children with disabilities who are in institutional care."
"Our concern was the deinstitutionalisation of those children."
"However, this issue has not gone away and we will continue to fight for their rights."
"I hope that the President of the Commission responds to my letter in this regard."
"- (FR) Madam President, I voted against the resolution on the draft general budget of the European Union because of a last-minute attempt once again, via an amendment tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, which the majority of my fellow Members have not even seen and of which they have not assessed the scope, to interpret the famous Cox package concerning the future status of MEPs in a manner that would render their voluntary pension fund meaningless."
"This amendment does not reflect what is expressly agreed on in the Cox package."
"It is therefore out of the question to deprive almost all of the Members of new rights."
"This amendment cannot possibly have the slightest effect on the implementing provisions to be laid down in this regard."
"We are going to make sure that this situation is redressed, because the vote has taken place without the Members' knowledge, and they are all coming to see me now, stunned by the true scope of this amendment."
"As vice-chairman of the pension fund, I will make sure it is redressed."
"(NL) Madam President, in the final vote, I voted against the draft general budget for 2009 for the different European institutions, including Parliament obviously."
"I did so first of all because I am not convinced that all these European institutions, without exception, handle the huge pile of tax money economically and responsibly."
"Quite frankly, I think the reverse is true."
"The image which our voters have of the European institutions, and we should be well aware of this, is one of a gravy train where overpaid and undertaxed apparatchiks and MEPs form a kind of Soviet-styled nomenclature, where decisions are often taken over the heads of the public, and certainly against the will and the interest of the citizens."
"This is an image that we have, which certainly does not apply to everybody and everything, but in which, I fear, there is some truth for a considerable number of European institutions."
"In my opinion, we will need to put our own house in order for some time to come before we can send out a more positive image of our Europe."
"- (CS) Allow me to explain why I voted for Mr Stockmann's report on air travel fees."
"On the one hand, I welcomed the obligation to state combined costs to travellers on airline tickets and in offers, inclusive of airport fees, as this will lead to greater transparency in the decision making of passengers and will encourage economic competition."
"Most of all, however, I welcome the limit which unifies airport fees for the main national and larger airports, allowing the smaller airports to offer lower prices and thereby to compete in a market which is currently very much lacking in transparency."
"This creates an opportunity for regional airports to develop and for the range of air travel services on offer to the public to expand."
"- (FR) Madam President, I should like to say that, in view of the growing threat of sea piracy off the Horn of Africa, the draft motion for a resolution on piracy supports the will of the Member States to undertake a coordinated naval campaign."
"Unfortunately, the amendments, for the most part, are pious hopes or merely point out the obvious, such as the collapse into anarchy of Somalia, events from which the full consequences must necessarily be drawn."
"It will certainly not be possible to combat piracy effectively if the pirates' bases are not destroyed."
"It is regrettable, also, that this text does not point out the main cause of this resurgence of piracy, which represents the decline of Europe's civilising influence in this part of the world."
"Lastly, I believe that it is rather odd to want to demand that the Member States' naval forces separate, as it were, the action of combating piracy from the actions being carried out - it is not too clear why - within the context of Operation Enduring Freedom, as if Bin Laden were escaping in some way from Afghanistan via Pakistan, in a dugout canoe, to make his way to New Zealand."
"I understand that there is a desire to introduce this distinction, but ships in the area will naturally have to carry out both missions."
"Madam President, accounting standards are the key element of the language of financial services."
"For investors, the moves to converge the national standards of accounting to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are a great step forward."
"It means that companies will be able to publish accounts in one basic form, which should be accepted in the major economies around the world."
"Canada, China, Japan, the USA - and now, it seems, India as well - are in agreement in the wish to converge their standards towards IFRS."
"Although I welcome this, as the rapporteur for the transparency directive, I recognise that work to achieve actual convergence still has to be done."
"This is why I and my fellow rapporteur, Margarita Starkevičiūtė, have approved the amendments to monitor the progress of this convergence process."
"I trust that the Commission, in their discussions with various national authorities, can keep the momentum moving."
"With regard to the USA, I am keen that a new administration can be trusted and relied upon to make the substantial progress that it is needed."
"The Commission should keep pressure on this."
"On accounting standards themselves, it is vitally important to keep the underlying approach, as agreed within the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)."
"The integrity of these rules will be tested by attempts to dilute them for national reasons."
"This should be resisted strongly, and fair value accounting must be supported in the face of such pressure."
"(NL) Madam President, I abstained on the motion for a resolution on aircraft safety and body scanners, not because I object to the reservations it expresses with regard to the right of privacy for travellers, quite the reverse."
"I too believe that body scanners cannot be commissioned without a clear scientific and medical evaluation of the possible effects of the use of the technology in question on the health of the users."
"I can only bemoan the fact that the proposal to postpone the vote and to invite Commissioner Tajani in this connection to present a study which may enable us make a more informed decision regarding the use of body scanners has been rejected."
"This is a very serious matter, involving, as it does, the safety of the citizens and the use of pioneering new technology."
"This is why I find it very regrettable that we in our Parliament treat this issue so shoddily."
"Madam President, as one of the co-authors of the motion for a resolution of the European Parliament on the commemoration of the Holodor, theartificial famine of 1932-1933 in Ukraine, allow me, as a member of the PPE-DE Group, to begin by expressing my thanks to all of my parliamentary colleagues who voted in favour of the motion for a resolution."
"Under the leadership of the PPE-DE Group, a compromise was reached under which the word 'genocide' was removed at the request of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament."
"Following the discussion in your presence yesterday, however, filled as it was with high emotion and with the powerful words of Commissioner Tajani, nobody could be in any doubt as to what name to give this appalling act which destroyed ten million people."
"It is now up to the historians, on the basis of fact and as long as there are survivors still living, to bring to an end the silence and the concealment of these events."
"There must be books in our libraries bearing genuine witness to the famine in Ukraine."
"By voting in favour of the motion for a resolution on branding the Ukrainian famine of 1932 - 1933 as a horrific crime against the Ukrainian people and against humanity, we have today pasted back into the annals of European history a page ripped out by Stalin."
"Madam President, I voted for the resolution on Holodomor, the great Ukrainian famine."
"The resolution rightly calls it an appalling crime against the Ukrainian people and, indeed, against humanity."
"However, due to the position taken by certain factions, the resolution has avoided the term 'genocide', which would be fair and appropriate to be used in this case."
"The Ukrainian Parliament and 26 states have defined this crime, which caused the death of at least four million people, as genocide."
"Moreover, recital B of the resolution quotes the UN Convention on the crime of genocide of 1948, which unequivocally covers the Ukrainian case."
"So I very much hope that the European Parliament will soon join the position taken by these states."
"- (FR) Madam President, we have commemorated the Holodomor, the methodical destruction of Ukraine's farming community by famine, and our Parliament has recognised, as did our fellow Member a moment ago, that it was a genocide."
"I should just like to stress the fact that the perpetrators of this genocide sat among the judges of civilisation at Nuremberg, a fact that should make it possible, today, to debate the composition, procedure and conclusions of the Nuremberg Trial."
"However, intellectuals, who are holding this debate today in Europe, are being arrested, detained, hunted down, ruined, pursued and thrown into prison."
"Worse, their lawyers, who are also presenting the same conclusions, are being hunted down in the same way."
"In Mr Pöttering's country, for example, they are being hunted down and arrested in line with procedures that resemble Stalinist trials."
"We awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to a Chinese dissident; we could just as well have awarded it to certain Europeans such as, for example, the courageous German lawyer, Sylvia Stolz."
"(DE) Madam President, Doris Pack has, as always, submitted an excellent text, because she is not only an expert on Southern Europe, but also on education."
"I welcome the fact that education is a particular area of emphasis in relation to the stabilisation agreement."
"However, we must extend our approaches, firstly by focusing more closely on accelerating the visa liberalisation process and giving young people in Bosnia and Herzegovina the chance to find out more about Europe by studying and travelling here."
"The second decisive factor is the establishment of a European multi-faith university in Sarajevo, which is supported by all three religious communities in the country and which will act as a European centre of tolerance and mutual understanding, not on the basis of indifference, but on the basis of people's roots in each religion."
"With our strong support for the European university, this will not only represent major progress for people in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but may also allow Bosnia and Herzegovina to send a signal to the whole European continent."
"(NL) Madam President, the report that is before us by the Committee on Petitions on the European Ombudsman's report for 2007 was very positive on the whole, and I can certainly support this view for once."
"I have therefore endorsed the report."
"Nevertheless, I should like to note once again in this explanation of vote that it is remarkable that Parliament should congratulate the European Ombudsman on his conduct to ensure the correct and full application of rules and regulations, while law infringements and violations of the rules are occurring before our very eyes in this Parliament, so to speak, without Parliament intervening or even with Parliament's cooperation on a daily basis and on a very large scale."
"For example, the way in which the Commission and Parliament continue to build on the Treaty of Lisbon, which has died a political and legal death since the referendum in Ireland, makes a mockery of all legal rules."
"I think it is high time we started to put our own house in order."
"Written explanations of vote"
"The June List believes that the EU budget should be limited to 1% of the Member States' average GNI."
"We have therefore chosen to vote against all the increases proposed by the European Parliament, at the same time as the June List has welcomed the few savings proposed in the form of amendments by either the Committee on Budgets or individual Members."
"There are a number of unfortunate budget headings."
"The June List particularly regrets the large amount of subsidy for the EU's agricultural policy, the Cohesion Fund, fisheries and the budget headings containing support for various types of information campaign."
"The June List also believes that something needs to be done about the European Parliament's constant shuttling between Strasbourg and Brussels and that the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions should be disbanded."
"in writing. - (FR) For twenty-seven countries to have a European budget in the region of EUR 130 billion - that is to say, the equivalent of Spain's budget, and that alone - is, under normal circumstances, already rather strange."
"Nevertheless, it is thus that, in a Europe that lacks high-speed rail links between Finland and Spain, and between France and Poland, as well as equipment and staff for the universities, research centres and retirement homes of a continent submerged by the geriatric tsunami, the worldwide crisis of interbank liquidity, of the real estate shock on several economies and of the decline in confidence of entrepreneurs and workers, a budget effort is required that is far removed from the usual European budget."
"We therefore require exceptional budget programming for a major infrastructure plan, approved via a major 'European financial referendum'."
"By this I mean a European loan, of an amount equivalent to EUR 1 700 billion, raised by the banking sector."
"in writing. - (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats regret that the EU should be funding tobacco producers, at the same time as investing large amounts of money in public health campaigns and anti-smoking measures in the EU."
"We also consider it a scandal that the EU budget should be used to support bullfighting, which is a tradition we do not consider to be compatible with modern values and animal rights."
"We also regret that all those types of export subsidy, together with milk quotas, should take up a portion of the EU's budget."
"We voted against all these proposals."
"We also wish to clarify why we voted against the proposal for a pilot project in favour of children and children's rights."
"It was because this proposal was not contained in the compromise between the political groups involved in pilot projects."
"Because we did not wish to jeopardise this sensitive compromise, we were not, unfortunately, able to support the proposal, with whose content we fully sympathise (amendment 133)."
"Finally, we wish to express our great disappointment about the fact that the amendments aimed at strengthening union cooperation and consultation between trade and industry and union organisations were not adopted in plenary."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Haug on the draft general budget of the European Union for 2009 and amending letter 1/2009 to the preliminary draft general budget (PDB) of the European Union."
"Like many of my fellow Members, I deplore the fact that the Council has further reduced an already meagre budget: the commitment appropriations of the draft budget represent a total amount of EUR 134 billion, that is to say, a shortfall of EUR 469 million with regard to the PDB, even though the payments stand at EUR 115 billion, this being a decrease of EUR 1.8 billion."
"The payments are thus limited to 0.89% of GNI, that is to say, an unprecedented level that is drastically widening the gap between commitments and payments and this is something that goes against budgetary discipline."
"With regard to agriculture, I support the creation of three new funds - the fund for restructuring in the dairy sector, Eco-Aid to maintain sheep and goat farming in the EU, and the ad-hoc financial instrument for the adaptation of the fishing fleet to the economic consequences of the rise in fuel prices."
"in writing. - (NL) The Haug report cannot count on my support, because the European Parliament is asking to spend more."
"I do, however, support the new priorities in the areas of climate change and energy."
"Many amendments aim to raise the profile of these priorities in the budget, which I welcome."
"This also means, though, that we need to indicate the areas in which we want to cut costs."
"Parliament's position does not make any mention of this."
"Furthermore, I should like to declare myself openly in favour of balanced support to the governments in the Middle East."
"The issue of the Palestinian Authority requires our continued attention."
"It is appropriate for us to provide aid, given that it now looks like Prime Minister Fayad is setting a course that deserves our support."
"Finally, it is justified that the European Union should wish to give extra food aid to poor countries due to food prices soaring."
"I agree with the rapporteur that this should not be funded from the budget for European agriculture, but rather from the budget for external policy."
"in writing. - (SV) We support the basic principles behind the EU budget for 2009 and wish to emphasise that it needs to give people good value for money."
"The budget's framework should be respected, and we therefore welcome the fact that the budget will be kept well within this framework."
"We want drastically to cut back on agricultural and regional aid and reduce the total budget."
"We want to put more of our shared resources into research and development, growth, infrastructure and security."
"On Thursday 23 October, the European Parliament adopted at first reading the European Union's budget for 2009."
"This budget falls within the particular context of the narrow 2007-2013 financial perspective - which the French socialists, moreover, refused to vote in favour of in 2006 - of the financial crisis and of the preparations for the European elections of June 2009."
"A budget is policy expressed in figures."
"Parliament has succeeded in restoring a satisfactory payment level, in spite of the Council's desire to make bleak cuts in lines that nonetheless appear to be a priority for MEPs, such as the fight against climate change, aid for SMEs, growth and competitiveness, and citizenship schemes."
"In this connection, I am delighted that we have re-established a satisfactory level of appropriations for communication initiatives concerning citizens and the media."
"In order to prepare for the forthcoming elections and to make citizens want to take part in the vote, it is vital that they are made aware of European issues."
"All initiatives undertaken by the Commission and by Parliament for the purposes of explaining Europe and its added value in terms of everyday life and of preparing for the future must be encouraged and provided with sufficient resources."
"in writing. - I voted against amendment 134 because to vote for or to abstain would be to lend credibility to false allegations by Kathy Sinnott to the effect that the EU funds coercive abortion, involuntary sterilization, and, infanticide."
"in writing. - (PT) As in previous budgetary procedures when we had many reasons to immediately reject them at first reading, we can say that, with regard to the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2009, we have even more reasons to reject it."
"The Council clearly views the next budget in exactly the same light as it did the previous ones."
"In other words, it plans to use this instrument to continue supporting the EU's neoliberal policy."
"We should not really expect anything else."
"This budgetary procedure, once again, provides clear evidence of the EU's intended response to the worsening capitalist crisis, triggered by the financial crisis at the very heart of the system, in other words in the US."
"Neither the Commission, nor the EP, nor the Council have put forward any measures in the EU budget which will effectively respond to the needs and growing difficulties of workers and the general population, micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises and a large part of the productive sector."
"At the precise moment when the structural crisis in the European Union is getting worse, the Council has reduced payments to an 'unprecedentedly low level', by nearly EUR 9 billion compared to the forecast in the Multiannual Financial Framework."
"This is why we have voted against."
"in writing. - (SV) I abstained from voting because large parts of the outcome are a disappointment."
"For example, it is mad for the EU to be funding tobacco producers, at the same time as investing large amounts of money in public health campaigns and anti-smoking measures in the EU."
"It is also a scandal that the EU budget should be used to support bullfighting, which is a tradition I do not consider to be compatible with modern values and animal rights."
"I also regret that all those types of export subsidy are still to take up a portion of the EU budget and that the amendments aimed at strengthening union cooperation and consultation between trade and industry and union organisations were not adopted by Parliament."
"in writing. - We would strongly oppose coercive abortion, forced sterilisation and infanticide, and concur that these are human rights abuses."
"We have abstained on the amendment as EU funds have never been used in this way and the amendment fails to clarify the importance of the international development work of credible organisations in supporting women in fertility management, specifically reproductive education, reproductive health-care services and family planning, and campaigning for women's right to health care."
"While we are voting in favour of Amendments 612, 131, 132 and 133 because of the importance of the issue, we feel it would be more appropriate to create a separate budget line on children's rights, which would include the issues dealt with in these amendments."
"in writing. - (NL) Budget item 05020812 and Amendment 169 have given sudden and unexpected importance to the topic of school fruit on account of proposals to spend more money on it in future."
"There is currently a purchase agreement for which money has been set aside for years with a view to supporting the fruit growers."
"This gives the bought fruit a useful purpose."
"There are proposals in the pipeline which, from 2010, could increase the budget for 'market regulation' by EUR 90 million or more per annum."
"Parliament can only have an advisory role in this."
"It is the Council that makes the decisions, and the subsidiarity test does not apply, because this power has, pursuant to Articles 36 and 37 of the Treaty, been with the EU for a long time."
"Our party, the Socialist Party in the Netherlands, considers this to be a bizarre state of affairs."
"A school fruit arrangement may be useful in preventing children from becoming ever more obese and unhealthy."
"The question is why the EU should get involved in this, rather than the municipalities that run education."
"Payments are currently made from the EU fund to the Member States, which are obliged to add a sum to it, and it is then up to the municipalities to implement the scheme."
"If nothing else, this way of working leads to a great deal of unnecessary administration and time-consuming red tape."
"in writing. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have voted in favour of the draft general budget of the European Union for 2009, drawn up by Mrs Haug."
"I am pleased to note the increase in resources for overall spending on transport in the preliminary draft budget for the next financial year, and the creation of a new budget line on Support Activities to European Transport Policy and Passenger Rights."
"I must nonetheless express my disappointment over the reduction, although not excessive, of payments relating to this item."
"Finally, I would like to draw attention to the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, of which I am a member, and say that I share Mrs Dührkop Dührkop's satisfaction that the increased budget provided for the current year for Title 18, Area of freedom, security and justice, has been retained for 2009."
"This reflects the great importance given to issues associated with security and safeguarding liberties, the management of migration flows and the external borders of the Union, which are becoming ever more critical, not least in the eyes of European citizens."
"in writing. - (SV) As always when one votes on a budget the size of the EU's, there are details about which one has reservations."
"In the case of the EU, of course, it is mainly agricultural policy that sticks in the craw."
"It may therefore appear strange to be voting in favour of a budget in which the dominant budget heading is one that we should have liked to have been one of the smaller ones - if it existed at all. At the same time, there is a need to consider the whole picture, and the good news is the ever-increasing awareness that significantly larger resources need to be invested in what really is joint expenditure - in this case, on climate."
"My vote needs therefore to be interpreted in the light of the fact that the annual draft budget involves something of a shift forward, not that I uncritically support the total content."
"Two corrections to the voting protocol, for example concerning tobacco subsidies, have been introduced."
"in writing. - Amendment 602 was supported by Parliament."
"Again this is disappointing, as it continues subsidising tobacco producers in the EU."
"Tobacco is the cause of death of half a million EU citizens each year."
"It is a disgrace that there is still a subsidy available to grow a product which kills so many."
"in writing. - (EL) The vote in favour of the EU budget for 2009 by the centre right and centre left forces of the European Parliament, with the participation of the Greek MEPs from the New Democracy, PASOK and LAOS parties, signals the intensity of the anti-grassroots policy against the workers."
"Within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy and at a time of crisis in the capitalist system, the European Union is using the budget to make workers pay for this latest crisis, to speed up capitalist restructurings, to promote harsh anti-labour measures which undermine collective agreements, to generalise the application of flexible forms of employment and to privatise state social services and insurance systems."
"The European Commission and the European Parliament are pushing ahead with the imperialist action of the EU and making more money available for the militarisation of the EU, in order to pave the way for the European monopolies to penetrate third countries."
"They are using the political power of the stick and carrot to try and misdirect the labour movement and are strengthening their repressive mechanisms in order to strike at the labour grassroots struggle. At the same time, they are using social dialogue to try and wheedle the consent of the workers to the rationale of the European way forward."
"The parliamentary group of the Communist Party of Greece voted against this deeply class-based budget and the imperialist plans of capital and of the EU."
"in writing. - (RO) As part of the vote on the report approving the 2009 Budget Section III - Commission, I voted for paragraphs 14 and 38 of the report, which support the development of institutional skills for the Nabucco project."
"I also voted for amendment 542, which provides for an increase of EUR 5 million in budget item 06 03 04 (Financial support for projects of common interest in the Trans-European energy network)."
"Although this sum is tiny in comparison with the size of the budgets required to implement energy projects, I believe that it is important for us to develop the institutional skills required to implement this project."
"The supplementary sum is earmarked for the development of the administrative skills of the Nabucco project coordinator."
"Europe needs to diversify its sources for providing energy."
"In this sense, the Nabucco project is a strategic project for the European Union."
"The majority with which these amendments were passed is recognition of the importance attached by the European Parliament to the Nabucco project."
"Furthermore, we are expecting specific action to be taken, which will materialise in launching the construction of the Nabucco project."
"in writing. - British Labour MEPs have long supported the reform of the CAP, especially reforms which save money, and thus do not support measures which increase costs unnecessarily."
"In particular, the EPLP does not support subsidising the production of tobacco; bullfighting; new funds for dairy, sheep and goats and funds for publicising the CAP."
"British Labour MEPs welcome any opportunity to help small and medium enterprises, as they are the backbone of our economy, providing the majority of jobs in the EU."
"Consolidating funding under one budget heading will help draw attention to the needs of SMEs."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the resolution on the sections of the EU budget, excluding the European Commission's budget, on the basis of the report by Mr Lewandowski."
"Although none of the budgets covered by this report appear to present any major problems, I remain convinced that the European Parliament is not equipped with the resources to match the political responsibilities it has acquired by virtue of the development of the Treaties and the work of its Members, and, moreover, by virtue of its role in reducing the gap that has set in between European integration and the people, a gap that has been confirmed again and again by the various recent referendums."
"Like the great majority of my fellow Members, I support the proposal to strengthen the European Court of Auditors' audit capacity with the creation of 20 posts."
"The costs associated with funding the extension of the Court building must be kept as low as possible for taxpayers, and it is a good idea to fund this expenditure directly from the budget over four years, rather than to conceal the significantly higher costs that would result from a 25-year rental-purchase option."
"in writing. - (SV) The report's starting point is increased interinstitutional cooperation by means of a general increase in services within the EU's institutions."
"The rapporteur believes that efficiency will be increased in this way."
"For example, it is proposed that personnel resources for the political groups should increase by 53 services."
"Moreover, a further two higher services are to be set up, in addition to the new services included in the draft budget."
"The June List is very well disposed towards making the EU system more efficient, but does not believe that this is automatically achieved by means of more services."
"In principle, we are opposed to an increase, both in the EU budget and in the number of services, because we believe that this would involve increased bureaucracy and less national self-determination."
"When it comes to more services in the political groups, we maintain that this would be of most benefit to the large groups - a development that would make it harder work for other groups to conduct their own policies."
"Moreover, the European Parliament has already in the past taken steps to introduce EU contributions to special 'EU parties' and party-political foundations linked to these."
"We believe that, in this way, more than sufficient advantage has been accorded, at taxpayers' expense, to the big well-established political parties and their groups in the European Parliament."
"The June List has therefore chosen to vote against the report."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the 2009 draft general budget presented in Mr Lewandowski's report."
"Indeed, I believe that the European Union should adhere strictly to the financial regime in order to send out a strong message in this time of great uncertainty on the markets."
"I would point out that there is still room for improvement; ample work remains to be done in building stronger interinstitutional cooperation."
"Lastly, I feel I have a duty to express my opposition to those amendments providing substantial cuts to European funds for the regions of southern Italy: this is not the way to achieve European integration, even if fund management in these areas could be better."
"If a tap is leaking, the answer is not to turn it off, but to repair the pipe."
"The concept is the same, with due proportion."
"in writing. - (DE) With regard to amendment 4 to the Lewandowski report, I would like to state that the PSE Group has not signed this amendment due to an error, but has fully supported it and continues to do so."
"in writing. - British Labour MEPs support the principle that the European Parliament should be knowledge based, but decided to abstain on the decision to increase the number of Group staff due to the current financial conditions and the need to save money as a result."
"in writing. - (PT) As we have highlighted throughout this process, the aim is to amalgamate and deliberately confuse 'competition' with 'transparency'."
"Obviously it is necessary to determine the relevant criteria for airport charges and what these charges actually represent."
"However, this should not occur within a policy aimed at liberalising and privatising a strategic public service such as air transport, particularly by creating a 'truly competitive airport market', applying the 'user pays' principle and requiring profitability in a public service."
"Indeed, as we have previously highlighted, the aim even seems to be to remove the 'supervisory role' from public control, by transferring this to 'independent' supervisory authorities or bodies."
"We would reiterate that previous privatisation in this sector has not resulted in added value in the services provided, but has helped to destroy jobs and reduce workers' rights and, in some cases, caused technical and operational problems."
"Despite the outermost regions not having been explicitly excluded from the scope of the directive (by recognising the permanent natural and geographical disadvantages and constraints affecting these regions and by establishing adequate derogations from compliance with universal public service obligations), as we proposed, we welcome the fact that the directive's scope has been limited to airports with more than 5 million passengers per year."
"in writing. - Whilst British Conservatives recognise that the charges airports levy on their users should be subject to scrutiny on occasion, Conservatives abstained in the vote on the amendments at second reading on the draft airport charges directive."
"This was because they still have concerns that the regulation of some regional airports is unnecessary and may affect their ability to operate competitively."
"Conservatives were keen for the EU to adopt a percentage threshold at first reading."
"The current threshold is arbitrary and does not take into account the competitive growth of the sector."
"in writing. - (DE) I will vote in favour of the directive on airport charges presented by Mr Stockmann."
"The report will make abuse more difficult and reduce the distortion of competition."
"This will prevent airports from abusing their dominant market position and imposing excessive charges on the airlines."
"I believe it is right that there will be greater differences in charge levels in future and that the new system will therefore also benefit the customer."
"It is important for airport users to know in every case how and on what basis charges are calculated."
"It is also important that the directive includes standardised regulations on the mutual obligation to provide information, the transparency requirements and the method of calculating the charges."
"in writing. - (DE) I have not voted in favour of the directive on airport charges at the second reading, just as at the first reading, because what is being proposed here will lead to unacceptable discrimination against Luxembourg airport."
"This is no way to treat a small country."
"Applying the directive to Luxembourg airport, which has 1.6 million passengers per year, and the failure to apply it to direct competitors Frankfurt-Hahn or Brussels-Charleroi, which transport more than 3 million passengers, represents unacceptable discrimination in the internal market, simply because there is a national border in between."
"It is not national borders which should be the decisive factor in this case, but objective criteria, if the directive aims to prevent possible abuse on the part of airports with a dominant market position."
"In the case of a smaller airport, in particular when it is the only one in the country, there is no risk of abuse of this kind, even though the competitive airports, which are also home to low-cost airlines, are only a short distance away."
"Luxembourg is so small that you can reach three neighbouring countries in only 30 minutes on the motorway."
"This is a blatant violation of the principle of proportionality."
"For this reason, once again, at second reading. I am voting under protest against this text, which is intended to be a compromise."
"in writing. - (GA) The rapporteur and the Committee on Transport and Tourism have done Trojan work on this report."
"The lack of amendments show that Parliament has taken a strong and unified position on this matter and that its Members recognise that it is important to progress the Directive on airport costs."
"I am happy with the adoption at first reading of the provision of the Directive changing airport capacity from 1 million to 5 million passengers per year."
"It is also commendable that environment provisions have been included in the common position."
"However, I felt that specific elements were missing from the common position, but the rapporteur succeeds in rectifying this at second reading."
"I therefore pledge my full support."
"in writing. - (PL) The directive on airport charges will put an end to the long-standing conflict and debate between airports and airlines concerning the cost and quality of services."
"The new provisions will also protect passengers against unduly high airport charges and will restrict the practice by large airports of imposing artificially inflated prices."
"To date, the airport use costs imposed on airlines have been passed on to consumers."
"The directive aims to increase transparency and the principles of collecting airport charges."
"It also introduces more specific provisions on the quality standards of the services to be provided."
"In addition, it establishes independent supervisory bodies Thanks to the new directive, airport charges will at last be linked to the real costs and discrimination between specific airlines will cease."
"The directive in question will apply to the 67 largest European airports, handling over five million passengers per year. Warsaw's Okęcie airport is one of these."
"The directive will also apply to the largest airport in a particular Member State of the Union."
"Ten more airports will be covered by the directive by 2010."
"in writing. - (SV) I have been opposed to the proposal ever since it was put before Parliament because I believe that the Chicago Convention, which at present regulates the basic provisions governing airport charges, should have the same significance for the Member States in the future too."
"There is no reason to change rules that are generally accepted and thus can be regulated only by the Member States."
"New EU legislation means that, in the event of a dispute, pricing can ultimately be interpreted by the European Court of Justice, and this was obviously one of the reasons why the proposal was put forward."
"I nevertheless think that there is reason to be sceptical when the European Court of Justice has to interpret binding Community legislation."
"I am worried by the reluctance to take account of national provisions where certain issues are concerned."
"I think that, in the future too, there must be reasons to question the role of the European Court of Justice, especially on this issue."
"I voted in favour of Mrs Pack's report on the conclusion of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, of the other part, because I am convinced that this step will help to establish a contractual relationship between the two parties that will facilitate Bosnia and Herzegovina's transition to a fully functioning state."
"This will cause the country's economy to accelerate, enabling its legislation and regulations to draw gradually closer to the acquis communautaire of the European Union, which will strengthen the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA), given that greater efforts are needed to overcome ethnic divisions and to move towards real reconciliation between the parties."
"I also agree in particular that these efforts need to be focused on the young generations, through common educational programmes in the two entities and through a common understanding of the recent tragic events that took place there."
"in writing. - (PT) The European Parliament 'gives its assent to the conclusion of the agreement' ..."
"Behind these nine words are 65 pages of an 'agreement' which, among many other negative aspects, is ruled by the euphemistically termed 'principles of free market economy'."
"In addition to some worrying political aspects, the primary objective of the agreement is the integration of Bosnia and Herzegovina within the European internal market, as a way of ensuring that the EU's major transnationals have control over its economy."
"The agreement is littered with the terms 'free trade', 'free movement of capital', 'liberalising the establishment and supply of services' and 'liberalisation of transport' (air, maritime, inland waterways and land)."
"Its aim is to ensure that, within six years, Bosnia and Herzegovina has 'properly implemented and enforced' the Community acquis on free competition in the internal market and also 'other trade-related areas'."
"Obviously, we support the further development of friendly relations with other countries, but this must be in response to their real needs."
"These relations must be mutually beneficial and contribute to reciprocal development and the principle of non-interference and respect for national sovereignty must be observed."
"However, this agreement is contrary to this principle."
"in writing. - (RO) Sea piracy is an issue which is as topical nowadays as it has been for a couple of hundred years."
"However, it is far from being the romantic, noble 'profession' depicted in adventure novels or in the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' series of films."
"Piracy causes victims and generates huge revenues for the practitioners of this 'profession'."
"According to some statistics, last year alone, pirates attacked more than 60 ships, capturing 14 of them and taking hundreds of sailors as hostages."
"Acts of piracy in the Gulf of Aden have cost ship-owners between USD 18 million and USD 30 million, in the form of ransom fees paid to recover the ships and their crews."
"Furthermore, piracy can lead to complicated situations, like the one when a Ukrainian vessel transporting more than 30 missiles fell into the hands of Somali pirates."
"These weapons could have very well ended up with Islamic militants in Somalia or in other conflict zones on the African continent."
"It is difficult to explain how, in the year 2008, we still have piracy just like in the Middle Ages."
"The international community in general and the European Union in particular have a duty to examine this historical anomaly and to develop mechanisms which will put an end to this for the benefit of the entire region."
"in writing. - I fully support the resolution on sea piracy."
"Currently two attacks a day are taking place around the Horn of Africa and pirates are disrupting trade flows and preventing international aid reaching Somalia."
"This resolution calls for coordinated action between the EU, the UN and the African Union to isolate pirates in the region and ensure aid reaches this troubled region."
"I support these recommendations."
"in writing. - (PT) One of the most significant aspects of the EU NAVCO mission is the fact that this is the EU's first naval mission."
"However, it should also be noted that the EU, in taking action against this piracy, is clearly aware that it is defending its direct interests."
"This awareness is undoubtedly bound up with the consequences of globalisation."
"As the world gets closer and as the European economy becomes increasingly global, it is clear that our interests lie well beyond our borders and that their defence will also require resources that go beyond the geographical limits of Europe."
"At the same, we should stress that these interests and their defence are, as a rule, common to Europe and its allies."
"That is why the role played by NATO, among others, in the fight against piracy is vital and must be noted and included in our analysis of this changing situation."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on piracy at sea."
"The unhindered passage of vessels is an absolute precondition for the development of international commerce: the European Union cannot tolerate acts of piracy taking place against Community fishing boats off the coast of Somalia, a rich hunting ground for thieves operating at sea."
"I welcome the call on the Somali Transitional Government, in collaboration with the United Nations and the African Union, to treat piracy and armed robbery committed from the Somali coast against vessels carrying humanitarian aid as criminal acts to be pursued by arresting the perpetrators under existing international law."
"Finally, I applaud the joint action promoted by the Council, namely to extend the right of sea and air pursuit of these pirates to the territorial waters of the coastal states, provided that the countries concerned agree, as well as to develop a mechanism for coordinated assistance against cases of maritime piracy."
"in writing. - I shall be voting for this resolution and I congratulate my colleagues on the Transport Committee for taking this initiative at this time."
"Sea Piracy is a criminal act that not only threatens seafarers' lives but also disrupts legitimate trade and even humanitarian aid."
"Modern day pirates have no romance; they are not Johnny Depp type characters swinging through the rigging."
"They are desperate, dangerous criminals who need to be brought to book."
"Piracy is a problem all over the world and especially off the coast of Somalia, where it has risen to epidemic proportions."
"Now it is time for concerted international action to bring this type of activity to a standstill."
"This resolution is timely, and I hope it will help our governments to work together as a part of that international effort."
"in writing. - (EL) The motion for a resolution, which was passed by the large coalition of centre right and centre left political forces in the European Parliament, uses piracy as a pretext to promote new imperialist interventions by the EU in the area of Somalia and the Horn of Africa."
"It exploits the cases of piracy in an area in which the imperialist aspirations of the ΕU, the USA, Russia and other forces clash to impose and safeguard the presence of EU military forces which, with a fistful of weapons, will promote its imperialist plans to gain geostrategic control."
"The European Parliament welcomes the decision by the EU Council to set up and send a euro-unifying naval force, which is basically a strike force for the European monopoly business groups seeking greater penetration and redistribution of the markets for their own benefit."
"This new imperialist operation will mean even greater plundering of the wealth-producing resources in the area, more exploitation of the people in order to safeguard monopoly profits and new dangers of opportunist wars on the battleground of the competing imperialists."
"The people can repel these new imperialist plans and impose their inalienable right to determine their own future and fate on the basis of their own interests against these imperialist plans and ambitions."
"in writing. - The British Conservative Delegation supports strong international naval action against piracy, but we do not believe this is an area where the EU can, or indeed should, be involved."
"We therefore abstained on the Resolution."
"A NATO Naval Maritime Group is already being deployed against piracy in the seas off the Horn of Africa."
"The EU Member States that would have to contribute warships to the 'EU naval force' are already contributing to the NATO response."
"The EU has no additional assets."
"It brings no added value, only complexity, confusion and duplication, when the situation demands coherence, an unambiguous chain of command and political control, and robust rules of engagement."
"This is a job for NATO."
"We also object to references to 'EU fishing vessels', 'EU fishermen' 'Community fishing, merchant and passenger vessels'."
"The EU possesses no ships and none are flagged EU."
"The number of acts of piracy recorded across the world between the years 2000 and 2006 was 2 400."
"This figure does not include the incidents transport undertakings fail to declare for fear that their insurance premiums will be increased."
"The Australian Government has calculated that the real number of acts of piracy is two thousand per cent higher."
"Piracy leads to losses of the order of USD 13-16 billion each year, and this figure is likely to increase significantly over the next few years."
"Somalia is only the tip of the iceberg."
"From 2000 onwards, the most dangerous waters in the world have been those along the coast of south-east Asia, along with the waters around Malaysia, Indonesia, Nigeria, Iraq and Tanzania."
"Acts of sea piracy represent a serious threat not only for human beings, but also for maritime safety."
"The European Union should make every effort to counter this threat."
"The International Financial Accounting Standards (IFRS) are a sound basis on which to unify accounting standards across the world."
"Generalised use of globally accepted accounting standards will improve the transparency and comparability of financial reports."
"The benefits will be felt by enterprises and investors alike."
"The United States only recognises financial reports prepared on the basis of the IFRS in the version issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IAS)."
"The United States has, however, indicated that, for a transitional period, it is prepared to accept financial reports prepared on the basis of the IFRS in the version adopted in the framework of Regulation EC No. 1606/2002 without requiring them to be adjusted."
"I voted in favour of the European Parliament motion for a resolution on the impact of aviation security measures and body scanners, that is, machines producing scanned images of persons as if they were naked, equivalent to a virtual strip search, on human rights, privacy, personal dignity and data protection, because I agree with the rapporteurs that this control measure, far from being merely technical, has a serious impact on the right to privacy, the right to data protection and the right to personal dignity."
"For this reason, I believe that it should be accompanied by strong and adequate safeguards."
"Since conditions for a decision have not yet been met, given that essential information is still lacking, I would like to emphasise the need to ask the Commission, before the expiry of the three-month deadline, to carry out a fundamental rights impact assessment and to urgently draw up an opinion on body scanners by the beginning of November 2008."
"in writing. - (PT) I support the European Parliament motion for a resolution on the impact of aviation security measures and body scanners on human rights, privacy, personal dignity and data protection."
"I am concerned about the proposed regulation which provides for the use of body scanners among the permitted methods for screening passengers at EU airports."
"These machines produce scanned images of persons as if they were naked, which is equivalent to a virtual strip search."
"This measure, far from being merely technical, has a serious impact on the right to privacy, data protection and personal dignity."
"I consider that the conditions for a decision have not yet been met, that the European Parliament is still missing essential information and that the European Commission must carry out a fundamental rights impact assessment, consult the independent data protection authorities and carry out a scientific and medical assessment of the possible health impact of such technologies."
"Taking a decision without doing all this will show a rashness that European citizens will not understand and will represent yet another step in the escalation of security in total disregard for fundamental freedoms and personal dignity."
"in writing. - (RO) I abstained from the vote on this motion for a resolution because the European Union needs to have a much more mature reflection on the balance between security and freedom."
"It goes without saying that both are core values for the citizens in the Member States and need to be protected in equal measure."
"However, we need to be aware that the technology used by criminal gangs or terrorists is, in very many cases, more advanced than that which our law enforcement agencies have available."
"The EU has no excuse for not using the most advanced technical resources available, if using them can mean avoiding the loss of human life."
"in writing. - (PT) In recent years, stricter security requirements in air transport have increasingly led to questions about their compatibility with individual rights."
"This need to harmonise interests traditionally arises in the area of freedom and privacy in particular."
"These concerns have arisen once again in this case and demand an appropriate response which we believe can be given."
"If we take into account, on the one hand, the level of invasion of current methods and, on the other hand, the answers provided by solutions which involve the recording of images and ensure a physical distance between the security person and the passenger being checked, it seems that some of these questions have been overcome or at least could be overcome."
"There is, however, another question which I believe has not been sufficiently covered and which raises major concerns."
"The health implications of this technology have not yet been adequately studied."
"The value put at risk in this case, namely the health of citizens, demands that care be taken."
"This will be difficult to ensure if measures are adopted without the conditions proposed by the original version of the text put to the vote."
"I therefore voted against the amendment which aimed to remove these conditions."
"in writing. - (SV) I am voting in favour of this motion for a resolution, demanding that the problems associated with body scanning be investigated before a decision is taken."
"The resolution could have gone further, however."
"I am opposed in principle to the use of body scanning, which involves too great an infringement of privacy and is disproportionate to what it is desired to achieve."
"The current system is already on the verge of being an invasion of privacy and is sufficiently secure."
"in writing. - (EL) The unacceptable EU motion for a resolution on the use of body scanners at airports has nothing to do with the security of aviation; it forms part of the reactionary policy of the EU and is a grossly flagrant breach of the personal rights and freedom of workers, with painful consequences for their health and safety."
"The demagogic references, reservations and objections to the lack of guarantees relating to body scanners contained in the joint motion for a resolution in question by the European Parliament pave the way for the application of this unacceptable and highly dangerous system."
"The proposed measure, which is a vulgar insult to the dignity of man and his very personality and, at the same time, puts his health at serious risk, reveals yet again the real, repulsive face of the EU of capital."
"The people must again draw their own conclusions."
"Electronically undressing citizens, with or without 'guarantees', is totally unacceptable and it needs to be roundly and decisively condemned straight away."
"Resistance, disobedience and insubordination in the face of the policy and measures of the EU are the only way for the people to safeguard their fundamental dignity."
"in writing. - (NL) The large majority of all nations in the former Yugoslavia wish to join the EU."
"This wish has been expressed not only by the Albanians and Macedonians in Macedonia, who only recently found a solution to their differences of opinion regarding the government of that country, but also by the Serbs, Montenegrins and Albanian Kosovars, who recently bade farewell to a common state, along with the Serbs, Croats and Bosnians in Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"The EU would do well not to overestimate the significance of this."
"The fact that they wish to work together within the EU says nothing at all about the state structure where they live."
"This is in the hands of the people themselves, not the EU."
"If they have to choose between regional self-governance and a transfer of powers to a central government, because that is what the EU wants, then they will opt for the former."
"The war in Bosnia between 1992 and 1995 came about because the majority of residents did not want a central government, but a loose partnership at most."
"Yesterday's debate clearly demonstrated that a large majority of this Parliament would opt for more central government in Bosnia-Herzegovina rather than decentralisation."
"Since this goal is unattainable, the EU condemns itself to an indefinite presence in that country."
"This is why I will be voting against."
"in writing. - (PT) This motion for a resolution forms part of the crude campaign to falsify history by equating communism with fascism, in the process disgracefully whitewashing the latter and placing those whose aim was to enslave humanity on a par with those who heroically fought for freedom."
"As we have previously highlighted, this is a profoundly anti-communist campaign which aims to divide democratic forces by denying and falsifying the communist contribution to the anti-fascist fight and to the development of our civilisation."
"It must not be forgotten that anti-communism was the ideological cement of several fascist dictatorships and a factor used by them to divide democratic forces."
"This motion for a resolution also forms part of the attempts to hide the fact that it is capitalism which is sowing the seeds of misery and hunger in the world."
"Just listen to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations which recently reported that tens of millions of people will fall victim to hunger, a situation that already affects around a billion human beings in the world."
"This motion for a resolution must be viewed in the context of the rise of nationalist forces in Ukraine, the attempts to whitewash the collaboration of Ukrainian pro-fascist groups with the Nazis, the pressure to enlarge NATO and the current anti-Russia campaign."
"in writing. - Labour Euro MPs wish to state our strong support for the belief that the Famine of 1932-33 was an appalling, man-made human tragedy, and we believe it is important to promote remembrance and public awareness of the artificial famine, together with its importance in Ukraine's history."
"Britain's Prime Minister Gordon Brown made a Joint Statement with the President of the Ukraine on 15 May 2008 in which Britain pledged cooperation in international institutions to promote remembrance of the Holodomor."
"Although we do not officially recognise the events of 1932-33 as falling within the definition of the 1948 UN Convention on Genocide, we recognise that some academic opinion supports this view and are committed to following the debate and studying any emerging evidence closely."
"in writing. - (FR) Our Parliament is at last recognising the horror of the extermination by famine - the Holomodor - instigated in the Ukraine by the Soviet regime."
"It is regrettable, however, that it has not taken the Ukrainian Parliament's lead and described this mass crime as a genocide."
"Indeed, the famine, which killed millions of Ukrainians between 1932 and 1933, did not result exclusively from the economic and social absurdity of communism; it was the fruit of an extermination plan fitting the definition of a genocide, that is to say: 'the intention to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such', and also 'deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part'."
"At a time when, in France, in particular, a certain middle-class communist left extreme is benefiting from media support, recognition of a genocide such as this would make it possible to remember the horrors of Marxism-Leninism, which has been responsible for the deaths of 200 million human beings since the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 and which is today still oppressing over one and a half billion people, in Cuba, in North Korea, in Vietnam and, above all, in China, where the most uncontrolled form of capitalism combines very well with communist totalitarianism."
"in writing. - (NL) My group has not signed this motion for a resolution and the majority have voted against, the reason being that they believe that the emergence of the Soviet Union in what was then a backward Russia was a step forward and enabled many badly trained, badly paid and rightless people to have a better life."
"I share this belief, but this cannot justify all the means that were used then."
"Some in favour of modernisation, not least their leader Stalin, considered the individual right to life of people who hold different views completely insignificant."
"This stance fitted into the framework of a long Russian tradition of oppression and violence."
"All the bad means from the past were dusted down, this time to break any opposition to progress."
"The original ideal of democracy and equal rights for all people was placed second to this."
"The good that was pursued became the justification for the bad that was being done, based on the idea that history always judges in favour of the victors."
"We are now 75 years down the line, and it is only right and proper that much attention should be devoted to what went wrong then and the many victims in this."
"This is why I will be voting in favour of this motion for a resolution."
"in writing. - I and my British Conservative colleagues support the work of the European Ombudsman and believe that many of the proposals for improving the operation of the role in this report are worthy of support."
"With regard to recital B, I wish to make clear that the British Conservative MEP Delegation opposes the Treaty of Lisbon and the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into that Treaty."
"We believe that the ratification procedure on this Treaty should end following the decisive 'no' vote in Ireland."
"in writing. - (PT) In this report, the Committee on Petitions encourages the Ombudsman to continue the dual aim that he announced in his 2006 Annual Report, namely working with the institutions to promote good administration and increasing communication efforts so that all citizens who might need to make use of his services are properly informed of how to do so."
"The increase in the number of complaints lodged confirms the importance of this information."
"It should be remembered that the Ombudsman now has more powers, following changes adopted by the European Parliament at his request."
"The total number of inquiries dealt with by the Ombudsman in 2007 rose to 641."
"Of these, 64% concerned the European Commission, 14% EPSO (European Personnel Selection Office), 9% the European Parliament and 1% the Council of the European Union."
"The main types of alleged maladministration were lack of transparency, including refusal of information, unfairness and abuse of powers, unsatisfactory procedures, avoidable delay, discrimination, negligence, legal errors and failure to ensure fulfilment of obligations."
"In some instances, the cases were settled."
"On 19 May 2008 the European Ombudsman, Mr Diamandouros, submitted his report to the Committee on Petitions."
"In it, he presented a detailed account of his activities together with data expressed in terms of figures and percentages."
"According to the report, the number of admissible complaints addressed to the Ombudsman has risen."
"It increased from 449 in 2006 to 518 in 2007."
"Compared to 2006, the number of inadmissible complaints fell last year."
"The reasons for lodging complaints were various. They included lack of transparency, unsatisfactory procedures, avoidable delays, discrimination, failure to ensure fulfilment of obligations and legal errors."
"Most of the complaints, as much as 65% of the total, concerned the European Commission."
"Only 9% of the complaints lodged with the Ombudsman concerned the European Parliament."
"The European Ombudsman also mentioned errors on the part of the European institutions."
"Mr Diamandouros criticised the European Commission for failing to comply with the legal requirement to publish in 2006 the 2005 annual report on access to documents of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"

"Approval of Minutes of previous sitting: see Minutes"
"1."
"Venezuela"
"The next item is the debate on three motions for resolutions on Venezuela."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Venezuela is a great country and the Venezuelan people have deep-rooted democratic traditions and sentiments."
"However, they have unfortunately been living for some years in a terrible situation, which is getting worse, in which their fundamental rights are being violated."
"That is why we are once again discussing this issue in this House and why we must condemn this situation."
"We condemn the abuse of personal data in lists used for political persecution along totalitarian guidelines, such as the 'Tascón list', 'Maisanta list' and 'Russián list'."
"The actions taken to disqualify dozens of citizens from standing in the regional and local elections to be held in Venezuela are unacceptable."
"The expulsion of human rights organisations, such as representatives of the NGO Human Rights Watch, simply for having made pertinent observations, is unacceptable."
"It is also shocking that the violence and intolerance being fuelled by the authorities has even produced young victims."
"We therefore condemn and regret the assassination of a young student leader who died a victim of this climate of violence which is being fuelled by the authorities."
"We demand the truth and that those responsible are prosecuted."
"We Europeans have to be more active."
"Just imagine if this were happening in our countries."
"Would we accept, in our countries, the disqualification of citizens from standing in elections, as is happening in Venezuela?"
"If not, then how can we close our eyes to this?"
"How can we close our eyes and pretend that nothing is happening?"
"How can we accept, for example, the attitude of the Portuguese Government - my country, unfortunately, for which I am ashamed - which is bowing down before the Venezuelan Government, which has a boot-licking policy and which has recently become the European receiving room for the tyrants?"
"This is truly unacceptable."
"It is vital that the Commission and the Council become firmer and clearer in their condemnation of these human rights' violations."
"Mr President, a detailed explanation of the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr Julio Soto in Maracaibo must be provided."
"I would like to convey my condolences to his family."
"We call for the perpetrators of this crime to be properly tried and punished."
"The observations and comments made by Human Rights Watch merit our attention, especially as this is an independent organisation that does not receive subsidies from any quarter."
"We wish to protest against the ban on the activities of this organisation."
"We call for full respect for freedom of expression in the media and freedom of association."
"We call for full implementation of the legislation to protect women against violence."
"We call for the November elections to be run in such a way as to ensure that there can be no reservations about the conduct of the election campaign or about the election process itself."
"Venezuela should be a democratic country where people enjoy the same degree of freedom as they do in each of the Member States of the European Union."
"author. - Mr President, for several years the situation of the Opposition in Venezuela has been very difficult, and questioning Venezuelan democracy has been legitimate."
"But what is happening at the moment is proof that Venezuela's democracy and the rule of law are a mockery."
"To use an administrative measure in order to ban people for 15 years from holding or running for official positions is unacceptable."
"Only the courts should be allowed to take such decisions, and only after convicting perpetrators of serious crimes."
"The perversity of this measure can be easily noticed when it is realised that the vast majority of those banned are from the political Opposition, a practice that most likely will not be used only for the elections this November but may continue for the elections which will follow."
"It is not surprising that this political disqualification is happening at a time when human rights advocates who criticise the current government are being expelled from Venezuela and when very suspicious accidents, resulting in the deaths of people who expressed criticisms, are not properly investigated."
"The European Parliament must send a firm message to public opinion in Venezuela that political disqualification is an undemocratic practice and is contrary to the very foundation of the rule of law."
"We must strongly reject the allegations of the Venezuelan Vice-Minister for Europe that the European Parliament refused to vote on this resolution in September because it was seen as a vote against the anti-corruption fight."
"Such a manoeuvre to manipulate Venezuelan public opinion is undignified for a minister for Europe."
"We also strongly reject his accusation that what we are doing here constitutes an attack against a sovereign country."
"This resolution is the expression of our concern regarding democratic evolution and respect for human rights in a country whose people we highly admire and respect."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, the brutal murder of Julio Soto represents a provisional climax in the dramatic collapse of democracy and the rule of law in Venezuela, a country which for a while played a positive role in Latin America."
"However, under the current regime it is not only the case that fundamental human rights are being totally disregarded, but also that a megalomaniac dictator is attempting to export his inhuman system of terror to the entire continent and even to Europe, if you take into account his links with Belarus."
"For this reason, it is essential that we put a stop to his plans quickly, for the sake of his own population, but also for the sake of populations of other nations which he is attempting to buy or blackmail with his oil wealth, in order to impose his ideology on them."
"If he should raise the argument of national sovereignty, I can only say that there is something which is far more important than any national sovereignty and that is fundamental and universal human rights."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, there is no doubt that Venezuela has had a traumatic history in recent, as well as more distant, times, and endogenous causes are not the only ones to blame."
"Indeed, exogenous factors are perhaps far more significant in this respect."
"However, whatever, or whoever, is to blame, it has been mainly the innocent civilian population that has suffered."
"The present government, headed by Mr Chávez, obviously has an axe to grind with the USA and its supporters and allies, but that must not lead to such gross violations of the Venezuelan people's rights as the institution of so-called 'administrative disqualification' from elections or the persecution and murder of opposition activists."
"Mr Chávez must realise that if he wants his country to progress to prosperity, then he must make sure that his government functions strictly within the limits of democracy and respect for human rights."
"Using violence and persecution against his own people can only lead his country to more national trauma and suffering, and this we must not allow to happen."
"Mr President, the resolution on violation of human rights in Venezuela is based on facts and is an action worthy of support."
"Unfortunately, for many years Venezuelan society has been experiencing polarisation of political forces."
"I refer, for example, to the coup by part of the army, intolerance, stratification of society in terms of property, or racial differences."
"President Chavez's team is the most active in all this because pursuant to the presidential system he can exercise control over the administration and the armed forces."
"As a result of this struggle over decisions taken, the structure of Venezuelan society is becoming similar to that of Cuba, namely socialism with historical and nationalistic features."
"This could lead to changing the country's flag and the national anthem."
"The present changes have not had a significant impact on the standard of living, as Venezuela is immensely rich in natural resources."
"The latter cushion the impact of the changes and make it possible to engage in populist action."
"The situation is so serious that the resolution alone will not halt the process of further limitation of citizens' rights in Venezuela."
"The practical support of all the countries in the region is called for."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) Once again we are faced with an unacceptable and deplorable attempt by the European Parliament to interfere, which just happens to have occurred before the regional and local elections in Venezuela."
"At heart, the inclusion of this debate on the agenda and the motion for a resolution are simply intended to respond to those who support and encourage an already long-standing and worrying attempt to interfere with and destabilise a democratic and sovereign state."
"The aim is to blatantly promote interference in Venezuela's internal affairs, by trying to meddle and exert pressure from outside in order to impose decisions that only the Venezuelan people have the sovereign right to take."
"Instead of distorting the facts and trying to give Venezuela lessons on democracy, the European Parliament should have included on the agenda a debate about the EU's attempt to impose a proposed European Treaty, which has already been rejected, in total disregard for the democratic decisions sovereignly taken by the French, Dutch and Irish people, and also bearing in mind the refusal to allow other people to give their opinion through referendums."
"Instead of meddling in something which only the Venezuelan people can decide, the European Parliament should have rejected the inhumane return directive which disregards and violates the human rights of immigrants, many of whom are from Latin America."
"What really bothers the sponsors of this initiative is the fact that the Venezuelan people have set an example which is causing problems for the major financial and economic interests that control the European Union."
"They have set an example of how to affirm national sovereignty and independence, how to build a patriotic project of emancipation, progress and development, and how to develop anti-imperialist solidarity."
"They have shown that it is worthwhile for a people to fight and that it is possible to have a fairer, more democratic and more peaceful country and world."
"Reality shows that the best response to this attempted interference by the European Parliament is the enormous prestige and importance that the Bolivarian process has for the people of Latin America and the world."
"As a result, they should stop claiming that they can preach to the rest of the world."
"We are today debating breaches of human rights in Venezuela due to failure to respect the civil and political rights contained in the Venezuelan constitution, and denying these rights to opponents of the present government."
"It is impossible for members of the opposition to stand in elections, there is no freedom of expression, and observers from international organisations are being expelled."
"This debate is therefore a good opportunity for us to express our opposition to the democratic deficit in Venezuela and beyond."
"The debate is also an opportunity to call for the truth in public and political life."
"The President of Venezuela has succumbed to the temptation to seek absolute power. So too have the leaders of many other countries and empires seeking to subjugate people who think differently or who are poorer."
"Mr Chávez's new Left-Wing doctrine is known as Christian Socialism but it has little in common with the social teachings of the Church."
"That is why representatives of the Venezuelan bishops have criticised the lack of democracy."
"The Gospel story about the mote and the log often comes to mind in this context."
"(LT) Ten years have passed since Hugo Chavez became President of Venezuela."
"The 1999 Constitution of Venezuela was a perfect opportunity to strengthen the rule of law and guarantee human rights in this country."
"Today however, we have to admit that this historical opportunity has been missed."
"We know that in Venezuela, the Venezuela ruled by President Chavez, discrimination of political opponents and critics is tolerated, even encouraged."
"In the Venezuela ruled by him the judiciary is no longer independent, and we also know about the situation facing unions and the press in this country."
"Our resolution today is one more reminder to President Chavez that the constitution is not just a piece of paper; its rules must be enforced in real life."
"- (PL) The House is about to debate the very dramatic and tragic situation in Congo, where the victims are counted in hundreds, or even in thousands."
"In comparison, the situation in Venezuela appears far less serious."
"It concerns violations of electoral rights and expulsions from the country."
"The first murder has taken place, though. A student leader has been killed."
"Even at this stage, however, it is very important to raise the issue, because we must bear in mind that every such process begins with the violation of democratic rights."
"The first stage is always abuse of power for want of arguments, and this subsequently leads to murder."
"The resolution makes sense, therefore."
"It serves as a signal, or as a reminder that this dangerous process has been noted when we still have the chance to monitor it and prevent genocide."
"(EL) Mr President, it is obvious that, on the eve of the elections in Venezuela, a manifestly unacceptable attempt is being made to interfere in domestic developments in this country in the obvious aim of influencing the outcome of the elections."
"The situation in Venezuela is a major and important victory for workers in Europe and in the world in general, because positive steps have been taken during recent developments in this country and workers' problems are being resolved, despite the difficulties and the obstacles and despite the interventions of American imperialism."
"The attempt being made is unacceptable and we wish to take this opportunity to condemn the action by the political forces intervening in the internal affairs of Venezuela with this resolution."
"I should like to close by saying that it is unthinkable for seven parliamentarians to take the political responsibility during a sitting of the European Parliament of condemning a nation fighting for its freedom and to meet its current needs."
"The right of a people to determine their own future is non-negotiable and we should all respect that."
"Mr President, when one thinks of democracy, one thinks of human rights."
"The importance of a voice and a vote at all levels of government is very understandable."
"For years this has not been the case in Venezuela, a country rife with corruption and currently led by Mr Chávez."
"Under his government, there is a history of intimidation of Opposition members, cases of Opposition party members being brutally murdered, and defenders of human rights and members of NGOs having been forcibly removed."
"Additionally, Venezuela presently uses so-called screening lists not only to keep citizens from holding public office, but also depriving them from the right to vote freely for their preferred representatives."
"What we, as a democratic body, should be seeking from Venezuela is compliance with international standards of democracy, allowing Venezuelan citizens to take advantage of the fundamentals, the freedom to freely and openly criticise those in power and the ability to change the government via election without fear."
"Mr President, President Chávez has been something of a darling of the Left in Europe."
"Most notably, in my constituency, he was championed by the former Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone."
"This allowed his unsavoury image to be somewhat airbrushed with a veneer of spurious respectability."
"President Chávez has, of course, presided over a diminution of the rights and freedoms of the Venezuelan people."
"He has undermined political freedom, the rule of law, the independence of the courts, and the freedom of the media and organised labour."
"Politicians like Mr Livingstone who endorse leaders like President Chávez undermine genuine democracy and reveal a great deal about themselves."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission is following the situation in Venezuela with great interest."
"The country is in the process of preparing for the regional and local elections which will take place on 23 November."
"It is worth noting that in the last few years several democratic electoral processes have taken place in Venezuela."
"Some of them have been monitored by European Observation Missions which concluded that, in general, they complied with international standards and national legislation."
"Others have not, as was the case with the last referendum, since we were not invited."
"The Commission is aware of the concerns expressed by some of you and also many sectors of Venezuelan society about the constitutionality of the 'disqualifications'."
"These are believed by some to be intended to obstruct the full participation of the opposition in the November elections."
"The Commission has taken note of the explanation provided on several occasions by the Venezuelan authorities, in relation to the constitutionality of these 'administrative sanctions' imposed by the State Controller on a number of civil servants."
"We stress the importance of guaranteeing the rights of all citizens who want to participate in the elections, in accordance with the Constitution and the rule of law."
"We hope that the upcoming elections will strengthen democracy in Venezuela and that the results will reflect the views of the whole of Venezuelan society."
"We encourage all actors to engage in the electoral process in a spirit of tolerance, civic-mindedness and respect for pluralism of opinions."
"The Commission is also aware of the expulsion of the representatives of Human Rights Watch from Venezuela."
"We have heard the voices which have condemned this decision as a measure which adversely affects the right to freedom of expression and an act demonstrating an intolerant attitude towards criticism."
"In this context, we stress the importance that the EU attaches to freedom of expression and opinion."
"Freedom of expression is one of the fundamental human rights, and constitutes the cornerstone of democracy and the rule of law."
"I wish to assure Parliament that the Commission will continue to follow closely the developments in Venezuela."
"The Commission's commitments to supporting development of democracy and the promotion of human rights will continue to be reflected in our cooperation policies and relations with Venezuela."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of this afternoon's debates."

"Democratic Republic of Congo: clashes in the eastern border areas"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on the Democratic Republic of Congo: clashes in the eastern border areas."
"author. - Mr President, the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is profoundly traumatising for Congolese society."
"Amongst other atrocities, rape has been used for many years as a weapon of war and tens of thousands of women and girls are suffering."
"Our empathy is not enough."
"Without any doubt, there is an ongoing genocide against women in Congo, and we can no longer afford to turn a blind eye to this dreadful situation."
"Words are not enough to describe the horrors these women have to endure."
"Undoubtedly, the clashes of the rebels in the eastern provinces will bring more and more violence, including sexual violence."
"How many women and girls have to die, be gang-raped, butchered, enslaved, contaminated with HIV, rejected by their communities, until we decide at am international level to engage seriously and with a long-term view on this subject?"
"There should be no tolerance for the sexual violence against girls and women."
"The impunity of the perpetrators must come to an end and the rule of law has to be restored in the eastern provinces of the DRC."
"We all have to acknowledge that this situation demands a multifaceted approach."
"Peace needs to be achieved, the rule of law established and society saved from the poverty trap in the eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"This implies that the exploitation of Congolese natural resources must follow the rule of law as well."
"author. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, please accept the apologies of my colleague, Mr Hutchinson, who could not be with us today."
"5 400 000 people - that is the number of victims of the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo since 1998."
"Every day, 1 500 people die."
"These people are women who do not survive the mutilations inflicted upon them; they are rebels or soldiers from the Congolese regular army; they are also child soldiers, snatched from their parents; they are little girls whose short time on Earth will have been a nightmare."
"The violence of the words I use is nothing compared to the violence that has been taking place in the Democratic Republic of Congo for too long, violence that has increased and spread over the past few weeks, and all this amid the total indifference of the international community."
"The reports we have gathered are, however, damning: damning for the soldiers, in various rebel factions on the ground; damning, too, for the government forces which, instead of protecting the population, represent a threat to them; damning, even, for the UN, which is incapable of guaranteeing the protection of civilians."
"It follows that the resolution that we are debating is designed to alert international public opinion to what is going on and puts forward a series of very practical demands along the lines of ensuring a swift and lasting resolution to this conflict."
"Among these demands, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament lays particular emphasis on several points: firstly, strengthening the UN mission with European personnel capable of communicating with the population; and secondly, we are calling on Congo's highest political and military authorities to do their utmost to ensure that soldiers from the Congolese army put a stop to their atrocities once and for all."
"author. - (ES) Mr President, I should like to emphasise some of the aspects already mentioned in relation to the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"The first is obvious."
"The conflict that we are talking about has many causes."
"We are talking about a problem that concerns access to resources."
"We are also talking about the impunity with which these resources are exploited, the impunity with which certain people 'wander' around the region committing atrocities without being prosecuted either by local authorities or by international forces and, thirdly, the impunity resulting in the constant presence of international arms which keep arriving in the region."
"I feel that these three elements, and the link between them, are fundamental because they firstly highlight the need for an in-depth review of the United Nations' presence in the region."
"Secondly, we must very closely study the issue of violence perpetrated against women, particularly sexual violence."
"This is an issue that we have discussed before in this House."
"We should take this opportunity to again insist that both the United Nations and the European Union demand that rape and in particular recourse to the torture and abuse of women as a sexual weapon are regarded as war crimes."
"We have been calling for this in all the appropriate arenas for a long time."
"There is also a third aspect that I feel should be highlighted: this whole problem stems from one of the greatest sources of wealth in the world, namely diamonds."
"The consistent and precise application of monitoring mechanisms such as the Kimberley process is absolutely fundamental to this basic issue."
"Please allow me to remind you that, next week in the United Nations, a debate will begin on the adoption of an international treaty on arms exports."
"I believe that this is a golden opportunity to stress that this is absolutely vital in contexts such as the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"author. - (NL) Mr President, it is becoming increasingly important for the residents in Congo to find a way to survive, even if it remains impossible to create a central government."
"We should, as a matter of urgency, try to prevent all circumstances that expose them to violence and exploitation, forced displacement or famines."
"Why is Congo the sum total of everything that can go wrong in Africa?"
"Congo started out as a colonial mining project in the poorly accessible interior of Africa."
"There was no Congolese people with shared interests and prospects, only a multitude of peoples in isolated areas."
"When Congo gained its independence nearly 50 years ago, the then warring politicians became household names the world over."
"Tshombe and Kalonji, closely connected with mining interests, sought to split their south-eastern region, with considerable natural resources, from the rest of the country."
"The only visionary who took pride in giving the country as a whole a serious future, Patrice Lumumba, was promptly silenced."
"After this, the military dictator Mobutu ran the country like a private company, one that was completely subject to his whims, for a long time."
"The hope that the death of Mobutu would finally herald the beginning of progress in Congo has been dashed."
"The second President since Mobutu, Mr Kabila, has failed to inspire or control large parts of the country."
"Congo's present options are determined by failed elections, whose outcomes have been controversial from the word go and have certainly not been universally accepted, by mass migration from the eastern neighbouring countries, regional rulers with mining interests and rebel armies."
"It remains to be seen whether a unified solution for an undivided Congo is still on the cards."
"author. - (PL) Mr President, some Polish clergymen are currently in Congo, along with clergy from other countries."
"In their missions, they are working to protect the civilian population, mainly women and children, against violence."
"The Polish armed forces have also been involved in the peace missions."
"I therefore feel personally affected by the dramatic events in Congo."
"Particular concern has been expressed about the situation in North Kivu and about peacekeeping in the Ituri region."
"For many years now, horrific massacres, the rape of women and girls, plus conscription of children into the army have all been everyday occurences in this country."
"We call upon the governments of the Democratic Republic of Congo and of Rwanda to engage in constructive dialogue that will enable Congo to emerge from this humanitarian disaster."
"I would like to make a very important point."
"The real reason why this conflict stalled was that South African workers refused to unload Chinese weapons."
"We call upon governments in the Great Lakes region to engage in a dialogue to halt the violence in Congo."
"I appeal to the European Commission to step up medical assistance to the civilian population in Congo."
"In particular, aid is needed for women and children infected as a result of rape."
"on behalf of the draftsman. - (DE) Mr President, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is currently in the same situation as Europe after the Thirty Years War, when the rule of law collapsed."
"However, Congo is suffering to a far greater extent."
"Bands of uniformed men are roaming the country, some of which refer to themselves as the 'official army' and others the 'private army'."
"In reality they are all bands of criminals who are plundering the country and murdering, raping and robbing the civilian population."
"Peace will not return to Congo until at least a semblance of the rule of law is re-established at a regional and national level."
"For this reason, our task in the European Union is firstly to provide humanitarian aid, but secondly to ensure that the country has a minimum level of national security."
"We are far from being able to do this and the intervention which took place in Congo, and we do need to be self-critical at this point, was obviously not as successful as we would have liked."
"For this reason, it is essential that we begin to plan straight away how we can bring stability back to this country at the heart of Africa with all the peaceful and, if necessary, military means at our disposal, or even using peacekeeping troops."
"We have not reached this point yet, but we must discuss it."
"When you look at Congo, and I have had several opportunities to fly over the country, you realise that Congo touches all areas of Africa in a way which is not the case with any other African country."
"We cannot have a stable African continent without a stable Congo and therefore we have very strong obligations in this respect."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, in fact we are extremely concerned about the resurgence of violence in the eastern provinces of Congo."
"We therefore call on all participants to return immediately to the peace process to which they committed themselves in January."
"I would like to make three points."
"First, the Congolese Government has to take special responsibility to put an end to the widespread sexual violence against women and girls used as a weapon in this internal warfare."
"Second, international pressure should be put on the governments of both the DRC and Rwanda to make them restart a constructive dialogue."
"Third, we call on all EU governments to provide special assistance immediately to the population of eastern Congo."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ET) Ladies and gentlemen, today we are discussing a very complicated region, and it seems to me that we are discussing it mainly in order to emphasise how bad the situation is, and not because we have a clear idea of how to resolve the situation."
"I would, however, like to make a few comments, although I will be repeating what previous speakers, including Mr Kelam, have said."
"The most important thing is to support the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo in order to find a solution to this crisis."
"Violence only engenders new violence, and I would not like to say that men's lives are somehow less important or that violence against men is permissible, but the situation of women and children in Congo is truly awful, and special attention should be devoted to them."
"I appeal to the international community, to the UN Security Council for improved assistance, to the Council and Commission for the provision of medical aid - above all to the greatest risk group - and also specific assistance from the Member States is definitely important."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo has in recent years been the site of massacres, as well as a variety of immensely cruel and sadistic crimes against human beings, mainly involving innocent civilians, including many women and children."
"The African Union, the EU and the UN have proven themselves to be shamefully incapable of making a determined effort to establish peace in that region."
"This has been mainly due to the lack of provision of the resources necessary to be effective in protecting the local population and in providing it with much-needed special assistance, and in truly helping to bring about an eventual political solution to the prevailing conflicts."
"Let us hope that this resolution will help to beef up peace assistance to Congo and, not least, perhaps to deter those evil-minded governments around the world which continue to provide armaments to the warring factions in Congo from continuing so to do."
"Mr President, the peace agreement reached in Goma on 28 January 2008 did not resolve the problems nor did it bring about peace in the eastern territories of the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"The raping of women and even small girls continued, as did looting and the forced conscription of civilians and children into the armed forces."
"All sides in the conflict committed atrocities."
"I could mention the rebel groups, the fighters of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, and the Congolese army."
"The clashes resumed, proving that the war which began over four years ago is continuing and intensifying."
"Worrying information has recently emerged from North Kivu, concerning hundreds of dead bodies dumped in rivers and around one hundred thousand displaced people."
"Not only is the war causing fatalities, but it is also resulting in devastation, more acute hunger and widespread demoralisation."
"The Congolese authorities and army will not be able to resolve the region's problems on their own."
"International assistance is required, including assistance from the European Union."
"Material aid in the form of food and medical aid is also urgently needed."
"The Union for Europe of the Nations Group fully supports this resolution before the House."
"The well-being of every individual and his or her right to life and peace must triumph."
"Mr President, the atrocities endured in the Congo are unimaginable to those of us who live in peaceful civilised societies."
"How can we offer practical help to people such as the Congolese?"
"Direct military intervention and humanitarian aid must only come from international effort under the auspices of the United Nations, but time and time again we see the leaders of these types of failed states being allowed to plunder their countries and enjoy their wealth in the Western world."
"The stable and peaceful countries of the world should unite to ensure that vast amounts of wealth cannot be stolen and then deposited in western banks with impunity."
"International agreements should be reached to ensure that leaders of such states cannot live off their ill-gotten gains."
"This would be at least one small element of an overall solution to help develop stability in countries such as the Congo."
"Mr President, renewed combat in the eastern part of the Congo is making a mockery of human rights and is silencing democracy."
"Despite the signing of the Goma peace accord in January of this year, the abuse of the most fundamental of human rights has continued: women of all ages being raped, massacres committed and child soldiers being gathered up."
"A situation of such fragility cannot be ignored."
"We must use our position as one of the strongest voices in the international community to call for peace, cooperation and stability in the region."
"We can also use this voice to condemn the recent statements of Laurent Nkunda, who called for the overthrow of the elected and legitimate government of the Congo."
"The Congolese army alone does not have the human, technical or financial resources to carry out its tasks in eastern Congo."
"But a global statement, like the signing of the Child Soldier Accountability Act this month in America, reminds us all that help can be offered to such countries and authorities in bringing violators of human rights to justice."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission shares the concerns about the degraded situation in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, which is causing further stress to an already seriously affected population."
"It is also particularly worried about the widespread human rights violations in the region, including violence against women and the continuous mobilisation of child soldiers in the conflict."
"The Commission restates its conviction that the current crisis involving Kinshasa and the Congolese rebel groups has no military solution."
"Hence, we encourage all parties to this conflict to rapidly resume dialogue and promote courageous political compromises, taking into consideration the commitments agreed upon in January 2008, the so-called Actes d'engagement de Goma."
"In this context, it is extremely important to restore acceptable confidence levels amongst all Congolese stakeholders directly involved."
"As a preliminary step, all parties without exception should abide without delay by an effective ceasefire with a view to implementing the military disengagement plan provided by the United Nations."
"In addition, it must be borne in mind that the underlying root causes of the conflict also include the dramatic problems posed by foreign armed groups in Democratic Republic of Congo territory, in particular the Rwandan FDLR, an issue where most of the DRC commitments taken in the Nairobi communiqué have still to be put into action."
"Given the multiple challenges which still lie ahead in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Commission strongly advocates that the UN's peacekeeping mission mandate should be renewed and, where possible, strengthened in order to ensure effective protection for the population and support to the Congolese army in tackling the foreign armed groups."
"In addition to the relentless efforts of the EU facilitation team, it is important to ensure the broader participation of African diplomacy (including the African Union) in the resolution of the eastern DRC conflicts, especially in areas where a sustainable solution would be greatly facilitated by close cooperation between neighbouring countries, in particular the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda."
"As regards our support to the population in conflict-affected areas, the Commission will continue to provide support via both our humanitarian and development cooperation."
"More specifically, regarding health services (an issue raised by all the resolutions), it is important to stress that the Commission has been active since 1994 in the health sector in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is today one of the focal sectors of our cooperation."
"In addition to humanitarian aid, we are currently providing strategic and financial support to the Congolese authorities to improve the quality of medical services and the qualifications of medical staff."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of this afternoon's debates."
"3."
"Burma"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Burma."
"Mr President, the Burmese military junta has not succeeded in keeping the promises it made to the international community after the so-called sapphire revolution."
"It has not succeeded either in improving the situation for its society, which is rebelling and claiming its legitimate rights."
"Democracy and development will not be crushed by the brutal repression of widespread protests in September of this year, or by mass imprisonments."
"Burma must move towards complying with democratic principles, and ensuring freedom of expression, freedom of association and meeting, a multi-party system and release of political prisoners."
"It must also develop an independent judiciary and discourage ethnic cleansing."
"Burma needs assistance."
"More involvement is therefore needed on the part of the United Nations, its Secretary-General, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the European Commission, and the governments of countries with influence on the Burmese authorities."
"In the name of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, on whose behalf I have taken the floor, and on behalf of the authors, I would like to express support for this resolution, which I commend to Members of the House."
"author. - Mr President, this is the sixth European Parliament resolution on Burma in the last two years, but the monstrous Burmese military junta seems to have taken no notice at all of what the EU thinks or says."
"Meanwhile, the ordinary citizens of Burma continue to suffer oppression, persecution and poverty, all of which are the result of the brutal, anachronistic and shameful stance taken by the brainless military regime controlling that country."
"The dictators, of course, continue to get richer and to lead a lavish life at the expense of their citizens' suffering."
"It seems that resolutions have little effect on these military criminals and, in my view, the most significant reason for this is the fact that countries like China, India and Russia continue to support Burma economically and politically."
"It seems to me that our attention should now be directed not at Burma itself, but at those three countries."
"It should be made clear to them that they must stop aiding the heartless and mindless military generals of Burma or their relationship with the EU will suffer severely and irreversibly."
"author. - (PL) Mr President, Burma has become almost a permanent subject of debate in this House."
"We return to the situation in Burma at every session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg."
"The forthcoming ASEM summit is an opportunity for the European Union, represented by the French Presidency, to raise certain fundamental issues with the Burmese authorities."
"The first is the release of political prisoners."
"According to Amnesty International, there are currently some 2 100 political prisoners in Burma."
"The second is an end to the torture of those held in prison."
"There is a constant risk of suffering torture in Burma."
"Thirdly, the Burmese army must behave professionally."
"It must respect human rights during military action against ethnic minorities, notably against the Karen people at this time."
"The European Union cannot tolerate violence and crimes against humanity."
"Finally, the European Union's policy has to produce tangible effects."
"We need to consider whether sanctions impact most on Burma's leaders or on its people."
"Our policy needs to be a wise one."
"The European Union must reconsider its policy on sanctions against Burma."
"On the one hand, therefore, we must insist on respect for human rights and democratic freedoms."
"On the other, the international community must adopt an effective policy towards Burma."
"author. - (ES) Mr President, tomorrow's Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) in Beijing affords an excellent opportunity for the attending Heads of State or Government of the European Union to once again raise the worrying situation of human rights in Burma."
"As already requested in a letter from Amnesty International, it would be absolutely appropriate for the President-in-Office of the Council, Nicolas Sarkozy, as joint chair of the ASEM, to express Europe's very great concern about the more than 2 100 political prisoners and also to demand their immediate release."
"Another source of concern is the current military offensive against the Karen populations in the east of the country, where the biggest military operation in a decade has taken place."
"The operation's direct target is the civilian population and has led to the internal displacement of 150 000 people."
"In June 2006, Amnesty International proved that this type of practice did in fact constitute a crime against humanity."
"Furthermore, as requested by Burma Campaign Spain and Burma Campaign International among others, the fundamental political problems will be discussed for the first time during the planned visit in December of the Secretary-General of the United Nations."
"The Secretary-General has already recently visited the country on two occasions, following cyclone 'Nargis' earlier this year."
"We have certainly never before had such a seemingly broad consensus among Europeans and Asians on combining forces and putting pressure on the regime to release all political prisoners."
"That is why the meeting which will begin tomorrow is so vitally important."
"It is regrettable that the United Nations has for so long ignored, and sometimes even believed, the lies of the regime, as proven by the fact that, following 37 visits made by the UN Envoy, no significant progress has been observed."
"That is why I must add my voice to those calling on both the European Heads of State or Government - obviously including the Spanish Prime Minister, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero - and the United Nations to show that they truly support a change in Burma."
"It is therefore vital that they call for the immediate release of those detained."
"The opportunity available as from tomorrow must not therefore be lost and the Heads of State or Government must respond in line with expectations."
"I trust that these Heads of State or Government, in particular President Sarkozy, will be able to rise to the occasion, that they will be particularly aware of the gravity of the situation and that they will act accordingly."
"If the European Union truly wants to be a credible political player, with a foreign policy based on the defence and promotion of human rights, and if it does not want to appear, as so often happens, to simply be serving the economic interests of major companies such as Total and Chevron, then this is the moment to prove it."
"It is in situations such as these that we can gain this credibility."
"Many lives are depending on these actions."
"author. - Mr President, tomorrow marks the 13th anniversary of the unjust incarceration of Aung San Suu Kyi, Burma's most revered political prisoner."
"This timely Parliament resolution condemns her continued detention and insists upon her immediate release."
"Aung San Suu Kyi's latest five-year term of house arrest was extended in May for a further year."
"Article 10b of the Burmese state protection law 1975 stipulates that a person judged to be a threat to the sovereignty and security of the state and the peace of the people can only be detained for up to five years."
"Therefore this prolonged detention is illegal."
"Suu Kyi has spent more than 13 years of the past 19 years confined to her Rangoon home."
"I also deplore the fact that the number of political prisoners in Burma has increased from 1 300 to over 2 100 since the Saffron Revolution of September 2007."
"The military junta has clearly failed to deliver on promises made to the international community in this regard."
"Whereas the release of veteran journalist and National League for Democracy (NLD) secretary U Win Tin and six other leaders last month was a step in the right direction, further moves must be made to free Burmese political dissidents."
"I call on the Secretary-General of the United Nations to press ahead with a second visit to Burma in December irrespective of the prevailing conditions in order to make an urgent personal appeal for the release of all political prisoners and the full inclusion of the National League for Democracy in preparations for the 2010 elections."
"Finally, I call on leaders at the ASEM summit beginning tomorrow in China on the 13th anniversary of Suu Kyi's detention to understand their responsibilities regarding ongoing oppression in one of their neighbouring countries and to take decisive action accordingly to condemn the Burmese military junta for their continued suppression of political dissidents."
"author. - (FI) Mr President, Commissioner, Burma has no respect for human rights or civil freedoms."
"As many here have said, it is not for the first time that we are adopting a position on a the lack of freedom of expression, suppression of information, a ban on freedom of assembly, a violation of very basic principles of the rule of law, and a ban on opposition."
"The Burmese nation's worst enemy is its own country's leadership, which, with the support of the army, by force of arms and through violence, forces its people to be controlled by its state monopoly."
"The junta's prisons hold more political prisoners than ever."
"The junta also works against its own people, by preventing international emergency aid from reaching areas where natural disaster has struck."
"The international community is powerless as it witnesses the Burmese people perish because of their leaders, who are repressive but do nothing at the same time."
"In our statement we appeal to the ASEM Summit, so that the other countries in the region might exert pressure on the junta to work towards the release of political prisoners."
"We are being a little sanctimonious in insisting on this, of course, as we know that Burma is not the only country in the region where human rights are being trampled into the mud."
"Our group supports the joint resolution."
"Mr President, Commissioner, one year after the brutal crushing of the protests by Buddhist monks, the international community remains divided on the issue of how to act towards one of the most repressive regimes on earth."
"The United States and Europe are imposing stricter sanctions and loudly proclaiming their outrage at violations of human rights, as indeed we are doing today in this Chamber."
"On the other hand, Burma's neighbours in the region, namely the ASEAN countries, along with China, India and Russia are refraining from open criticism of the Burmese regime on the pretext of not interfering in that country's internal affairs."
"That is why I wish to endorse what Mr Matsakis said earlier."
"The European Commission should be bolder and raise this question more openly in discussions with China, Russia and the ASEAN countries."
"A further difficulty relates to action at the level of the United Nations, which has proved totally ineffective."
"Prior to the last General Assembly, a breakthrough on Burma was forecast."
"No such breakthrough has taken place."
"The European Commission and the Member States should take determined action to ensure that more is done at international level on the issue of Burma."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, less than four months have gone by since the last European Parliament resolution on the dramatic situation inside Burma."
"The military regime in power has not kept any of the promises it made to the international community following the uprising last year."
"If the situation in Burma does not improve, there is a danger that the Secretary-General of the United Nations will call off his visit in December."
"The number of political prisoners has risen to two thousand."
"They are still being held in inhuman conditions and deprived of access to medical care."
"Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi, has been under arrest for 17 years."
"She is both a Nobel and a Sakharov laureate."
"The Burmese regime is still restricting fundamental human rights and freedoms, including access to independent sources of information."
"The Karen minority is being persecuted by the authorities and has sought refuge in Thailand where it is living on the verge of poverty."
"The same is true of people affected by the hurricane."
"The regime did not allow humanitarian aid to reach them, thus putting thousands of its own citizens at risk of death from starvation."
"We should require the Burmese authorities to lift all restrictions on the provision of humanitarian aid, and to restore fundamental freedoms in the country."
"Strong efforts must be made to ensure that the UN Secretary-General's visit to Burma goes ahead, and that the National League for Democracy is involved in the process of preparing for the 2010 elections."
"China and India should exert political and economic pressure on the Burmese regime by refusing to assist the Burmese army."
"The international community should impose economic sanctions, and also freeze the assets of government members and persons connected with them."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, Burma is a country which is steeped in corruption."
"With 2 000 political prisoners under arrest, access to free media impeded by the authorities and widespread slavery in industry, the people of this country need serious help."
"However, in spite of more than 37 visits by UN envoys in the past 20 years and six resolutions in this House, there has been not a single reform made by the military junta."
"I would agree with Mr Matsakis that it is not good enough to point to Burma: we must point to Burma's supporters and main supporter, especially China, its most powerful economic and military ally."
"Yet a smiling Mr Sarkozy represented the European Council at this summer's Olympic Games."
"Did he press China's top officials, who stood with him, about the Burmese, about the Sudanese, about the people of Tibet and about China's own persecuted people?"
"I particularly also want to mention the misuse of aid funds that go into Burma, because we still try to reach the ordinary people of Burma and, yet, these goods are often given to favourites of the Burmese Government to resell at high value."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, tomorrow marks the 13th anniversary of the unjust incarceration of the Burmese leader, Aung San Suu Kyi."
"This is therefore a good time for the European Union and the President-in-Office of the Council, who are in Beijing at the Asia-Europe Meeting, to very formally declare that the situation in Burma is unacceptable, to exert the necessary pressure, particularly on China, as has already been suggested by several Members, to follow the example set in particular by the US in 2003, and to refuse to keep importing clothing made under conditions of abject slavery."
"In addition, sanctions which are absolutely clear and consistent must be imposed."
"If this could be done, I believe we would finally start to see changes in the Burmese situation."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for listening to us."
"Along with colleagues such as Glenys Kinnock, I have long looked forward to the day when resolutions on human rights in Burma and elsewhere do not have to be considered in this Parliament, but we continually have to return to this."
"I can only agree with colleagues around the House that, when we look at the attempts, time and again, to make changes in Burma, we see nothing but failure instead."
"We need to expose those countries that aid and bail out this corrupt regime with trade."
"We have announced the names of some of those countries and should do more at European level to make sure their exposure leads to real change."
"We need to see changes in Burma leading to freedom of assembly and association, the release of prisoners of conscience and a full transition to a multi-party democracy."
"We have seen off juntas in Europe."
"We need the world to see off the junta in Burma."
"- (PL) Mr President, if only a single individual voices opposition to the authorities, that voice will barely be audible."
"If all the Members of this House raise their voices, however, and are joined by those in other countries, then the citizens of countries enduring repression will realise it is worth telling the truth and standing up to such regimes."
"They will realise that their efforts will eventually bear fruit and their morale will be strengthened."
"Nonetheless, it is also the case that specific measures are needed in addition to mere words, in order to demonstrate to the junta that it is not worth persevering with oppression to the bitter end, because of its impact on the nation and on the authorities themselves."
"Two determined actions must therefore be taken and seen through to the end."
"I am convinced that the truth will win through and that, as more people proclaim the truth inside Burma, so they will gather strength."
"Mr President, earlier this year we saw the failure of the Burmese Government to deal with the consequences of a natural disaster in that country."
"Considering the amount of money spent by the military on its own upkeep and the tight hold it has on national life, one might at least have expected it to be able to respond to the needs of its own people in a humanitarian crisis."
"It did not, because it has no real function, except to perpetuate its own existence and stranglehold on power."
"Referring back to what I said in my previous remarks on the Congo, I wonder how many of the military junta have bank accounts in Western banks and enjoy shopping trips to London, Paris and Rome."
"A direct way of showing support for the Burmese people would be for democratic countries to stop them coming until human rights and democracy are practised in Burma."
"(LT) I have been following this discussion intently and would like to draw attention to two ideas."
"I think that Mr Matsakis quite rightly stressed that the key to the situation in Burma lies both in Moscow and especially in Beijing and Dehli."
"Pressure must be increased not only on Burma, but on those other countries as well."
"Secondly, the observation made by Mr Pinior is very important and I agree with him wholeheartedly -that we must watch how much that pressure on Burma and those sanctions against Burma affect the junta and how much they affect ordinary people."
"I would like to invite the European Commission to analyse how adversely all these steps will affect the actions of the junta and how much they will affect the people."
"It seems to me that Burma must be encouraged to open up to the rest of the world in every way possible."
"Only then will that country be able to take the road to democracy."
"Mr President, in coming to the end of this part-session's debate on human rights here in Strasbourg, it is worth noting that life is getting back to normal, with a very few faithful and determined colleagues still present, along with the Commission's representatives - we are grateful that the Commission always has representatives at these debates - and, of course, the absence of any representatives from the Council."
"We should all just be grateful that the roof has not fallen on us."
"Let us hope that it never will!"
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to start by reminding you that the Commission's response to the cyclone last May was quick and substantial."
"We provided humanitarian and food aid and worked through the civil protection mechanism in cooperation with the EU Member States."
"We are pleased with ASEAN's active role in coordinating international efforts."
"The Commission funded the largest part of the needs assessment undertaken jointly by ASEAN, the United Nations and the Government."
"The humanitarian emergency is not over, but we will now also look at rehabilitation issues."
"Most remarkable during this period has been the outpouring of solidarity among citizens, local NGOs and the Myanmar Red Cross."
"This is a clear signal that giving up on civil society is not an option."
"The problems that need to be addressed are the following:"
"Firstly, we must reduce the isolation of the Burmese people."
"Civil society needs strengthening."
"The Commission is co-hosting a conference on the role of civil society in Myanmar in Brussels, which will take place on 29 October."
"Secondly, we must keep open all possible channels of communication with the Government."
"At the ASEM Summit, which will take place in Beijing on 26 October, President Barroso is expected to take the floor."
"In addition, the Commission has established working relations with line ministries in matters of health, education and livelihoods."
"Thirdly, we must keep and strengthen the United Nations as a driving force."
"There is no alternative to the good offices of the UN Secretary-General and the UN Special Adviser, Ibrahim Gambari."
"The Commission strongly backs the efforts of the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Myanmar, Mr Tomás Ojea Quintana."
"National reconciliation also requires an inclusive dialogue."
"It cannot take place with political stakeholders in jail or under house arrest."
"We continue to request the release of all those being detained on political grounds."
"The Commission also backs the ILO efforts to end forced-labour practices used for military and infrastructural programmes."
"The Commission is using all its channels to express concerns regarding forced labour and non-respect for fundamental freedoms."
"The people of Myanmar deserve our attention and assistance, and the Commission will continue to do everything in its power."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (RO) The European Parliament must adopt a united front in condemning Myanmar, where the situation has become tragic, for crimes against humanity."
"Well-respected non-governmental organisations indicate that around 70 000 civilians have been forced to abandon their homes over the last six months, in an attempt to escape the systematic abuse meted out by the military junta."
"Myanmar has a history of military dictatorship going back around 50 years, and we condemn the fact that its inhabitants have not been able to lead a normal life for half a century."
"In view of the level of persecution, torture, hard labour, confiscation of land and restriction on the rights of movement in Myanmar, the authorities can easily be accused of crimes against humanity."
"As a member of the European Union, an institution which has the respect of human rights as its fundamental principle, I believe that it is necessary for the authorities in Myanmar to be made aware publicly that respect for human rights forms the basis for economic prosperity in a country."
"Releasing all the political detainees in Myanmar, starting with Nobel Peace prize-winner, Aung San Suu Kyi, would be highly symbolic on the part of the authorities in this state, indicating that they are open to international dialogue and do not intend to become completely isolated from the rest of the world."
"in writing. - (NL) At the forthcoming ASEM Summit on 24 October 2008 in Beijing, the Burmese opposition leader and Nobel Prize Winner Aung San Suu Kyi will have been held captive for a total of 13 years exactly."
"UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon has announced his intention to visit Burma in December, but has indicated that he will only do so provided that serious progress can be made in the political and human rights situation in Burma; if not, he will be forced to postpone his visit."
"The forthcoming ASEM Summit is a perfect opportunity to bring intense pressure to bear on Burma to meet the UN's conditions promptly and thus to precipitate Ban Ki-Moon's visit."

"Welcome"
"Ladies and gentlemen, today and yesterday, the EuroMedScola completed its programme here in Strasbourg."
"It was a great pleasure for us to welcome more than 250 young people aged between 16 and 18 from all over the Euro-Mediterranean area, in other words the Mediterranean Union, including the 27 EU Member States and our partner countries in the region, making a total of 37 countries."
"The participants have now taken their seats up in the gallery."
"Over the last two days, they have discussed a wide range of topics, including the environment, immigration, equality, the role of citizens, education and many other issues."
"This is an expression of the cooperation between the European Union and the countries on the southern shore of the Mediterranean."
"School pupils from Israel, Palestine, the Arab states and every country of the European Union have also been here, and I would very much like to welcome our young friends to the gallery."
"It has been a fantastic event, and I am delighted to have had the opportunity to meet you."
"Once again, a very warm welcome to the European Parliament."

"The final version of the draft agenda for this part-session as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 13 November 2008 pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed."
"It has been requested that this draft be amended as follows."
"Wednesday:"
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament has requested that Council and Commission statements on the situation in the car industry be inserted in tomorrow's agenda."
"It should be pointed out that, if this point is inserted, the oral question on the review of the Recommendation providing for minimum criteria for environmental inspection in the Member States will need to be moved to Thursday's agenda."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I am sure that everybody in this House is aware that the car industry in the European Union is now in a very difficult position, in part due to the crisis in the car industry in the United States."
"I therefore think it would make perfect sense for the Commission to make a statement on how it views this crisis, on what possible solutions it can see, including, for example, State aid, what competition rules need to be complied with, and so on. This is, in my view, an important issue."
"I would, however, just like to add that we have no intention of weakening or postponing the environmental objectives for the car industry."
"We will still insist on these environmental objectives being implemented and pushed through, but at the same time we should also have the opportunity here to discuss the car industry's economic difficulties with a representative of the Commission."
"That is one of our concerns, and I hope that we will gain wide support for it."
"(NL) Mr President, by way of point of order in accordance with Rule 7 of the Rules of Procedure, I should like to deplore the fact that the Lehne report, which should normally speaking have been the subject of discussion this evening and which deals with the immunity of my colleague Mr Frank Vanhecke, was taken off the agenda this evening."
"There is, therefore, no debate, contrary to what the original agenda stipulates."
"Secondly, I should like to protest against the fact that Mr Lehne, following discussion of the report in committee, refused to send this report to the person in question, stating that this would be made available to him following discussion in the plenary meeting."
"This very topic was, however, given plenty of air time on the Belgian TV channel VRT that evening, so it seems that it had been leaked."
"I should therefore like you to find out how this confidential report, which the person involved was not allowed to peruse, could be discussed on Belgian television that same evening and appeared not to be so confidential after all."
"We will take note of that."
"I cannot, and will not try to, reassure you, but what I can tell you is that even letters written by me and dealt with absolutely confidentially by my staff sometimes end up being published."
"It is a situation that does not apply only to you, but it is regrettable in all cases."
"We have taken note of it, and will look into it."
"One-minute speeches on matters of political importance"
"The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"Mr President, on 4 and 5 December 2008 the European Parliament will discuss a set of proposals to modify Directive 2003/87/EC concerning the emissions trading scheme for greenhouse gas emissions for the period 2013-2020."
"The proposal foresees a huge increase in auctioning as early as 2013."
"While today 90% of pollution allowances are handed out to industrial installations for free, the new directive states that full auctioning should be the rule from 2013 onwards."
"In the case of Romania, this will have extremely severe consequences on the whole economy, and the industry will be seriously affected."
"Many industrial companies would have to relocate to third countries with less climate protection, which will raise prices and slow down Romania's development project on infrastructure."
"This is why I ask that industries in Romania should receive all their allowances for CO2 certificates for free for the entire period."
"(ES) Mr President, last night, in a joint and extremely smooth operation on French territory, security forces from France and Spain arrested one of the main and perhaps most bloodthirsty leaders of ETA, Txeroki, whom they have been pursuing for more than six years for various murders and attacks."
"While exercising the caution that is always needed in such cases, I believe that this is very good news and I am sure that the House will share our satisfaction, which makes up for our disgust on other occasions when we have had to speak about the crimes of this organisation."
"This is a very severe blow for the terrorist organisation and we should congratulate the security forces, governments and people of France and Spain on the success of the operation."
"We should also congratulate ourselves on the example set by international cooperation as an essential instrument of anti-terrorist resistance."
"Lastly, Mr President, I must say that the terrorists should know that this will be their fate: being arrested and handed over to the courts and paying for their crimes, or at least those which can be proven, with years in jail."
"(HU) Thank you, Mr President."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it has been almost 10 months since the European Parliament adopted a resolution requesting that the European Commission formulate a strategy on the Roma."
"Apart from one staff working document, the Commission has not brought out anything new even for the EU-Roma summit, which was referred to as a historic one."
"Meanwhile, in Kosovo, the Roma are still living in life-threatening settlements tainted by lead pollution, and in Hungary attacks with Molotov cocktails or firearms have been perpetrated in nine settlements against the houses of Roma families."
"The most recent and terribly sad site of such attacks was Nagycsécs, where two Roma trying to flee the burning house were cruelly shot to death with pellet guns."
"During the same period, according to reports by civil organisations, close to 30 000 Roma fled Italy in recent months because of police brutality and anti-Roma sentiment."
"On top of this situation, there is the current economic crisis, which - let there be no doubt - will most harshly affect the excluded and destitute social classes and the Roma."
"I would like to remind every responsible politician that this is another reason why we need to create a European Roma strategy. Thank you very much."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to raise the issue of the by-pass around the town of Augustów in Poland."
"The lengthening wait for a judgment of the European Court of Justice in the matter means further fatal road accidents involving pedestrians."
"Each year some two million goods vehicles pass through the centre of the town."
"In view of the many projects for reserves in the Podlasie region, the freezing of all road investments in the region by the European Commission, deprives it of the opportunity of future development."
"The European Commission's decision means the area is turning into a skansen, which on the model of some Western countries will make it a scenic tourist facility."
"But not having the Augustów by-pass on grounds of protecting the environment at any cost, while ignoring human needs, is depriving the residents of north-eastern Poland of the opportunity of development and a dignified life."
"The European Commission must take this into account."
"Nature needs protection, but not at the cost of human life."
"(HU) Mr President, 'I desire mercy and not sacrifice': the words of Jesus echo in our souls when we encounter rampant violence and cruelty in the world."
"Terror and force are even more painful when committed in the name of fundamentalist religiosity or religious exclusivism."
"That is why we must protest against the brutal execution of the 13-year-old South Somalian girl, who after having been raped by three men, was stoned to death upon the verdict of an Islamic court."
"And we must protest against the persecution of Iraq's Christian minority, who have been forced to flee their homes in Mosul and its surrounding region in the thousands by militant Shiites."
"In the spirit of our European Christian tradition, religious tolerance and ecumenical brotherhood, the European Union should raise its voice and take action to protect the victims of religious violence and persecution."
"(PT) In Portugal, workers are fighting for their rights in a wide range of sectors."
"We wish to express our solidarity with all those who are fighting."
"We particularly support the courageous fight of teachers and the impressive demonstration that brought together, in Lisbon, on 8 November, 120 000 teachers from all corners of the country."
"This second large-scale demonstration in six months involved nearly 80% of this professional class."
"It has been followed by other events aimed at showing that teachers are determined to continue defending state schooling and fighting for their dignity and respect for their work which is essential for training the young generations and for ensuring development and progress in Portugal which has some of the worst school achievement levels in the European Union."
"We also support the fight of workers from Pirites Alentejanas, in Aljustrel, against the halt in mining activity which the multinational decided to suspend six months after it was resumed, sending more than 600 people into unemployment."
"Measures must be urgently taken to prevent unemployment from worsening in such a deprived area and to prevent the country becoming poorer."
"(EL) Mr President, I should like to inform Parliament that over the last three days, from 14 to 16 November, a country which is a candidate for accession to the European Union has had a naval presence occupying the Greek continental shelf."
"I do not intend here to advocate in favour of Greece."
"The Greek continental shelf is also part of the European continental shelf and I see no concern on the part of Europe in protecting its sovereign rights in the area."
"I wonder how a country which behaves in such a way, with such a blatant presence and with such intentions, can join Europe and how we plan to accept this Asian country into Europe when it behaves in such a way."
"- (SK) In October last year I made a written declaration warning about the emergence of an extreme right-wing organisation called the Hungarian Guard."
"Sadly, the inactivity of the Hungarian authorities, coupled with our indifference at a European level, have borne fruit."
"This fascism has now been exported to Slovakia."
"Let us not stand idly by in the face of the provocations that have taken place over the past two weeks."
"On 8 November, in the Slovak town of Kráľovsky Chlmec, 28 members of the Hungarian organisation marched in replica fascist uniforms and laid a wreath to the victims of wars with the provocative inscription I believe in a Hungary reborn."
"I am appalled that the act of intervention by the Slovak authorities remained unnoticed in Europe."
"How is it possible that just at the time when Europe is commemorating the 70th anniversary of Kristallnacht, a Member State can tolerate on its own territory the existence of organisations such as the 'Nyilas', the Hungarian Guard, Jobbik or Hnutie 64?"
"Can we really be indifferent to the fact that this amounts to a display of contempt for the millions of victims of the Second World War or to the fact that fascists are able to march through the towns of one of our Member States?"
"- (SK) On the day when we are commemorating the 19th anniversary of the Velvet Revolution in the former Czech-Slovak Republic, allow me to express my unease over the policy of the current Slovak government, particularly in the area of the economy, which has outlines very similar to those from the period prior to November 1989."
"The attempts at complete political management of the private sector and the regulatory interference of the state to the extent carried out by this government are unacceptable in a healthy market system."
"Through amendments to the law on prices and criminal law the way has been opened to a new regulation of prices in connection with the transfer to the Euro, involving punishments of up to three years in prison for small traders and service providers."
"In addition to the measures relating to increases in energy prices the government has come up with a range of populist pronouncements and threats, with an attempt to expropriate a number of private companies in the energy sector and a proposal for hard, open-ended and superficial regulatory measures targeted against private entities in the so-called general economic interest."
"Under the pretext of solving the financial crisis and the economic recession, the above-mentioned measures will prevent further essential liberalisation, deform the market environment and scare off potential investors."
"(PL) Mr President, on 14 November in Poznań, as every year, a march for equality was held."
"A group of my young colleagues, members of the Federation of Young Social Democrats, took part in the march."
"Their slogan was diversity yes, intolerance no."
"This is part of a larger campaign being held by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament throughout Europe on the issue of tolerance, and which has been underway for many months now."
"When the demonstration was over, the group was attacked by about a dozen thugs who beat them up and snatched banners with the logo of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament."
"One of the victims was hospitalised."
"I expect those responsible for this incident to be tracked down and punished by the authorities in Poland."
"I expect political thuggery, which aims to replace dialogue, to be universally condemned by those involved in politics."
"(PL) Mr President, on Friday the EU-Russia Summit in Nice, hastily called in order to enable attendance at the G20 meeting, ended."
"The European Union in effect decided to renew negotiations with Russia on the partnership system, and in doing so went against its own decision, made on 1 September this year, that there would be no negotiations with Russia if Russian troops do not withdraw from the occupied territories of Georgia."
"The European Union is behaving in this matter like an old man, who remembers exactly what he did 50 years ago, when the Treaties of Rome came into being, and forgets what he did two months ago, when the EU gave itself and Europe its assurances on this important issue."
"It is now retreating from its own undertakings, and what was jointly agreed on 1 September has now been tossed aside."
"In this context the question arises as to whether human rights, which we in the European Parliament often champion all over the world, should also apply to European countries such as Georgia and Russia, when the European Union is simply behaving like Pontius Pilate on this issue."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, perhaps you too have heard that there are no longer refuse crises in Campania."
"Well, that is not the case: a few days ago in Chiaiano, which was to have been one of the sites for Berlusconi's infamous dumps, 12 000 tonnes of asbestos and toxic waste was discovered."
"Where it came from no one really knows."
"At present in Italy there is a decree in force that clearly goes against all European legislation concerning, above all, the protection of health as well as impact assessments."
"What is more, the situation is being treated as a state secret, since these areas have been declared out of bounds and it is impossible to gain any access to information on what is happening there."
"We have called on the Commission to intervene; we believe it has a duty to do so because to have 10 000 tonnes of asbestos and toxic waste out there in the open air is a danger to everyone."
"We hope that Commissioner Dimas will take action and will do so publicly."
"(HU) Mr President, it is unacceptable that Slovak-Hungarian relations should unfold according to the intentions of extremist forces."
"We firmly condemn those who would spoil relations between these two peoples, for we know who the culprits are."
"In Slovakia, the government party, the Slovak National Party, is stirring up tensions with its hate speech against minorities, its outbursts that revile the nation and its anti-Hungarian slurs."
"In Hungary, by contrast, it is not the government authorities but extra-parliamentary extremist groups who are keen to over-react against these attacks."
"This is a fundamental difference."
"Both phenomena are to be condemned."
"One of the reasons for the poisoning of relations between the two peoples is that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament turned a blind eye to the policies of the Slovak SMER party coalition, thereby fuelling extreme, explicitly anti-minority policies."
"Therefore the Socialist Group's decision to readmit the SMER into its ranks was a bad one, one that gives free rein to extremist anti-Hungarian expressions."
"Unfortunately, the coalition government in Bratislava does not provide an opportunity for the improvement of Slovak-Hungarian relations. Thank you."
"(DE) Mr President, I do not want to go into the details now, but I think that Mr Duka-Zólyomi - with whom I am good friends - is well aware that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament is highly critical of the coalition, and in particular of Mr Slota's party."
"It is now time, however, particularly following the very welcome meeting between the two prime ministers, Mr Fico and Mr Gyurcsány, to arrange matters so that the two countries can resolve their problems together in peace, and not give radicals a platform."
"On that we agree: the radicals must not be allowed to continue spreading poison."
"That certainly applies to Mr Slota's verbal radicalism, but it also applies particularly to the Hungarian Guard."
"I call on both countries and both prime ministers, and all parties in this House, to make every effort to silence the radicals, to stop them blockading borders and to ensure that peacefully minded people who want to protect and assist minorities have their voices heard."
"Welcome"
"Ladies and gentlemen, It is my great pleasure to welcome to the gallery a group of former members of the first freely elected parliament of the GDR."
"This Parliament entered the history books when it resolved to reunify Germany, and then dissolved itself shortly afterwards."
"The delegation is headed by the President of the Volkskammer at that time, Dr Sabine Bergmann-Pohl."
"A very warm welcome to the European Parliament."
"(Applause)"
"One-minute speeches on matters of political importance (continuation)"
"Mr President, the eCall system in motor vehicles is a major advance in assisting emergency services to get to the scene of an accident as quickly as possible."
"The device identifies the exact location of the accident so that the medical, police and fire services are able to get to the scene as quickly as possible."
"This is particularly important in rural and isolated areas and particularly in the case of single car accidents."
"eCall is now standard equipment in all new cars in many EU countries."
"Unfortunately, it is not available in my own country, Ireland, where we still have an unacceptably high level of fatal accidents."
"I believe that the system should be mandatory in all Member States."
"This is about saving lives, and this device certainly saves lives."
"That is the reason I am calling on the Commission to insist that all Member States insist that this device be available in all new motor vehicles."
"- (SK) According to research from the Institute of Sociology at the Slovak Academy of Sciences, Slovak inhabitants of Hungarian origin are proud to be citizens of the Slovak Republic."
"This view is held by more than 70% of people, which is the highest percentage in the history of the Slovak Republic."
"This result sends a clear message, countering the claims of some politicians who are trying to convince Europe that the Hungarian minority in Slovakia is discriminated against."
"On the floor of the European Parliament some of my colleagues, instead of sitting down at the negotiating table, have for two years preferred a method of communication which radicalises the domestic political scene even more."
"I would like to invite those who care about the friendly co-existence of Hungary and Slovakia to support the efforts of both premiers, who met on Saturday in order to coordinate the fight against extremism and to lead both countries in the direction of good neighbourly relations."
"I appreciate the fact that, two days after the talks, the Hungarian premier adopted measures which will lead to changes in the laws against extremism."
"This will be the most effective weapon against those who today threaten democracy in this region and yet go unpunished."
"Mr President, one of the key elements of the EU White Paper on Sport is the elimination of racism, particularly at football matches."
"Unfortunately racism has raised its ugly head at the Scottish Football League and we all very much regret that."
"Some players who have declared to play for Ireland have been subjected to racial abuse and also to the singing of the 'Famine Song', which is a huge insult, not only to the players, but to the Irish people."
"I welcome the fact that the Scottish FA, and also the former British Home Secretary John Reid, are taking action on this."
"But racism cannot be tolerated no matter where it raises its ugly head, and I believe we all have to stand up and say that this is completely unacceptable and that it cannot happen no matter where it takes place."
"(DE) Mr President, at the EU-Russia summit in Nice last Friday, it was resolved that the negotiations on a new partnership agreement with Russia would be continued on 2 December, despite the fact that some Member States expressed concerns and that certain issues, such as further action in Georgia and the Caucasus, remained unresolved."
"I have been watching developments in Russia with considerable concern."
"Quite mysteriously, the Duma has now voted to extend the president's term of office to six years."
"Human rights continue to be trampled underfoot, as demonstrated by the case of Svetlana Bakhmina, a former employee of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the businessman imprisoned for five years: the authorities continue to refuse to permit her early release from a Siberian prison camp, even though she is heavily pregnant."
"In the negotiations, the European Union must not give in to Russia's blackmail attempts with regard to energy and must clearly address abuses of human rights."
"(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one of the most important rights of European citizens is the right to free movement."
"One year ago, when we opened the Schengen borders, strange obstacles appeared at certain borders of the new Member States, such as those between Austria and the Czech Republic, between Hungary and Slovakia as well as between Hungary and Austria."
"Near my home town, the Austrian authorities placed a 'No Entry by Car' sign on a road that is otherwise freely accessible to cars."
"Consequently, since in our opinion this annoying obstacle is limiting one of the most important rights of European citizens, the right to free movement, my colleagues Othmar Karas, Lívia Járóka and I covered up the sign symbolically with the EU flag as a protest against this obstacle, which causes local people a great deal of irritation."
"Today we no longer have to fight against the Iron Curtain, honourable Members - I have on several occasions already brought in this piece of the real Iron Curtain from near my hometown - but only against a few 'No Entry' signs, yet I think we should see to it that in the spirit of Europe, these too should be removed."
"As to the Hungarian-Slovak conflict, I wish to say only that those protesting against extremists would have credibility only if they had done likewise when Ján Slota, a member of the coalition party, was making declarations against Hungarians and calling for the expulsion of Hungarians from Slovakia."
"Mr President, this year we commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Kristallnacht pogroms."
"It seems that the collective memory is becoming weaker and weaker, since we face rising extremism associated with racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism and aggressive nationalism worldwide, including in European democracies."
"Looking ahead to the 2009 European elections, the PSE Group is convinced that political representatives can play a positive role in the overall promotion of mutual respect and understanding."
"The PSE Group is committed to raising awareness of the value of cultural and religious diversity as a source of mutual enrichment of societies."
"We always underline the necessity that public personalities should refrain from statements that encourage the stigmatisation of groups of people."
"May I express my confusion that the EPP has chosen - and still keeps - as its main partner in Bulgaria a party whose leader appreciates the statesmanship of Stalin, Hitler and Mao; who believes that the way forward to integration is to impose a list of Bulgarian names on every new-born child of non-Bulgarian ethnic origin; a man who says that there are Bulgarian citizens in Bulgaria, Turkish in Turkey, and if somebody is a Turk they should go to Turkey."
"I wonder if you, Mr President, or the EPP support the same approach for the ethnic Turks in Germany."
"I underline how important the role of the European parties is in carefully selecting its partners, because when you exchange quality for quantity, the first victims are the EPP's credibility, the stability of the national political systems and, of course, the beliefs of the ordinary right-wing voters."
"Mr Vigenin, as you addressed me personally, I will take the liberty of pointing out that, in Brussels last Monday, the European Parliament held a very moving commemoration of Kristallnacht."
"As far as my party membership is concerned, I am acting here in my capacity as President, and not as a member of a party, although I do of course feel attached to my party."
"You will have to ask those responsible directly, though, as it is not a question that can be addressed to the President."
"(RO) We welcome, first of all, the action plan adopted at the recent G20 meeting, as well as the particular contributions made by Mr Barroso and President Sarkozy."
"The final decisions made reflect the strategy discussed and adopted by the European Union's Member States."
"We should also welcome the commitment of all the participants to work together to combat the current crisis in the financial sector."
"At the moment, people are not interested in disputes, only in real solutions."
"Interdependency generates two-way channels which allow the crisis to spread, but they can allow the solutions for economic recovery to spread too."
"In Romania's case, unemployment in any country of the European Union accelerates the rate of unemployment in our emerging economy at double the speed."
"This is happening firstly as a result of people working abroad being sent back home and then due to the reduction in the number of jobs being offered by foreign companies, which are scaling down their activities."
"At present, unemployment needs to be analysed at pan-European Union level, but the solutions need to be implemented and financed at both ends of these channels."
"(HU) Thank you very much, Mr President."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to draw your attention to the pressures on the maize market which are especially rife in Central Europe."
"Bumper crops, unfavourable international market conditions and the fluctuating yields that are customary in Central Europe have driven prices well below the intervention level in certain regions within Hungary."
"We must take steps on behalf of producers and in the interests of market stability."
"Under the present circumstances, Hungary itself is not able to buy up the surplus; nevertheless, there are other ways to stabilise the market."
"In the first place, the intervention quantity has to be raised for States that do not have seaports."
"The system must play the role of a safety net in this regard, as originally intended."
"Secondly, for the benefit of countries without seaports, calls for tender must be issued for the purpose of exports to third countries."
"Lastly, the special private storage facilities must also be opened."
"Instituting these measures would greatly contribute to preventing the situation from deteriorating, and would help our growers to adapt to exceptional circumstances. Thank you for your attention."
"That concludes this item."
"EMU10: The first 10 years of Economic and Monetary Union and future challenges (debate)"
"We will now proceed with the debate on the first ten years of economic and monetary union and future challenges. In that connection, I would like to wish the Prime Minister and Finance Minister of Luxembourg and President of the Eurogroup, Mr Jean-Claude Juncker, a very warm welcome to the European Parliament."
"(Applause)"
"It is, of course, also my pleasure to welcome the competent Commissioner, Joaquín Almunia."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, Mr President of the Eurogroup, Commissioner, I believe that this is an important moment, and the theme that we are going to debate today greatly affects Europeans as a whole."
"I believe, and everyone is convinced of it today, that the euro is our greatest capital, our best investment."
"It is now time to assess matters, but through an assessment in a crisis period we clearly need to find the means to get things moving again."
"What kind of situation would we be in without the euro?"
"Without the euro, Iceland would today be more or less like Ireland, or, rather, Ireland would resemble Iceland."
"We have re-opened the debates in this crisis because everyone has realised just how central the euro was to our ability to withstand events not just in ordinary times, but also in times of crisis."
"Commissioner, I should like to thank you for your sense of anticipation, for when, in May 2008, in this House, you put this document on the table, no one realised just how useful and necessary it would be, or how it would underpin vital work aimed at looking ahead to the future and at being able to tackle the crisis facing us on the basis of this solid foundation that is the euro."
"However, I am fully aware that, in your discussion with the ministers for economic affairs and finance, they suddenly had their minds on other matters, they suddenly had their minds on matters to which they were not paying attention: those of the financial markets."
"You must remind them that, if they want in the future to emerge from the crisis situation we are in, they will not get away without doing two things."
"They will have to balance Economic and Monetary Union."
"We have seen it done to manage the crisis on the financial markets."
"We are seeing it being done today to manage the crisis in the real economy with which we are faced."
"Monetary policy can do a great deal, by injecting liquidity to help the markets operate, and by lowering rates to try to revive investment."
"But that is all!"
"After that, it is up to the governments to take action to save the banks, to drive out toxic products, and, in the future, to revive economic activity within the European Union."
"It is therefore time that the ministers for economic affairs and finance used the Treaty, which tells them to regard their economic policy as a policy of common interest."
"On this basis, Commissioner, relaunch the debate at Ecofin, demand this road map that you have suggested to them, and realign yourself with us on the basis of the proposals, of our proposals, that you will have endorsed so that, in future, the euro really serves growth and employment."
"With regard to monetary policy, of course, we respect the independence of the Central Bank, but we also respect the Treaty as a whole, and Article 105, beyond price stability, stipulates that the Central Bank must pursue the Union's other objectives."
"Need I point this out?"
"Need I say that, tomorrow, we may open a new debate, as well?"
"Is it not necessary, this is not in our report, but will it not be necessary to open a debate on the inclusion of a financial market stability objective in the monetary policy objectives?"
"I put the question to you."
"Clearly, we will not make progress with the operation of Economic and Monetary Union if we do take greater account of the relationship between the real economy and the financial markets."
"We are paying the price today for having forgotten this."
"On enlargement, this crisis is re-opening the conditions of the debate, but I believe that we need to remain rigorous."
"Reform prior to entry into the Euro Zone is easier than reform after entry into the Euro Zone, even though this is extremely demanding."
"Commissioner, you made this a key point of your report: the idea that the differences that have emerged in the operation of the Euro Zone are a cause for concern."
"They are greater than we first thought."
"Therefore, we, the European Parliament, call on you to provide the European Union with tools enabling it to observe the quality of public spending in order to see how the Member States react, and to ensure that this is not just a debate on thresholds, one that allows only a general debate and not a debate on the quality of public spending, which is the responsibility of the ministers for economic affairs and finance."
"In the road map that you are proposing to us, we also believe, Commissioner, that you need to address the Member States today to ask them to review their plans."
"Their national reform plans do not take account, at present, of the latest forecasts that you have put on the table."
"If we are to take the joint economic policy coordination exercise seriously, these plans now need to be reviewed on the basis of the growth forecasts that you have put on the table and that have been backed up and confirmed by the IMF and the OECD."
"Lastly, of the proposals that we are formulating, I would draw your attention to the issues at stake in terms of the external representation of the Euro Zone."
"For too long we have adopted a passive attitude."
"The euro protected us."
"However, in addition to protecting us, it now has to enable us to be a player with a strong voice on the international stage, so that we are not just the floating link in a debate between the other major monetary powers."
"We are a major monetary power, we must accept the consequences of this in full, and this is also a matter for a consistent, concerted debate within the Council of Ministers."
"We, the European Parliament, are more than willing to play our part in this exercise, as you know."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, I would like to welcome the representatives of the Euro Zone, the Prime Minister and the Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"Taking stock overall, I think we can say that, in its first ten years, the euro has been an unqualified success."
"It did not all go completely smoothly, but, particularly during the recent crisis in the financial markets, the institutions have proven their worth."
"On the basis of institutional cooperation within the Euro Zone, decisions could be drafted quickly, implemented promptly and, in particular, act as examples for all 27 Member States."
"We have presented a report containing 62 detailed points, including an assessment of the past and prospects for the future."
"Mrs Berès has already talked about certain points concerning the outlook for the future, and I would like to expand on them."
"Behind all the positive responses to the euro, there is still the question of what is to happen next."
"Are the Euro Zone and the European Central Bank prepared for the forthcoming challenges?"
"There will certainly be one challenge or another that will need to be analysed."
"I would like to remind you of the differences in the development of competitiveness in the Euro Zone, because the secret is that, although we have a central monetary policy, we have local budgetary and financial policies."
"The Stability and Growth Pact can only act as an anchor between these two levels if the Member States are prepared to stick to the pact, to accept the conditions and to demonstrate the necessary discipline."
"The Stability and Growth Pact is therefore now facing its first big test, in the form of the handling of the financial crisis."
"In my opinion, it has the necessary flexibility, and there can in any event be temporary exceptions in extreme cases, but the Stability and Growth Pact cannot be just set to one side."
"The other question is what is to happen next with regard to debt."
"The package for the financial markets was wrapped up quickly, the governments took action, and there was a demonstration of an ability to act in a crisis, including by the Commission, but the question is, are we now going to cast aside the principles that have contributed to the stability of the euro, or are we going to succeed in developing and maintaining those principles?"
"On top of that, we have made myriad proposals that, due to the short time I have surprisingly been given to speak, I cannot and will not enumerate."
"The fact is, though, that we need a more authoritative and unified external representation of the euro - in which respect we fully share the position taken by the Prime Minister of Luxembourg and President of the Eurogroup."
"I was amazed that Mr Juncker, as President of the Eurogroup, was not invited to the most recent summit in Washington."
"I can say that quite openly, because it is such a contrast with all the positive developments."
"Naturally, we also want the European Parliament to be appropriately involved, and there is one item on the agenda that we have been debating for a long time, namely the issue of whether it is enough to increase coordination of budgetary and financial policy or whether - as France believes - it is not enough and we need, instead, to provide an institutional form of 'economic government', which is so controversial in Germany."
"Which is the right path to take?"
"For my group, the answer is clear: we do not need economic government, but we do need greater coordination, including with regard to the agreed policy mix."
"We also, however, need the Member States to show the necessary discipline, otherwise the euro may find itself in difficulties over the long term, and nobody wants that."
"Many thanks to all those responsible."
"Parliament is prepared to cooperate closely, and we are sure that we will be able to set the tone with this report."
"Member of the Commission. - (ES) Mr President, Mr President of the Eurogroup, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I must, on behalf of the Commission, thank the two rapporteurs, Mrs Berès and Mr Langen, and all those who worked on this excellent report."
"The quality of this report on the tenth anniversary of Economic and Monetary Union is to be congratulated."
"The cooperation between the various political groups, in a demonstration of the high degree of cohesion within this Parliament, should also be congratulated."
"This is yet another asset and another positive element of this Economic and Monetary Union, both in its present and in its future."
"This Economic and Monetary Union has existed for ten years."
"That was the starting point for our analysis and also the starting point for the report produced by the Commission."
"It was also the starting point for the Commission communication that I had the honour of presenting to you on 7 May."
"However, the tenth anniversary of the euro and Economic and Monetary Union has coincided with an exceptionally difficult and complex economic situation."
"This allows us to analyse this Economic and Monetary Union in terms of how useful the euro, our single currency, our sign of integration, can be in tackling such a situation, which we have never experienced before."
"The conclusion is that the first ten years of the euro have been very positive."
"In terms of the usefulness of Economic and Monetary Union in tackling the current situation, the conclusion is also positive."
"We are living through difficult times but we have in our hands an extraordinarily useful instrument to tackle these difficulties."
"Obviously, the conclusions of the analysis in our communication that I presented here on 7 May and the conclusions of your report must be put into practice so that this instrument can be usefully applied at this moment in time."
"I agree with the two rapporteurs that coordination is a key element."
"At the meeting in Washington this weekend, there was also talk about coordination."
"Without coordination, we cannot tackle this situation effectively."
"No one can solve their economic problems in such a situation as this without coordinating their economic policies."
"This was evident a few weeks ago when we had to confront the risk of collapse in the financial system."
"It is also evident now that we are having to face the prospect of a recession in most of our economies, and when we are, for the first time in our lives, even facing a risk of deflation."
"Budgetary policies must be coordinated."
"The report on Economic and Monetary Union talks about the need to increase budgetary surveillance, to expand the way in which fiscal and budgetary policies are coordinated, as Mr Langen said."
"However, we must also bear in mind sustainability, as Mrs Berès mentioned, the quality of public finances and the fact that we have a system of rules in the Stability and Growth Pact, which was revised in 2005."
"This revision is now proving very useful, because at times of economic recovery it allowed us to move forward with fiscal consolidation."
"The euro area ended 2007 almost breaking even - for the first time in its history, with a deficit of 0.6-0.7% - but this means that we now have sufficient flexibility so that our fiscal policy can really help to sustain demand, as our monetary policy should also do."
"The conclusions of our report are particularly useful now in terms of the need to link budgetary policies with structural reforms and, in this respect, I agree with Mrs Berès: we must review and adapt the national Lisbon programmes, the national reform programmes, and we must also review the stability and convergence programmes of the Member States and adapt them to the current situation."
"We will be discussing this in coming months and, for this reason, as you know, the Commission will, on 26 November, present an action plan incorporating objectives, instruments, policies and commitments."
"This plan will indicate the need to adapt the national programmes in order to unite national policies and make them convergent and consistent with a European strategy, policies and instruments."
"I agree with you and with the report that we must reinforce the external dimension of the euro and of Economic and Monetary Union."
"As Mr Juncker is well aware, we must have a strategy in relation to the multilateral organisations and the other main parties whereby we can defend our interests in terms of our currency and our Economic and Monetary Union and thus defend the economic interests of the European Union."
"This strategy must be based on principles and priorities, and also on instruments for taking action which will allow us to speak with a single voice, thus reinforcing the influence of each and every European and, in particular, of the euro area."
"This is also an issue of governance."
"I totally agree with many of the governance aspects that you have included in your report and I hope that the Finance Ministers in the Ecofin Council and in the Eurogroup will also agree."
"Mrs Berès - I am about to finish - said in her speech that the Commissioner and the Commission should once again draw the attention of the Finance Ministers to the conclusions of this report."
"There is a Molière character who said that he thought he had been speaking in verse, but had in fact been speaking in prose without realising."
"I believe that the discussions now being held by the Ministers in the Eurogroup under the presidency of Jean Claude Juncker, by the Ministers in the Ecofin Council and by the Ministers at the Washington meeting are discussions which fit perfectly with the priorities and need for coordination reflected in the Commission's report and in your report, although some of them are probably not aware of this."
"(Applause)"
"President of the Eurogroup. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Berès, Mr Langen, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating your two rapporteurs on the report they have submitted to you and to us, since we are reading it and we are debating it."
"This report is fair and goes far enough to ensure that we will be kept busy during the coming months."
"I agree with the analysis made in Mrs Berès's and Mr Langen's report on the assessment of the first ten years of the single currency."
"There is nothing to add or to remove from what they have expressed in their report."
"Furthermore, it is a report that has the support of a large majority within this House, at least where the Commission has expressed its opinion on it."
"I note that the House's enthusiasm for the single currency is far more pronounced today than it was 12 or 13 years ago, even 10 years ago, and we should be pleased about that."
"With regard to the economic divergences, the deltas between structural reforms and the differences in terms of the management of public finances, I should like first of all to point out that I did not understand what the report meant when it said that the results do not live up to the expectations that existed at the time of the introduction of the single currency."
"I know of no quantitative report on the divergences between the various Member States of the Euro Zone."
"Given that this report does not exist, it is therefore a circumstantial comment, which I did not understand."
"I do share the view that these divergences tend at times to increase, something which, until now, has not threatened the cohesion of the Euro Zone but, were this divergence to persist, could harm its cohesion in the long term."
"For the rest, and in this regard, we should be pleased that Europe - the European Union in general and the Eurogroup in particular - which is today faced with one of the most serious crises that it has had to tackle over the past few decades, has competently managed the crisis in which we currently find ourselves, not least by avoiding making the mistakes that were made in Europe during the 1970s."
"To say that we have not repeated the same mistakes is no small thing, for economically and politically, this has enabled us to prevent the crisis from increasing the divergences within the monetary Union and from helping to undermine its cohesion."
"The fact is, in the face of a crisis of the size that we are experiencing and in the face of a crisis that is increasingly extending to the real economy, a strong and coordinated economic policy response at European level is necessary, and we need to reflect on the best way of organising it by taking account, on the one hand, of our conceptual and regulatory framework - I am referring here to the Stability and Growth Pact and to the Lisbon Strategy - and, on the other, of the seriousness of the crisis, the consequences of which are far graver than we imagined a few months ago."
"The creation of the world's second major currency certainly brings advantages, but it also entails obligations, with the G20 of last Friday and Saturday in Washington reminding us of the obligations of ourselves and others."
"We have to use and make the most of the three weeks we have before the December European Council in order to skilfully hone our European strategy and to prevent disparate responses at national level."
"These disparate responses threaten us, of course."
"It moves me to hear the calls and renewed calls for economic policy coordination that are mainly expressed in the language of Voltaire."
"I should like those who are calling for the coordination of economic policies first and foremost to set an example and demonstrate the sincerity of their words."
"I note that the various governments of the various member countries of the Euro Zone are pouncing greedily, and justifiably, on the problems being faced by their countries' automobile sector."
"I should like those who talk about the automobile sector and who continually talk about the coordination of economic policies to coordinate their national actions when it comes to taking initiatives in the automobile sector."
"The rest is of trifling importance."
"Really coordinate and prove, with an example to hand, the sincerity of those words."
"(Applause)"
"With regard to monetary policy, you know how timid I am, I would never utter a word about it, except to say that I continue to believe that the role played by the European Central Bank over the last few months was truly exemplary."
"Integration and supervision of the financial markets - that is another area of considerations that your rapporteurs have covered in their report."
"The G20 has set us an ambitious road map; it must be translated into concrete action by the G20, and hence by the European Union and by the members of the Eurogroup."
"You will no doubt recall that the member countries of the Eurogroup and those of the European Union were the first to demand that appropriate lessons be learnt from the crisis we are facing, and I do not wish to save my memories of that episode for a later date."
"For four years we - I am talking about those in charge of the Eurogroup - have kept on repeating to the Japanese and US ministers of finance and have kept on drawing the attention of our US friends both to the risks of their double deficit and to the risks created by systematically underestimating the risks, especially with regard to real estate."
"For two years several of us, at G7 level and in particular under the German Presidency of the G7, demanded, with a certain bluntness of tone, more extensive regulation of the financial markets."
"I do not take kindly to the fact that those who rejected this in the past are today giving the impression of leading the European response."
"The US and UK Governments had all the time they needed to accept the Eurogroup's proposals on better regulation of the financial markets; they did not wish to do so."
"They should not give the impression today that they are leading the others."
"On the enlargement of the Euro Zone, I have nothing to say that differs from what your rapporteurs said."
"I would simply point out that, belonging to the Euro Zone is, of course, an advantage, an opportunity, but that it also entails obligations of which some will have to be met before accession to the Euro Zone is possible."
"This entirely understandable enthusiasm for the new formation of the G7 does, however, cause problems concerning the external representation of the Euro Zone."
"We have always appealed, within the Eurogroup, for the European Union and the Eurogroup to have a greater presence at the G20, at the International Monetary Fund and at the Financial Stability Fund."
"We, at the Eurogroup, were the first to demand a lasting and permanent seat for the Commission at the G20, something that did not prevent the President of the Commission from not claiming the Presidency of the Eurogroup - the consequences of which we shall see later."
"However, we believe that the European Central Bank and the Commission should be represented on a long-term basis at the G20, as should the Eurogroup, whether it be represented by the President of the Eurogroup, who is modestly trying to lead the finance ministers' work, to which Mr Sarkozy commented that they were unequal, or by someone else."
"I am not seeking the Presidency of the Eurogroup at minister of finance level for my own pleasure and glory, which is hardly inexhaustible; I am doing so out of a sense of duty."
"If others think that they can do a better job of these tasks, then let them do so, but they should apply the same intensity to them in the years to come as they give the impression of wanting to do at the present time."
"For the rest, with regard to the EMU's economic instruments and the governance of our group, I believe that, over the last few years, we have made remarkable progress, but when we debate exchange policy and monetary policy at international level, it is unthinkable that the world's second major currency should not be represented in political and monetary terms by those responsible for managing these two aspects and these two areas of our common policy."
"If we want the ministers of finance within the Eurogroup properly to manage the economic strand of Economic and Monetary Union, then the various Heads of State or Government need to give their ministers of finance the necessary instructions."
"In Luxembourg, as you know, this presents no problem whatsoever."
"(Applause)"
"Many thanks, Mr Juncker, not only for this report, but also for your committed work on this matter as President of the Eurogroup."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Eurogroup, Mr Juncker, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall begin by congratulating my fellow Members, Mrs Berès and Mr Langen, on the quality of their report, and by thanking them for having incorporated the amendments tabled by the Committee on International Trade."
"Ten years on from its creation, the EMU should be regarded as a European success story of which we should be proud."
"No one can dispute the fact - and many studies demonstrate it - that there is indeed a link between monetary policy and trade policy, and that, in this respect, the positive role of currency stability is necessary for the sustainable growth of international trade."
"Increased use of the euro as an international currency benefits the Member States of the Euro Zone because it enables European businesses to reduce the exchange risk and to increase their international competitiveness."
"However, although the European Central Bank, by prioritising price stability, has increased confidence in the euro, no one can seriously dispute the fact that inflation is a global reality and that, in an open market economy, this global phenomenon cannot be tackled by means of European monetary policy alone."
"It is clear that the euro exchange rates have been too high for too long and have had negative effects, not least by constraining exports and by promoting imports within the internal market."
"Many manufacturers have voiced their concerns in this regard."
"According to a study that we commissioned within the Committee on International Trade, the ECB's high-rate policy has cost us, over the past few years, 0.5 growth rate points per year."
"It is in this way that I regret that the Commission has not carried out a more precise analysis of the euro's international role and its repercussions on the internal market with regard to international trade."
"The monetary policies conducted by some of the EU's partners with the aim of undervaluing their currency unfairly undermine trade."
"They could be considered a non-tariff barrier to international trade."
"It is in this context that we are proposing to study the feasibility of a body for regulating monetary differences on the model of what the States managed to create in the trade sphere at the World Trade Organisation."
"This body, which would come under the IMF, could help to stabilise the international monetary system, to reduce the risk of abuse and to give the global markets back the confidence they need."
"I support the Commission's proposal to develop common, European monetary positions, by obtaining in the long term a single seat for the Euro Zone within the international financial institutions and forums."
"Lastly, I regret that the report does not take up the idea of an economic government."
"Mr Juncker, this is not an issue of sincerity; it is a political proposal for organising our Community instruments."
"In times gone by, governments would settle major international disturbances with military wars."
"Today, we are fighting an economic and social war, but instead of having people die, we have people out of work, and we no longer really know who the enemy is."
"In this context, let us not be naïve and let us work tirelessly to implement European economic and social governance."
"The latter may certainly not be enough in itself, but it is a necessary condition for the success of a European social market economy."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would very much like to thank the rapporteur for his comments on the future of the euro and all the associated policy areas, and to say that he has garnered widespread support in the committee."
"I am also grateful to the other participants, in particular to Mr Juncker, who was the face of Europe at the IMF meeting in Washington and made a very good job of it."
"We were proud of him, and I would just like to say: do not let the negative discussions discourage you from continuing this very successful work."
"Ten years ago, I had the honour of speaking about the euro on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and at the time I said, and I quote, 'the euro will be strong, in defiance of the negative comments', such as those from Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, as he was to become, who said at the time that the euro was a sickly premature baby."
"We repudiated that, and successfully in my opinion."
"After all, the euro was brought into the world following several years of dieting by means of a strict, consistent fitness policy, and it has been a success."
"I do not want to go into that yet again."
"At the time, Gordon Brown was President-in-Office of the Council, and he stated quite clearly back then that the European Parliament had played a major role in the historic process of monetary union."
"Other players also spoke, including Jacques Santer, and also Wilfried Maartens, who at the time described the countries in the Euro Zone - first 11, then 15, then 16 of them - as the pioneers of a courageous Europe."
"I believe that we in Europe need courage for the future, so that we can carry on working so successfully and continue to stand up in the world of the other major powers - the USA, Asia and the other world powers - successfully with the euro."
"The currency reserves held globally in euro are the best possible evidence of the success of the euro and of the Euro Zone."
"I want to congratulate not only the rapporteurs, but also the Commission on its initiative in preparing this text reviewing the first 10 years of Economic and Monetary Union."
"It is a strategic text and this analysis was vital."
"As has been said here today, the euro is an undeniable success."
"From Lisbon to Helsinki and from Dublin to Bratislava, the euro has proved strong and solid, even during the current severe turbulence."
"It is clearly vital that the borders of this club are enlarged."
"However, every day now the solidity of the European project is being put to the test in many other dimensions."
"As has been said, the euro is central to the functioning of the financial system."
"However, even the Commission's text clearly points to the fundamental conclusion that neither growth in the real economy nor social or spatial convergence have kept up with this success."
"On the contrary, the Commission clearly concludes that disparities have sharply increased during the first decade of the single currency."
"This divergence affects regions in my country, in particular northern Portugal, and also other regions in other Member States."
"The single monetary policy, particularly the very high exchange rate, has had a greater impact on those regions which are more exposed to international competition and also on those that export most."
"Today, the crisis resulting from deregulation of financial markets is seriously affecting the real economy and is further worsening the situation of many citizens in many regions."
"Those regions which are exposed to international competition, those which depend on small and medium-sized enterprises and those in which access to credit is very important are now falling victim to this process and depression is even threatening."
"The euro's success depends on the trust placed in it by European citizens."
"The most powerful European countries have already taken steps to stimulate their national economies."
"We can cite, in particular, the initiatives taken in relation to the motor industry."
"However, Europe is more than that."
"It has to be much more than the more or less coordinated sum of national policies."
"The time has come to make the euro one of Europe's central tools to ensure a robust currency and also a robust real economy."
"The euro must be accompanied by mechanisms guaranteeing the central objective of achieving social and regional convergence, because, in essence, that is the heart of the European project."
"The debate on coordinating economic policies in the euro area is now unquestionably more relevant and more topical."
"However, coordinating national policies is not enough."
"More needs to be done."
"Having a Lisbon Strategy that is purely the sum of national initiatives and having a Stability and Growth Pact that puts different amounts of pressure on the various countries using it and subject to it are limitations, to which we can add the limited budget available."
"Crises generate opportunities."
"Monetary union can only be maintained if there is convergence in the well-being of Member States and their citizens, regardless of where they were born."
"How else can we mobilise the people to support the single currency?"
"The Commission must be equal to its own diagnosis and that is why we anxiously await the concrete proposals to be made by the Commission on 26 November to this House and to the European citizens."
"It is vital that this crisis leads to a new phase in the Union, in which consolidation and strengthening of the financial system are accompanied by real prosperity based on cohesion and a concept of citizenship which is also economic."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are currently experiencing the most serious financial crisis in decades, and the European Central Bank and the euro have so far passed the litmus test of this financial crisis with flying colours."
"The ECB has acted quickly and decisively to deal with the crisis, and has done its job better than some other central banks; it has thus given an impressive demonstration of its crisis management abilities in difficult times."
"The euro has shown itself to be a strong currency, which has helped to keep the Euro Zone stable and has even been able to give a helping hand in the form of target measures to certain countries outside the Euro Zone."
"The call for European economic government fails to recognise that much has already been, and is being, done to coordinate the policies of the individual Member States and to harmonise them."
"The achievements in this area can be credited, not least, to you, Mr Juncker, and I would therefore like to take this opportunity to thank you most particularly."
"Countries outside the Euro Zone, such as Denmark and Hungary, are currently learning the hard way how expensive it can be not to belong to the Eurogroup and not be shielded by the protective umbrella of the euro."
"Countries that have previously been opposed to joining the Euro Zone, such as Denmark and Sweden, are now changing their minds and considering joining in a few years."
"The financial crisis also shows how closely linked the financial systems are, and how vulnerable they are."
"It is therefore in our own interests for the countries that have not yet reached that stage to join the euro as soon as possible, and for the opt-out countries to change their minds, albeit not with concessions that do not fit in with the accession criteria."
"The European Economic and Monetary Union is a stable area with clear accession criteria, and this should not be watered down."
"The only thing that might be worth considering would be, with regard to the rate of inflation, not to use the three best countries in the European Union as the reference point, but instead to look at the Euro Zone as a whole, given that we are now a larger club with 16 members."
"Since the Stability and Growth Pact was revised a few years ago, it has been flexible enough to respond appropriately, in times of economic imbalance, to challenges such as those of the current crisis."
"It would therefore be a mistake to try to weaken and redefine the requirements of the pact."
"The crisis also makes it very clear that excessive deficits such as those seen in the USA are not sustainable in the long term, that economic development on credit on a massive scale does not work, and therefore that there is no alternative to measures for consistent budget consolidation."
"We are confident that, contrary to what is currently being said on the financial markets and peddled in the media, the financial crisis will ultimately strengthen, rather than weaken, monetary union."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate Mrs Berès and Mr Langen for the work they have put into this very important report."
"It is an excellent report and one that should be taken notice of."
"When this topic was first reported at committee level, we were experiencing a very different economic climate."
"The subprime crisis in the United States of America had emerged, but I do not think anyone foresaw the repercussions and the extent of the effect it was going to have on financial markets right across the world."
"As the financial situation has worsened, the tone of our debates here in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has changed."
"The current crisis is a global one, and to get through it we need a coordinated global response, so I very much welcome the initiative that was taken at the weekend and the outcome of that."
"There is a lot of more work that needs to be done, but I think that is a very good start."
"For Ireland, the stability brought about by the euro currency, notably as regards interest rates and foreign-exchange rates, is a key factor in enabling us to emerge from the turmoil, not unscathed, but certainly still standing."
"If there is still anyone in Ireland or elsewhere in the Euro Zone or elsewhere in Europe that doubts the benefit of euro membership, just look at the north-west of Europe and take note of what is happening in Iceland."
"If people in Ireland had listened to those who opposed not just the Lisbon Treaty but also the Maastricht and Nice Treaties, where would Ireland be now?"
"We would be outside."
"We would not be in the Euro Zone and we would be very badly affected economically because we would not have the stability which the euro has brought to the country."
"I do not expect an answer from those parties like Sinn Féin who have consistently opposed Europe and the steps we have taken, but I really believe that it is time that they stood up and said what exactly they think and where they stand on the whole issue of Europe and our economic future."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Mr President of the Eurogroup, Commissioner, on behalf of my group, I should also like to thank Mrs Berès and Mr Langen for the important report they have submitted to us."
"With its 62 paragraphs and 14 dense pages, it provides much food for thought."
"I should like to take advantage of the President of the Eurogroup's and the Commissioner's presence to share with them, again, on behalf of my group, several remarks that, in our view, deserve to be examined more fully than is the case in the report."
"The first remark concerns the euro exchange rate policy."
"I admit that I still do not understand whether or not there is an exchange rate policy for the euro in relation to the other international currencies and whether, at the G20 or elsewhere, there is a discussion about the way in which the United States' very substantial deficits are going to continue to be financed."
"My second remark relates to the topic of coordination."
"I believe that the euro is a success, particularly from a political point of view, because it gives the European Union the status of a political power."
"However, I also believe that its coordination is not working very well, and this, at least, on three points."
"The first point is the issue of taxation."
"You know what the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance's opinion is on this matter: we are in favour of tax competition within the Union, but fair tax competition."
"We believe that we are lagging too far behind when it comes to combating tax havens, including within the European Union, and we believe that we are lagging too far behind when it comes to extending the Directive on savings income."
"With regard to the issue of budget policy coordination - which is the second point - I note that the Member States are all embarking on 'revival' plans."
"At European level, I hear Mr Strauss-Kahn say, for example, that 1% of the Community's GDP needs to be pledged, a figure that represents practically the entire EU budget for one year."
"Where do we stand with regard to that point of view?"
"I believe that the coordination effort is not going very well and I also believe that the responses you are providing with regard to the revisited Stability and Growth Pact are neither sufficient nor a match for the challenge awaiting us."
"Lastly, the third point on which coordination seems to me to be poor and insufficient is the wage policy conducted within the various EU countries."
"In reality, Germany has built up its strong performance over the past 10 years by practising a wage policy that, in view of the size of the German economy, is responsible for the overall momentum of the Euro Zone."
"I believe that this presents a problem in terms of the level of internal demand and of the level of wages for a number of job categories, not to mention the problem of job insecurity."
"On these three points, Mr President of the Eurogroup, I shall expect, from yourself and from the Council of finance ministers that you represent, more ambition for the future, since we are also talking about the challenges to come."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 10 years after the introduction of monetary union, Europe finds itself in a major crisis."
"Banks are collapsing, or are being propped up with billions from national budgets; the market is collapsing, and millions of people are afraid for their jobs and their future."
"It is not only the market that has failed: the prevailing policy seems unable to learn from its mistakes."
"We take the view that serious mistakes were made in setting up Economic and Monetary Union."
"One of those mistakes was the structural separation of monetary and fiscal policy: one cannot create a common currency without at the same time harmonising taxation and expenditure policy, at least in broad outlines."
"It seems to me that the economic imbalances within the Euro Zone have increased enormously."
"What we now need is, indeed, better coordination of economic, and in particular taxation, policy."
"We need effective measures to combat tax dumping; tax havens also need to be closed and movements of capital finally need to be controlled again."
"The second serious mistake, in our view, lies in the structure of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"In times like these, anybody who thinks that budget consolidation is essential is obviously living in another world: nothing would be more disastrous than responding to this economic crisis, at this point, with obvious saving programmes."
"The stability pact has clearly proven that it has failed."
"It should be replaced by an integrated European strategy for solidarity and sustainable development."
"In our opinion, we need an investment offensive to renew public infrastructure and to improve the lives of socially disadvantaged groups in Europe."
"The third mistake, in our view, lies in the structure of the European Central Bank itself, which is not subject to any democratic supervision and which has as its sole objective price stability."
"We would advocate introducing democratic supervision for the European Central Bank, and we also call for the ECB's monetary policy mandate to be adjusted so that, in future, growth and employment have to be given at least the same weight as price stability."
"The current crisis is also an opportunity for far-reaching reform of the European monetary and financial architecture."
"This opportunity must not just be frittered away."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Mr President, if we had a common literary reference framework in Europe, I would begin my speech with a quote from a great Swedish poet: The voice of flattery lulls you to sleep: listen to the voice of truth some time."
"The meter is alexandrine with a caesura."
"Both rapporteurs make the assessment that the monetary union has been a success."
"As a result they are helping to create a myth surrounding the euro that is not anchored in critical Western thinking."
"The truth about the euro is quite different."
"Firstly, its first ten years have entailed enormous costs in the form of reduced growth and increased unemployment."
"Secondly, the monetary union has not been tested in hard times until now."
"Research points to the fact that the effect on the volume of foreign trade could be fairly large, perhaps even 3-4% of GNP."
"On the other hand, it is apparent that the socio-economic profit from this increase in trade is very modest, perhaps 3-5 per mille of GNP, which is a one-off profit."
"This negligible increase in prosperity has been gained at the expense of the Euro Zone countries not having been able to conduct an independent monetary and finance policy."
"Germany went into this monetary union with a heavily over-valued currency and has lived with a high rate of interest and too restrictive a finance policy."
"The costs have been considerable, and so how is it going now?"
"The story that has been put together is that the countries of the Euro Zone have united forcefully and have led the fight against the financial crisis."
"As everyone knows, this is a myth."
"It was the United Kingdom, which is outside the monetary union, and Gordon Brown who took the initiative."
"The Euro Zone followed on afterwards."
"Mr President, let me congratulate Mr Lundgren on his remarks and also challenge Mr Ryan of the UEN Group, who tells us that the stability provided by the euro has been an enormous boon to Ireland."
"If he had been following recent Irish economic history, he would know that the inflexibility of the euro monetary policy has contributed to serious inflationary problems, especially in the housing market, and that the Irish housing bubble has been much more severe than it need have been if Ireland had been able to control its own monetary policy."
"We were offered great benefits with the euro; we were offered ease of travel, growth and efficiency, and transfers of money between Member States would suddenly become easier."
"But this has not happened."
"Yes, we have got the ease of travel, but we have not seen the growth and efficiency, and I believe that it is nearly as difficult and expensive to transfer money between euro-zone states as it ever was."
"Those of us who had doubts about the euro project have been vindicated."
"What we have is the wrong interest rate for most countries most of the time."
"Italy has had the most fearful crisis of competitiveness, with its unit labour costs increasing by 40% compared to Germany."
"We are told that the euro is a great success because of its strength as a currency."
"Well, we should go and ask some euro-zone exporters what they think of the strength of the euro."
"It is doing huge damage to them."
"The real test of a currency's success is the degree of confidence in the market, and that is measured in this case by the bond spreads between euro-zone states."
"The last time I looked, the bond spread between Greece and Germany was over 150 basis points."
"This is not sustainable."
"It shows a total lack of confidence in the euro from the markets."
"The question for us is not how long can the euro last, but which Member State will leave first."
"- (SK) Mr President, Commissioner, allow me to begin by thanking both rapporteurs for a well-balanced report."
"In connection with this report I will first of all respond to the current problems in the Euro Zone."
"And despite ten years of positive effects achieved through its operation, the Euro Zone faces new challenges over how to confront the financial crisis and the subsequent economic recession."
"I would like to contribute by pointing out some of the unsystematic regulatory interventions made by a number of Member State governments in the market under the pretext of sorting out this new situation."
"I must say with some surprise that the governments of Member States are often encouraged to make certain unhelpful interventions in the financial sector by some of the statements from certain representatives of the European Union, and these often resolve only the peripheral aspects of the situation."
"This applies in the case of adherence to the conditions of the Stability and Growth Pact, for example, where some governments are already signalling that they will apparently not be sticking to a planned deficit in their public finances and referring in this context to the encouragement of the European Union."
"The takeover of troubled financial institutions by the governments of some Member States will create a dangerous precedence for the expropriation of private companies in any sector whatsoever who are not willing to adapt themselves to un-systematic regulatory and discriminatory interventions carried out, for example, in the interests of holding down inflation."
"The large-scale financial interventions in some sectors of the economy, such as the automobile industry, give rise to questions as to whether or not such interventions cause excessive market deformation and also discriminate against other sectors."
"Without clear and careful coordination and clear rules at a European Union or Euro Zone level, it will be difficult to manage these very challenging processes."
"In this context, I would like to urge the representatives of the European Commission and the European Central Bank and other relevant EU institutions to take a considered and coordinated position when looking for an optimal solution in these difficult times, when the whole of Europe faces economic recession."
"In the short-term, excessive regulation and government intervention in the free market may temporarily halt further economic collapse in the EU, but in the medium term they will certainly not bring the boost to development that is so much expected."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner Almunia, ladies and gentlemen, Economic and Monetary Union has added a new dimension to the European integration process."
"Its governance is based on two asymmetrical pillars: monetary union, which is federal in nature, and economic coordination, which is intergovernmental."
"Both must ensure the stability, growth, fairness and sustainability that our citizens demand."
"The review of ten years of the euro area is positive."
"The proof lies in the fact that the euro is increasingly regarded as a refuge and place of security for Member States."
"However, we need to go further and expand its scope."
"We need to do this in order to confront the challenges of globalisation, climate change and population ageing, and also the current financial crisis which necessitates improvements in the way we operate."
"We also need to do this in order to tackle the spectre of recession which is emerging for the first time."
"The euro cannot simply act as a safety anchor, but must also be an engine that can drive growth."
"The euro area and Economic and Monetary Union must be capable of responding to these challenges."
"I must congratulate the rapporteurs on their excellent work and, in particular, thank them for having incorporated two of my proposals."
"The first was to introduce, in the definition of our monetary policy, together with the economic pillar and the monetary pillar, the need for a financial analysis in order to correctly define this policy."
"Its definition must take into account the transfer of monetary policy, the development of credit and financial assets, the characteristics of new products and the concentration of risks and liquidity."
"Secondly, we must take account of the divergences between the Member States, which will increase with the enlargement processes."
"A 'one size fits all' monetary policy will not in many cases suit the situation of the various countries."
"It should therefore be adjusted by introducing financial facilities for those countries which may experience contractive effects due to the 'one size fits all' policy, given that the expansive effects can easily be corrected through fiscal policy."
"(LT) It is said that any crisis highlights all the strong and weak points of economic and institutional structures."
"I must admit that previously I had little doubt that greater attention to countries in the Euro Zone would create preconditions for the emergence of a two-speed Europe and that developing economies, like Lithuania's economy, would face obstacles to their entering the Euro Zone."
"But the current events in the financial markets have changed my attitude to the Eurogroup's role and influence on the European Union."
"It is obvious that the Euro Zone has withstood the first strong wave of the financial crisis."
"It is clear that the economic downturn can be halted by implementing an economic policy, which is better coordinated among Member States, which speeds up integration and the expansion of the internal market."
"Those countries, which have remained outside Euro Zone's borders, have suffered more."
"For the most part we suffered and became victims of the financial crisis because capital is being taken back."
"That is why sometimes we object very strongly to decisions, which would ease the movement of capital in the countries of the European Union, it is not that we are against integration."
"As a professional economist, I know that integration processes encourage economic growth."
"But we would really like the Euro Zone to become a rock, which would beat back the waves of the financial crisis, a rock which we could climb onto and where we could seek shelter from the icy winds."
"What needs to be done to make the strength of the Euro Zone the strength of the entire European Union?"
"We should certainly avoid proposing a lot of new measures."
"Commissioner, today I looked through the resolutions, which the European Parliament adopted on economic policy."
"Now it would have been to our benefit, if at least part of those proposals had already been implemented."
"There are a great number of proposals and it seems to me that we will not think of anything more."
"Now we ought to consolidate those proposals."
"At the moment there are discussions as to whether we need greater state interference or a more liberal policy to overcome the economic recession."
"I would say that both economic strategies should be used."
"Above all, what is obvious is that we need a social safety net, where the state offers support and maintenance, so that people who have lost their jobs due to the crisis, due to restructuring, can find a new place in life."
"On the other hand, we need liberal reforms so that the integration process becomes stronger and creates opportunities for business expansion in the European Union."
"Here the Euro Zone has a strong part to play."
"In conclusion, I would like to join my colleagues and say to you, Mr President of the Eurogroup, that we value your work and know how complicated this all is - at least in the European Parliament you have support."
"(PL) Mr President, a review of the ten years of Economic and Monetary Union should be assessed from an international perspective."
"The question we should ask is where the European Union has shown its advantages over its main competitors in the world, that is, the USA and Asia."
"This perspective clearly shows that the Euro Zone balance sheet is in the red."
"The European Union has been developing more slowly than its competitors."
"Growth in jobs, and particular the growth in labour productivity has been lower than in the USA, not to mention Asia."
"This means that the common currency is not fulfilling its fundamental role."
"Another aspect is the future of the Euro Zone: documents of the European Central Bank and the authorities of the EU are placing increasing emphasis on the need to use the euro as a tool to impose uniform economic policies on the Member States, particularly as regards budgetary and fiscal policies."
"This declaration is of concern to the more backward countries, particularly the new Member States."
"How can they develop and close the gap with the old Member States if they are forced into a policy that slows economic growth in all Member States?"
"The main criticism of the European Central Bank is that in striving to make the euro a world currency, it is ignoring the economic problems of the regions and the less developed Member States."
"It is also failing to take into account social aspects, such as demographic structure and the mobility of citizens."
"The position of the EU authorities is even less acceptable when it is considered that for many years both Germany and France failed to comply with the stringent conditions of Maastricht, because they knew that this was in their national interests."
"Furthermore, they were never called to account or punished."
"Therefore, in my view, what is needed is not to continue the present economic doctrine of the Euro Zone, but a radical change which will help not only to counteract the present financial crisis, but will above all release the energy for every Member State of the EU to develop economically."
"(EL) Mr President, the proposal by the European Commission on the first ten years of Economic and Monetary Union contains a series of contradictions."
"It aims to close a cycle of market deregulation, while in the real economy the prices of goods and services are at an all-time high and unemployment in the Euro Zone is forecast to reach 8.6% in 2009 and 9% in 2010."
"Developments confirm that there has been no narrowing whatsoever of the gap between rich and poor."
"The global economic and financial crisis is directly linked to limitations on the state and the policy of deregulation."
"Furthermore, while we have confirmation that the distribution of wealth has been uneven, the Commission is advocating in favour of the continuing application and levelling effect of the Stability and Growth Pact and a stronger role for the International Monetary Fund."
"This approach rides roughshod over the peculiarities of the economies of the individual Member States and clashes with the philosophy of different rates of growth in each Member State."
"(DA) Mr President, this year it is ten years since the introduction of the euro in a large number of countries within the EU."
"In Denmark we have rejected the introduction of the euro twice after long and in-depth debates, and now it is time take stock and review the situation."
"We need to look very critically at our common currency."
"Since July, the euro has fallen by 30% in relation to the dollar after the start of the financial crisis."
"Investors lack confidence in the euro."
"The question is, why?"
"Part of the answer is obvious: there is a lot to suggest that the monetary policy pursued within the EU, which only looks at fighting inflation, is not the correct one."
"The very stringent finance policy that Member States are forced to pursue on account of the Stability Pact is simply not the right one just now."
"The low rate of the euro in relation to the dollar is a result of there being no confidence in the economic policy of the countries using the euro."
"We can also say that the financial crisis demonstrates something else - that the euro's 'one size fits all' standard does not hold true."
"More and more economists are of the opinion that an expansive finance policy should be pursued."
"If we want to use it as a tool, we need many more individual economic policies than the euro will allow."
"'One size fits all' will never fit anyone very well."
"It will always be a poor fit for everyone."
"Finally, I have to say to Mr Klinz - who said that we in Denmark would like to join the euro and that our currency is weak - that the Danish economy is as solid as a rock and that we have managed the financial crisis better than the average euro country."
"(DE) Mr President, on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of economic and monetary union, there is really very little to celebrate."
"We are desperately trying to use a variety of rescue packages to prevent a dam bursting in our financial system, and all we are managing to do is patch up the breaches inadequately."
"The banks have pocketed billions in government money, whilst at the same time distributing bonuses and profits, and the average citizen has been made a fool several times over: his tax money has ended up on the banks' roulette tables, and in return he is threatened with unemployment and possibly even losses on his savings and pension fund."
"In the middle of this dilemma, voices are now being raised saying that we finally have to do something to ensure that European companies do not end up in the hands of non-European, for example Chinese, owners."
"This sell-off of Europe started years ago, with cross-border leasing and other such machinations."
"What is more, the EMU is in a certain amount of trouble in view of Greece's spiralling debt and Italy's carelessness after joining the Euroclub."
"We therefore need to ensure that mistakes made in connection with the euro are not repeated by new members, and that no more risky financial games can be played with public money, in other words with the people's money."
"Not only do we need strict EU-wide monitoring of dubious financial constructs, but we also need to require a solidarity contribution from those who have profited from speculation."
"Above all, the EU must, in principle, renounce completely untrammelled capitalism, and instead protect its citizens from unbridled greed and the negative effects of uncontrolled globalisation."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Juncker, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Mölzer seems to have missed the point, as nothing that he said had much to do with the euro."
"The euro and enlargement are the European Union's most visible successes of the last 10 years."
"We must, however, also bear in mind that these successes would never have been possible without the Maastricht criteria, the Stability and Growth Pact and the European Central Bank, and without political will and a willingness to take responsibility at European level."
"We are now talking about cooperation and coordination."
"It is true that we need more cooperation and coordination, but, for that to be possible, we will need to trust each other more."
"We need more cooperation and coordination, not least in light of more Europe with respect to economic practices."
"During diverse crises, the European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan have helped to protect Europe from monetary crises."
"I would therefore once again stress that there can be no summit without representatives of the Euro Zone and of the European Central Bank."
"The financial crisis has demonstrated that the euro has helped us to avoid currency speculation, and to prevent it from occurring in the Euro Zone."
"The reactions in Denmark, the United Kingdom, Sweden and Hungary very clearly show us what the euro has done for us."
"My final point, Mr President, is that we also want the European Union to be represented in the IMF, the World Bank and the global financial economy in accordance with its strength."
"We call on all those who are now clamouring for global regulations to do in Europe and in their Member States what they are demanding that others do."
"(SV) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Juncker, I would like to begin by giving my hearty congratulations to a mature ten year old and my thanks to both rapporteurs for an excellent report."
"The last few months have, of course, demonstrated the strength of the euro."
"Few people believed ten years ago that the euro would be such a formidable success."
"Some countries, my own included, waited anxiously outside."
"Some critics probably thought that the euro would not pass the test, just as Mr Lundgren said."
"But he and the other prophets of doom were wrong."
"After months of financial uncertainty it is clear that only cooperation in economic matters, with the euro as the linchpin, can provide the certainty that the current global economic systems require."
"Precisely the fact that it was joint actions that led to an easing of the market proves the strength of the euro cooperation."
"The euro should be the currency of the whole of Europe."
"If this vision is to become reality, then the already stringent convergence criteria should not become even more stringent."
"I therefore think it is wrong to make membership of the euro into an exclusive club with higher entry requirements, which one of the amendments requires."
"Allow me to say a few words regarding Sweden's position outside the Euro Zone."
"For Sweden, which has only one foot in the European Union but is still outside the Euro Zone, the advantages and disadvantages are clearer now than ever before, even, I hope, to Mr Lundgren."
"When the previous financial crisis hit Sweden in 1992, we could ultimately do nothing other than allow the krona to fall."
"Lessons learned at that time led to our decision to become part of the European family."
"Over the last year, the Swedish krona has fallen in value against the euro."
"Now, as the financial crisis is being dealt with, Sweden finds itself outside both the protection offered by the euro and the resolutions adopted and required by the crisis management within the euro group."
"It is now that small countries like Sweden should realise the value of a common currency."
"The stability that the euro offers allows the long-range view that is important for a country that is as dependent on exports as Sweden is."
"Sweden has good economic development, that is true, but membership of the euro would have given us more stability in our monetary policy and have created more jobs, a more stable economy and stronger exports."
"The Swedish parties should therefore be prepared to review their passive attitude to the euro as a currency for Sweden."
"Sweden should be a full member of the European Union."
"It is therefore time that we began to talk seriously in my country about a new referendum."
"For my part, I am hoping for Swedish membership within five years."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to draw attention to two questions in this debate, questions which in my view cast a shadow on the functioning of economic and monetary union."
"Firstly, we have the more rapid development of the countries outside the Euro Zone than those within it."
"In 2002-2007 the old Member States outside the Euro Zone - England, Sweden and Denmark - developed much faster than the Euro Zone countries."
"GDP growth in these countries was almost double the average in the Euro Zone, and unemployment rates were significantly lower than in the Euro Zone."
"The differences between the Euro Zone countries and the new Member States are even more telling."
"Secondly, there is the unequal treatment of countries aspiring to economic and monetary union, and those already in it. The candidates for monetary union have to meet strict fiscal and monetary criteria for two years before adopting the currency, while the two largest EU countries - Germany and France - who are in the Euro Zone, exceeded the budget deficit threshold for the four years between 2002-2005."
"A change in the Stability and Growth Pact was necessary for these two countries to avoid having to pay several billion euros in penalties for non-observance."
"(SV) This report praises the EMU."
"I wonder what there is in fact to celebrate."
"The Euro Zone is in a recession and unemployment is rising sharply."
"Several of the large EMU countries no longer meet the basic economic requirements for membership."
"This alone indicates what a rigid project this is."
"Five years ago the Swedish people voted against the EMU."
"However, on repeated occasions I have heard the Commission say that Sweden sooner or later must join the EMU."
"I would therefore like to take the opportunity of asking the Commission whether you can clarify this once and for all."
"Must Sweden join the EMU?"
"The EMU requires a fundamental reform."
"A clear objective for the European Central Bank to combat unemployment should be included."
"Greater economic flexibility should be allowed."
"These would represent a few important steps in the right direction."
"(HU) Thank you, Mr President, I consider the introduction of the euro a success, since we have seen unemployment fall and employment rise, given the stability that lies behind the euro."
"Further proof has come from the current crisis, for any country that can use this strong reserve currency simply cannot have balance of payment difficulties, whereas others - such as Hungary - are experiencing such problems."
"However, the Euro Zone has not succeeded in achieving convergence, despite cohesion fund support, and what we should be examining instead are the reasons for this. It is a very strong magnet for capital."
"Therefore, I suggest that in examining what happened, we should take into account not only GDP but also GNI."
"I am pleased that the report has included the point that measures should be taken against Member States who have continuously provided incorrect, rose-coloured forecasts - as we know from the events in Hungary in 2006 - and I believe that this is indeed necessary."
"I think it important that we should preserve the prestige of EU membership."
"On the one hand, states that are not members of the European Union should not enter the Euro Zone, since this would mean that we could not justify the dramatic efforts made by certain states to become members."
"The tools of the ECB, particularly during the current crisis, should be used for each Member State, especially as regard liquidity; we should not be selfish in this regard."
"This gives meaning to the EU's protective shield and to membership in the internal market, which represents a significant challenge, particularly for the less developed Member States."
"But similarly, we should take this into account in the composition of the ECB Executive Board."
"The most important consideration, however, is the external representation of the Euro Zone."
"This is necessary, but each Member State should be involved in conferring the mandate for the external representation of the Euro Zone; external representation should not be an exclusive club, since the EU is a unified entity."
"Finally, I would like to say that Member States need to enter the Euro Zone as soon as possible, under strict but logical conditions."
"Therefore, I am pleased with Mr Klinz's reasonable suggestion that the reference countries be limited to the EU area countries. Thank you for your attention."
"- (SK) In connection with the financial crisis in recent weeks the inhabitants of Europe have seen how the Member States in the Euro Zone are better equipped to cope with large disruptions."
"People also see this in my own country, Slovakia, which joins the Euro Zone on 1 January."
"The financial investors and speculators from the currency markets already consider us to be part of the Euro Zone."
"It no longer pays to speculate with our currency, since we have established a fixed conversion rate."
"At the same time, the currencies of our neighbouring countries are falling."
"Speculators see in them a level of risk which they do not wish to incur, due to the crisis on the financial markets."
"Some currencies have fallen to their lowest levels in years."
"The adoption of the euro for a small and open economy shields entrepreneurs and inhabitants from fluctuations in the exchange rate."
"Even the inhabitants of the country with the highest level of employment in the world, Denmark, which has long had one of the highest levels of competitiveness and highest standard of living in the world, have discovered that if they were members of the Euro Zone they would have more favourable rates of exchange and they would be better able to tackle the current global problems."
"The same also applies to Sweden, of course, which we have been discussing here today."
"Perhaps now is the right moment for them to reassess their entry into the Euro Zone."
"The criticism has been raised today by a colleague from my own country that the Slovak government is drawing up measures for strengthening the framework of regulation and supervision."
"I would like to draw his attention to a resolution of the European Parliament, which recently asked the Commission to propose measures for strengthening the framework of regulation and supervision across the entire EU."
"There is no other way."
"That is why a majority of MEPs from various political groups voted in favour of this option."
"I would like to end by congratulating both rapporteurs for an excellent report."
"(LT) The Economic and Monetary Union is 10 years old."
"It is a fine anniversary, but also an occasion to consider how the EU and the global economic, financial and political situation has changed and whether the Maastricht criteria suit current global changes."
"In 2005 the Stability and Growth Pact was reviewed, perhaps because its requirements had not been implemented by the largest countries in the Euro Zone."
"In a period of 10 years virtually none of the countries in the Euro Zone had implemented all of the Maastricht criteria."
"We know that the European Central Bank's inflation target is 2%."
"If we were to look for this target today, then we would see that it has not been achieved by any EU countries; their inflation this September ranged from 2.8% in the Netherlands to 14.7% in Latvia, and the Maastricht price stability criterion would be 4.5%."
"If the members of the Euro Zone fail to implement the price stability criterion, how can we talk about inflation stability?"
"Talk of inflation stability began in 2006, when the Euro Zone started to expand."
"Are we talking about new requirements purely for new Euro Zone candidates?"
"What are the prospects for Euro Zone expansion?"
"I invite the European Commission and the European Central Bank to review once more the Economic and Monetary Union's principles, government, and the Maastricht criteria, asking whether they are being implemented in the current global economic and financial situation and what the future holds for the Economic and Monetary Union and candidates to the Euro Zone."
"(PL) Mr President, Mr Juncker, you are out of luck, because today's debate on the success of euroland is being held at a moment when Eurostat has announced that a major recession is starting in the countries which have the common currency."
"This should incline you to self-criticism, rather than to the unbounded propaganda of success."
"In their report, the authors praise the fall in unemployment, which over nine years has admittedly been just over 1.5%, but forecasts now predict a significant increase in unemployment in the Euro Zone in the coming year."
"The other side of the coin is less pleasant, and the report does underline this, and that is the very unsatisfactory economic growth and significant reduction in productivity (from 1.5% in the 1990s to 0.75% in the past decade)."
"It is clear that the euro is neither a panacea for economic woes, nor an instrument that by its nature provides faster economic growth and greater prosperity than in the EU countries outside the euro - Sweden, Denmark and Great Britain."
"(EL) Mr President, there can be no doubt that the birth of EMU and the euro are one of the highlights in the sixty-year history of European integration."
"This is the first time in Europe and in the world that we have had such a structured changeover to a common currency, without war, without bloodshed, by consensus and through the political will of independent countries which jointly and democratically decided to take this road towards monetary stability."
"It has been a difficult road, but a road which suited both components in Europe: both those countries which were accustomed to financial stability and continued to pursue the same anti-inflationary policies and the others which, after decades with no financial discipline, found for the first time in the euro an oasis in which they could rationalise and restructure their economic basics."
"So much for the past."
"Now, however, we are in a very difficult phase, at a crucial stage in which we must look at the 'E' in EMU."
"Until now the 'M' in EMU, its monetary components, have helped us to get where we are today, but from now on, without a cohesive, consistent, single European approach to the economic aspects of the argument, I am afraid that we shall find many of our achievements overturned before us."
"So we have two matters outstanding for the future: coordination rules for European economic governance which will also inoculate the global system over and above the excesses and anarchy which caused the present crisis and, secondly, we need to condemn the economic pandering to the people of all those who want to use the crisis to cast doubt on such important achievements."
"(PT) I must start by congratulating the rapporteurs on this excellent report."
"Only the few who are completely oblivious or the many who lack any understanding at all might consider that the euro and its associated monetary policy have not been a huge success for humanity and a great success for the European economy."
"You only need to look at the vast number of jobs that have been created in Europe during the euro's reign to understand its importance."
"It also cannot fail to be significant that, in a crisis situation in which the European economy, thanks to its instruments, is reacting more favourably than other regional economies, those who a short time ago were sceptical about the common monetary policy and the euro are now quickly asking to cooperate with and even integrate into the euro area."
"However, that is not everything and it does not mean that I personally am satisfied with how the European Union has tackled the issues of financial consolidation and financial stability."
"I have already said in this House on numerous occasions that I am in favour of financial stability and the Stability and Growth Pact, but that I feel that this Pact has not always been a friend to the real economy."
"Neither this Pact nor the monetary policy has been a true friend to the real economy."
"The real economy has frequently suffered enormous problems due to an overly conventional application of the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"I have never met an economist nor read an economic text book that told me that two, three and sixty, the magic numbers of the Stability and Growth Pact (inflation, deficit and debt ratio), have been scientifically proven."
"I have never met anyone and I have particularly never met an economist or economic theorist who at any time has said that it is absolutely vital to doggedly maintain this kind of configuration."
"One idea heavily defended by the Commission and by the more conservative sectors of Europe is that we must have balanced or zero budgets."
"This is an absolutely absurd idea."
"At any level of growth, a balanced budget means the total elimination of debt in the future."
"This is not fair in social terms, nor is it fair in inter-generational terms, and it has no connection with reality and the real economy."
"Mr President, the Berès-Langen report is an excellent one because what it does is give us the history of the EMU over the last 10 years and say how it should go forward in the future."
"The euro has been a resounding success: it is the second most important currency in the world; inflation in the first 10 years has broadly been in line with the ECB's objective of 2%; furthermore, it has facilitated travel, trade and employment; and, most importantly of all, it signifies a further step in EU consolidation."
"The announcement last week that the Euro Zone is in recession now means that urgent action will have to be taken both within the EU and globally, but the one thing we cannot do is blame the euro for the current crisis."
"While the Stability and Growth Pact rules are well-intentioned in setting down maximum borrowing guidelines for Member States, they did not foresee - and nobody could have foreseen - the current global economic crisis."
"The current crisis in my opinion calls for flexibility because, unless the credit squeeze by the financial institutions is relaxed, there is every possibility that the crisis will get even worse and that more and more jobs will be lost."
"I have to say that I want to commend Presidents Barroso and Sarkozy for the manner in which they represented the European Union at the G20 talks in Washington last week."
"I think they did us proud and I think they did Europe proud."
"Finally, we must examine how we got into the current crisis and what the causes were."
"We must learn the lessons and we must make sure that it never happens again."
"If this means reform - reform of the institutions, reform of the International Monetary Fund - let us do it."
"If it means examining the operations of the European Central Bank, let us do it."
"Let us at this stage carry out a forensic analysis and, whatever the crisis that Europe is now experiencing - we do not know how serious it is, where it is going to end up or what the consequences will be - let us examine it forensically and let us put solutions in place."
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Juncker."
"I share the view that the common currency has been a great European success."
"For several years we have had low prices and low levels of inflation, we have had low interest rates, we have had transparency of prices among countries, we have had macroeconomic stability - and this is a particular success for those countries which previously had problems with inflation and their budget deficit."
"I share the view that this is a success."
"I would like to comment on what my Polish fellow Member said a few minutes earlier, when he said that we have growing unemployment and a financial crisis in the Euro Zone."
"Unfortunately he has left the Chamber now, but had he stayed, he might have heard a few words of wisdom."
"Because he ignores the fact that without the euro, Europe would be in a much worse situation than it currently is."
"This is particularly evident if we look at the situation of countries such as Iceland or Hungary, which are now facing huge economic difficulties."
"Had they been part of the Euro Zone, their situation would be far better."
"I would like to say that the long-term success of any currency will be decided by real factors, it will be decided by long-term economic development, and this is lacking in Europe."
"We should note that in the past weeks the US dollar has strengthened against the euro, evidence that even in an economic crisis investors, or at least the majority of them, believe that the dollar is a safe haven for their investments."
"That is why we need to create a basis for long-term growth in Europe, which will strengthen the European currency."
"But this requires reform, it requires economic momentum, and it requires higher rates of productivity."
"The second point is that I believe that we should review the nominal convergence criteria, and we should ensure that we adapt the criteria to the new conditions, in particular the inflationary criteria and the method of calculating the benchmark, so that they will enable those new Member State economies that are very dynamic to join the Euro Zone."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Chairman of the Eurogroup and the Commissioner, as well as the two rapporteurs who produced this report, because I am convinced that the introduction of the euro has enabled citizens to manage their own family budgets more successfully, by helping them to make savings in their spending on goods and services, and not only this."
"As others have pointed out, we have seen the inflation rate contained at an average of around 2%, as well as the creation of roughly 16 million jobs over these ten years and the reduction of the public budget deficit, which in 2007 - as the Commissioner said - amounted to approximately 0.6% of GDP compared with 4% in the 1980s and 1990s."
"Moreover, the euro has acquired international prestige and has become an attractive currency even to countries outside the Community, and despite the recent financial turmoil that has dealt serious blows to the world financial and banking system, the euro has undoubtedly attenuated the devastating impact of this financial crisis of global proportions."
"There is today, however, a danger that the global slowdown in demand will continue to weaken exports and to frustrate the advantage of the discount rate of the euro, which is threatened by the fall in value of the dollar."
"It is clear that we must look again at making significant adjustments to the basic structure of the euro, in order to put Member States with a below-average GDP in a position to redress their disadvantage."
"An EMU road map to better analyse economic divergence, drive forward structural reforms and monitor public finances and financial markets, accelerating their integration, is therefore most welcome."
"All this can and must be achieved little by little as we emerge, and let us hope as soon as possible, from this situation of instability that is currently exacerbating not only the urgent decisions that national governments have to make, but also the confusion into which savers are thrown."
"Savers' trust must be restored in order to get investments and consumption moving and to improve the overall framework within which we can then act more calmly."
"In other words, the responsibility must be a collective one, but a concerted effort is required on the part of the competent authorities to judge which reforms to support with rigorous governance and authoritative political leadership."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to congratulate both rapporteurs, Mrs Berès and Mr Langen, for a very balanced report that studies the subject from the wide angle."
"Secondly, I think that when this report was initiated no one thought how timely it would be at this point."
"I think it is a sign of the EU's ability to respond to global challenges, secure competitiveness and create stability."
"Without European Monetary Union, both the euro countries and the countries outside the euro would have been far more vulnerable to this financial crisis."
"Over the past 10 years, the European Central Bank has played a very positive role, and this initiative has ensured very stable monetary policy and economic policy that actually made us able to respond in timely fashion to the crisis and to take proactive actions, not only in the EU area, but globally when it comes to discussions of reform of global financial architecture."
"I think that this is more than a crisis of a financial nature: it is a crisis of decision-making and the rules of the game."
"What we need now is a firmer European role for supervision and for the European Central Bank."
"We need better harmonised regulation for all different financial instruments."
"We need transparency through proper procedures and, most of all, we need Europeans to be very persistent in unity to advance these policies globally."
"We have to be united because markets have grown beyond our national states' capabilities, and we need coherent actions nationally, at European level and globally."
"- (SK) The euro will be the best investment stimulus for foreign investors in the region of Central Europe as well."
"Therefore, in connection with the introduction of the euro in Slovakia from 1 January 2009, it will be up to the government of Robert Fico how to make the most of this opportunity."
"The sustainability of inflation and the deficit in the public finances will be very closely monitored in Slovakia and the current Slovak government must therefore continue with the reforms of the previous government of Mikuláš Dzurinda."
"If this is not the case, Slovakia may have a problem holding down inflation after entry to the Euro Zone."
"I believe that the Slovak government will take to heart the recommendations of the rapporteurs of the European Parliament and will not saddle the country with future debt."
"It should not meddle in pension reform in an attempt to obtain the funds of private savers and achieve a short-term improvement in the public finance deficit, it will not pass laws that conflict with the rules of the market and it will contribute to improvements in the entrepreneurial environment."
"(RO) Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union derives its strength from its 490 million or so European citizens."
"The Euro Zone is a pillar of stability for Europe and the whole global economy."
"In the Euro Zone 16 million jobs have been created in the last 10 years alone."
"In the future, the Union will have to respond to the challenges posed by demographic and climate change."
"An ageing population will cause major problems of a social, economic and budgetary nature."
"I believe that the free movement of goods, people, capital and services needs to be defended, especially now against the backdrop of the financial crisis and economic recession."
"Lifting the barriers preventing the free movement of workers guarantees proper, decent working conditions for all European workers and provides an effective means of combating social dumping and tax evasion."
"I call on the European Commission and members of the Eurogroup to take the necessary measures, along with the governments of the Member States, to lift the restrictions imposed on Romanian and Bulgarian workers."
"The Euro Zone needs to set an example for the social market economy."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Commissioner Almunia and President Juncker for their work in developing this instrument, which is so important."
"The euro is a solid reality that has protected us in this crisis."
"Therefore we must press ahead and develop an economic policy to work alongside the monetary policy that has been so successful; a policy for the Eurogroup as a whole, but potentially for the Union as well, precisely because at this juncture we need to undertake an emergency programme to address the forecasted economic difficulties."
"I therefore believe that a strong commitment is required; we need to embark on a high-impact programme to build energy infrastructure in the Union and to make energy savings."
"I am convinced that we must do this as soon as we possibly can."
"Mr President, allow me to make my points in bullet points."
"Homogenous markets are at the heart of the systemic failure that we have, and if really good operators like Mr Juncker and Mr Almunia cannot bring heterogeneity back to the markets, then we are only putting off failure to a future date."
"Homogenous markets are at the centre of this problem."
"Secondly, it was forecast in Ireland that the euro as a currency would be something like a vehicle with no brakes, no steering wheel and no lights."
"How much they got that wrong!"
"Where would we be in Ireland today if the euro and the European Central Bank were not in place?"
"Why are we not taking greater credit for this?"
"This is one thing that could help us with the Lisbon ratification process."
"Lastly, concerning the argument about vaccination, parents have the right to decide, but if every parent decides not to vaccinate, then epidemics will rise."
"I would just say this: no man is an island."
"Britain may well be an island, but it is time that Britain revisited the question of joining the euro, because we cannot all go our separate ways."
"Mr President, it has always been economic nonsense for a number of differently performing economies to share the same interest and exchange rates."
"In addition, the primary function and legal obligation of the European Central Bank is to control inflation, which in the developing economic crisis is the least of our problems."
"These are the fault lines that will eventually tear the European single currency apart."
"But Europhiles in the UK are now using the argument that the falling rate of the pound is an opportunity for us to join the euro."
"A knowledge of basic economics would tell them that this is precisely the reason why Britain should not join."
"The ability of the pound to find its own value against other countries will be an essential factor in helping Britain to weather the coming economic storm. The United Kingdom needs the European single currency like a drowning man needs a strait jacket."
"(RO) Mr President, Commissioner, I would first of all like to congratulate both rapporteurs, Mrs Berès and Mr Langen."
"Ten years are neither a lot nor a little, but they have clearly made a major contribution in consolidating the single market and, at the moment, in creating a shield to protect against financial speculation."
"I believe that tighter regulation of the financial and banking sector, combined with encouraging investment in research and development, promoting competition and providing financial education for citizens may be much more effective solutions during this time of crisis."
"I think that the states of the European Union need to show economic and financial solidarity at the moment as intervention in the financial and banking sector alone is not sufficient to stabilise the economic crisis except superficially."
"I hope, Commissioner, that the effects of the crisis will not have an impact on the budget projections for 2007-2013 as European funds may be able to achieve the desired effects in providing for the Union's sustainable development."
"Mr President, on the question of Britain's membership of the Euro Zone, I think it has always been the case that Britain has been reluctant to join European agreements at the outset."
"It has learnt very quickly to regret that decision."
"We then apply to join at the worst possible moment."
"Had we been founder members of the Euro Zone - which we should have been - we would have been in a much stronger position today."
"I look forward to the next Conservative Government applying to join the Euro Zone really quite shortly."
"(Applause)"
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to make just two comments."
"Firstly, the euro has passed the test."
"Without the euro, in this financial crisis we would probably not have been spared speculation that would have gone against entire national economies in Europe."
"In that sense, then, the euro has passed the test."
"We would probably be facing serious difficulties - if not an absolute shambles - in Europe if we had not had the euro in this crisis."
"In my view, two things will be absolutely crucial in future."
"The euro can only remain stable and make progress against the dollar as a global reserve currency if two things are guaranteed: firstly, the ECB, which has proven itself in the crisis, must remain independent - as has already been argued - and, secondly, the Stability and Growth Pact must be expanded on."
"It is already extremely useful in its current form, but it also needs to be applied and protected."
"Member of the Commission. - (ES) Mr President, I should like to thank all the Members who have spoken in this debate."
"I believe that, from this debate, we can conclude that there is a very broad consensus in favour of the report under discussion, together with very broad support for continuing with the Economic and Monetary Union project and also in favour of our single currency."
"I am not saying this out of a desire to repeat the reasons given by those of us who supported the creation of Economic and Monetary Union 10 years ago, but due to the analysis of what has happened in that decade and of what we must do now, in these very difficult economic times."
"Of course, the current problems cannot be attributed to the euro."
"As we all know, the causes of this very deep crisis do not lie here in Europe or in the euro area."
"However, it is clear that we are paying the price, as are other industrialised countries, emerging economies and developing countries."
"This is because, in a global economy, decoupling is not possible."
"However, with Economic and Monetary Union, we at least have the instruments to tackle the problems more effectively."
"We believe that we will be able to get out of this crisis quicker if we work together than if each country tries to go it alone."
"I agree with all those - and there have been many - who have said that the European Central Bank is an institution which, since its creation, has more than adequately justified the trust that we placed in it in the Maastricht Treaty."
"I believe that it has done its work very well and that this work should be supported, because it is an essential part of Economic and Monetary Union."
"I also agree with all those who have said that the Stability and Growth Pact should be maintained as it is now, following the 2005 revision, so that we can use the flexibility introduced in that year and debated here on many occasions."
"This flexibility will enable us to maintain budgetary discipline and the rules of budgetary discipline."
"It will enable us to anchor the sustainability objectives of our public accounts."
"However, at the same time, it will enable us to use our fiscal policy in a situation requiring an active policy in terms of taxation and fiscal policy instruments."
"The fiscal stimulus must be coordinated so that it is effective."
"Our framework of budgetary discipline makes this coordination easier, but it also imposes limits to prevent the coordination of a fiscal stimulus from jeopardising the sustainability of our public accounts."
"Thirdly - and many speakers have mentioned this today - we undoubtedly have to reinforce the voice of the euro in defending the stability of our currency and in bilateral and multilateral relations with holders of our currency, with those representing other currencies and, in particular, with the other currencies of the major players in the global economy."
"This crisis ultimately stems from macroeconomic imbalances which should have been tackled but which could not be tackled due to a lack of effective mechanisms for solving global imbalances."
"We discussed this in Washington and we must keep discussing it."
"We can only do this effectively, as Europeans, if we give the euro our full political support and the necessary governance mechanisms so that our interests can be defended, as they deserve to be, through the exchange rate for our currency."
"I believe that this is the road to take, as stated in the report, as has been said by the President of the Eurogroup, as agreed by the Commission and as, in coming months, the leaders of the Member States will also increasingly agree."
"This requires coordination, provided that it is the right kind of coordination."
"It does not mean challenging the independence of the European Central Bank or artificially coordinating economic policy decisions, which must continue to be made according to the circumstances of each country."
"That is not real coordination."
"It must be the coordination that has always been behind the economic branch of Economic and Monetary Union, which is coordination serving the objectives of Economic and Monetary Union, in both macroeconomic policies and in the link which must exist between macroeconomic policies and structural policies."
"When we in the Commission talk about coordination, we are talking about this type of coordination."
"I feel that, in the current circumstances, the risk of recession that we are facing shows that this coordination is a priority and that Economic and Monetary Union gives us the instruments to achieve this."
"President of the Eurogroup. - (FR) Mr President, I shall be very brief, since the majority of those who tried to lead this debate are no longer in the Chamber."
"Thus there is no need to respond to them."
"For the rest, I would say that I have been impressed by the broad consensus that has resulted from the European Parliament's debates, since we are almost all agreed in saying that the euro was a success."
"I am pleased to note that those who belong to the Euro Zone say so."
"I am pleased to note that those who would like their countries to become members of the Euro Zone say so too."
"I note that those who have always said that everything we do is utterly stupid maintain this view, which cannot be characterised any differently from the way in which they characterise our attitude."
"Consequently, within Parliament, there is nothing new, except to say that, a touch of anxiety - that is a polite way of saying it - has all the same filtered into our debates."
"This is caused by the financial and economic crisis that we are facing at the present time."
"On this point, I should therefore like to say two things in response to a number of speakers."
"No one in Europe is radically arguing for an excessive budget consolidation."
"No one."
"We have a reformed Stability and Growth Pact."
"Some Members of this House did not agree with the reforms that we made to this Pact."
"They are the first ones today to commend the wisdom of the decisions that were taken in March 2005, when we applied a more economic perspective to the interpretation of this Stability and Growth Pact."
"This perspective allows the Member States and their budgets to breathe more easily today, even though we are entering a phase that is not depressive, but that makes the consolidation of public finances less straight forward."
"The Member States that have been virtuous in terms of budget consolidation over the past few years have sufficient budget margins to enable them to react to the current economic crisis, which includes the structural aspects that we are facing at present."
"The Member States that were less virtuous are having greater difficulty in releasing the budget resources that would enable them to react to the crisis that we are experiencing right now."
"However, throughout the Euro Zone, we have a duty to react to the crisis where economic policy is concerned."
"It is not enough to talk about budget stability."
"It is not enough to devote our efforts exclusively to the financial crisis."
"It is clear that the Euro Zone has to provide a strong and coordinated response to the economic crisis."
"We therefore have a few weeks in which to gather together all the elements we need in order to analyse and take action, so that we can formulate this practical and strong response."
"However, all those who are demanding greater coordination of economic policies must of course work towards this by trying not to anticipate economic policy decisions that they have not referred to their colleagues within the Eurogroup."
"It is easy, within Parliament, to call for the coordination of economic policies."
"I would propose to you, on the basis of your Rules of Procedure, that you put forward an intergroup text, in which the large groups, acting as the European Parliament, call on the Eurogroup and on their respective national governments no longer to announce economic policy measures before they have referred them to their colleagues from the Eurogroup."
"Urge your governments - it is easy to demand it here - urge your governments to respect the principle of coordinating economic policies."
"Make an intergroup resolution, and we shall see."
"We shall see, in two, three, four months' time, whether the governments - and the political parties to which you belong are very often part of the governments that you would address - have done what you demanded of them."
"That would be credible, reasonable, logical, rational and consistent."
"I am therefore saying that we need a strong and coordinated economic response to what is becoming more and more of an economic crisis."
"And, on the subject of wage policy, we will not say everything that we want to say, but everything that is worthy of being said."
"You are right in saying that the socialist governments of the Greens in Germany have practised a wage policy that has reduced the purchasing power of German workers."
"The situation has improved since then."
"The same comment applies, moreover, to France, whose government was not, at the time - between 1998 and 2002-2003 - a reactionary one."
"It was quite the opposite, from what I understood."
"A little self-criticism, of course, would enrich the comments of certain people in a good way."
"For the rest, on the taxation of savings, we are three years ahead of the timetable on which we agreed."
"You are absolutely right, Mr Jonckheer, to call for the expansion of the range of financial products that are due to fall within the scope of this directive."
"With regard to tax havens, you will converse in the language of your country with your own government and you will discover that you have work to do."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for this debate."
"I believe that it is a sound contribution from the European Parliament to what we are expecting you henceforth to implement, Commissioner, Mr President of the Eurogroup, through a road map."
"Mr Juncker, you said to us: 'If only the groups would come to an agreement!'"
"Well, the groups are going to come to an agreement: tomorrow, they are going to vote for a paragraph 61(d) and 61(g), in which they demand exactly what you are calling on them to demand."
"Therefore, you can count on this tomorrow when you go and meet with the ministers for economic affairs and finance."
"You said to us: 'There is no report on divergence'."
"There may not be a very precise report, but one thing is for certain: convergence of economic situations within the Euro Zone, which we expected, has not taken place, and Mrs Ferreira has given you a concrete example of this."
"On the contradictions between the Member States, Mr President of the Eurogroup, again, I cannot share your view."
"I have no time for those who demand coordination when it suits them and who then reject it and advocate national sovereignty when it suits them better."
"Issues of economic policy coordination are issues of common interest, and the situation we are in today is unacceptable: on the US side, it has already been possible to implement two Paulson plans, while, in Europe, you tell us that we still need a few weeks to find something to say to the people of Europe, who are awaiting our responses."
"We all need to join forces, and the Commission has in its hands today the means with which to progress on the basis of the European Parliament's proposals."
"I hope that we will be heard and supported."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, I would like to start where the prime minister left off."
"I believe that the flexibility shown by the Euro Zone and the 27 Member States in recent weeks is a very good start."
"It now needs to be developed further, and I have no doubt that, if the experience you have both brought to bear here is also accepted by the Member States, we will be on the right track."
"I would like to thank everybody for their contributions."
"Mr Hoppenstedt quoted from the first debate on the euro, in which the euro was called a premature baby."
"Today, 10 years on, it has become a strapping young boy - the euro is a boy in my language, whereas the German mark was feminine - who got good marks all through primary school and is now going into secondary school."
"It remains to be seen whether he will continue to make it over the obstacles, but I am reasonably optimistic that he will succeed."
"When I hear from Mr Beazley that even the Conservatives in the United Kingdom are seriously considering joining the euro, that is quite a new perspective."
"All I can say to all that, of course, is that even the United Kingdom will not be able to join the euro for free: you will need to meet your obligations regarding the coordination and regulation of financial markets and comply with the necessary minimum harmonisation."
"In that sense, we are on the right track."
"I would like to thank the Commission, and particularly Mr Almunia, and the President of the Eurogroup for their excellent cooperation."
"We will take you at your word regarding your suggestions."
"We want to work with you."
"(Applause)"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday 18 November 2008 at 12 noon."
"Application of the principle of equal pay for men and women (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Bauer, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, with recommendations to the Commission on the application of the principle of equal pay for men and women."
"rapporteur. - (SK) The gender pay gap is nothing new."
"For more than fifty years there has been an article in the Treaty of Rome forbidding gender discrimination in levels of pay and since 1975 Directive 117 has been in force, which requires Member States to enforce the principle of equal pay for equal work."
"It is of course true that not all differences in pay result from discrimination."
"According to the law of large numbers, however, the persistent differences in gross hourly rates of pay are not explainable."
"Between 1995 and 2006, according to Eurostat, the differences based on hourly earnings fell from 17 to 15%, and this is at a time when the majority of university graduates are now women."
"The trend may be declining, but not in a straight line."
"According to a study from the Dublin Foundation in 2007 covering four countries in the European Union, the gap was actually widening."
"If the pay gap narrowed at the current pace and did not increase again from time to time, pay would perhaps equalise after seventy years."
"We can agree on the fact that the current legislation in this area is not very effective."
"The reasons for the pay gap are varied."
"They are of both a systemic and an individual nature."
"Sectoral, vertical and horizontal segregation, the classification of professions, the conditions for establishing a work-life balance and stereotypes all play a significant role in the persistence of the pay gap, which later carries over into a pensions gap and the final result is that poverty wears a female face, as we have been saying."
"The pay gap also has individual dimensions."
"According to a study from the Commission, these increase with age, period of employment and education."
"Moreover, the statistics show that there are minimal differences in the case of young people."
"The gap appears after the birth of the first child and the return of the woman from maternity leave."
"In relation to the demographic crisis now confronting us, this problem, besides being a major factor in economic competition, raises a profound moral problem which should also not be overlooked."
"The question today concerns what the European Parliament can do to resolve the situation."
"On the one hand we have a persistent problem and on the other hand we have some rather ineffective laws."
"At the same time, of course, we must not lose sight of the fact that the reasons for the pay gap lie far beyond the bounds of legislation."
"The European Parliament, however, has in its hands only one instrument - legislation."
"Everyone involved in this situation bears their own responsibility and ours is whether we can manage to send out a clear signal that we want better and more effective laws in the interests of establishing fairer conditions in the labour market."
"Member of the Commission. - (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission welcomes this own-initiative report on the principle of equal pay for men and women and I congratulate the rapporteur on the quality of her work."
"The Commission, like Parliament, considers the 15% pay gap between women and men in Europe today to be unacceptable."
"We must of course be careful and not lose sight of the fact that this indicator compares relative differences in the gross hourly earnings of women and men across the economy as a whole."
"It does not therefore measure just direct discrimination but is an indicator of all of the related factors and all of the disadvantages which women suffer from before they enter the labour market and over the entire course of their professional careers."
"The Commission Communication of July 2007 stated that Community laws were effective in eliminating direct discrimination - in other words in cases where the remuneration for the same work is lower for women than for their male colleagues."
"They were, however, less effective in ensuring adherence to the principle of equal pay for work of equal value."
"Based on a detailed analysis the Commission has concluded that it should be possible to consider amending Community law with the aim of ensuring above all that the systems for setting pay rates exclude both direct and indirect gender-based discrimination."
"The Commission announced that in 2008 it would be evaluating Community laws from the standpoint of their implications in respect of the pay gap and that it would be proposing necessary amendments."
"The detailed analysis mentioned earlier is currently under way and I cannot predict what the results will be."
"In order to ensure quality, the Commission is making use of external specialist consultants as well as the extensive and detailed expertise and knowledge of intra-state bodies concerned with gender equality."
"The preliminary results of this study will be discussed at a workshop in the first quarter of 2009, when all the interested parties should attend, including Member States, legal experts, intra-state bodies concerned with gender equality, social partners and civil society."
"Parliament's attitude in this process will be decisive."
"It is significant that one of the participating law creating bodies has expressed a clear opinion that the laws in question must be amended quickly."
"It is also important that the practical recommendations of Parliament regarding the amendments relate to the areas which the main interested parties have identified as problematic, among them are transparency of remuneration and work assessments and sanctions."
"In conclusion: we share Parliament's view that such a great difference in pay for women and men in Europe is unacceptable."
"The Commission considers that this is the right time to complete the analysis and the assessment and to plan the next steps, which will lead to more concrete results."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am truly proud of the work carried out in this Parliament and of its ability to make use of the already recognised powers to propose legislation."
"The report that we are about to vote on concerns a key issue, a fundamental principle of European law: the principle of equal pay for men and women in the workplace."
"Not only is it a fundamental principle, it is also the first, at least in order of time, among the principles of equality."
"We know that it was already included in the Treaty of Rome, we know that it has been applied since the very first judgments of the European Court of Justice, that it was already regulated by a directive dating back to 1975, and re-regulated when this directive was recast in 2006, that it is the subject of continual studies and research, as the Commissioner himself said, and of continual claims for its application."
"Why then do we return to look at it again in such breadth and depth today?"
"There are many reasons: firstly because we refuse to accept its widespread non-application, to which all the statistics bear witness, and secondly because we believe that the extreme injustice suffered by women in all countries of the European Union and in all professions, at all levels and in all sectors absolutely must be tackled, and it is in fact obvious that the instruments we possess will not suffice for this, otherwise after all this time we would surely have succeeded in reversing this trend."
"Finally, because we believe it is time to take the pay gap seriously and above all not to look on it as a mere accident in the working lives of women."
"What, then, are we asking for?"
"We are asking the Commission for a specific, pertinent directive on pay gaps in general, but we are not stopping there; we are not merely asking for a directive, we are sending the Commission precise recommendations."
"We have built a bridge to cross over to genuine change and we believe that this bridge can be solid if it rests on eight pillars."
"First and foremost, we want to lay down a definition of pay discrimination; it is not enough to look at gross hourly pay alone because that would indicate direct discrimination and such direct discrimination has in fact already been overcome."
"It is no accident then, if all the research looks at the whole picture, pointing towards part-time working, encouraging us to consider direct and indirect segregation, discrimination and horizontal and vertical segregation."
"We are calling for comparable, effective, consistent and complete data."
"All too often we encounter manipulated or hidden data, facilitated by systems for classifying personnel, from backward-looking working structures marked by stereotypes."
"We believe that equality organisations can play a key dual role in combating discrimination, by raising awareness and by providing training for the judiciary and for social partners."
"We aim to introduce specific penalties, bearing in mind, however, that preventive action and measures are also required; we need positive action and integration, therefore mainstreaming."
"I hope that this House will adopt the text in its entirety, because the more precise and detailed the work we submit to the Commission, the more we will gain in effective speed."
"That, in fact, is our hope: it is not enough to talk or write about equal pay, we want to make it a reality."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (SK) I would like to offer my frank congratulations to Mrs Bauer on the proposed text."
"As Mrs Bauer has said, the topic we are debating is as old as the Treaty of Rome."
"Little has changed in fifty years."
"The question of equal pay for equal work performed by women and men rears its head with remarkable regularity especially during election periods."
"If the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality proposes sanctions for companies which do not respect a basic principle of remuneration, objections are raised with reference to the principle of subsidiarity, as if this justified the inequality."
"Last week I took part in the ministerial conference in Lille."
"I appreciated the attempt of the French Presidency to debate this topic but there were very few constructive responses aimed at solutions from the Member States."
"The statistics show that inequality in women's pay appears mainly after the birth of the first child."
"The national and European policies aimed at achieving a balance between the responsibilities for the family and professional ambitions should not permit new differences to arise between employees who have family responsibilities and those who are unmarried or childless and who do not have such responsibilities."
"This is first and foremost a question of the social model we are aiming for."
"I propose that we establish a coalition with industrial firms."
"If the managers of these firms are not prepared to work in close partnership with us to promote equality of pay, our report will simply gather dust."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I am amazed that women are still so patient with us."
"We have been talking about pay inequality for 50 years, and nothing significant has changed."
"The numbers speak for themselves: 15% less for the same work."
"This deprives women of a fair wage, because, looked at the other way round, it means that women have to work one and a quarter times as long to earn the same money."
"Where do we stand in the European Union?"
"The Member States need to do more in this respect, and I am grateful to Mr Špidla for taking on board our proposals here in Parliament and for showing the will to take legislative action."
"Evidently there is no other option."
"In Germany, one of the largest Member States of the European Union, the pay differential in the private sector is 23%."
"That is unacceptable, and means that we are bringing up the rear of the EU."
"We know full well that France and Scandinavia have taken positive measures."
"That is what it is about."
"We call on the social partners to take action, and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament calls for transparency in businesses, so that bonuses can be seen clearly and be included in the official assessment, so that we can get a grip on it."
"Regular wage audits may reveal successes or failures in combating wage discrimination."
"In my view, a law for the private sector will be unavoidable in Germany."
"We must put more pressure on the Member States to introduce a statutory minimum wage, so that it can be taken for granted that women can earn a living wage, because that is the best safeguard against poverty in old age."
"I would, in any case, call on the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, in order to retain this clarity in Mrs Bauer's report, to withdraw its deleting amendments, which would further water down the report."
"Let us stick with the clear language it has at the moment."
"on behalf of ALDE Group. - (ET) Commissioner, President, colleagues."
"Rapporteur Mrs Bauer stated that poverty has a woman's face."
"I must also reiterate that even in 1957, Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome contained the principle that men and women should receive equal pay for equal work."
"Today however, in the year 2008, women in the European Union earn on average 15% less than men, and in my home country Estonia they earn as much as 25% less than men."
"The wage disparity significantly influences women's position in economic and social life, both during and after their active working lives."
"It also intensifies women's risk of poverty, especially in families with single parents."
"The wage disparity between men and women often leads to differences in men's and women's pensions."
"Single female pensioners often live in risk of poverty."
"As a result, I welcome the position proposed in the report, that is, that the European Commission should present a legislative proposal concerning the examination of current legislation concerning the principles of equal payment for men and women by 31 December 2009."
"We have passed too much legislation and waited too long, but the results are not very good."
"As time has shown, this problem cannot be solved with European Union legislation alone."
"One significant outlet for the solution of the problem would be for the topic to be prioritised in political action plans."
"Only an effective combination of policies that includes better and more effective legislation and designates the responsible party will make it possible to find a positive solution to this problem."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for pointing out very important aspects in the report, and thank you for your attention."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, it is indeed true that, 50 years after the Treaties of Rome were concluded, we have made little progress regarding equality for women in the labour market."
"The figures are alarming: 80% of part-time workers are women, and only 57% of women are in employment, compared with 72% of men."
"Wage inequality has also remained stable since 2003, and has only changed by 1% since 2000."
"These are alarming figures, which all of us here lament."
"We have also referred to the fact that women are doubly disadvantaged, because this wage inequality is translated into differences in pension rights and social standards, and we also have a tax and social system that continues to penalise women, in that, for example, unmarried couples and double-income families are still disadvantaged in many tax systems, such as in Germany."
"The Commission has stated that there will be legislative proposals, but why are they coming so late?"
"Why have so many years gone by, in this parliamentary term, without any proposals in this field?"
"We in Parliament have already called for proposals."
"With regard to quotas, we have said that there should be legal requirements."
"We also have Member States, such as Sweden, that have set objectives with a timeframe."
"Why do we not make use of the fact that we have these gender requirements to encourage the Member States to make efforts to resolve this shameful pay gap."
"In Germany, as has already been said, we are unfortunately third from bottom, with a shameful pay gap of 23%."
"We also need to make it clear that a statutory minimum wage will bring about changes particularly in sectors primarily employing women."
"However, we must also have the courage to make it clear ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) The devaluation of work by imposing low pay continues to be one of the ways most commonly used by capitalism to increase worker exploitation."
"This particularly affects female workers, which also implies a devaluation of motherhood."
"It is unacceptable that, more than 30 years after a directive on equal pay for men and women, levels of discrimination remain high, particularly indirect discrimination resulting from a lack of job stability, which especially affects women and young people."
"In some countries, such as Portugal, where unemployment is very high, average pay differences between men and women have increased, exceeding 25% in the private sector and meaning that poverty still has a female face, including among the retired."
"The European Commission and the Member States must adopt the measures needed to enhance the value of work, overcome pay differences and eliminate stereotypes linked to the jobs and sectors which always discriminate against women."
"Those professions and sectors in which women predominate, such as the retail and services sectors and some industries, need to be valued more highly."
"Experience shows that worsening unemployment weakens women's rights, intensifies worker exploitation and increases discrimination."
"We therefore insist on a new policy which gives priority to employment with rights, the fight against discrimination, and the protection of motherhood and fatherhood as fundamental social values."
"We therefore support this report, to which we have suggested some amendments, pointing out that collective negotiation and bargaining have an important role to play in combating discrimination against women, not least as regards access to employment, pay, working conditions, career advancement and vocational training."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, the draft report on equal pay for women and men contains some legitimate facts on equal pay for work of equal value."
"Equality in remuneration is necessary, as is proper payment in jobs that are dominated by women because of their psychological and physical predispositions."
"The effect of regulations that have been written down in multiple pointlessly duplicated documents definitely depends on the effective implementation of the law in individual Member States."
"However, implementation may be quite difficult with regard to the predominant private sector, where the majority of managers look above all at the profits of their companies and have no respect for ethical and moral principles, at the same time preventing the action of trade unions which would protect workers and take part in pay negotiations."
"The problem of unequal remuneration is therefore an element of discrimination against the weak."
"We do not need academics and experts to realise that discrimination is above all the result of left-wing materialist ideology, the lack of implementation of ethical principles, lack of personal development, selfishness, greed, taking advantage of the weak and poor, and not just in terms of salaries, but in terms of the growing practice in the European Union, which goes down even to the poorest and weakest states, of discrimination against Catholics and persons with views differing from those imposed by the political correctness which is required here."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that women are still paid less than men for the same work is a sad chapter in our European community."
"Really, it is quite incomprehensible, because in law the situation is absolutely clear."
"Since the Community was established in 1957 - as has already been said several times - the principle has been enshrined in the Treaties of Rome as a directly applicable right."
"In other words, any woman could go directly to the European Court of Justice to enforce this right: the EU provides no stronger legal protection."
"Nevertheless, we have missed the target on this principle by an average of 20%."
"It is therefore absolutely vital - as the Commission is proposing here - to enforce this principle by means of secondary legislation."
"That being said, this situation once again shows us that there is a difference between the law and real life."
"People who depend on their job and their salary - many of whom are women - often simply do not dare to demand their basic rights, for fear of being thrown out."
"We therefore cannot simply once again call for company responsibility, based on the fact that decency dictates that women should not be treated worse than men in terms of pay."
"However, he that will not hear must feel."
"I am therefore in favour of severe and consistent sanctions for those who break the law."
"It is up to the Member States, in particular, finally to take this seriously and to expose those companies that contravene this principle and to punish them, for example using procurement law."
"I have one small criticism for the Commission: it is possible that the process has been rather too lax in this case, and that you paid too much attention to business."
"I congratulate Mrs Bauer on her report."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, I too should like to congratulate the rapporteur on her work."
"This is a highly relevant report given that the pay gap in the European Union is a reality that should be eliminated."
"It is unacceptable that women earn 15% less than men and that, in the private sector, this difference can be up to 25%."
"This pay gap is difficult to fight as it stems from indirect discrimination: the most precarious work and the majority of part-time jobs are carried out by women."
"What should we do?"
"Basically, we must promote equal opportunity policies aimed at reconciling work and family life, and also policies aimed at cutting the number of and increasing the pay for the lowest-paid jobs, which are mainly held by women."
"Therefore, among the report's recommendations - all of which are very important - I should like to highlight that of amending the Directive on the implementation of the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation by including references to the pay gap, and also that of amending the framework agreement on part-time work, which is where the differences are greatest."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say to Commissioner Špidla that, in addition to considering the excellent proposals in Mrs Bauer's report, if we can legislate at EU level against pay discrimination, I believe that would be right to include discrimination relating to pensions."
"Although this may be a more subtle, indirect form of discrimination, it is particularly heinous in a country such as Italy."
"It also concerns discrimination in terms of retirement age, an issue that the European Commission has already looked at, and which I believe must be acknowledged."
"Back in 2004, the European Commission stressed to the Italian Government that it was unacceptable to have different retirement ages: 60 for women and 65 for men, which we can consider the more common legal age."
"As the radicals, we have, together with Emma Bonino, sought in every way possible to stress to public opinion, to the government, to the opposition and to the parties, that this structure must be removed."
"It has not been done."
"Thanks to the European Commission, on 13 November the Court of Justice at last ruled that this discrimination is illegitimate and violates the Treaties and Community laws."
"The most serious thing is the line of reasoning taken by Italy in defence of this discrimination."
"Italy claimed that it was justified by its objective of eliminating the existing socio-cultural discrimination against women - in other words, discrimination on the labour market does exist."
"In order to remedy this form of discrimination, another is created, by forcing women to retire before men."
"In my view, this measure in particular also requires intervention, because it could be eliminated at European level."
"(SV) Mr President, I wish firstly to thank Mrs Bauer for an important and constructive report, which I fully support."
"Secondly, a fellow Member recently referred to women as being weak."
"I would like to say that women are not weak."
"However, it is the patriarchal structures in society that make women weak."
"The EU Equal Pay Directive has been in existence for 30 years."
"Despite this, women are still not worth as much as men - either when it comes to pay or influence - both in society and in the workplace."
"Despite the fact that women generally have a higher education, they earn on average 15% less than men for the same or similar work."
"It is thus clear that improving the existing legislation will not be sufficient to solve the pay discrimination."
"The differences in pay between women and men is ultimately yet another indication of the continued discrimination against women in all of the different areas."
"It is not enough that we have lower pay for equal work, we are also very often forced to take atypical work or part-time work etc. This pay discrimination haunts women right through their lives, as we also often get poorer pension terms and poorer conditions when we get older."
"It is high time that we took action together to stop this discrimination against women."
"Mr President, there is sadly a fundamental misunderstanding by most politicians as to the reasons why there are differentials between the genders in pay."
"The basic premise, erroneous though it is, perpetuates the myth that employment is a demand-led, employer-governed phenomenon."
"It is no such thing."
"Those who argue that all women should be paid the same as men for perceived similarities in the job description miss the point entirely that no individual is an economic unit."
"In spite of already overburdening employment legislation, usually drafted by people with little or no business experience, pay differentials continue for one simple reason: employment is about demand and supply; it is about lifestyle choices; it is often based on priorities, early retirement goals, a desire to live in certain parts of a country or town, pressure of hobbies or sport, or one of those offspring."
"Employer and employee strike a mutual bargain in the same way as the buyer and seller of any commodity."
"The UK Equality and Human Rights Commission employs substantially more women than men, and the average pay for their men is higher than for their women."
"I agree that past legislation has had a limited impact on these dynamics."
"Yes, you might as well legislate against a ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker.)"
"- (SK) Thank you Mr President, Commissioner."
"I am delighted that this 'women's' debate is under your chairmanship."
"I appreciate the efforts of the rapporteur, Edit Bauer, to find a balanced approach towards formulating recommendations for the Commission and improving the framework of EU laws, particularly their effective enforcement."
"As a result of varying transpositions, implementations and interpretations at an intra-state level, the directive setting out the principle of equal pay for men and women has failed to eliminate the gender pay gap, which is connected mainly with levels of professional segregation."
"I appreciate the fact that the rapporteur has emphasised in her report that motherhood should not disadvantage women who have decided to interrupt professional careers to look after their children."
"In all Member States parents should, for a minimum period of one year after the birth of a child, receive support at the level of their net income prior to the start of maternity leave and at the same time these arrangements should be linked into a system of pay according to which the number of years worked are taken into account when setting pay rates."
"Motherhood should bring advantages to women, not disadvantages."
"Education is equally important as it can contribute towards eliminating gender stereotypes and improving the remuneration of the few paid positions and posts which remain unoccupied by women."
"The Member States must implement a consistent information campaign aimed at raising awareness among employers and employees of the existing or potential differences in pay on the labour market in the EU."
"At the same time, they must be informed about the essential measures that have been passed with the aim of ensuring that employers are penalised for breaching the principle of equal pay for equal work."
"Thanks to the European Parliament's recommendation in this report, for which I congratulate the rapporteur Mrs Edit Bauer, I believe that the European Commission, in cooperation with the European Parliament and the Member States, will draw up laws that will indeed ensure equal pay for men and women."
"(RO) Fellow Members, this report is perhaps the most serious document we have drafted concerning the pay gap."
"In particular, the recommendations accompanying it represent a step forward in terms of the principle of equal pay for work of equal value finally being applied."
"I must congratulate those who contributed to the report."
"Until now, work has been evaluated on the basis of tradition and the ability to negotiate."
"When I talk about negotiating, I am thinking of the involvement of powerful trade-unions capable of making governments and employers accept proper wages."
"Both these criteria have put women at a disadvantage."
"We need a non-discriminatory system of evaluating work and a new way of classifying professions."
"We call on Member States and the Commission to finally embark on the path of adopting specific measures in favour of gender equality."
"We hope that they will make this public by supporting the clause which is the most favourable to women in Europe at the end of this month in Paris."
"Let us not have any illusions however."
"Even when the new system has been devised and implemented, it would only refer to paid work."
"Work carried out at home and in the black economy will continue to be performed, especially by women, without any pay gap as they do not even receive a salary for this work."
"- (CS) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I consider the report of Edit Bauer to be a great success."
"Inequality in the pay of men and women is one of most stubborn forms of discrimination against women."
"As Mrs Bauer said, there is a lack of decent statistics on workplaces at both a national and an EU level."
"I have addressed this issue myself in a number of the books and articles I have published over recent years."
"Lower pay for women performing the same work and having the same qualifications and productivity is unfortunately caused by profound stereotypical perceptions on who should be the family breadwinner."
"This duty is traditionally assigned to men and until now all employment structures, whether in the private or public sector, have more or less connived with it."
"There is a deeply-rooted view that a man supports from his wages not only himself but also his family, while a woman's pay is merely some sort of added extra for the family budget."
"Incredible though it may seem, this illusion is so firmly entrenched that even with the fulfilment of equal rights in the workplace we cannot rely on cultural enlightenment, but instead we must unfortunately find ways to enforce equality through legislation."
"I am therefore very much in favour of the idea that Article 29 of Directive 2006/54 should be extended to include precise instructions on the application of principles of equality."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, the report by Mrs Bauer does not need any additional comment on our part in order to show the path which needs to be followed to abolish a phenomenon of which society should be ashamed and which creates a reproduction cycle of injustice, with children in a family seeing their mother doing the same job as their father and being paid less and female colleagues seeing their male colleagues working like them and being paid less."
"Thus society tolerates this phenomenon and reproduces it, because women should have the legislative means which will allow them to correct their circumstances as and when necessary, and the powers of state should introduce appropriate measures which take account of periods devoted to family life, periods of unemployment and periods of illness and which provide fair taxation in order to compensate for women's unequal pay for their work, which should be judged not only by the time spent working, but also by the quality and additional elements that a women brings to her work."
"I repeat, Commissioner, the call made by Mr Cappato for you to review your stand as a Commission on the disputes which some Member States had on the retirement age for men and women and the country which had these disputes and was taken to the European Court of Justice."
"These disputes were corrective disputes for all women, regardless of whether or not they were mothers, and of course for mothers it is even more important to take account of the overall time, especially as you advocate an overall life cycle when calculating time at work."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(PL) Mr President, in the European Union, women earn an average of 15 to 25% less than men."
"In addition, the system of payment which takes into consideration years of service in determining pay levels is unfavourable for women, who often have to interrupt their careers for family reasons."
"Bringing up children, changes of job or less working time puts women in a situation of constant structural delay."
"The concept of equal payment for equal work cannot be distorted by a stereotypical approach to gender and social roles, which have previously significantly affected people's choices of profession and education, while maternity leave or family career breaks cannot be grounds for discriminating against women on the employment market."
"The Directive on implementing equal opportunities and equal treatment of women and men in the area of employment and work is an irrevocable element of the acquis communautaire, and the Member States must implement it as soon as possible."
"The aim of reducing the pay gap must be fully implemented in employment regulations, and regular audits on equal pay and the threat of sanctions should put an end to all kinds of discrimination, particularly gender discrimination."
"(NL) Mr President, I am grateful to Mrs Bauer for her excellent report."
"It beggars belief that today, we are discussing a topic that has been on the agenda since 1957, no less, when the equal treatment of men and women, equal pay for men and women were anchored in the Treaties."
"We have had European rules and laws for 30 years."
"We have a 2006-2010 road map from the European Commission, and one of the key objectives, which is also included in the Lisbon Strategy, is to narrow the wage gap between men and women."
"Despite this, the wage gap is not getting smaller."
"In fact, last Saturday, I read in The Times that the difference in wages between men and women in the United Kingdom has increased to 21.7% in the private sector and to 13.8% in the public sector."
"There is no sign of improvement - take my own country, for example - in other Member States either."
"The gender report for the Netherlands from the World Economic Forum shows that the Netherlands is only ranked 88th on the list of equal pay for equal work."
"Action is therefore called for."
"On Friday, the ministers from France, the Czech Republic and Sweden adopted a plan of action."
"How many more plans of action do we need though?"
"Mrs Bauer makes a large number of recommendations in the resolution that she submitted, which is great, but there are two priorities in my view."
"First of all, we must ensure that equal treatment is applied, and much stricter controls should be put in place in this respect - equal pay for men and women on which all our social security systems are based."
"Secondly - and I really believe that this should be brought to your attention - there is the pension gap between men and women."
"We are faced with an ageing population, and if women do not have a pension, then we have a deeply sad situation on our hands."
"That is what we need to focus on in future."
"-(BG) I welcome the discussion on this report."
"That inequalities in pay between men and women persist is unacceptable."
"However, we should not limit our discussion to equal pay for equal work."
"We need to take a broader perspective."
"The individual nature of work lies at the basis of all activity, and it is important to find an objective way of assessing its value, with clear rules, criteria and indicators which will achieve greater objectivity, and eliminate discrimination through clear legislative measures."
"An important instrument is to evaluate occupations and jobs and to assess their price."
"The low financial status of some occupations makes them unattractive so that men generally avoid them and women take them."
"Improving this situation would have a positive impact on improving the economic independence of women."
"The low financial status of, for example, the services provided by nurses or teachers, is not acceptable, because it does not at all correspond to their importance in the development of society."
"This is an area where the Commission and the Member States also have their obligations."
"(SL) Ladies and gentlemen."
"I would like to begin by saying that I for one find it quite unacceptable that women earn on average 15% less than men and that in the private sector the differential is as great as 25%."
"Let me stress in this respect that in my own country, Slovenia, women do not lag behind men in terms of education, so action needs to be taken."
"Many people probably question why it is necessary to take action at a European level and why the solution to this problem cannot be left to the Member States."
"One of the reasons is that it is taking too long for these differences to reduce and another reason is that in the majority of Member States there are too few women involved in politics for proper attention to be given to gender-related problems."
"A minority is only in a position to highlight its problems in a credible manner if, in a particular institution, such as a parliament or a government, it makes up at least 30% of the total numbers."
"And there are a large number of European countries which do not have a 30% representation of women in politics."
"The average proportion of women in the governments of the Member States and in their parliaments is less than 30%."
"Our representation in the European parliament is 31%, which is just a little higher than the critical mass we need to highlight gender-related problems effectively."
"This is why we have to do so from here."
"Another question I have asked myself is whether the proposed measures are too revolutionary and whether they contravene the principle of subsidiarity."
"Here I agree with the rapporteur when she says that the legislation is not effective enough and that it could and should be strengthened."
"Our proposals must be bold and must represent a valid starting-point for the shaping of real policies."
"I support her proposal that the Commission should prepare a new legislative proposal regarding the existing laws on equal pay for men and women by no later than 31 December next year and I congratulate her on a well-prepared report."
"(ES) Mr President, two months ago, here in this House, we debated the annual report on equality between women and men."
"One of the most worrying aspects highlighted in that debate is now the subject of today's debate: the difference in pay between men and women."
"It is worrying that, since 2003, we have not managed to reduce this 15% pay gap."
"This means that a woman has to work 52 days more in a year than a man to receive the same pay."
"This is a wholly unacceptable situation in the European Union and we must therefore, without any shadow of a doubt, adopt both stronger legislation and stronger agreements with employers to try and eliminate this pay gap."
"However, we will also shortly be looking at another questionable issue in this respect."
"Next month we will be discussing the Working Time Directive, which may also prove to be a worrying factor in terms of reconciling women's family and working lives."
"This is unquestionably a very sensitive issue in relation to work."
"We are therefore also expectant in this regard."
"(BG) My congratulations to Edit Bauer on the excellent work she has done on the recommendations on equal payment between men and women."
"I know that she has put a great deal of effort into drafting a document that takes as much account as possible of the real situation, and I hope that the recommendations contained in it will be put into practice."
"In my country, Bulgaria, the pay gap between men and women is between 25% and 30%, and while the overall picture in the European Union shows a lower differential, the fact remains that women are paid less than men."
"Why is this?"
"One of the factors is the pay structure of some occupations with a high proportion of female workers."
"Another cause is rooted in the fact that nobody feels responsible for the situation, and therefore nobody feels responsible for solving it."
"The current deeply ingrained stereotypes and prejudices on how labour is distributed between the genders not only hinder, but are often used as an excuse to ignore the problems."
"What can we do in this situation?"
"In the first place, as the report states, a mandatory condition is that the Member States must conform with current legislation."
"State policies must encourage the implementation of equal rights and equal pay."
"Secondly, transparency in evaluating work and setting pay rates must become an integral, rather than a formal, aspect of work in companies."
"And finally, encouraging in-house dialogue and good communications between management and the workforce, particularly in small and medium-sized enterprises, must become part of a truly new culture in individual European societies and Europe as a whole."
"I would like to congratulate Mrs Bauer once again on her skilful presentation of the problems and the solutions she has outlined. Thank you for your attention."
"Mr President, I would like to thank you for this debate."
"I would like to raise one issue, and perhaps the Commission could address this."
"We are speaking about equal pay for equal work, and we all want and desire that to happen."
"What is the Commission's view of the current job situation?"
"I have a concern that, with so many jobs being lost in countries in the European Union, this issue could get worse rather than better because of people's desire to earn money, even if it is less than they are truly worth."
"I would like some comments from the Commission on that."
"I would like to raise an issue of discrimination which certainly exists for men and women: public sector versus private sector workers where there are very different terms and conditions."
"They enjoy different pension rights and security issues and sometimes the inequalities are not just gender-based, although I appreciate that this report is about gender, and certainly my concern is that in the current situation this problem may get worse, rather than better."
"(RO) Mr President, Commissioner, there is a difference of 15% between salaries received by women and those received by men for carrying out the same work."
"In the case of women managers, this figure reaches 20% and even 30%, when it comes to managers of SMEs."
"28% of female researchers in industry and only 34% of women in industry have more than one child."
"Commissioner, while women are on maternity leave, the average annual percentage used to calculate the benefit relating to these periods produces a financial loss, in spite of the importance of this period in terms of social welfare."
"Mothers must not be penalised for giving birth and looking after their children during the first few months of their life."
"I also believe that maternity benefit must be paid not only to mothers who have worked during the last 12 months prior to the birth."
"I do not think that it is a child's fault if their mother has worked or not during this period."
"Above all, I believe that there must be no discrimination among children right from birth."
"(LT) I can only repeat that as far back as 1974 documents were adopted obliging Member States to pay men and women equally for the same job."
"However, although more than 30 years have passed, the situation has not changed."
"Furthermore, in my country, Lithuania, reform of the pension system has begun."
"Part of the funds paid by workers into the state pension insurance fund is being transferred to private pension saving funds."
"In a few years it became clear that in order to receive an equal annuity from these funds women must pay 35% more contributions than men, as they live longer."
"Moreover, leaving these funds is like leaving slavery, it is impossible - this in itself is an infringement of human rights and freedom of choice."
"Apart from Lithuania only Bulgaria uses the same gender system."
"Having investigated such cases, I invite the Commission to take the initiative and propose decisions."
"- (CS) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that women in the European Union must work almost two months longer in order to earn as much as men is more than alarming."
"Even though Europe is dying, all we can do here is to state that wage discrimination against women and families with children persists up to the rate of 25%, although women have now surpassed men in educational attainment at a ratio of 60:40."
"Mrs Bauer has noted that in the so-called male professions the work of women is routinely undervalued for no objective reason."
"However, if the reason is the lack of working years that women devote instead to caring for their families, we must give the matter some serious thought."
"Families should not be a handicap."
"Mrs Bauer is making waves and her arguments for starting on a review of anti-discrimination laws are convincing."
"I also support the proposal that access to public tenders and projects financed from EU funds should be made conditional upon a given company being able to demonstrate an anti-discriminatory pay policy."
"I believe this is the way to change the gender stereotypes of employers, especially in the private sector."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for a highly professional report."
"(PL) Mr President, in discussing this important issue, it is typical that there have been only two male interventions on this issue."
"In the case of Mr Bloom, his intervention was so male, that it was difficult to agree with."
"However, we are considering a very important report."
"We are considering a report from which we know that work has great value, that it must be adequately paid, and this payment has to be differentiated on the basis of criteria such as the nature of the work, the efficiency with which it is done, ability to create added value, and not on gender criteria."
"But change is coming in the Member States as well."
"Allow me to mention my own country, where we have only very recently introduced gender equality which allows a father to take paternity leave, which shows that we are converging and we are on the right track."
"(PL) Mr President, women do not get equal pay for equal work."
"However, their pay is also lower because they work in lower-paid sectors, and in temporary, lower-quality forms of work."
"A result of pay inequality is also inequality in social provision, particularly as regards pensions."
"On the one hand they get paid less for the same job, and on the other their shorter period of employment because of the responsibilities of motherhood are both reasons for the poverty of women when they reach retirement age."
"That is why unequal pay hits women twice as hard."
"I would like to point out that the law usually forbids discrimination, while practice shows continued discrimination."
"The main question is therefore enforcing the law in practice."
"(PL) There are no grounds for discriminating against women in this respect, and it is not a matter which is open to discussion."
"Three brief questions: on economic grounds, pay should correspond to the effects of work on the basis of the service provided, regardless of who does it."
"The second point: Europe is getting older, like it or not."
"Perhaps we should consider a bonus for women who are doing the same work as men, but at the same time decide to have children and bring them up, thereby keeping up the population."
"Point three: a good example in this area are academic institutions, or at least those which I know, where the opportunities given are equal, and payment is simply results-based."
"Perhaps this model could be extended to other sectors."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to join those male voices, which unfortunately have been so few in the present debate, and which recognise that public debate and putting such an important matter as pay and equal pay for women and men on the political agenda is one of the most important matters guaranteed and rights guaranteed in national and European law."
"I can say that like everyone else, I do not agree that payment rates should depend on gender."
"It may depend on education and experience, but under no circumstances on gender."
"It is my impression that national and EU law is quite well developed on this point, and in many cases it may be said to be very good, but what worries me is that it is not enforced, it is not put into practice because there is no tradition of doing so."
"The European Court of Justice has frequently reiterated that it is not being enforced."
"The question therefore is not to make more laws, but to ensure they are observed."
"- (FR) Mr President, the pay gaps denounced in this House are all the more difficult to understand given that the young women of today boast higher success rates at school than men in all the Member States and that they account for the highest proportion of graduates."
"I should like all the same to emphasise that we have had a solid legislative base since 1975 and especially since 2006, and that the latter enabled me, in the years 1975 to 1980, to encourage women in my country who were being discriminated against to start legal proceedings against their employers, in particular from the public sector."
"Hundreds of millions of Luxembourg francs, the currency in use at that time, were paid out to them retrospectively."
"First and foremost, then, we should make use of the sound legislation in force, even if it means improving it by endorsing our rapporteur's excellent recommendations."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my thanks for a debate which has tackled an issue that is simply unacceptable."
"There are no real or defensible reasons why a situation should persist under which women continue to receive less pay on average than men."
"You have mentioned in the debate a very wide range of approaches and a very wide range of issues that are linked to the pay gap and I think it was clear from the debate what a complex question this is."
"I would like to state that this question is on the European political agenda because the Commission has just addressed the matter in a number of its documents and also in view of the fact that the Commission is drawing up a specific potential revision of current laws, and of course also because Parliament has taken up the topic thanks to the report of Mrs Bauer, for which I would once again like to express my appreciation."
"Also, however, thanks to the fact that in Lille the troika of the three succeeding presidencies did not just announce but actually adopted an action plan which establishes this issue on the agenda of three consecutive presidencies, in other words those of France, the Czech Republic and Sweden."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to state that the debate in Lille, in addition to the action plan, presented the individual Member States with a set of concrete actions in this area, some of which, I must say, were very radical and in my view capable of producing results."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like once again to thank you for allowing me to speak and for the debate and I would like to say that the Commission is fully prepared to cooperate with Parliament in this matter in order to bring about the gradual elimination of this unjust and untenable state of affairs."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for a very interesting debate."
"Allow me to make a few remarks."
"First, legislation alone will not solve this problem."
"As has already been said, there are many reasons for legislating but it is not possible, of course, to solve some economic problems through legislation."
"I also agree that we should beyond any doubt make better use of the existing legislation."
"The long history of this legislation clearly suggests, however, that it is not very effective in its current form."
"We have no other instruments available to us apart from legislation."
"This means that our task is clearly to help in ensuring that the existing legislation contributes towards solving this long-standing problem in such a way that the labour market becomes a fairer place."
"I would like to conclude with one final remark."
"Many fellow Members have emphasised that the continuation of such differences is unacceptable from the perspective of equal rights."
"I would like, however, to emphasise another angle, another aspect to this issue, and that is the requirements applying to economic competition, because equal pay for equal work is enshrined in the Treaty of Rome as a requirement of fair economic competition."
"I feel that this is the response to give to those colleagues who have been emphasising that the labour market operates under a different set of requirements."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday 18 November 2008."
"Written statements (Article 142)"
"in writing. - The legal framework within the EU relative to equal pay for men and women is widespread."
"The problem lies with enforcement."
"It is agreed that discrimination in pay based on gender is diminished by existing legislation."
"Indirect discrimination is still an issue."
"Mostly, this results from economic segregation and in such cases existing legislation is limited in application."
"Evaluation of the legislative framework shows some differences in legislation concerning Gender Pay Gap (GPG)."
"Although operative legislation stricto senso has the same scope, existing directives show fundamental differences:"
"a) in 1975 the GPG was considered to be an economic competition issue, an ''integral part of the establishment and functioning of the common market', while"
"b) the 2006 Directive relies on the principle of 'equal treatment and equal opportunity'."
"The data show a persistent gap between pay for men and women."
"The latest figures show a 15% difference between the gross hourly pay of men and women."
"In the private sector this is more prevalent and the rate rises to 25%."
"The GPG used to be explained by differences on an individual basis, such as age, education and experience."
"Evidence suggests, however, that these differences play a relatively minor part in the persistence of GPG."
"The principle of equality of opportunities and equality of treatment between women and men is a topic with specific connotations in the Eastern Europe countries which have recently been integrated."
"The benchmarks used for professional performance essentially continue to be predominantly male-based."
"This outlook cannot be changed easily in the former Communist zone where, as a result of the propaganda efforts of the regime, the collective mentality has adopted a totally artificial model of equality."
"The lack of consistency with the primitive equality promoted by the propaganda of the Communist regimes has succeeded in undermining current efforts to promote equal treatment between women and men."
"Based on these premises, I feel that every effort made nowadays to promote the principle of gender equality needs to focus on a broader educational aspect, offering the Community's citizens realistic system models for non-discriminatory treatment."
"In order to implement this principle throughout the Community, we need Europe's institutions to propose more than organising a European Equal Pay Day."
"It is no coincidence that one of the main elements of the 2006-2010 roadmap for equality between men and women is the effort to eliminate the pay gap between the sexes."
"The problem of the pay gap between men and women goes beyond the fundamental principle of equal pay for equal work."
"The difference in wages mirrors the serious inequalities that can be observed on the labour market and that affect women most of all."
"This indicates Europe's serious democratic deficit."
"Solving the problem requires complex arrangements, which cannot be made without political determination."
"Existing legislation needs to be perfected, and its practical application promoted and monitored."
"The true principle of equal opportunity can only be put into practice if each Member State shows decisive political will, and takes constructive steps to end the pay gap between the sexes."
"It is unacceptable that a good number of Member States should still fail to devote special attention to the pay gap between the sexes, be that in public debates or in political programmes."
"Launching a social debate and organising educational campaigns are likewise indispensable."
"I urge that a package of political measures be prepared in order to remedy this problem, which in any case must take into account national differences and tried and true practices."
"We need more precise and detailed statistical information in order to ascertain the true state of affairs and closely monitor developments."
"The reasons for wage differences need to be examined, and the information thus gained should be used to shed light on discrimination and to remedy and prevent it in the future."
"in writing. - I would like to congratulate Ms Bauer for her hard work in contributing vital recommendations to the European Commission on the application of the equal pay principle."
"The pay gap has a major impact on the status of women in economic and social life and constitutes an obstacle to equal economic independence."
"There are several areas where women are affected by the gap in pay based solely on gender in Europe."
"Women encounter differences in their hourly pay in new and old Member States alike."
"Differences can be seen in the income distribution between men and women: 20 percent of women, compared to 40 percent of men in Europe, receive a similar income distribution in the top-range of salaries."
"Another glaring pay inequality lies in sectoral gender segregation, as half of jobs in three sectors are male dominated."
"Finally, the over-representation of women - 30 percent - in part-time positions affects labour market contributions."
"These figures are even worse when it comes to women with certain ethnic origins, such as the Roma."
"While the EU's legal framework regarding equal pay is very extensive, in the European Union women are still paid less then men - even those with similar skills and education - which proves that improving legislation by strengthening its effectiveness is the main goal to achieve."
"in writing. -The gender pay gap is alarmingly high in the EU."
"There have been some initiatives to decrease it, but the rate at which the gap is shrinking is much too slow."
"Parliament has repeatedly asked the Commission to take initiatives."
"The report on the gender pay gap outlines many specific ways the EU can tackle this problem."
"It is important to define concepts like 'pension gap', 'direct pay discrimination', and 'indirect pay discrimination' more clearly and in more detail so that we have better tools for dealing with the gender pay gap."
"We currently are lacking the accurate statistical data that we need to assess the situation."
"Member States and the Commission should improve their statistics, but so should private companies."
"Companies should be required to perform regular pay audits and make the results widely available."
"Another way we can help to solve is problem is to add a specific reference to pay discrimination in Article 26 (Prevention of discrimination) of Directive 2006/54/EC."
"It is simply unacceptable that women in the EU earn on average 15% less than men."
"As a governing body, we must do something to correct this injustice."
"General arrangements for excise duty (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Astrid Lulling on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the proposal for a Council directive concerning the general arrangements for excise duty - C6-0099/2008 -."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this proposal for a directive, which is meant to replace the 1992 Directive, is above all intended to make the introduction, on 1 April 2009, of the electronic supervision of the movements of goods subject to excise duty - the famous Excise Movement and Control System - compliant with the legislation."
"It is therefore a technical measure, but at the same time a step in the direction of less red tape, less fraud and more speed."
"Apart from a few amendments, which I have tabled and which have been accepted, to guarantee more consistency in the operation of the new system, we are in agreement concerning this strand of the European Commission's proposal."
"In its view, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy has made the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs's report far more cumbersome by copying a large number of amendments negotiated within the Council."
"In fact, this move achieves nothing substantial as far as we are concerned."
"The political debate lies elsewhere."
"It relates to the conditions of movement and taxation of goods subject to excise duty, in particular alcohol and tobacco purchased by private consumers."
"The European Commission has had the wisdom, for once, to submit a text that is based on recent case-law, that is to say, case-law that permits Europeans to transport goods subject to excise duty that are purchased in a Member State other than that of their residence, without quantitative restrictions, provided that the goods have been purchased for private consumption purposes."
"My proposal and my position as rapporteur are unequivocal: I am wholly in favour of this Commission text, which is clear, precise and based on the principles governing the internal market."
"However, some of my fellow Members, socialists and liberals in particular, have felt obliged to table amendments that would re-instate tax frontiers such as those that existed before 1992, by re-introducing indicative limits."
"The fact is, indicative limits in theory mean quantitative restrictions in reality."
"As a result of the absences, and taking advantage of the lack of knowledge of certain fellow Members, they have obtained a majority in committee."
"My political group has taken the unanimous decision to table amendments intended to re-establish the European Commission's initial proposals."
"It is only fair that we do so."
"We do not want a return to borders and to practices such as those that existed before the single market."
"On the contrary, we want solutions that are adapted to our time, including with regard to electronic trade."
"Our message to the Council must be clear: do not propose to our fellow citizens that we go back on the acquis communautaire."
"What seems just as incomprehensible is the attitude of certain socialists and liberals who want to do away with the last remaining duty-free shops at the land borders of the European Union."
"The Commission wants this too, unfortunately, even though these shops in no way disrupt the single market."
"Their closure would lead, however, to thousands of job losses, in particular at Greece's borders."
"We have really picked a good time to propose such things!"
"There is worse to come, however."
"The circumstantial majority in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has even rejected my amendment, which was to keep the duty-free purchase option for travellers whose final destination is a third country, in order to take account of the situation concerning connecting flights."
"Why, if I am travelling to Singapore from Luxembourg, via Frankfurt or Paris, can I not buy duty-free in the airport of departure?"
"I must say that this is rather depressing, Mr President;"
"I would inform you that I have six minutes, but I will not use them all."
"I have confidence, now, in the good sense of most of our fellow Members - it is a pity that they are not here - to adopt a solution that is also in the interests of consumers and that does not re-invent new tax and bureaucratic barriers."
"Those who vote against our reasonable proposals tomorrow will have difficulty in explaining this backward step to our compatriots."
"They can count on me and on my colleagues to denounce their rearguard views."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me first of all thank the rapporteur Mrs Lulling and the ECON Committee for the report and the speedy treatment of this proposal, which provides the legal basis for the computerisation of excise procedures as of April 2010."
"Member States as well as the Commission have invested a lot in the Excise Movement Control System (EMCS)."
"It replaces the current paper-based movement monitoring system with a new computerised one."
"The greater use of trans-European networks for communication between traders and excise authorities, and between excise authorities themselves, will reduce the time needed for the discharge of tax liability for excise movements."
"This will provide excise authorities with an essential tool to effectively address fraud and hence protect legitimate trade."
"At the same time, it will improve the services to taxpayers who will benefit from improved legal certainty and real-time information exchanges with their tax authorities."
"Apart from these new provisions, the proposed Directive will entirely recast and update the old Horizontal Excise Directive of 1992."
"It will simplify and modernise the excise procedures, with the aim of reducing excise obligations for traders, in particular for traders carrying out cross-border business, without compromising excise controls."
"Clearly, as the Commission had proposed a new and up-to-date legal framework for excise, some of the more political issues included in this legislation had to be re-discussed."
"This concerns the issues of land-based tax-free shops, the position of transit airports and the maintaining of guide levels to distinguish commercial excise movements from movements of excise goods for personal use."
"Many amendments proposed by Parliament already conform to the text of the general orientation agreed in the ECOFIN meeting of 4 November 2008, or go in the same direction."
"They are also acceptable to the Commission."
"I am therefore confident that the proposal can be adopted soon and that the timely application of the EMCS is ensured."
"I am going to use the first of my two minutes to quickly highlight the main principles of my opinion, which was unanimously adopted in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy."
"These principles are as follows: increase efficiency in production and distribution of goods and services, mainly by reducing red tape; improve the existing rules and adapt them to the current circumstances, notably to facilitate risk-based monitoring procedures for national administrations; simplify procedures and increase transparency for intra-Community trade, by increasing legal certainty and fair rules; finally, the system for the collection and reimbursement of duty should not give rise to discriminatory criteria, and should avoid double taxation."
"These were the guiding principles of the opinion that I presented to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on behalf of the Committee on Industry."
"I would repeat that there was broad consensus on the opinion within the Committee on Industry."
"That is why I must say, as a Member for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, using my second minute, that I do not understand Mrs Lulling's observation that the Socialist Group and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe - and only they - introduced quantitative limits."
"It was not just the Socialist Group and the ALDE Group as, at least in the Committee on Industry, it was everyone, given that my opinion was unanimously adopted, as I said."
"I feel it is truly extraordinary that quantitative limits have not been included, as we know that this type of duty has various aims."
"Obviously the first is tax revenue, but there is also protection of public health."
"Of course, each country attaches a different level of importance to each of these two aims."
"I therefore feel that the solution we found (of defining quantitative limits) is a fair and balanced solution, which does not excessively benefit any country in particular."
"It also does not prejudice any of the countries which naturally have a different understanding from that of the country which Mrs Lulling represents and which I naturally respect."
"However, the wishes of that country obviously cannot be placed above the general wishes of the other countries of the European Union."
"My final comment in just 10 seconds is that the Socialist Group obviously supports the internal market and the expansion of the internal market and does not believe that the proposals adopted in either the Committee on Industry or the Committee on Economic Affairs may jeopardise the internal market."
"rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. - Mr President, Parliament defends individuals and small organisations, small businesses, as opposed to governments who want to sweep away inconvenient things and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection feels very strongly that the external land-border shops should be allowed to remain."
"They should be better policed, as should all the policing against crime across borders in Europe be much better, but it is not a reason to sweep them away."
"Secondly, on sea and air travel, the Internal Market Committee believes strongly that travellers - based on their final destination, as opposed to a transit destination - should be allowed to buy duty-free because that would help small regional airports generate revenue."
"It may be inconvenient to the governments, but we defend it very strongly."
"The third and final point that I want to make - which it is very regrettable that the Commission did not include in its 2006 consultation on this legislation - is the removal of these exemptions which it is now proposing."
"Why did it not include it?"
"Why did it not carry out an impact assessment on what it would mean before it proposed it?"
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (HU) Thank you, Mr President."
"I would like to congratulate both the Commission and the rapporteurs for their work, and I believe that this electronic updating system will have a timely and very positive effect."
"I would like to make two remarks."
"First, let us allow the internal market to operate."
"If the tax record system and the exchange of information are working well, I believe that traffic for personal use by private individuals will not cause great harm."
"If someone somewhere - having purchased goods for personal use - pays the excise duty, then the wholesale prices, and in part the divergent VAT rates will in any case compete with each other."
"It is not necessary to put limits on everything, and it is entirely unnecessary to send negative messages in the interests of protecting the treasuries of high-price countries."
"It would be very strange within the Schengen zone in particular, if we were to bother with police or customs inspections, since we know that there are various other methods for scanning the contents of larger lorries."
"Therefore, I see no point in an indicative listing."
"My other remark is that I too support the rights of citizens leaving the internal market to purchase such goods when they leave that market."
"As regards overland travel, I do not think that this would give rise to large-scale smuggling, or that the neighbouring Member States would suffer great losses, since prices in neighbouring third countries are much lower than within EU Member States."
"Thus, I am not thinking of industrial-scale export of goods."
"I presume the same is true in the case of airports, since one cannot take such great quantities of goods in checked baggage or carry-on bags that we should have to forbid taking such goods for personal use to third countries outside the customs union. Thank you very much, Mr President, for the opportunity to speak."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating the main rapporteur, Mrs Lulling, and the shadow rapporteurs, Benoît Hamon and Olle Schmidt."
"For unavoidable reasons, my colleague Benoît Hamon cannot be here today, so I will try to convey his position, which is the position of our political group, on a matter that deserves our full attention."
"In fact, taxation in terms of excise duties is a sensitive matter."
"When talking about excise duties, we must remember that they are levied on clearly defined consumer goods and services: tobacco, alcohol and energy products."
"The Commission proposal amends a text dating from 1992."
"The internal market in these goods has changed a great deal since then."
"It should also be noted that the new electronic system for managing and controlling transactions is a change that we welcome and that should simplify the operation of the system, for both operators and tax authorities, as the Commissioner has just mentioned."
"As regards the more technical aspects - including time limits for forwarding documents, rules for the establishment of financial guarantees by operators, and so on - the Commission proposal and the rapporteur's report deserve congratulations and agreement as they represent genuine and useful advances."
"However, with regard to these excise duties, the political content should not stop at technical aspects, as already mentioned by my colleague Manuel António dos Santos."
"The goods covered by this proposal are sensitive goods, the sale of which should not be subject merely to the forces of competition."
"In this respect, I should therefore like to focus on two illustrative examples."
"One is the guideline limits for the personal transport of these goods and the other is the rules applicable to Internet sales."
"On these subjects, we clearly disagree with the rapporteur."
"With regard to alcohol, tobacco and also fuel, the differences in taxation between the Member States are huge and therefore the retail prices also differ."
"I only need to point out that the price of a packet of tobacco can vary between EUR 1 and EUR 7 within the Union due to these significant differences in duty."
"As a rule, duties are payable in the country of consumption, except with regard to goods transported within the European Union."
"Under current rules, certain quantitative limits must be respected, otherwise it may be presumed that the goods are being transported for commercial purposes."
"The Commission proposal aims to abolish these quantitative limits and, on this specific aspect, the rapporteur, Mrs Lulling, agrees."
"This was not the understanding of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"By contrast, we agreed to lower these limits, following initiatives by the shadow rapporteurs, Benoît Hamon and Olle Schmidt, and also myself."
"Liberalisation does allow some consumers to purchase these goods more cheaply."
"However, this does not make sense where it may prejudice the public finances of Member States or public health objectives which Member States have the right to safeguard."
"It also does not make sense where it may support the grey market, which is something that we should all avoid."
"Therefore, the final agreement reached in committee was to maintain the limits at a reasonable level, namely 400 cigarettes or 45 litres of wine per person."
"These are the amounts assumed to be for personal consumption."
"As a result, those travellers who purchase these goods up to this limit will not be affected."
"For the same reasons we oppose Amendment 68 of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which proposes to tax distance sales, particularly those made over the Internet, in the seller's country and not in the consumer's country."
"This is an (unjustified) inversion of the general principle applying to taxation."
"This amendment would also open the door to a large-scale grey market and must therefore be absolutely rejected."
"Finally, I must just mention the issue of duty-free shops."
"The internationally recognised principle is that duty-free shops may only exist at ports and airports, to ensure optimum control and prevent any risk of fraud or abuse."
"We must therefore allow sufficient time for people to adapt and that is why we propose, on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, a transitional period for those Member States which still have duty-free outlets, allowing them to gradually adjust to the new situation."
"We therefore propose the distant date of 1 January 2017 to allow a gradual convergence towards the common rule."
"We believe that this approach is appropriate."
"It is an approach which resulted in consensus."
"It was not total consensus, but it was adopted by a majority in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and I hope that it will be adopted in the vote tomorrow in plenary."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (SV) Mr President, Commissioner and Mrs Lulling, we meet again on this issue."
"Of course, it is not the first time we have come into conflict with each other, Mrs Lulling and I, on the form excise duty should take in Europe."
"However, it is probably the first time that I have felt that I am the one with the majority on my side."
"It is dangerous to pre-empt things, but we will see how it goes."
"On the issue of the new technical system, EMCS, we are fully in agreement."
"It is on the sensitive issue of import quotas that our views seriously diverge."
"If the committee's approach is taken up, Parliament will have made clear both its commitment to freedom of movement in Europe and its commitment to encouraging the desire for a sensible public health policy."
"As always when it comes to tax-related issues it is necessary to find a balance between what should remain within a Member State's competence and what is considered our common responsibility."
"If we vote through the Committee's proposal it will mean that the European Parliament will establish that tobacco and alcohol are not the same as any other goods, just as we have previously heard in this House, and must be treated differently."
"This is, of course, nothing revolutionary, as many people have been saying this for a long time."
"By deciding to halve the indicative import levels while at the same time retaining the principle of a limit, we are giving Member States a lot of room to conduct their own policy while at the same time the common legislation will make it easier for undertakings and individuals to conduct cross-border trade."
"Or to put it more simply: Sweden will be given room to prioritise public health issues while Lulling's Luxembourg can continue its packaged low tax policy."
"The internal market cannot be built with alcohol tourism as its model."
"Drunkenness and its consequences is not a Swedish problem, as I sometimes hear people say."
"Recently, we have heard demands for forceful measures to combat drunkenness in the United Kingdom, something that the British Members should also think about perhaps."
"I think that it is high time that the European Parliament took a more sensible view of these issues and gave Member States the opportunity to take action in the direction of public health."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, speaking on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, I would like to draw your attention to three points."
"Firstly, changes in duties at European Union level should encourage an increase in the production and distribution of goods and services, mainly by reducing red tape, but also by making it easier for national administrations to apply control procedures based on risk analysis."
"Secondly, the solutions proposed in this directive meet these requirements."
"Simplifying administrative procedures and an electronic system of information exchange will for the tax authorities of the Member States become a tool for improved and better managed controls."
"Thirdly, we must support the solutions put forward by the rapporteur on including distance selling of excise goods within the scope of the directive, and also, in the duty suspension arrangement, by the application of reduced guarantees in respect of entities which meet the conditions of good behaviour and regularly use the system of guarantees."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, the Commission proposal relating to procedure states in Article 10 that 'Member States may [...] make excise goods which have been released for consumption eligible for reimbursement [...] of excise duty'."
"On this basis, Ms Lulling tells us that, as regards the conditions for reimbursement of excise duty, the proposal lays down, as a general principle, that it is for Member States to determine these conditions."
"However, Article 10 goes on to say: 'provided that such reimbursement [...] does not give rise to exemptions other than those referred to in Article 11'."
"Article 11 refers to exemptions for diplomatic purposes, for subsidising international organisations, for assisting the armed forces of NATO and under special arrangements with non-EU countries, all of which - I think you will agree - are rather specialised exemptions which, contrary to Ms Lulling's assertion, do not uphold the general principle that it is for Member States to determine the conditions for reimbursement."
"There is no exemption for Member States in this proposal, and on these grounds I commend to Members Amendment 54, which seeks to repair a glaring flaw in this proposal."
"(EL) Mr President, we find ourselves facing yet another eccentric proposal by the Commission; with what is no more and no less than a bulldozer policy, it proposes to abolish all duty free shops at land borders between the Community and third countries."
"The big question is why?"
"Why, Commissioner, did you have this thought and, having had it, why did you not table it at the consultation which you organised in 2006 and why did you not include it in an impact assessment which you were obliged to carry out within the framework of the new principle of better regulation?"
"You must therefore explain to us why we should tell hundreds of workers that they will lose their jobs, especially in these difficult times; you must explain to us what this impact is on the internal market which is so great that you need to abolish at one fell swoop all shops at land borders with third countries, which in the case of my country, in Greece, are working extremely successfully and with no fraud problems and no impact on the internal market."
"Parliament and the political groups which share this opinion must also take the political responsibility for explaining to the workers why it is that we want to abolish these successful shops."
"As far as I am concerned - as Mrs Lulling said quite clearly and as the IMCO said quite clearly in its report - we have not been given a convincing answer, which makes us believe that, for the Commission, this is something of a whim."
"We have not been given a convincing answer."
"I therefore make an eleventh-hour appeal for us to vote tomorrow in favour of Amendments 63, 64 and 65, so as to prevent this bulldozer policy from flattening once again everything that is working in the European Union."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, I shall make a specific proposal for the system of exemption of land-based shops."
"Commissioner, you are introducing a general exemption for land-based shops which constitutes discrimination against these undertakings and has an important impact on the functioning of these otherwise healthy shops, which make a significant contribution to national communities and local employment."
"In Member States such as Greece, with long land borders with third countries, these shops have been operating smoothly and profitably for a long time while, on the other hand, the question of systematic infringement of the criterion of purchase for personal use or cases of systematic abuse and tax evasion are clearly controlled by the national authorities."
"I consider that allowing duty free shops to continue to trade on land borders would be a solution which is also in keeping with the Commission's own proposals, while controlling their modus operandi and stamping out cases of tax evasion would, as with all other shops, be the responsibility of the ports and airports."
"I therefore consider that, in the forthcoming vote, we should support Amendments 57, 63, 64 and 65 and, in the worst case scenario, Amendment 69, which extends the period of operation of these shops to 2012."
"Mr President, I welcome the report on general arrangements for excise duty."
"I wish to highlight the progress made in the matter of purchasing duty."
"The original proposal, if implemented, would have restricted passengers to purchasing duty-free goods only in the final airport of departure before leaving the EU."
"In practical terms this would have meant that if a person went on a journey from Cork in Ireland to Dubai via Paris they would only be able to purchase duty-free goods in Paris."
"This would have decimated the profitability of Irish regional airports, as many currently rely on commercial activities for the bulk of their income."
"This would undoubtedly have led to job losses."
"However, this has now been addressed and accordingly I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on working to address our concerns."
"This represents a welcome development at a time when the Irish Government has introduced a new airport tax which will discriminate against beleaguered smaller regional airports to the advantage of the already congested Dublin airport."
"In that regard I call on the Commission to investigate the legality of this measure under EU competition rules."
"I welcome the report from Mrs Lulling and the Commission."
"Mr President, perhaps if I were Mrs Lulling living in Luxembourg I might feel as strongly about not having indicative limits."
"Unfortunately, I live on an island where there is a lot of smuggling and much of the alcohol and tobacco which people think that they can use for their own particular purposes is in fact later sold on to other people through commercial resale."
"I am afraid that anything we do to end the indicative limits would send a signal and a message to those smugglers who look for the resale of alcohol and cigarettes."
"Indicative limits may not seem like a safe guide for consumers but they are a safe guide for children, children who often end up taking the alcohol and cigarettes sold by bootleggers and smugglers who bring them into my region in the South-East and sell them in the streets, on the back streets and on the estates, for small change, one or two cigarettes at a time perhaps, but enough to get kids started."
"It is this trade which needs to be controlled and can only be controlled by setting indicative limits so that we can get to the source of the people who are trying to do this and trying to smuggle it past our police and customs officers."
"That is why I believe that indicative limits should stay."
"It is not, as I say, an end to the integration of the single markets, but it certainly does bring about a better idea of social cohesion and social behaviour and, in the United Kingdom, the customs and excise officers and the police officers asked for this."
"They asked for it because it gives good guidance as to what people would be expected to bring back for their own personal use."
"Tobacco has a life of only six months, so when you stop vans packed to the ceiling with cigarettes, you have to ask the question: is that really for personal use or is it going elsewhere for resale, and often to children?"
"- (RO) Fellow Members, excise duty and electronic charging systems in general appear to be technical matters, but they also serve certain powerful political objectives."
"However, to be able to use them, we need to take account of the specific situations in Member States, along with the abstract theories."
"At the same time, we need to maintain consistency with more general principles of the policies which we apply. For instance, the principle of equal treatment."
"This report would meet both conditions if a proposal is accepted."
"This applies in particular to Amendment 69, which refers to maintaining duty-free shops at customs points in the Union other than at ports and airports, until 2017."
"This amendment will eliminate the discrimination between those who travel by water or air and those who travel on land, which is totally unjustified not only from an economic and theoretical, but also a practical perspective."
"At the same time, it offers a certain advantage to those living in the border areas, as has been pointed out already."
"These people are generally economically disadvantaged due to their peripheral status, but if their jobs were to disappear, this would have a negative impact on them."
"Fellow Members, there are serious reasons for you to accept this amendment during tomorrow's vote."
"Compared to the huge expense we are prepared to go to without any objections in order to save corporations, this exemption has only minor financial repercussions."
"- (CS) Mr President, the free movement of people and goods is one of the great achievements of the European Union but it does not function well in the case of goods which are subject to varying high levels of consumer tax between the Member States."
"The conflicting views of the Commission, the committee, the European Court and the rapporteurs concerning quantitative policies have shown that we will not find a good solution as long as these tax differences continue to exist."
"It bothers me that the Commission has not carried out an impact study in order for us to assess the economic importance of the parallel market and the social importance which restricts our citizens and which perhaps we all acknowledge."
"I would like this debate to lead to the coordination of consumer tax policies on alcohol and tobacco, for, among other reasons, the health risks."
"It is a fact that countries with high taxes cannot boast of any visible success in the fight against alcoholism."
"- (RO) Mr President, Commissioner, Chapter 4 sets out the basic provisions and procedures which are applied as part of the Excise Movement Control System."
"The novel aspect is the introduction of the system and administrative documentation in electronic format."
"In order to ensure the efficient operation of the computerised system, Member States should adopt within their national applications a uniform data set and structure in order to provide a reliable interface for economic operators."
"The transitional period for adopting the Excise Movement Control System under suspension of excise duty must be set with due regard to the feasibility of introducing the computerised system in each Member State."
"With this in mind, the Member States and Commission are taking the necessary measures to implement key public facilities at national level and to ensure their interoperability."
"Commissioner, in view of the food crisis mentioned and the social and economic importance of Europe's agriculture, I believe that we need to look closely at the possibility of abolishing excise duty on fuels used for agricultural activities, as well as on the energy used to pump water for irrigation purposes."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, from the discussions I do see a general support for the main objective of the Commission proposal, which is to provide the legal basis for the computerisation of excise procedures by April 2010."
"I want to emphasise and confirm that the purpose of the proposal is to simplify and modernise the excise procedure, to improve control of the movement of excise goods and at that same time to reduce red-tape excise obligations for traders and to reduce the burden on private travellers."
"These were the guiding principles for the proposals."
"I would like to make some observations in relation to the amendments concerning some of the more sensitive issues in the proposal."
"On the 'guide levels', the Commission could accept to maintain guide levels as a tool, although we did not want to introduce or propose guide levels."
"However, the present quantitative reference values have to be kept."
"We cannot accept a reduction of these values, which would be a step backwards in comparison with the 1993 Directive."
"On the abolition of tax-free shops at land borders, which is another sensitive issue, I want to remind you that the origin of this approach dates back to as early as 1960, when the WCO, the World Customs Organisation, recommended the abolition of land-border tax-free shops, and I also want to remind you that in 2002, when the accession talks with 10 new countries were completed, countries like Slovenia, Hungary and some others were forced to abolish their land-based tax-free shops; so I think that the proposed solution, which provides a very long transitional period for Greece and for Romania, is quite fair in comparison to the stand taken with regard to the former new countries."
"On the reimbursement of excise duty to small fuel distributors, the Commission maintains the principle that the insolvency of the final consumer cannot be a ground not to charge excise duty."
"At the same time, in view of the ongoing economic crisis and sometimes remaining high fuel prices, and to ensure fuel distribution to end users, it should be possible for Member States to otherwise safeguard the interest of small distributors, provided that such measures do not disturb competition."
"Concerning the impact assessment, a point which many speakers raised, I want to remind you that an impact assessment was already made in 2004, so we simply did not find it necessary to repeat it two years later."
"In conclusion, I would like to thank Parliament for its support and constructive approach."
"Providing the legal basis for the new Excise Movement Control System will allow the Member States to speed up their preparation for the introduction of the system, foreseen by April 2010."
"The Commission will take all necessary steps to ensure that all central systems will be operational by that date, as well as provide support to allow a smooth transition to the new paperless environment."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Commissioner, we very much want the Excise Movement and Control System to replace the paper system in April 2009, and we hope that the whole unfortunate debate on the indicative limits will not delay adoption of the directive."
"I should like to say to Mr Dos Santos that these indicative limits have nothing to do with health or with Luxembourg."
"I should like to point out to Mrs Ferreira that, in 2005, we adopted in this House the report by the member of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, Mr Rosati, in which we already endorsed the abolition of the indicative limits."
"Moreover, Mr Hamon, who now has other concerns, had proposed in his amendment much higher limits than those of the infamous social-liberal compromise concocted behind my back."
"To Mr Schmidt, I would say that we really ought not to mix things up and speak in the same breath about taxation and health."
"Moreover, the scourge of alcoholism is, unfortunately, directly in proportion to the level of excise duty; the higher the rate of excise duty, the greater the scourge of alcoholism in countries."
"The latter are obviously free to impose as high a rate of excise duty as they like, because we have only minimum rates, not maximum ones; but, please, do not talk to us about health policy when you have rates such as that."
"I should like to say to Mr Skinner that, really, smugglers could not care less about levels and indicative limits."
"Moreover, in the Commission's proposal, there are criteria for defining goods acquired for personal use that are better safeguards than the indicative limits, including against smuggling."
"I hope that, tomorrow, we will be able to find the right solution, namely the one that I am proposing."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"European Union Solidarity Fund: obstacles for its reform (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Gerardo Galeote Quecedo, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on the European Union Solidarity Fund: obstacles for its reform - B6-0472/2008)."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, once again we are dedicating a debate in plenary to the reform of the European Union Solidarity Fund which, as we all know, is intended to alleviate the damage caused by a major natural disaster within the Union territory."
"This Fund very quickly proved to be ineffective in meeting its set objectives and, as a result, in 2005, the European Commission presented a proposal modifying the regulation governing this instrument of solidarity."
"The aim was to improve not only its operability, but also access to it and its coverage in the event of a major natural disaster."
"The European Parliament, as can be easily proven, worked promptly and intensively on this proposal so that in May 2006 our institution had finished its first reading."
"At that time we all thought and believed that the Council would do the same, given that this was a regulation under the codecision procedure."
"However, as we now all know, that was not the case."
"Contrary to expectations, the Council put a hold on the process due to its inaction."
"During this period, in addition to serious flooding, the European Union has suffered serious fires, which in some cases have resulted in deaths, and also major droughts."
"However, the Council has remained impassive."
"The proposal to improve the regulation is still sitting on the Council's table, despite calls from the European institutions and social forces."
"Today we want to once again call on the Council to act and remind it that modifying this regulation will not require one additional euro from the Community budget: our demands have no financial consequences and aim solely at rectifying the operational problems that have arisen since this instrument of solidarity was created."
"We simply want to improve its operability and agility, always in line with the subsidiarity principle."
"We note that, as this instrument currently stands, access to it is very difficult, restrictive and inflexible, as we have unfortunately witnessed over the nearly seven years of its operation."
"I therefore want to ask whether this inability of the delegations forming the Council to reach a common position has any real explanation, and whether anyone can tell us who and what arguments are blocking reform of this regulation."
"We should like the European Commission to drive forward the reform of this fund, to tell us what actions it plans to take, and to clearly set out the possible alternatives that it is considering in order to help unblock this matter."
"If the Commission does have any alternatives, we should of course like to know what they are and what their time horizon is."
"I believe it is appropriate to remind those present, in particular the French Presidency, that this instrument was set up with a laudable objective: to promptly, adequately and visibly show the Union's solidarity with its citizens."
"To end, Mr President, I want to make another call, this time specifically to the French Presidency, on a matter closely linked to this one: the creation of a European civil protection force, on which Michel Barnier, a former Commissioner as you all know, presented a report to the European Council in 2006."
"I am ending."
"The Fund was created in particular as a symbolic expression of solidarity between the European Union and its citizens."
"My final plea is that, if we manage, after so much time and effort, to make this operative in any degree, our first thought and action should be directed towards those who have died in these disasters in the European Union."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank the European Parliament, and in particular the members of the Committee on Regional Development, for their continued interest in, and support for, the Solidarity Fund."
"It is an important instrument to promote the European Union's strategic objective of solidarity and, since its creation in 2002, 61 applications have been received and the fund has intervened in 33 cases in 20 different countries."
"The total amount committed so far is EUR 1 523 million."
"According to the recent special report by the Court of Auditors, the fund is well managed and delivers quick, efficient and flexible assistance."
"However, this fund has its limitations."
"The threshold for mobilising the European Union Solidarity Fund is extremely high."
"As a result, the fund is not well equipped for certain types of disasters, typically involving lower eligible expenditure, such as forest fires, and more than two thirds of all applications for the fund assistance presented so far were based on an exception for so-called 'extraordinary regional disasters'."
"Moreover, with all the existing Community instruments, it is extremely difficult, or indeed impossible, for us to react to man-made disasters, as illustrated by industrial accidents, such as the Prestige oil spill, or terrorist acts, such as the Madrid bombing of March 2004."
"Likewise, it is not possible at present to provide assistance from the European Union Solidarity Fund in the event of a serious public health crisis."
"For these reasons, in April 2005 the Commission adopted a proposal for a revision of the Regulation."
"Despite joint efforts with successive presidencies since 2005, the Council has so far not been able to reach agreement on this proposal."
"One reason is that the large majority of Member States consider that the fund works very well under the present scheme and they do not consider it necessary or appropriate to expand it to cover additional situations, fearing in particular the budgetary consequences of such an expansion."
"The Council has not formally specified the position of each Member State, although the Council opinions are supported by quasi-unanimity."
"In addition, it was not indicated where areas of compromise could be found in order to reach an agreement on the Commission proposal."
"The Commission remains convinced that revision of the Solidarity Fund Regulation is necessary to increase the Union's capacity to react quickly in case of major disasters which are currently not covered."
"Therefore, it will adopt a report to take stock of the six years of implementing the fund and to identify Solidarity Fund limitations and any room for improvement."
"We hope that the report will relaunch discussions in the Council and in the European Parliament on a revision of the current Solidarity Fund Regulation."
"The report should be ready towards the end of the first quarter of 2009."
"With regard to civil protection, the Commission has begun to identify gaps in civil protection response resources on the basis of scenarios for major disasters, and assess options to fill identified gaps."
"In this context, the Commission will explore innovative arrangements with the Member States for reinforcing the overall EU disaster-response capacity in the framework of the pilot project and the preparatory action included in the 2008 budget."
"On the basis of this work, the Commission may propose to fill the gaps through the development of civil protection modules available for deployment at any time or through additional reserve capacities designed to complement national responses to major disasters, including in the area of fighting wild fires."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking in my capacity as rapporteur for the Social Fund, the 2002 Solidarity Fund and the expanded and improved version from 2006."
"This report, which the European Parliament adopted by a huge majority, has been on ice for over two years, because it is being blocked by the Council, despite the fact that citizens are calling increasingly loudly for European solidarity against the background of the ever more frequent occurrence of natural disasters."
"The Solidarity Fund, which was hastily cobbled together following the devastating floods of 2002 to provide urgently needed assistance, was an instrument that promised immediate aid in the event of disaster."
"Over time, however, it has emerged that - as you quite rightly said, Commissioner - that the currently available instrument makes it extremely difficult, if not downright impossible, to respond appropriately to large-scale crises at EU level."
"Moreover, the current threshold for mobilising the fund is, as you said, Mrs Hübner, extremely high, which means that the derogations are getting out of hand."
"The revised version of the Disaster Relief Fund, however, provides a clear response to this."
"The European Parliament therefore feels that it is even more important for this effective instrument to be made available to the people affected by disasters, hence, once again, the specific question: why can the Council not reach a common position on an issue that is so vital to suffering citizens of the European Union?"
"Which Member States support the improved Treaty, and which reject it?"
"You in the Commission have indicated that it might be a possibility at the start of 2009."
"We hope so, but we also want to push for it once again here, because one cannot simply disregard the vote of this Parliament as the various Presidencies have done previously."
"Mr President, Commissioner, as stated by my fellow Members, in 2006 we debated in this House the modification of the Solidarity Fund Regulation with a view to adapting it so that it could become a rapid and effective instrument of response."
"However, today this issue is still on the table."
"It was not easy to achieve the very broad agreement that was reached in this House, given that both the various political groups and the interests of certain countries put forward very different ideas as to how to modify this regulation."
"However, I feel that we all made a major effort to reach agreement and allow this regulation to be amended."
"I feel that Parliament set an example of what we all now have to make an effort to achieve: the consensual modification of the regulation."
"The European Commission must make every possible effort to foster this agreement and achieve the set objective."
"I am pleased at the response given today by the Commissioner, who has said that a study will be carried out in order to determine the objectives that we must now set with regard to the modification of the regulation, not least so that we can ensure future agreement by the Council."
"We must ensure that, through the modification of this regulation, a rapid and effective response can be given to those disasters which the Member States are unable to tackle on their own, by extending the current eligibility to industrial disasters, acts of terrorism and public health emergencies, not forgetting such an important issue as the severe droughts which are occurring increasingly often, particularly in certain Mediterranean areas."
"In addition, we must be firm in proposing to lower the threshold for mobilising the fund from EUR 3 000 to 1 000 million in damage caused, not forgetting the regional component."
"This instrument must respond with financial aid to situations of extreme drought, fire and flooding, not forgetting under any circumstances the victims who need immediate help and assistance."
"The Solidarity Fund is a political instrument for solving problems, which is why I must once again stress the need to make every effort to take this fundamental issue forward, but we must do so with the necessary changes that are appropriate to today's reality."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, my fellow Members have already cited some examples."
"I should like to refer to some of them in order to introduce this subject, since we need to combat natural disasters."
"Who remembers what took place just a century ago, in 1908, in Messina, where 100 000 people died?"
"Everyone obviously remembers Chernobyl, but if we focus on the last 10 years or so, there were the storms and the sinkings of 1999, the floods in Central Europe already cited just now, not to mention 11 September in New York, the terrorist attacks of March 2004, the problematic disease, chikungunya, and so on."
"We do not know what the next disaster will be or on what scale it will be, but we are sure of one thing, and that is that there will soon be another disaster again."
"When that time comes, our fellow citizens, who for 50 years have been used to seeing a supposedly united Europe being built - and a number of reports on which we have voted this week are testimony to this - will turn round and ask us the same question that they have been asking us regarding the current financial crisis: 'but what have you done?'"
"Over the past few weeks some of you may have heard the former director of the International Monetary Fund explain in a previous report, from three or four years ago: 'We said at the IMF that the crisis was going to happen, and we explained how to prevent it'."
"So, Commissioner, this evening you have come to listen to us, and we hope that you will be able to hear us and to ensure that, unlike what is happening with regard to the current financial crisis, Europe will not be behind if a disaster occurs."
"For my part I should like to make a twin proposal."
"Firstly, a proposal concerning the type of action to take."
"You said this in your closing remarks, Commissioner, you referred to the report by Michel Barnier."
"We cannot have two separate actions, even though you yourself, like each of us, in particular within the Committee on Regional Development, are forever saying that we need integrated approaches."
"We cannot have development of the Solidarity Fund, on the one hand, and a prevention policy, on the other."
"The two should be linked, not least in order to convince these infamous ministers of finance, who explain to us that perhaps even if the Solidarity Fund criteria were adapted - and you spoke about this - it would cost more."
"They should draw inspiration from the Barnier report and they would understand that if, at the same time, we conducted a prevention policy by pooling the means of action and pooling accident and natural disaster prevention, then, we would save money."
"Therefore, it is clearly a question not only of saving money and averting disasters, but above all of saving human lives - that really is the priority."
"That is why, Commissioner, I, along with all my fellow Members, urge you to do your utmost to ensure that, at the end of the French Presidency and during the Czech Presidency, you obtain a genuine guarantee from the Swedish Presidency that the action plan will not just be studied, but launched."
"We are counting on your determination."
"We need it."
"You know that Parliament is behind you - this evening it has said so loud and clear."
"We shall now wait to receive results for a year's time, without fail."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Council is not present, but it is the institution that is creating the blockage, and it is to the Council that this discussion should be addressed."
"After all, who is it that submits the applications when the fires or the floodwaters are spreading?"
"The Member States - and they attach all sorts of special requests."
"They want generous aid, and it is not always used appropriately: we have just had the example of the United Kingdom."
"Nevertheless, I would like to take this opportunity to express another concern to the Commission."
"Originally, the Commission, under Mr Bernier, was very committed to the area of prevention, because it understood that natural disasters can only really be combated through preventive action."
"Today, this aspect is not being given sufficient attention."
"I would welcome it if the Commission could draw up guidelines for the implementation of the Solidarity Fund that really focused on prevention."
"I would once again point out that the Commission already has opportunities to put greater emphasis on prevention, for example as part of the ERDF programme, but what are they doing in that connection?"
"So far, little has come across, and little investment has been made to prevent the occurrence of natural disasters."
"There has been no investment in natural flows, and there has not been enough insistence that reforestation should involve a natural mixture, for example in Greece, where it is the pine forests that burn particularly easily."
"I expect the Commission to act with greater commitment on the current applications, and to keep an eye on what the money is being spent on, in order to ensure that disasters do not recur, and to enable investments can really be in harmony with nature."
"I have seen no sign of this commitment, and in that respect the Commission needs to shoulder a portion of the blame."
"Although we talk about natural disasters, the majority of natural disasters are to a large extent man-made, due firstly to the inadequacy of our fight against climate change and secondly to building on flood plains and planting monoculture forests."
"In this connection, the Commission needs to commit now, and not wait."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) During the debate on modifying the Solidarity Fund Regulation, held on 18 May 2006, in which we actively participated by tabling a series of proposals, we underlined our disagreement with the position adopted by a majority in Parliament."
"In particular, we disagreed with the failure to maintain the eligibility of regional disasters - which are the kind that occur most - as provided for in the current regulation."
"We also disagreed with the rejection of the possibility of greater financial assistance for the cohesion countries and convergence regions and we disagreed with the reduction in the threshold for mobilising the Fund, so that it is the European Union countries with the highest gross domestic product which will clearly benefit most."
"In line with everything we have done to date, in addition to amending the issues highlighted above, we will continue to fight for the following aspects, inter alia: recognition of the specific nature of Mediterranean natural disasters; adaptation of the Solidarity Fund in terms of time limits (having witnessed unjustifiable and unacceptable delays in its mobilisation and the delivery of Community funds to victims); adaptation of the Solidarity Fund in terms of eligible actions, particularly with regard to the specific nature of various natural disasters such as drought and fire; inclusion within the eligible actions of support for re-establishing productive activity in areas affected by disasters, and also operations to provide emergency land-based and airborne equipment for fighting forest fires."
"With regard to all initiatives in the area of civil protection, we consider that the priority should be promoting prevention and improving the civil protection resources of each Member State, and also their coordination."
"(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, there is the expectation of Europe to be pro-active."
"Citizens in affected areas cannot understand why it should take months before Europe, caught up in its own procedures, can grant clarity."
"How does it work?"
"Something happens somewhere and a few hours later, you can watch it all on TV and you find yourself thinking, this area needs our help and solidarity."
"This is followed by a deafening silence."
"We are then caught between the national state and European offices."
"What is frustrating is that there is no communication at that point."
"It is stuck in the Council, and has been for the past two years, but surely we should be able to find out what the reason is for the obstruction and hear alternatives."
"This is the big issue."
"Shortly, in six months' time, Parliament will be outgoing."
"When we will have a new Parliament, we will be expected to hand over this dossier, without having achieved our goals, with sound proposals on the table."
"The French Presidency is involved in everything other than this dossier."
"Nothing has happened with it, and we should particularly like to hear why that should be."
"I should like to congratulate the European Commission though."
"Mrs Hübner and her colleagues have definitely made some headway with it, and it should be possible to remove the obstruction completely by joining forces."
"In a naming and shaming exercise, we have to say that the Council and the French Presidency have failed on this score."
"(DE) Mr President, when do citizens need the solidarity of Europe?"
"When do Member States need the solidarity of the European Union?"
"Primarily, of course, in the event of disaster."
"This is precisely the question that I asked in connection with the vote on the fourth cohesion report this spring."
"Mr President, today we are discussing revising the Solidarity Fund to arm ourselves better for future challenges and to allow us to provide rapid and effective aid."
"The Commission and Parliament are, according to their resolutions, of one mind concerning the objectives of this legislative initiative."
"In July this year, I asked the Council about the status of this procedure."
"It informed me that, unlike Parliament, it saw no need for an initiative at the current time."
"In view of the fact that a former French Commissioner and minister stressed the need for revision in his report, I find the Council's attitude incomprehensible."
"I therefore could not ask for a better committee chairman than Mr Galeote, who is not prepared to accept Parliament decisions being disregarded."
"I would like to thank him quite specifically for that."
"I would call on the French Presidency, as a matter of urgency, to reconsider their attitude towards the citizens of Europe."
"(DE) Mr President, this is long overdue, and I would like to thank the rapporteur most warmly."
"I think this is one of the core issues that holds Europe together, and it is also a question of solidarity."
"It is high time for the Member States to take action in this area."
"The EU must provide financial support for those organisations that help us in crisis situations."
"Many Member States have suffered devastating natural disasters in recent years: I am thinking of the forest fires that repeatedly occur in Greece, including within the last year, and the floods in Central Europe in 2002, which also badly affected Austria."
"Disasters like these pull the economic rug from under people's feet."
"In such situations, exceptional resources are needed, Mr President, because it is not just about emergency aid, but also about rebuilding centuries of infrastructure."
"One Member State on its own does not have those resources."
"It should also be borne in mind that, unfortunately, certain States are more prone to these national disasters, and here, too, I am thinking of Austria."
"The people of Austria are still talking, with considerable gratitude, about how quickly the EU helped them."
"The European Solidarity Fund should not only help to fund reconstruction, but also support emergency organisations."
"The work of the voluntary fire service, the Red Cross and other voluntary organisations is priceless: one cannot begin to imagine how much it would cost if such services were not provided on a voluntary basis."
"These organisations always help in emergencies and are an indispensable part of the social structure in rural areas."
"We therefore urgently need to take action to maintain and expand these aid structures."
"I hope that we will reach agreement here quickly, so that we do not regret it when another disaster occurs and we cannot act quickly enough."
"(BG) As the rapporteur Mr Galeote and a number of other Members pointed out, the Solidarity Fund is a necessary instrument whose very name and purpose is to fulfil one of the most important principles of the European Union - that of solidarity among the Member States."
"During the time the Fund has been in use, omissions and failings have become evident, and for this reason reform is required to remedy these failings, and to respond to the dangers that face us."
"As has been mentioned, there is a reform mechanism and the European Parliament has stated its position."
"The important thing is to account for all potential problems that the Fund may encounter so that it can become an instrument that is genuinely useful and people feel that something is getting done."
"Nobody needs a useless instrument which has the potential to be used, but which in practice hardly works at all."
"At the same time, let us state quite clearly, that the greatest effect is achieved through quick response."
"We are still very far from achieving an effective system."
"The smaller Member States do not have the resources of the larger ones, while cooperation and coordination at European level is something we can only dream of."
"And, as has been pointed out, it does not always necessarily mean more cash."
"This summer in my country, Bulgaria, there was a huge fire in the Rila Mountains, the most picturesque and inaccessible mountains in the country, which we were only able to contain with the help of French firefighting helicopters, and we are deeply grateful for them."
"But organising and coordinating the operation cost too much valuable time."
"The citizens of the European Union are impatient for effective decisions, and not necessarily large amounts of funding."
"Effective decisions, which as Mr Beaupuy said, could even save us money."
"Mr President, we are all aware that the background and the origins of the European Solidarity Fund lie in the devastating floods in Central Eastern Europe in 2002; its necessity was further cemented by other natural disasters such as the forest fires in Greece."
"And recently the flooding in my own constituency in Northern Ireland brought it home to me how important this is."
"Despite widespread support and enthusiasm for the Fund expressed by Parliament and the Commission and among EU citizens, the Council's reluctance to cooperate is hindering its full implementation."
"Surely the European Union wishes to grant assistance to Member States which have experienced natural disaster."
"This aid must be administered in a swift and responsive manner in order to have any chance of being effective."
"However, the Council is currently placing obstacles in the way which are preventing the smooth operation of the Fund."
"I am glad therefore that the tabling of this oral question and its urgency is a matter which is highlighted by the Committee."
"Furthermore I would like to stress the part of the question posed by the Committee, which asked which Member States are opposed to the Fund, and please tell us why."
"The Solidarity Fund is an extremely important mechanism for the European Union to have at its disposal."
"However, problems of its implementation have dragged on for far too long and in my opinion this needs to be resolved as soon as possible."
"It matters nothing whether it is floods or forest fires, when people are in trouble they need help and assistance and above all they require financial support, upfront and speedily; not like the present system that has taken months and years and has been stifled totally by bureaucracy."
"If you really want to do something positive, this is it and will bring you more credit to Europe than any of your other proposals or all of them put together."
"I want to make it very clear to the Council."
"The Council disagreed because, in my opinion - and it is only my opinion - they do not want Parliament, and more importantly, they do not want the Members of this Parliament in the local region, where we are more important than you, the Commission or they, the Council."
"Because when something happens the people look to the Members."
"They do not look to the Commission and they do not look to the Council and they do not know who you are."
"You are an untouchable, faceless, bureaucratic body in Brussels."
"So it is the Members - so do not run away from it - we, the Parliament, are the people who are out there with the people all the time and we need that support."
"I have never heard such feeble excuses in all my life; it is time to get this done."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, we usually say that we are a Union whose basic principle is solidarity."
"Today our citizens need a Union which can put this principle into practice."
"They need actions, not just words."
"Today we call on the Council to take account of the citizens' expectations and show that it is up to the job as far as the Solidarity Fund is concerned."
"All of us in our countries have experienced the effects of what are frequently occurring natural disasters."
"We have all witnessed the despair of our fellow citizens who have been affected and we all know and understand how important it is for these citizens to feel that the European Union is standing by them."
"In May 2006, the European Parliament adopted the European Commission's plan for a new Solidarity Fund, a new, faster and more flexible and effective fund, which it was planning to implement in the period 2007-2013, but which has so far been collecting dust on the Council's desk."
"I honestly cannot understand how we can possibly have such a good instrument and yet not implement it."
"The European Union needs the new Solidarity Fund now more than ever."
"- (CS) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as a member of the Committee of the Regions I had a chance to see with my own eyes the storm-damaged forests in the Slovakia's High Tatra mountains, the fires in Portugal and the floods in the Czech Republic."
"In discussions with local people I fully realised how the use of European funds to repair the damage and regenerate the Tatra national park was strongly felt to be a concrete manifestation of European solidarity."
"The solidarity fund is able in certain crisis situations to assist individual states and thereby to give a major boost to the sense of belonging to a wider Europe."
"Unfortunately, the actual administration of this fund is not very efficient, so help often arrives after many months of delay."
"Therefore the European Parliament has been trying for a long time to change the legal framework in order for the law to be able to consider fresh needs when using these financial resources and enabling the provision of rapid and effective help in a shorter period of time."
"In view of global climate changes it can be expected that catastrophes involving floods, droughts, storms and fires will become more frequent on our old continent."
"There are also new threats in the form of terrorist attacks and health pandemics."
"In reality individual states are attempting on a bilateral basis to cooperate and are organising joint exercises and events for their emergency services."
"They are thus indirectly supporting some of the ideas on civil defence outlined by Michel Barnier in 2006."
"Unfortunately, that discussion has yet to be continued."
"Ladies and gentlemen, rapid responses, the more effective use of the Solidarity Fund and international cooperation in preventing and attempting to counter the effects of catastrophes are very hot topics, particularly ahead of the forthcoming European elections."
"I therefore fully understand the questions that have been submitted and I call on the European Commission and the Council to resolve the situation quickly."
"(HU) Thank you very much, Mr President."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Community created the Solidarity Fund with the stated purpose of enabling it to respond in a rapid, efficient and flexible manner in cases of dire emergencies."
"It cannot be said, however, that promptness and efficiency characterise the Council when it comes to formulating a common stand."
"Unfortunately, the greatest natural disasters do not wait for the formulation of a common stand."
"In spite of positive results obtained since the existence of the Solidarity Fund, further improvements are needed in order to be able to deliver aid more rapidly and efficiently to those in need."
"There are enormous challenges facing us, and for this reason I cannot understand why the years go by without the Council taking any decision."
"Our citizens' understanding will be even harder to gain than mine."
"We must not allow further delay, but need to strive for a debate that leads to results, and come to an agreement as soon as possible in order to meet the challenges posed by more and more frequent natural catastrophes. Thank you for your attention."
"- (BG) In recent years we have had to face increasing numbers of disasters, both natural and man-made."
"These disasters have resulted not just in serious financial, but unfortunately also in human, losses."
"Over the past few years we have had to deal with floods, drought and forest fires in Bulgaria."
"This weekend Bulgaria experienced an earthquake, which fortunately was not very strong."
"Although little consolation, it does confirm the need for an effective European Solidarity Fund."
"I would like to point out that we are not the only country in Europe to suffer from such disasters."
"Neighbouring Greece, for example, had to deal with devastating forest fires in 2007."
"This means we have to do more to deal with the consequences of these disasters."
"It is clear that we need changes in the regulations to provide more flexible tools."
"As Mr Berend correctly concluded in his report in 2006, we have to speed up the delivery of aid and decrease the amount of red tape involved."
"We must ensure that the aid reaches citizens when it is needed, and not days or even weeks afterwards."
"That is why I welcome the reduction in the threshold and the implementation of new fast-track payments which are an expression of real solidarity."
"Another aspect that is very important is that the new revised proposal also covers industrial disasters."
"If in Bulgaria, for example, we have an oil pipeline explosion or a shipping accident, this would also qualify for aid from the Solidarity Fund."
"And finally I would like to put forward an idea about funding."
"We could in the long term think of financing instruments such as the Solidarity Fund by using part of the monies that are lost under the 'N+2' and 'N+3' rules."
"For the time being, though, we need to concentrate on real change, and that is why I urge the Commission, and in particular the Council, to support the modification of the European Solidarity Fund."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, the Solidarity Fund is an important tool for the exercise of social policy in Member States hit by natural disasters."
"It is a practical expression of solidarity with European citizens affected by such disasters and it is through such procedures that we do justice to the vision of active support by the European Union for its citizens."
"The important contribution of the Fund in dealing with major disasters was demonstrated during the floods in central Europe, the earthquakes in Italy and the fires in Portugal and in my country, Greece, in 2007, and it is telling that a large number of Member States have used appropriations from the Fund."
"At the same time, with the current regulation and the existing resources, the European Union cannot respond to other such crises which are not due solely to natural causes, such as industrial pollution, a pandemic in Europe, droughts and such like."
"The proposed reform of the regulation covers broader requirements, speeds up procedures, introduces the innovation of advance payments and generally takes practical and positive measures."
"This being so and given that the European Parliament has adopted the Commission's proposal, I fail to see the reasons and causes for the delay in ratifying the regulation."
"It is comforting, Commissioner, that you made clear your support for our views in your stand today."
"This delay is not in keeping with the spirit of solidarity which should govern us."
"The Council bears a great deal of responsibility and we hope that it will respond to the call by the European Parliament and assume it immediately, even though it is absent today."
"- (RO) Mr President, Commissioner, fellow Members, first of all, I would like to say how happy I am that we are finally having a debate on this topic."
"I hope that today's debate will also produce the results which the Commissioner has already promised us."
"We all know that the current procedures for actually accessing the Solidarity Fund take a long time."
"I am therefore proposing that the Union's budget be amended."
"For example, when Romania wanted to obtain aid from the Solidarity Fund following the floods which took place in the spring/summer of 2005, it had to wait around a year to receive the money."
"The provision of the Regulation stipulates that the application should be submitted no later than ten weeks after the disaster takes place and the total value of the losses must be given, which helps to classify the type of disaster. It is rather difficult to meet these requirements when floods are involved, for instance."
"In order to evaluate the losses properly, the water needs to be drained off completely."
"This does not depend in any circumstances on national institutions and authorities."
"The next procedure is for the Commission to verify compliance with the conditions, primarily those of a major disaster."
"This requires a good deal of time, including additional information and clarifications."
"Finally, after the amended budget has been approved, the Commission prepares and approves the decisions for awarding the grants."
"This is ultimately followed by the transfer of funds, which must be spent within a year at the latest."
"In practical terms, this money reimburses the expenses already paid out by the beneficiary state following the disaster it has been through."
"On the basis of these conditions, we all ask ourselves whether this is really emergency aid."
"I would like to conclude by saying that rejecting the Commission's proposal to modify the Regulation after discussing it in the Working Group of the Financial Counsellors, without consulting the 'Structure Action' group, may lead to the conclusion that, in practical terms, the finance ministers were not in agreement."
"This conclusion creates numerous problems for us, especially in the current climate with so many problems and at Member State level too."
"Mr President, some of the best questions are raised late in the evening and this is one of them, although there is an element of 'the dialogue of the deaf' because we do not have the Council here to hear this debate."
"There are two words which we talk about a great deal in Europe: one is 'subsidiarity' and the other, 'solidarity'."
"Subsidiarity is about respecting the Member States and their rights and solidarity, in my view, reflects the commonality of the European Union and our support for each other."
"So, why does this fund not work to do that?"
"Indeed, one of the dangers and the damage as a result of its failure to work is that we make announcements about funding being available and then fail to deliver because the system is complex, bureaucratic and very unwieldy for communities and for individuals to work with."
"It is, I presume, about budget and about money, ultimately."
"I listened very carefully to the comments of the Commissioner responsible for Financial Programming and Budget last week about many things, from the common agricultural policy to other issues but, in particular, calling for a more flexible budget, a budget to react swiftly to world events rather than the European Union running after events."
"I am sorry that she did not speak about the need for flexibility to react to events in the European Union because I think that is what we are talking about here this evening."
"I come from a country which has said 'no' to the Lisbon Treaty, where we talk increasingly about trying to bring citizens closer to the European Union, and the best way to do that is to see Europe in action rather than in words."
"I am afraid that there are too many announcements about things in the European Union and too little action on the ground where people see it working."
"On a positive note there was a survey this morning in the papers which suggests that the Irish public are looking perhaps at changing their minds on Lisbon."
"So I would hate you to leave the Chamber despondent."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this oral question put to the European Commission by Gerardo Galeote, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, is totally justified and relevant."
"The reasons why the Council has blocked reform of the Solidarity Fund, given its inability to reach agreement on a common position that would allow the legislative process to continue, should be spelt out."
"It is difficult to see what reasons there might be for the Council's position, except perhaps mean financial reasons."
"Does the Council not want a more agile and immediate response to the natural disasters that occur?"
"Does the Council not want this type of speedy response to be available for any other type of disaster, such as major industrial disasters, acts of terrorism or public health emergencies?"
"It is vital that a clear answer is given to these questions, just as it is also vital to clarify what the European Commission thinks about this situation and whether it intends to take any steps to unblock the legislative process."
"The value of solidarity must also be fully ensured in this area."
"Citizens really would not understand if this did not happen."
"(PL) Mr President, this fund is one by which citizens often judge the European Union."
"In recent years we have observed a growing number of natural disasters, which have been increasingly violent in nature."
"Time and again we hear of floods, droughts, fires or storms in various Member States."
"They are not the only problems."
"We need to make it possible to get aid in events like chemical spillages, explosions, industrial fires or accidents at nuclear power stations."
"We also have to be prepared for new challenges, such as countering terrorist attacks and dealing with their aftermath."
"Neither should we forget crisis situations concerning the health of our citizens, or animal diseases."
"In the face of such threats, the cost of drugs, vaccinations and equipment are a great obstacle to dealing with these situations."
"The Fund must be elastic so it can adequately respond to situations, and do so comprehensively."
"The procedure for applying for aid also has to be as simple as possible."
"(PL) Mr President, today Commissioner Hübner finds herself in a very difficult situation."
"She has to reply on behalf of the Council, which has no representatives present."
"During the Danish presidency in 2002, when there was a flash flood, they managed to mobilise themselves and prepare the relevant documents in a matter of weeks."
"Today we should accuse the four presidencies for this sluggishness in reforming the Solidarity Fund."
"We need this Fund."
"The aid from it should not just be a token of our solidarity, but needs to be fast and effective, with a minimum of red tape."
"I believe that we need to address two issues here."
"One is how the Solidarity Fund should be managed, and in what situations, and the other is how to use other resources, from other funds, such as the Cohesion Fund, for long-term disaster prevention activities."
"But this is a separate subject."
"I would like to take this opportunity to ask the Commissioner a question."
"At one time the question was discussed of setting up a 'rapid reaction instrument' and of readiness for major disasters, with a budget for this eventuality of approximately EUR 200 million."
"I do not know what is happening with this project, which is also related to the issue under discussion."
"(DE) Mr President, it is unusual to be given the floor again under the 'catch the eye' procedure, but I just wanted to reiterate at the end of the debate that the criticisms expressed this evening are for the most part not directed at the Commission at all."
"The Commission has continually helped us in drafting the revisions to this Treaty, and it has always been on Parliament's side in the efforts to implement them."
"It is the Council that is at fault, and we wanted to phrase this question so that we could express our criticisms to the Council."
"The fact that it is not present shows contempt for Parliament, and we should not put up with being fobbed off like this."
"Mrs Hübner, you have our full support in all your dealings with the Council attempting to get this revised fund off the ground."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I have three explanations to present to you."
"This is not an emergency aid solidarity fund; it is a fund which is based on reimbursement of specific costs for emergency operations after disasters, allowing for a return to normal living conditions."
"The Commission proposes; Parliament and the Council decide."
"Secondly, in the Regulation amendment we propose to enlarge the scope, we propose to lower the threshold and we propose to change the procedure allowing specifically for the advance payment."
"Thirdly, the list of my interventions, and those of President Barroso, with seven presidencies is a very long list; it takes practically two pages, the list of all the meetings and letters."
"None of the seven presidencies, although some of them initially presented positive attitudes, managed to get agreement in the Council for approving the amendment to the Regulation."
"I refused to withdraw the proposal from the Council, hoping that with the new report that we will produce and adopt as the Commission early next year we will have a new debate which will allow us to go on with amendments; maybe we are now also having new ideas, maybe a broader scope of amendments to this Fund."
"In that regard, I hope very much that you will be present and participate in this debate and will support the proposal of the Commission."
"Briefly on another issue, prevention, we will adopt at the end of this year a communication 'Towards a comprehensive new approach to preventing disasters'."
"We have already completed the two exploratory studies, we have also completed consultations and the impact assessment is currently in preparation."
"Also, cohesion policy - somebody, I think Mr Janowski, suggested involving cohesion policy in prevention actions - has as one of its priorities precisely preventive actions, especially in the area of environment."
"That is all, Mr President."
"I hope that we will continue to work together with a view to getting this Fund amended in such a way that it will be more important and more responsive to the needs of European citizens."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"Parliament and the Commission reached an agreement over two years ago to extend the scope of the Solidarity Fund so that it covers not just natural disasters but also industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and major public health crises."
"The agreement specifies that particular attention will be paid to the outermost regions even if they do not meet the eligibility criteria in full, so that they receive emergency aid in the case of unforeseen happenings."
"However, this reform has still not come into force, as the Council has not managed to reach a decision, with the result that the adoption of a common position has been delayed even further."
"In spite of the fact that this Fund has recently been harnessed to help Réunion following Cyclone Gamede, and Martinique and Guadeloupe, both victims of Hurricane Dean, uncertainty remains about the admissibility of each request, because the Council did not take a swift decision on this reform."
"The Commission should also review its proposals with the aim of strengthening the Union's civil protection capacity, in order to exploit the expertise and geographical location of the outermost regions and the OCTs, which aspire to be support points in the event of intervention outside Europe."
"On both these issues, the outermost regions expect an ambitious response from the EU in order to guarantee their security."
"Improving consumer education and awareness on credit and finance (short presentation)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Iotova, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on protecting the consumer: improving consumer education and awareness on credit and finance."
"The report on financial education which will be put to the vote at tomorrow's plenary session is more important than ever."
"It is clear that the financial crisis we are now facing can be avoided if consumers are well informed of the risks that various types of credit entail."
"We can definitely say that if in the past we had concentrated more on the financial education of people, we would not be facing the present situation, or at least the crisis would not have assumed the proportions it has."
"For the sake of the future we must be sure that our children are given the opportunity to learn and to handle credit cards and loans properly everywhere in Europe."
"We have to concentrate on student mortgage loans and pension and investment funds."
"These financial products strongly affect the lives of consumers, which is why they must be taken into consideration."
"We must not forget that increasing numbers of young people are getting deep into debt without even suspecting what effect this will have on their lives."
"We have spent many months working very closely on the texts of the report."
"We conducted a very interesting public discussion with representatives of European and US banks and financial institutions right on the eve of the crisis."
"Even then the problems had clearly come into focus, and the alarm was sounded."
"On the other hand, we were able to see the experience and good practice of financial education in countries which have traditions in this area and which are constantly working to improve it - the UK, France, Germany and elsewhere, and we heard the opinions of those who are taking their first steps in this field."
"I am pleased with the results of the vote on the report in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and by the Commission's decision on the budgets needed to provide assistance on the project."
"We also received many encouraging responses from leading financial instructions on the initiative report."
"I believe we have reached a compromise solution which satisfies all political groups, which is why I hope tomorrow's vote on the report will be successful."
"We can only overcome the present financial crisis through joint efforts, which is why we need to unite and work together on this common initiative."
"It is time to act and to ensure that European consumers have the knowledge they need about consumer and other types of credits, so that a similar financial disaster is not repeated."
"To achieve this it is extremely important that the Member States implement the measures undertaken and cooperate closely."
"And finally I would like to thank the members of the European Commission greatly for the assistance they have given me."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, this is a very timely report."
"It highlights many of the challenges which European consumers are facing in the context of the current financial crisis."
"That is why I give many thanks to Mrs Iotova for the outstanding work."
"The Commission recognised the importance of financial education for the proper functioning of the internal market in our Communication which was adopted in December last year."
"Consumers definitely have to be empowered to take responsible decisions regarding their personal finance, and only in this way will they be able to reap the tangible benefits that come from financial integration in the European Union."
"Education is the competence of the Member States."
"The Commission's role in this regard is mainly supportive, but nevertheless important."
"The national level is the most appropriate for the delivery of consumer education programmes and it is also the most effective and efficient."
"Member States have a key role to play, for example by adopting national financial education strategies based on public/private partnership."
"We believe that the Commission's role is to act as a promoter of financial education EU-wide, showing benefits, coordinating efforts, demonstrating best practice."
"In this regard we have implemented several practical initiatives and created the expert group on financial education, which held its first meeting in October, devoted to discussions on the national strategies for financial education."
"We have also been advancing the development of the Dolcetta online tools for teachers to make it easier for them to incorporate financial topics into the existing curricula."
"Soon we will be publishing the European database for financial education, an electronic library of schemes run by various types of providers."
"Finally, the Commission regularly offers its patronage to selected events giving visibility to financial education."
"We fully agree with the general thrust of this parliamentary report and the majority of its proposals."
"The issue of crucial importance is the education of children and young people, and the Commission shares with Parliament the conviction that financial literacy should be taught at school."
"We are ready and willing to assist Member States in developing their basic educational programmes in the field of personal finances, and a similar concern applies to the idea of tasking the Commission with running EU information and media campaigns on financial education."
"Such awareness-raising campaigns should be tailored to the specific needs of the audience and are most efficient when run at the national or even local level."
"Again we are ready to assist."
"I would like to conclude by thanking Parliament for its good work on this file and look forward to continuing the dialogue between Parliament and the Commission on the important issues of consumer financial education."
"That concludes this item."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (RO) Ignorance of the law does not exempt us from its consequences, in much the same way as ignorance of financial mechanisms does not exempt us from the losses suffered."
"Finance and banking institutions and insurance companies had and still have an obligation to provide consumers with 'user instructions' for financial instruments so that they can make enlightened decisions."
"This is why I believe that the need to educate Europe's citizens in financial, banking and insurance matters by governmental and non-governmental institutions is a good solution for those who really want this."
"However, providing information to the citizens who use these instruments must be a duty performed by the providers of services in this area."
"I think that it is the obligation of the EU Commission and Member States to warn and inform Europe's citizens about the harmful nature of particular products or services and to regulate the European market so that these harmful products or services cannot appear on the market."
"I would like to conclude by congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs Iotova, and our colleagues from the Committee on International Trade and Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for the efficient way in which they drafted this resolution."
"in writing. - (SK) The crisis over risky mortgage loans has confirmed that the level of financial awareness among EU citizens is low."
"Consumers are not sufficiently familiar with the risks of bankruptcy and excessive debt."
"Information on financial products from financial institutions, mainly provided through advertisements, is hard to understand and sometimes confusing."
"They do not provide consumers with enough information prior to signing contracts."
"The job of informing consumers about finance and loans should begin in school, where the consumers of tomorrow should be familiarised with the products of the banking sector."
"Particular emphasis must be placed on programmes for young people, pensioners and vulnerable groups."
"I firmly believe that the Commission should create a budget item for financial education programmes at an EU level, which could bring together all of the relevant bodies, such as the state, non-governmental organisations, consumer organisations and financial institutions."
"I would like particularly to emphasise the role of the consumer organisations at a Community level and also at an intra-state level, since they know best the special needs of the target groups in the area of educational programmes."
"Many Member States fail to assign adequate funding in their budgets to consumer protection policies and fail to give attention or financial support to the activities of consumer organisations."
"There are few consumers who can afford the services of personal financial advisers and I therefore firmly believe that consumers should be provided with independent advice on proper training courses via EU educational programmes and within the framework of consumer organisations."
"I would like to congratulate Mrs Iotova for the subject matter dealt with by this report."
"I consider financial education to be a very important topic."
"At the moment in Romania, we are facing the problem of people who are no longer managing to pay their debts because they have taken out credit from different banks."
"Not only have they been badly advised about the implications of this credit, but they have not been given any kind of adequate financial education to allow them to decide which financial service might suit them better."
"We must not confuse financial education with information supplied to consumers."
"Financial education programmes need to be developed according to the age groups and needs of the various sections of the population."
"I hope that the Dolceta service will be translated into Romanian and Bulgarian as soon as possible so that all the citizens of the Member States can benefit from it."
"Consumer Markets Scoreboard (short presentation)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Anna Hedh, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the Consumer Markets Scoreboard."
"Mr President, The internal market is an extremely important part of the European cooperation, but for many consumers it is nothing more than a vague concept."
"Irrespective of how well we recognise its importance, rules and provisions, we are all consumers and are all affected by how the internal market operates."
"I have always maintained that if we have satisfied and confident European consumers, we will also have an internal market that operates efficiently and thrives."
"In order to win this trust, we must make the internal market more efficient and sensitive to citizens' expectations and problems."
"This does not necessarily mean more or stricter legislation and rules imposed by the EU."
"Information, education and self-regulation can often be a more appropriate and more effective solution."
"Irrespective of how we solve the problems, the aim must always be to ensure that we safeguard consumers' rights so that they can make good and well-founded decisions."
"This is, of course, also a good thing for the market itself."
"Therefore, the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection and I welcome the Consumer Markets Scoreboard that the Commission presented at the request of the Committee."
"We believe that it could be an important tool for the future development of consumer policy."
"The internal market comprises around 500 million consumers and has a large supply of goods and services."
"It is, of course, impossible to examine in detail all aspects of the internal market."
"It is therefore important to use analytic resources where they are actually needed most."
"I welcome the five areas that the Commission has focused on, namely complaints, price levels, satisfaction, switching and safety."
"These five main indicators are relevant and applicable, even if there will, over time, be a need to further develop and improve them and maybe also to include some new categories."
"I would also like to stress the importance of raising awareness of the Scoreboard amongst consumers themselves and the general public."
"It is therefore important for it to be written in an easily accessible language."
"Moreover, the Scoreboard should be visible on relevant websites."
"Finally, I would like to say that it will take time to develop the Scoreboard, partly because we have made very different degrees of progress in the different Member States with regard to consumer policy and consumer protection, but also because we are different, with different cultures and different traditions."
"We must be patient and give this Consumer Markets Scoreboard time."
"I would also like to take the opportunity to thank Commissioner Kuneva and her secretariat, as well as my own secretariat, for their extremely constructive cooperation."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Scoreboard initiative came into existence less than a year ago and during that time the Commission has greatly appreciated Parliament's interest and support."
"The Scoreboard has been the subject of many debates in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and we have learnt a lot from these debates and from the suggestions made."
"Thank you very much for all that, but especially thanks to Ms Anna Hedh for the excellent report."
"Let me reiterate briefly why the Consumer Market Scoreboard is so important for all of us."
"If we are to deliver to consumers, we need to be more responsive to their expectations and better understand the problems they are facing in their day-to-day lives."
"To do so, we need an evidence base that shows how markets perform in terms of economic and social outcomes for consumers, and how consumers behave on the market."
"Sound policy-making requires accurate data, and we fully share your view on this."
"The Scoreboard brings together evidence to identify markets that risk not delivering well for consumers and therefore need further attention."
"It also allows progress in retail market integration to be tracked, and helps to benchmark the consumer environment in Member States, particularly in terms of compliance with consumer legislation, enforcement, redress, and consumer empowerment."
"We share your views on which indicators to include in this Scoreboard, and we believe that the establishment of a harmonised EU-wide database of consumer complaints will be an essential step forward."
"It will allow us to detect problems in consumer markets at an early stage and, if necessary, to take appropriate action."
"The Commission firmly believes that it is important to include price data, since prices are one of consumers' principal concerns."
"The current political and economic climate further reinforces the need for good price data."
"We need to send a clear signal to our consumers that we are keeping an eye on how prices compare across the internal market."
"The Commission can assure you that it is fully aware of the complexity of this issue, and will of course interpret this data carefully and make sure the data are put in the right context."
"Prices may diverge across the internal market for sound economic reasons, but also because of market malfunctioning, and our aim is to find ways to tell the difference."
"We share Ms Hedh's view on the importance of close cooperation with Member States."
"This year, the Commission started to work together with national policy-makers, statistical offices, enforcement authorities and consumer organisations to further develop the Scoreboard indicators, and we will continue with this cooperation in the coming years."
"Ms Hedh has stressed that we should make this Scoreboard more accessible to a larger public and that we should raise awareness."
"The Commission accepts this point, and will step up efforts to do so."
"I invite you to see the results in the second edition of the Scoreboard."
"Finally, what the Commission wishes to take from Ms Hedh's report - although I could quote many other points if I had more time - is the wish for more empowerment indicators such as literacy and skills."
"Within the framework of Eurostat's revised European Social Survey Programme, the Commission plans to run a module on consumer empowerment through which it wants to measure consumer skills, consumer information and awareness of rights and assertiveness."
"This would allow us to start drawing up a statistical snapshot of Europe's citizens in their capacity as consumers."
"We see this as the main subject of the pilot project proposed by the Parliament for 2009."
"Let me conclude by again thanking Ms Hedh for the interest and support, not least in financial terms."
"That concludes this item."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (BG) I welcome Anna Hedh's report on the Consumer Markets Scoreboard and its aim of making the internal market more sensitive to the expectations and concerns of citizens."
"Over the past 19 years of Bulgaria's so-called democratic transition, we have had our fill of various privatisation solutions put forward by the ruling authorities in Bulgaria."
"A striking case is when proven thieves from the ČEZ Měření power company were allowed into the Bulgarian domestic market."
"The gentlemen of ČEZ, whom we of ATAKA have long identified as blatant gangsters, have been indicted in their own country."
"32 of their employees have been arrested for blackmailing customers whom they accused of stealing electricity."
"But obviously too busy with corruption, the tripartite coalition in Bulgaria did not consider this reason enough to throw these criminals out, as the governments of Canada and Hungary did, and so ČEZ continues to rob and blackmail the Bulgarian taxpayer under the guise of their neat little privatisation agreements."
"I believe that the adoption of the Consumer Markets Scoreboard will improve the tools for keeping tabs on sectors which need to be investigated for weaknesses and infringements, will involve the national consumer protection authorities in preserving the quality of social services, and will help to restore consumer confidence in the internal market."
"The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection of the European Parliament has the priority aim of improving the position of European consumers in the internal market."
"It is constantly calling on the Commission and the Member States to research what consumers think about the internal market and particularly what they need."
"The main precondition for an effective and well-functioning internal market is consumer confidence."
"Recognising the advantages of the evaluation table for the internal market which has been used since 1997, the committee has called on the Commission to submit a proposal for an evaluation table for consumer markets as an instrument for assessing the market from a consumer perspective as well."
"Complaints, pricing levels, satisfaction, interfaces and security are the five main indicators used in the evaluation table."
"The committee realises that since this will be the first ever evaluation table for consumer markets, some of these indicators will have to be replaced with new ones in the future."
"The indicator referring to pricing levels is particularly doubtful."
"I agree with the opinion of the rapporteur, Anna Hedh, that the table should be properly promoted through the media and placed on the relevant websites."
"My preference would be for the Commission to provide financial support for a public awareness campaign which would be carried out by the consumer organisations."
"Due to their experience in the area of consumer policy, they will know the best way to get the table across to consumers."
"I firmly believe that the table will have to capture the interest of consumers if it is to become an important instrument for the future development of consumer policy."
"Supporting early demonstration of sustainable power generation from fossil fuels (short presentation)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Christian Ehler Ehler, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on supporting early demonstration of sustainable power generation from fossil fuels."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a Brandenburger I would of course particularly like to greet Mrs Hübner."
"I would like to give a brief overview of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy's report on a Commission communication on CCS demonstration facilities."
"If we are to meet the energy and climate change targets adopted by the European Union, it is clear that one of the most decisive factors is reducing CO2 emissions, in which connection coal, as a fossil fuel, has an essential role to play."
"On the other hand, we in Europe are currently faced with a dilemma."
"We have three goals in environment and energy policy: the first is environmental protection, the second is security of supply, and the third is price stability, which goes hand in hand with security of supply and is particularly important in economically difficult times such as these."
"It is clear to all of us in Europe that coal is the only fossil fuel, Europe's only fossil energy source, that is thus strategically important for these three goals."
"However, without CCS technology, in other words without clean coal technology, this fuel will have no future."
"The Commission's proposal to support the urgently needed demonstration projects is therefore welcomed by the majority of the committee."
"The Commission has put a very sensible proposal on the table."
"We need - and the majority of the committee agrees on this - to provide incentives as quickly as possible for the use of CCS technology on an industrial scale."
"However, a majority in Parliament therefore feels - and we have said this quite explicitly - that financial support for clean coal technology is absolutely indispensable to Europe's energy and climate change goals."
"The proposal by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy is therefore very specific, with funds from the Seventh Framework Programme on research and also from anticipated emissions trading allowances to support the construction of at least 12 demonstration facilities."
"These facilities need to combine the various technologies with the various storage and transport options, and they should be spread as widely as possible across Europe."
"We are cautiously optimistic to see the first signs of movement from the Commission in the current trilogue negotiations on the CCS and ETS Directives."
"With the same cautious optimism, we take the view that we must manage, in the trilogue negotiations, not just to clarify the future framework conditions for CCS but also to lay solid foundations for funding the vital preliminary trial facilities."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I thank Mr Ehler very much for his report on the communication of the Commission on supporting early demonstration of sustainable power generation from fossil fuels."
"We appreciate the general support in the report for our policy objectives and for the recognition of the important role CCS can play in combating climate change worldwide."
"The report also clearly recognises the urgent need for up to 12 large-scale demonstration projects to make CCS commercially viable by 2020."
"Our communication has to be seen as a part of the complete and comprehensive climate and energy package which includes the CCS Directive, which sets the legal framework for allowing operation of CCS technologies in Europe, the emission trading system, which provides the economic and commercial framework for CCS, and the Commission's proposal that suggests that 20% of the auction revenues are earmarked by Member States for investment in low-carbon technologies, such as CCS."
"No matter what the final decision is, the auctioning revenues will be one of the substantial financing sources for CCS demonstration projects."
"Finally, our communication also suggests the creation at the beginning of 2009 of a European coordination structure to support CCS demonstration projects through knowledge-sharing, joint communication activities and other joint actions."
"I appreciate your general endorsement of the climate and energy package and especially the communication."
"However, the report also states that the efforts of the Commission might not be sufficient to reach the aim stated by the Council of having up to twelve demonstration projects."
"I understand this concern."
"To address the financing issue, an amendment to the ETS proposal has been adopted by the Committee on the Environment proposing to use EUR 500 million allowances from the new entrance reserve to finance CCS demonstration projects."
"The Commission has sent a policy option paper to Parliament in order to help build consensus in the Council, too, to ensure sufficient financing of low-carbon technologies."
"In the report two other issues are also raised with which the Commission cannot fully agree at this point in time."
"First, the report calls on the Commission to produce a detailed assessment of the costs and the share of private and public funding of each of the twelve demonstration facilities."
"Let me say in this context that the demonstration projects will only be identified after competitive tenders organised either at European or at Member State level."
"Cost assessments are currently underway but they can only provide rough cost estimates as each project is unique."
"Secondly, it also suggests the use of resources from the risk-sharing finance facility to support CCS."
"As resources here have been fully committed, as you know, any change would require amendments to the Seventh Framework Programme."
"So let me conclude by thanking you for the excellent work on the report, and I hope also that Parliament will keep the overall direction and objectives of the report in the vote."
"That concludes this item."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, one of the European Union's goals is an ambitious climate protection plan up to 2020, known as the 3 x 20 objective."
"The instruments for its implementation include the introduction of auctioning into the emission trading scheme and of CCS technologies after 2015."
"However, the emission limit of 500g CO2/kWh to be imposed after 2015 is technically unachievable, even for modern coal-fired power plants."
"It would therefore represent a sort of moratorium on building coal-fired power stations, and thus endanger energy security."
"CCS technologies could also be used in industries which generate large CO2 streams as a waste product, for instance in pig iron smelting."
"For this reason, Member States most dependent on coal should even now start building demonstration plants, so as to acquire the relevant experience."
"This will require immediate financial support, since any funds generated by emission trading after 2013 will arrive too late."
"In Poland, for instance, we should now be building two to three such facilities using different CCS technologies."
"What I have in mind are modern hard coal- or brown coal-fired power plants using different methods of CO2 storage in porous geological formations or underground reservoirs."
", in writing. - (HU) The question of carbon dioxide capture and storage is today an indispensable part of the discussions about climate change."
"We are talking about a very promising technology, which nevertheless has yet to earn the trust of society."
"Its future utilisation could serve as a sort of realistic compromise between the unavoidable use of fossil fuels and the aims of climate protection."
"Since carbon dioxide capture presupposes considerable long-term investments, it is crucial for the European Union to establish a consistent, stable legal framework."
"I think the climate package as amended by Parliament points in all the right directions in this regard."
"In a commendable turn, the relevant Parliamentary report proposes issuing free emission quotas to the 10-12 experimental power plants, instead of giving direct financial support."
"I deem it imperative that the power plants entitled to free quotas be designated by the European Commission according to the principle of regional balance."
"I agree with the rapporteur that in order to promote the new technologies, sources for new research and development must be substantially strengthened - at both Member State and EU levels."
"EU support cannot be a substitute for efforts by the private sector."
"Provided that carbon capture and storage is really a viable solution, there will be companies willing to take an active role in making the necessary investments."
"In addition, it is important to note that support for carbon capture should not divert funds from sustainable energy sources."
"The technology being discussed here may be feasible but is by no means the only solution for limiting the effects of climate change."
"Agenda of the next sitting: see Minutes"
"Closure of the sitting"
"(The sitting was closed at 11.10 p.m.)"
"Opening of the sitting"
"(The sitting was opened at 9 a.m.)"
"Debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law (announcement of motions for resolutions tabled): see Minutes"
"Decision on urgent procedure"
"Madam President, this discussion will take place this evening, if the plenary votes in favour of the urgent procedure on this issue."
"This is an amendment to European legislation that enables us to grant facilities for balances of payments, for countries outside the euro zone."
"As we are all aware, the issue at hand is that of Hungary but, unfortunately, I believe that we must look ahead and therefore enhance this facility of the European Union to provide assistance to its Member States, including those that lie outside the euro zone."
"I would therefore ask the plenary assembly to kindly vote in favour of this urgent procedure."
"Support schemes for farmers under the CAP - Modifications to the common agricultural policy - Support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development - Community strategic guidelines for rural development (2007 to 2013) (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the report by Luis Manuel Capoulas Santos, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing common rules for direct support schemes for farmers under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers - C6-0240/2008 -;"
"the report by Luis Manuel Capoulas Santos, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation on modifications to the common agricultural policy by amending Regulations (EC) No 320/2006, (EC) No 1234/2007, (EC) No 3/2008 and (EC) No [...]/2008 - C6-0241/2008 -;"
"the report by Luis Manuel Capoulas Santos, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) - C6-0242/2008 -;"
"the report by Luis Manuel Capoulas Santos, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council decision amending Decision 2006/144/EC on the Community strategic guidelines for rural development (programming period 2007 to 2013) - C6-0239/2008 -."
"rapporteur. - (PT) Madam President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to welcome you all at the start of this debate."
"This is the final act in a long and participatory process of discussion and reflection on the present and future of the common agricultural policy (CAP)."
"It has proved very arduous work which has involved, over many months, in fact over more than a year, a great deal of cooperation by Parliament, the Council, the Commission and the whole agricultural and rural world in the European Union."
"Throughout this period, I have had the opportunity to hear many opinions of organisations representing the agricultural sector and the rural world in various Member States and to dialogue with members of parliament and institutional representatives from many, in fact almost all, Member States and Community institutions, obviously starting here with the European Parliament."
"I have taken part in various seminars and conferences and listened carefully to everyone, including through the media, in my search for the best possible synthesis."
"I must therefore thank all my colleagues who have enthusiastically participated in this debate and also all the political group coordinators."
"In particular I must highlight the role played by Mr Goepel, not only as coordinator of the PPE-DE Group, but also as rapporteur on the own-initiative report which preceded the reports being discussed here today."
"I must also thank Chairman Parish for the way in which he conducted the work in our committee and for the excellent cooperation of the secretariat of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, given that they bore the hardest and most technically demanding part of the work."
"Finally, I must thank the Commission, as represented by the Commissioner, for its readiness to cooperate, as also demonstrated by its departments, and also Mr Barnier for the way in which he continually corresponded with Parliament, even before the formal start of the French Presidency."
"This exercise in enhanced cooperation has proved a good early example of the virtues of codecision, which I hope may enter into force on the full ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, hopefully as soon as possible."
"This debate, with all its inherent agreements and disagreements, clearly shows the complexity of European agriculture in all its variety."
"It also shows, in exemplary fashion, the importance that Europe, its institutions and Parliament in particular attach to this subject."
"The 1 170 amendments tabled to the Commission's proposals, particularly taking into account the fact that the period available was interrupted by the summer recess, illustrate the wide participation of Members in this debate."
"However, the compromises reached between four of the main political groups in Parliament, with nearly 400 amendments on the most important issues being concentrated into six compromises, also reveal the Members' sense of responsibility, spirit of compromise and readiness to yield ground."
"As for the content of the report, which I regard as fairly balanced and capable of responding to current challenges and providing good guidelines for the future, I must say that Parliament acknowledges as positive and accepts many of the Commission's proposals."
"I would highlight the following: confirmation of the need for a common policy as a prerequisite for competitive and environmentally sustainable agriculture in Europe; the contributions made by the Commission to ensure that the CAP is fairer and more acceptable to society; the emphasis on simplification and cutting of red tape; confirmation of the proposal to give more freedom of choice to farmers in defining their productive options; financial reinforcement of rural development and expansion of its scope to the new challenges (energy, climate, water, biodiversity); introduction of the principle of progressive modulation; additional flexibility granted to Member States in managing the CAP (I am talking about Article 68); creation of a risk and crisis management system with Community cofinancing, and the positive general direction taken in discussions on the post-2013 model and in the European Union's response to the World Trade Organization negotiations, aimed at a fair and reciprocal agreement for regulated international trade in agricultural products."
"However, the Commission's proposals also contain aspects which Parliament, and I as rapporteur, regard as less positive."
"As I have already mentioned on other occasions, the Commission's proposals contain, in some aspects, for example with regard to the market management instruments and the milk sector, an overly liberal tone which may prove dangerous just at a time when there is enormous instability and volatility in the markets."
"There is also a lack of social sensitivity, which is quite clear in the proposal to exclude small farmers."
"I also think that the Commission's proposal with regard to social and territorial cohesion is off course, given that it suggests ending the payment redistribution mechanism under the new modulation."
"I also think that the Commission has not taken due account of certain sectors which are particularly vulnerable to the current crisis in the markets and which face a serious risk of abandonment given the proposed timetable and rate of decoupling up to 2013."
"This is the case with the sheep sector and that is why we have agreed to call these small CMOs (common organisation of the markets) as, although small, they are very significant and very politically, economically and socially important to certain regions of Europe where alternatives are very hard to find."
"The report and the vote in the Committee on Agriculture aimed, by a large majority, to correct some of these less positive aspects."
"The five compromises adopted in relation to the key elements of modulation are important proposals by Parliament."
"These are: the percentage and progressive nature of support for small farmers, giving greater freedom to Member States to set the minimum thresholds; the retention percentage under Article 68 and the enlargement of its scope; the broader scope of the insurance system, which is extended to the fishing industry; the issue of cofinancing of rural development, and the expansion of new challenges."
"Many other proposals by Parliament also represent positive contributions."
"I would highlight, for example, valuation of the employment factor in calculating the allocation of aid and respect for health and safety at work requirements in relation to the conditions for receiving said aid."
"The Committee on Agriculture also adopted a very clear position on the most difficult aspect of this issue, namely the milk sector."
"This is a very important issue which must be carefully tackled, given the current market situation."
"Despite the profound respect that I have for all points of view, some of which are totally contrary to mine in certain areas, but which still deserve to be respected, I feel that the position adopted in the Committee on Agriculture is fairly sensible."
"I should like to see this adopted in plenary and confirmed by the Council with the backing of the Commission."
"A prudent increase in production in two years' time, adding to the 2% that we have decided on for 2008, and a final decision early in 2010 on the future of the sector, based on market developments, with a 4% increase in three years' time, seems to me to be a fairly sensible position and perhaps the one which could form the final compromise."
"I will end, Madam President, by stating my hope that this debate will serve to clarify positions and that we will able to achieve the consensus that agriculture and farmers expect from us."
"I hope that we all - Parliament, the Council and the Commission - are up to this challenge."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am extremely pleased to visit this House again and to visit you at a crucial moment, since both Parliament and the Council are seeking a definitive position on this issue of the health check of the common agricultural policy."
"We are well aware that this health check is not a fundamental change in approach, as the reform of 2003 was, but a significant adjustment of that reform to a highly changeable situation."
"In particular, it makes it possible to respond to a situation that was genuinely unimaginable a few years ago."
"Indeed, who could have imagined market trends since 2008, which have led to a drastic increase in agricultural prices and caused, as we are well aware, food riots just about all over the world?"
"This situation has shown the extent to which agriculture remains, for our European continent, a strategic asset, and how much the concept of food sovereignty makes sense in this context of increased volatility in the prices of agricultural products."
"However, while the health check only concerns amendments, there are nonetheless many and they are complex, and they form, for us all, a package that is difficult to complete."
"The Council has already done a lot of work at all levels to settle many issues."
"In this regard, I should like to offer my sincerest thanks for the valuable work carried out by the Slovenian Presidency, which has made it possible to make a very constructive start to work, particularly with regard to the Commission communication."
"Furthermore, ladies and gentlemen, it is your rapporteurs, Lutz Goepel and Luis Manuel Capoulas Santos, who have done this work on the communication regarding the legislative proposals, on behalf of Parliament."
"I should like to offer both of you my sincerest thanks for the quality of your respective reports, which were very thorough and full of proposals."
"As you know, I have wanted to work with the European Parliament from the beginning."
"I also had experience of working with it when I had the honour of being, for five years, European Commissioner responsible for regional policy and the institutions, and, as I told you, I wanted to work on this issue in the spirit of future codecision."
"I have taken a very keen interest in the subsequent work Parliament has carried out in parallel with the work of the Council, and we have all had what we could call a kind of enhanced dialogue between us."
"In this regard, I have had very productive and regular discussions on the status of the negotiation, with the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and within Parliament - almost 50 hours of meetings with the European Parliament or among colleagues."
"At each decisive stage of the negotiation, we met with the Council, on 27 September and 22 October, after the vote in the Committee on Agriculture, and on 4 November to deal with the final phase of the negotiation and the proceedings of the October Council."
"At this point, ladies and gentlemen, I should like specifically to thank the Chairman of your committee, Neil Parish, for his active cooperation throughout this process."
"I should also like to thank your group chairmen, Lutz Goepel, Luis Manuel Capoulas Santos, Niels Busk, Friedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf, Vincenzo Aita and Sergio Berlato."
"Since we now hold the Presidency, we have regularly kept the Council informed, at ministerial level and at a technical level, of the status of Parliament's work."
"For example, at our last meeting of the Council of Ministers in Luxembourg, I personally informed each minister, in writing, of Parliament's position regarding each of the items we had to discuss within the Council."
"Tomorrow, after you have given your opinion, we, together with Mariann Fischer Boel, will be able to seek a political agreement within this Council."
"Before starting, and I mean before starting, the last phase of negotiations, I shall inform the ministers of the outcome of your vote on the health check."
"As ever, ladies and gentlemen, finding a compromise is not easy, since there are many significant points outstanding."
"These are divisive issues but we are determined - the Presidency is determined - to find, together with the Commission, and in the light of your vote, the best possible dynamic compromise."
"The work within the Council has shown that, on many issues, we, as ministers, have similar concerns to those of Parliament."
"I shall take two examples: firstly, the search for increased flexibility for Article 68; secondly, the retention of exceptional market measures in the event of health crises, Article 44 of the Single CMO Regulation, which will be incorporated in the final compromise."
"I can assure you, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, that, among the most sensitive issues, there are at least two that are extremely sensitive: the issue of milk and the issue of modulation."
"In the Council, we have had debates every bit as in-depth, passionate and lively as those that I have heard or observed here, in Parliament."
"The same concerns have been expressed in both our forums."
"This morning's debate and tomorrow's vote on the health check are therefore very important steps that demonstrate, once again, the vital role of Parliament, which Parliament must continue to fulfil."
"In any event, it is in this spirit, namely in the spirit of this enhanced dialogue, in the spirit of codecision, that, for several months, I have wanted to work on behalf of the Presidency."
"That is why I am very pleased, as no doubt the Commissioner is too, to listen to you this morning, to answer some of your questions and to have this final discussion with you."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, first of all, before going into the more detailed content of this discussion, I would like to thank Mr Capoulas Santos for all the work that has been done on the report."
"I certainly do not underestimate the hard work and, as Mr Capoulas Santos mentioned himself, the number of amendments certainly did not make the task any easier in trying to find the middle ground for the landing zone."
"We have now spent more than a year together discussing the health check, sometimes in very great detail, firstly on the basis of the Goepel report, and now finally on the basis of the Capoulas Santos report."
"I do not think I need to explain my gratitude for the constructive cooperation I have always had with Parliament, and that we have always tried to listen and find a compromise that was not too far away from each other."
"As I have limited time, it will be totally impossible for me to go into all the details so I will concentrate on some of the more important ones, starting with the milk sector."
"2007 has been a very, perhaps strange, but certainly instructive year."
"One thing we learnt during 2007 was that our quota system did not allow supply to meet demand."
"As a consequence, we saw prices on dairy products simply go through the roof."
"Quite a few farmers said to me this was nice as long as it lasted, but the result was that because of increased production responding clearly to the higher prices, we then saw a very steep drop in prices."
"I think we can agree today that the sector is really struggling to get back some of the customers that left the milk or dairy sector because they thought prices were too high."
"I see therefore that Parliament is proposing an increase of 1% but only for two years, so a 2% increase taken forward to 2010."
"I think it is important that we review the consequences of the decisions that we will be taking in the dairy sector, but 2010 will be too early and I think we should stick to 2011, whilst clearly indicating that we will be open to discussing everything in 2011."
"The fact is, however, that the quota system expires in 2015."
"I have also learned from all the discussions we have had that there is strong pressure to get this milk fund."
"I agree that certain flanking measures should be adapted or adopted, and I am convinced that quite a lot can be done in the new Article 68."
"I acknowledge that the present Article 69 is much too narrow and too restrictive to be used in a forward-looking way, so we are now opening up possibilities in the new Article 68."
"If we can reach a good combination between Article 68 and the new rural development possibilities, then I am quite sure we will find solutions to the specific problems we see in some regions."
"On the single payment scheme, on de-coupling, the Commission proposes that we maintain the possibility to couple the payment in two or three areas - suckler cows, sheep and goats - because we acknowledge that you do face specific problems in those three areas."
"You also want to keep coupled payments for the male bovine premium, for protein crops and for dried fodder."
"My fundamental view is that it is important to decouple the system - this is actually a fundamental element of all the reforms that have been undertaken - and we need to look again at simplification to take any opportunity to simplify our system."
"I am, however, open to finding a solution that is less complicated than what we have suggested."
"We have suggested a two-step decoupling approach and I might be willing, together with the presidency, to do this in one step but postpone it until 2012 - the last application year - so the effect will be for the 2013 budget year."
"You had a point in asking why we should make it more complicated than necessary."
"As I said, Article 68 is to be used as a more flexible instrument but with certain limitations, because you want a situation where you can couple 10%."
"I think we should be careful not to have a situation where you decouple via the back door, via Article 68."
"Last but not least on modulation, on rural development and the new challenges, I think we all agree that we need more money to face these new challenges."
"Climate change is at the top of our list."
"Then we need to find new ways on how to manage our water."
"Water is a scarce resource, but an extremely important one for agriculture, especially in some of our southern regions, so we need to use new technologies to use water in the most intelligent way possible to avoid wasting water."
"This could be done, but certainly needs money."
"That is the reason why I have proposed this transfer from the first to the second pillar: 8% phased in over the years."
"I know that we might come back tomorrow on a compromise on this issue, but I would emphasise that money will certainly be needed, as it will be for biodiversity and for the milk axes that we have been putting into the system."
"I will not go into details on progressive modulation."
"I know your views and I know that you say now '1, 2, 3'."
"I am sure that we will again be able to find a decent compromise on this issue."
"I have only touched on some of the major issues, and I am sure that I will have the opportunity to respond after the debate, but I am committed, together with the presidency, to finding a decent compromise."
"We all know that you never get everything you want, so I think that it will be a question for all of us to accept that we have to 'swallow some camels' to be able to find a compromise that will be to the benefit of the European agricultural sector in a more globalised world."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. - (NL) Madam President, whilst the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety sets great store by being a reliable authority, this does not mean that you cannot implement major changes; what it does mean, though, is that you have to announce them well in advance and that people should also be offered alternatives."
"Last year, the European Commission submitted a communication about the state of health of the common agricultural policy, which is in need of radical reform."
"The intention was to make drastic cuts in direct subsidies and to increase output in terms of environmental protection and employment."
"We were ultimately disappointed by how the proposals were fleshed out, involving, as they do, a number of insignificant cuts on direct subsidies."
"Farmers should not be subsidised according to past yields or land ownership."
"The Environment Committee would like to see this done for the public services they provide, such as extending biodiversity and water management, and for their activities benefiting the environment, animal welfare and food safety that go above and beyond the statutory requirements."
"We would like to see this in place from 2020."
"This evening, we are discussing the decline in bee stocks."
"In order to improve this situation, it will be necessary to cut down on the use of sprays, and biodiversity will need to be promoted by introducing buffer zones."
"Gen technology and the intensive unilateral agriculture are a problem in this connection."
"I hope that this evening, as we did this morning, we will commit to a type of agriculture in which arable farming and nature reinforce each other."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have made some progress towards free agricultural markets, both in terms of opening up market regulations and the social and economic cushioning of European policies."
"I expressly welcome the fact that the Commission has already taken a positive stance in relation to several proposals from the Parliament."
"I would also like to thank the rapporteur, who has taken up many of the proposals from the Committee on Regional Development in relation to modulation and rural development."
"However, one concern remains for us: we want to exempt more small farms from the additional cuts in resources."
"The Committee on Regional Development and a large number of other colleagues believe that the exemption limit should be increased to a maximum of EUR 10 000."
"Commissioner, contrary to the opinion expressed by others, with which we are all familiar, this is not a ridiculous proposal."
"On the contrary, our proposal is very serious because it aims to allow farms to plan with certainty as they enter the market economy, and also keeps the promises set out in the agricultural reforms of 2003."
"Smaller farms have been particularly affected by market turbulence in recent months."
"For this reason, we should offer them political support."
"Of course, this programme could restrict special programmes in specific sectors."
"Nonetheless, we must be aware of the fault in the system."
"We cannot cut premiums for dairy farmers on the one hand and then point to the milk fund financed in this way as a rescue option."
"If money is needed for these structural changes, it must be found in unused agricultural and structural funds."
"Agricultural policy will remain contradictory and imponderable as long as it continues to be pushed back and forth in this way."
"Therefore, we, the Committee on Regional Development, are calling for planning security for the rural development programmes and for farmers' incomes."
"Both of these will only be possible if we strictly separate the operational approach of compensation payments from regional programmes in the future."
"We would now like to see proposals in this direction from the Commission."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, goodness knows that two minutes is very little time in which to deal with one year's conscientious work on this health check."
"There are just a few points I would like to make."
"To remind you: in November 2007, the Commission indicated 8% modulation plus 45% degression."
"A figure of 4% progressive modulation, that is to say modulation depending on farm size in the Goepel report, was indicated."
"We then heard 8% basic modulation and 9% progressive modulation for a total of 17% as an offer proposed by the Commission and we have recently reached a figure of 5% during voting in committee."
"It was important to us that all modulation resources should remain in the region and should be used, irrespective of the size of the farm or its legal form."
"Commissioner, you called for more flexibility for the Member States during the system changeover."
"This would mean more opportunities to introduce further decoupling and a move away from historical reference values."
"In principle I agree with this."
"Debates within the committee have shown that this is not advisable in all areas, as should be remembered in relation to the area of crops in particular as we move away from smaller market organisations."
"New challenges and increasing global mobility in the markets require new, flexible mechanisms."
"In the dairy sector, we have also succeeded in redefining Article 68 so as to support disadvantaged regions."
"Finally we come to milk, the most complicated matter in this evaluation."
"Because it is so complicated, I would have preferred us to have dealt with this complex of dairy-related issues with options and complementary measures as a complex report when quotas are abolished in 2010 or 2011."
"However, the milk fund is sizable and will provide additional support to dairy farmers, particularly in disadvantaged areas."
"The promotion of investments for dairy farmers without a tied quota throughout the EU should not be scoffed at, as it would reduce the purchasing pressure experienced by businesses."
"I have one last personal point: I would like to thank my team for their success in bringing this package to a conclusion by the end of my active period as a Member of Parliament under the French Presidency."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Commissioner, Minister, Mr Capoulas Santos, I should like, then, to speak and, as Mr Goebbels said, two minutes on such an important report is not long."
"What I would like to say is quite simple."
"I would first like to defend the balance of the report proposed today by Mr Capoulas Santos."
"It was necessary to update the common agricultural policy, which is the aim of the health check, but, at the same time, it was equally necessary to retain the unity of this policy at European level while allowing it to continue to be a policy that sets agricultural objectives throughout Europe."
"It is this balance that I now intend to defend by taking four examples."
"The first example is that of milk quotas, which have provoked debate, and, I say this sincerely, in my view the position that was found is the right one."
"We need to remain cautious on this issue."
"All those who want to act quickly to increase the quantities produced and get rid of market-based mechanisms, run the significant risk of seeing the price of milk fall and letting themselves in for extremely cumbersome restructuring work."
"The decoupling of aid: here too, we have found a position that, in my view, is balanced."
"Total decoupling jeopardises many kinds of production."
"We must protect the different kinds of production in Europe: sheep, cattle, goat and small-scale vegetable production."
"With regard to regulation mechanisms, we can in fact go down the road of insurance, but we must also retain public mechanisms that enable prevention and regulation; this is what is in this report, and that, in my view, is very important."
"Finally, with regard to the overall development of aid and the manner in which we go about it, I should like to say that, in modulating and limiting Article 68, important steps have been taken; they are a move in the right direction towards a condition, to ensure that our global agricultural production model moves towards sustainability."
"We must bear in mind maintaining an operating model that is based on individuals or groups and that takes account of three objectives, namely economic, ecological and social objectives."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DA) Madam President, the health check was marketed as a way to provide simplification and to remove bureaucracy."
"These were the key headlines when we started our debate."
"It was also proclaimed that we would make agriculture within the EU ready for increased free trade - and especially for the new period after 2013 when the current agreement period is due to expire."
"At the same time, it was also very important for us in Europe to assume our part of the responsibility for producing quality food - not only for European consumers, but for the whole world, in particular the increasing part of the world's population that is demanding food."
"The milk sector was the sector in which we were actually going to test whether we in Europe were ready to fit in with the requirements of increased production."
"In this regard, I think that it is disappointing to be part of the debate on whether we should begin the so-called 'soft landing' and give the milk producers who want to the opportunity to increase their milk production."
"For me this is a signal that we in Europe are not particularly ready for the change that tomorrow and, in particular, the period after 2013 will require."
"With regard to simplification and the reduction of bureaucracy - to make it easier to be a farmer - we have to say that it is not particularly easy to find clear or abundant examples of how we have simplified the situation or reduced the bureaucracy."
"The whole problem of cross-compliance, where there are currently large differences between Member States, is an area where, in my opinion, we clearly need to bring about an improvement."
"The most important point is that this review of agricultural policy should, in my opinion, give a much clearer indication of the direction we want agriculture to take when the agreement period expires in 2013."
"A positive element is the rural district policy, and here it is naturally important that the modulated resources remain in rural districts so that they can actually be of benefit."
"Finally, I would have welcomed it - and I also think that it would have benefited European agriculture - if we in Parliament had stuck more closely to the proposal tabled by the Commission quite a while ago."
"Madam President, two brothers were given a bag of sweets by their parents."
"'Let us share them out fairly,' said the older brother, to which the younger one replied, 'I would rather we shared them equally.'"
"This story describes the relations between the old and the new Member States when it comes to agriculture."
"Old States receive more, and new ones several times less."
"We understand that this is a transition period, but why should this situation persist beyond 2013?"
"Why should the new States continue to receive proportionally two or three times less than the old States?"
"We keep hearing that this is fair, and that there are historical reasons for this."
"But we do not want fairness, we want equality."
"There was some justification for the inequalities under the production subsidies system, which favoured farmers who produced more."
"However, now that we have moved to area subsidies, there is no further justification for this discrimination."
"It must end after 2013 and there must be no division into old and new members."
"We, the new members, want to be old too!"
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, these discussions are taking place in unfavourable circumstances."
"If the Irish had voted sensibly, we would have had a say on agricultural issues and on agricultural finances as of 1 January 2009."
"At present, our discussions are still taking place under the old dispensation, even though the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Barnier, has agreed to our participation."
"This is a kind offer, but remains merely a pious wish because things are as they are."
"This is also apparent in the draft documents from the Commission."
"The first draft that Mr Goepel edited as rapporteur - he gave us the figures a few minutes ago - provided for a major degression: 10, 25, 45."
"We in Parliament digested these figures and added the labour costs subject to special insurance contributions."
"This would have involved a redistribution that would have set an example for 2013."
"Our fear now is that in 2013 we will face a linear decrease."
"In relation to the figures currently being mentioned by the Commission it must be said that the mountain has given birth to a mouse."
"This proposal is lukewarm at best and has nothing to do with the diagnosis you correctly offered and with which I agree."
"Earlier, you reiterated the key points: water, climate, genetic diversity, renewable energies and dairy production."
"All of these areas must be considered, but the action you propose is quite ridiculous."
"Let me deal briefly with the dairy sector."
"You will be aware of the situation in relation to the dairy industry."
"A milk surplus exists and prices have fallen to catastrophic levels."
"Your proposal is to speed things up and to increase production opportunities."
"However, a market economy means producing in line with demand."
"What you propose would be a bit like the automobile industry reducing or abolishing the Christmas break and organising an extra shift to increase the stockpile of cars."
"This approach is misguided and I support what Mr Goepel said earlier, namely that it would make sense not to regulate dairy production now in the context of the health check, but rather when we finally have the market analyses which have been promised for so long, but which have still not materialised, and that we should then come to a reasonable conclusion in the dairy sector that will suit the market and the requirements of farmers."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that today's debate and the vote that will follow represent an important stage for Community policy on agriculture."
"I believe that there is a need, because of what has happened in recent years, and chiefly in the last two years, for an even stronger common agricultural policy (CAP) in Europe."
"Instead, through this lengthy work and the work that Mr Capoulas Santos has carried out, we have tackled some issues, but we have done so within an old system."
"The issues that have become central over these last two years are, for Europe, the following two issues, which I would like to stress."
"We started with the health check on the CAP, carried out in 2003."
"Some data should give us pause to reflect whether we are on the right road in our work, even though excellent work has been done over this year and a half."
"We are losing a huge number of jobs in employment, approximately - from Eurostat data up until 2005, so we do not know what has happened in 2007 and 2008 - two million employees, whom we have lost in this stable, seasonal and familiar employment sector."
"The number of holdings that we lost between 2003 and 2005 - again according to Eurostat data - is 611 000."
"At a time like this, of economic crisis, it happens that the Member States intervene strongly with the banks and industry, but in no country is a debate going on about the state of agriculture, because everything is expected to be achieved by Community policy and the CAP."
"Through the action we are taking, I believe that we are going against the real needs of farmers and the action that they in fact require: namely, to help these businesses to emerge from a situation of subordination to processing and marketing, because the other fact - and I am just finishing - is that the agricultural companies have lost income share over the last two or three years, to the benefit of the transformation of the marketing industry."
"These were the issues that we ought to have tackled, and on this point the assessment is very negative with regard to what we will be voting on in the Chamber the day after tomorrow."
"Madam President, financial discrimination against family farms and against new Member States are two basic mechanisms of the common agricultural policy which weaken the EU and conflict with its principal aims."
"The proposed changes do not do away with those mechanisms."
"How can we reform European agriculture fairly if we ignore 95% of all farms?"
"These 95% are family farms, no larger than 50 ha."
"However, they receive only the leftovers of the EU's agricultural subsidy pot."
"The richest farmers, of whom there are only 1%, receive over EUR 9 billion, in other words, more than 90% of all farms."
"This policy hits at family farms, which are the backbone of European agriculture."
"The outcome of the current and proposed agricultural policy will be continued depopulation of the countryside, environmental degradation and loss of food security for regions, states and the EU as a whole."
"- (SK) The Commission proposals for monitoring the health of the common agricultural policy (CAP) were formulated under conditions quite different from those under which we find ourselves today."
"Today we must pay greater attention especially to steadying the increasing volatility of agricultural markets, accelerating the process of alignment with world prices, emphasising the irreplaceable role of agriculture in society, strengthening the systems of the CAP and above all making better use of the potential of the discriminated agriculture of new Member States."
"The amendments tabled by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have unfortunately provided only a partial correction to the Commission's inadequate response to the acute needs we face today."
"For example, the Commission has pushed through the implementation of progressive modulation in an attempt to demonstrate to EU citizens its ability to eliminate high farming support levels."
"This is contrary to the increasing need for higher intensity of production factors concentration."
"However, it is totally absurd not to be willing to accept proposals to treat farms not as the property of landlords, but as rational and viable federations of small landowners who would not be able to compete with each other."
"Hence each individual shareholder has to be accepted as one farmer."
"I therefore call on Mr Barnier, President-in-Office of the Council, to make some room in Council debates for a proposed solution to this problem."
"Madam President, let me begin by offering my thanks to Commissioner Mariann Fischer Boel;"
"Mr Barnier, President-in-Office of the Council; Mr Capoulas Santos, rapporteur; and also Lutz Goepel, for the cooperation we have had, as well as all members of the committee for their hard work, because we are 27 Member States and, whilst we do not quite have 27 positions on this report, we do still have quite a number, and we came together in committee to reach what I consider is a sensible compromise."
"Let me also thank the Commissioner for her cooperation and help and in particular Michel Barnier, because we have had enhanced cooperation, if not codecision."
"We have to move forward now and adopt a report and reach a compromise and a position in order that farmers in Europe know exactly where they are going."
"There is a need for the production of food - we saw that clearly last year - and we need to free up farmers from bureaucracy; we need simplification."
"We also need farmers to make business decisions for themselves."
"So we have to move forward."
"Yes, we need some crisis management, but we must not return to the days of having intervention - the balance must be right."
"Many of us fly around Europe and when we land we like a soft landing, and milk quotas also need a soft landing."
"We do need to free up the market."
"The Commissioner said that last year there was a demand for dairy products, this year not so much - but next year there could be a greater demand again and we need the flexibility to meet it."
"Agriculture and the rural environment are one and the same and we have to move to make sure that we deal with climate change and the management of water, that we look at biofuels and biogas and that we really put Europe in a good position."
"We must not go backwards, because we are in a good position when it comes to the WTO."
"Let us go forward and actually reform the agricultural policy."
"Madam President, I would first of all like to add my thanks to our rapporteur for all his hard work on this delicate subject."
"However, despite his great efforts, I am afraid that I and my national delegation cannot support this report."
"I believe that the CAP is in need of radical reform."
"It needs to move away from the old direct subsidy route to a system that is market orientated and that values rural sustainability and the environment, and recognises efficient farming instead of propping up inefficient farming."
"Whilst this report in itself is not a major reform document, it does set the tone for future reforms beyond 2013."
"That is why I am disappointed in the outcome of the vote in the Agriculture Committee, which yet again - it appears to me - has resulted in that committee turning its back on a fundamental reform of this discredited system."
"In particular, I highlight compulsory modulation."
"I cannot support a position that will see less money going to rural development and furthermore removes the need for Member States to cofinance new modulation money."
"I also cannot support the Committee view that we should also step back from full decoupling, but I reserve my biggest fear for the Commission."
"Your position, Commissioner, on compulsory modulation is right."
"Your position on decoupling is right."
"For once, we have a Commission that seriously wants to reform the CAP, but faces a Parliament that always fails to deliver on this issue and believes that the challenges we face could be solved by sticking to the old discredited system."
"Hang tough, Commissioner, you are right and, sadly, I suspect this Chamber will be wrong."
"(NL) Madam President, as you are aware, I am less than enthusiastic about all the health check proposals."
"If I was a farmer, and I had calculated in 2005 what to expect up until 2013, then I could expect - if you will bear with me - an 8% cut due to modulation, a 10% cut due to the national reserve and potentially a 9% cut due to capping high bonuses, so a total cut of 27%."
"How can an average farmer in future rely on a European government that delivers on its promise?"
"Mrs Buitenweg said the 27% was inconsequential, but I think it is a fair chunk out of what was promised."
"I am also opposed to this modulation, therefore, and I would prefer the capping of these total bonuses to be much more limited."
"As for this national reserve, I think we should seize the one opportunity that we have, namely we should develop an insurance scheme that provides cover against animal and plant diseases as soon as possible across the whole of Europe."
"Sooner or later, as a result of people travelling so much, Europe will face another contagious animal disease, and our budgets are not prepared for this."
"If this were to happen again, I would not know where the Commission would get the money from."
"This is where an insurance scheme would come in."
"With regard to milk quotas, we can only note that an increasing number of markets are developing internationally."
"It is not a good thing for Europe, I think, if we were to say to the Americans or the Brazilians, for example, that that market would be theirs if they wanted it."
"We should take part in it too, which is why a soft landing of the milk quotas is necessary."
"We could take three measures: reduce the superlevy, gradually increase the quotas and settlement, every year, of what has not reached full milking capacity among the farmers that have milked to full capacity and have even exceeded capacity."
"(LT) First of all, I would like to thank all those who worked so hard on what are complicated, important and, in my opinion, the most important law-making projects of the year, especially rapporteur Mr Capoulas Santos."
"I do not have much time, so I can only touch on the most important questions which concern farmers in my country."
"First of all, there is the equalisation of direct payments after 13 years."
"This is very important and if we are talking about solidarity, honest competition and the common market, then we must behave accordingly."
"We must ensure that support is allocated correctly."
"The second very important thing is the necessity to abolish the restrictions on land area according to the condition of 30 June 2003."
"If we are talking about food shortages, world famine and finally biofuels, then let us allow farmers to exploit the opportunities of existing resources."
"Most importantly, we must protect the funding of the European Union's common agricultural policy and not allow the fragmentation of the agricultural budget to the benefit of all sorts of dubious ideas."
"Madam President, I congratulate and thank all colleagues in bringing us to a successful conclusion today."
"But I would echo colleagues' disappointment that we could have gone a bit further and been a bit more ambitious, but let us remember that the health check was only ever about a health check: the fundamental reform will come later and that is what we need to focus on today."
"As we look towards 2013 there is certainly a lot to do, because we have a common agricultural policy that, like any good compromise, leaves nobody particularly happy."
"So I pick up on Neil Parish's comments, and Mr Pieper's also, that we need to look towards the future about what the common agricultural policy is designed to achieve."
"We need to bring the reform of the Structural Funds particularly into this discussion, because the CAP as it stands is overcomplicated, convoluted and difficult to get public support for, whereas the Structural Funds would be a much cheaper, more effective way to deliver public environmental goods."
"We need to remember that the CAP is about the provision of direct support to producers of quality local food."
"If we remember that, we will not go far wrong."
"That is the big prize and today is a step on the road towards that."
"(PT) It is with some concern that we are participating in this debate on further modifications to the common agricultural policy (CAP) as, in essence, these aim to ensure greater liberalisation and subordination to the international markets, without taking into account that agriculture is a strategic sector and that food security and sovereignty are fundamental in guaranteeing quality food for the population of our countries."
"Likewise, the lack of social sensitivity with which this whole reform is being pursued, without taking into account the current serious unemployment situation, is unacceptable."
"This is threatening to destroy what remains of family-based agriculture, with the reduction in support for small farmers, the announcement of the end of the milk quota system, the renationalisation of the CAP and the continued injustices in the allocation of support being particularly serious."
"We therefore insist on the proposals that we have tabled to guarantee support for producing farmers, to combat instability in productive sectors due to price variations and to prevent the decline in the rural world and the desertification of many regions."
"(EL) Madam President, firstly we have a debt of gratitude to our colleague Mr Luis Manuel Capoulas Santos and to everyone else involved in producing this praiseworthy report."
"The Greek rural areas in which people working with tobacco live are the poorest in Greece;"
"I fear that they are also the poorest in Europe in absolute terms."
"The people who live there have no work other than tobacco and they are asking for nothing more than for the tobacco scheme to be extended to at least 2013."
"They are also asking, if at all possible, for the injustice of 2004 to be restored and for the 50% tobacco subsidy to continue under the first pillar, but only from 2010, in order to support their income."
"This demand is a humanitarian rather than a technical demand."
"Madam President, in the time available I will focus on the milk sector because - as the Commissioner knows from our meeting last week - it is in trouble in my constituency in light of the plunge in the price."
"That fall in price strengthens me in my view that abolishing milk quotas is premature and imprudent and will do nothing to stabilise the market."
"Likewise, reducing the range of available market-management measures seems to me unnecessary and foolish in light of the instability now affecting the market."
"We need meaningful market-management opportunities if a bottom is to be put, and to be kept, in this market. Without this, we are headed for anything but a soft landing for milk."
"I regret, therefore, that at a time when some Member States are showing flexibility - with France diverting underspend to the sheep sector and Germany talking about a milk fund - the Commission wishes to bind itself by reducing its scope for action by needlessly abrogating market-management measures."
". - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, first let me thank the rapporteur for the legislative proposal and the rapporteur for the own-initiative report."
"The 2003 and 2004 reforms were important stages in the reformation of the common agricultural policy (CAP)."
"The thorough examination of the CAP is not a fundamental reform in itself, but rather another important step in securing a modern, multifunctional and competitive common agricultural policy."
"Nothing has changed in relation to priorities."
"The first concern is food production, followed by fodder and then the supply of energy."
"The significance of milk production, particularly in mountainous areas where grassland farming is often the only option, has already been discussed."
"In this case we are preserving jobs, not just the environment, something equally important in my opinion."
"I believe that preparing for the soft landing following 2015 is an important issue."
"At present I oppose a general increase in the milk quota."
"I believe that we should be cautious at a time when we have this high milk surplus."
"Anyone who points to food prices as a reason for increasing quotas fails to recognise that a dairy farmer receives less than 30% of the sale price, while the sale price in the supermarkets - even in my own Member State - is currently the same as it was 25 years ago."
"It is important that the second pillar should be stabilised without eroding the first."
"We welcome the re-evaluation of Article 68 thanks to the Member States' autonomy of decision."
"I am also pleased that an agreement has been reached on the milk fund, including in relation to production in mountain areas and disadvantaged regions."
"Finally, may I say that I hope very much that the Council and Commission will reach a compromise in the coming days."
"I am certain that the common agricultural policy will be developed to ensure that we also have multifunctional, sustainable agricultural production in all regions of the EU in the future."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, we agree with the aims of this 'health check', but not all the proposed measures."
"The threats posed by new climate, financial, health and other risks indicate that the common agricultural policy, far from being obsolete, is needed to play a fundamental role in global food security and the preservation of our rural communities."
"We naively believed, at the time of the 1992 MacSharry reform, that food self-sufficiency was definitely assured and that the market would put everyone firmly in their place."
"However, we have realised that the increasingly globalised market is not responding to the dream of constant agricultural production with safe food at reasonable prices throughout Europe."
"The increase in the price of raw materials - now falling again - was a salutary lesson for us, accompanied as it was by the increase in feed and fertiliser production costs, and has dragged a number of sectors, such as the sheep and beef sectors, into deep crisis."
"Commissioner, this 'seesaw' effect seems likely to continue."
"I want to particularly mention the sheep and milk sectors."
"The sheep sector is in decline."
"It needs Community support, as called for by Parliament last June, and Article 68 will not be enough."
"As for the milk sector, the soft landing requires a transitional period so that the sector can adjust and adapt without the rigidity currently being caused by the scarcity of quotas."
"In addition, Commissioner, the situation is not similar or the same in all Member States."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur for the excellent, positive and intelligent work he has accomplished."
"The subject of the state of health of the common agricultural policy (CAP) is actually a very important one, because it aims to improve the competitiveness of the European farming industry."
"I feel it is appropriate to emphasise just two issues: the increase in milk quotas, providing for greater growth for countries in deficit and for those countries where the national quota is being exceeded, and the extension until 2012 of coupled support for tobacco cultivation."
"In relation to the latter, despite the strong resistance to reviewing the 2004 agreement, given that a large group of countries considers it morally unacceptable to subsidise tobacco because of its effects on public health, I would like to point out that production of raw tobacco in Europe accounts for no more than 4% of world production and that the European Union is the leading world importer of raw tobacco from non-EU countries, to cover over 70% of its own requirements."
"Therefore, I believe that we have a duty to find a fair solution to avoid further repercussions in terms of the economy and employment, to avoid causing a wholesale abandonment of tobacco-growing."
"(PL) Mr President, one of the most important tasks which has faced and continues to face the common agricultural policy is to ensure the agricultural self-sufficiency of the individual European Union states."
"Reading the conclusions of the review, I see that the changes it proposes include most of the mechanisms intended to improve the situation with production in individual markets."
"This is a good thing."
"Nevertheless, I am concerned at the lack of agreement on an overall change in the approach to aligning subsidies for all states of the EU at the same level, which would promote healthy competition within the Community and outside it."
"Actually, the review has confirmed the fact that protectionist attitudes towards national agricultures by the so-called old EU Member States in relation to those of the newly acceded States still persist in the European Union."
"The fact that I am yet another speaker making this point indicates the seriousness of the problem and the Commission's continued disregard of it."
"It is very important that Parliament has also noted the unfairness of the initial allocation of milk quotas."
"It is a good thing that, however timidly, we are now attempting to deal with this problem."
"- (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Barnier, European Development Days have been held over the last three days, during which frequent reference was made to the food crisis that is seriously affecting the poorest countries."
"All the speeches emphasised the prevailing need for developing countries to develop their own agriculture by making optimal use of their land and natural resources."
"Incidentally, the lyrical musings of those who, yesterday and again today, called for a reduction in state intervention and public spending, all-out liberalisation, privatisation and the relegation of agriculture to an almost prehistoric activity, this U-turn, therefore, in favour of huge public investment in agricultural production and food sovereignty, all seemed simultaneously laughable and scandalous."
"The future of agriculture in developing countries is directly linked to our debate today."
"Unfortunately I do not feel that this common agricultural policy (CAP) health check, which was begun before the food riots and the disastrous disruption of the markets reached their peak, takes account of the situation of the farming community in the South or draws the full conclusions from the serious crises that we now face in ecological, social, economic and financial terms."
"I am therefore very sorry that the robust relationship between northern and southern agriculture receives so little attention, both in the Commission's proposals and in Parliament's report, and the jeopardising of the EUR 1 billion pledged shows that there is still a long way to go."
"(PL) Mr President, Polish farmers and farmers from Central and Eastern Europe joining the European Union have been treated as second-class citizens, and this applies, inter alia, to subsidies and milk quotas."
"We are now seeing a growing tendency to retain this discrimination and unequal treatment beyond 2013."
"Please bear in mind that a large proportion of farms in the eastern part of the EU are family farms."
"Those are the families affected by decisions made in Brussels and Strasbourg."
"Those are the farmers who voted to join the EU, having been promised equal treatment from 2013."
"Should we now tell them that they have been deceived?"
"I appeal to fellow Members to ensure that our common agricultural policy is not common only in name."
"Expressions of noble sentiments accompany actions which could harm Polish and European agriculture, and we cannot agree to that."
"Farmers from the Solidarity Trade Union are protesting in Brussels today."
"They want to draw the attention of EU authorities to the difficult situation of milk and cereal producers."
"I support them and think that the protests in Brussels are the best proof that all is not well with agriculture."
"There must finally be an end to the unequal treatment of old and new Member States."
"(ES) Mr President, the vast majority of farmers and stockbreeders are waiting on the decisions and agreements that the Agriculture and Fisheries Council will adopt between today and Thursday on this common agricultural policy (CAP) health check."
"They are waiting because this is not a simple review, but will lead to profound changes, such as the disappearance of many holdings, if the cuts in direct aid proposed by the European Commission go ahead."
"Modulation is the central point of this parliamentary report and could be one of the few elements in Parliament's opinion with some impact on the negotiations being conducted by the EU's Agriculture Ministers."
"For years we have been opposing any increase in what we euphemistically call 'modulation' because, if the rural development policy lacks sufficient funds, this is not due to a lack of resources within the CAP budget, but rather due to the total lack of political will to provide an adequate Community budget for this essential pillar."
"Do we want to liberalise the markets?"
"Of course we do, but subject to the same requirements and conditions for all producers, both inside and outside the Union."
"At the moment, the European Union is playing with the future of many farmers and stockbreeders."
"In particular, I must mention fragile sectors such as the sheep, beef and tobacco sectors, the survival of which in many producing areas will depend on this health check."
"Some producers, such as sheep producers, are not asking for aid."
"They simply want to be allowed to withdraw from the market with dignity, because they have done their sums and the only way to survive is to reduce the volumes produced."
"The abandonment of production is therefore the only way out that we have left for many producers whose place will undoubtedly be taken by imports from third countries, because consumers will not stop consuming and the world will not stop rapidly increasing the number of consumers."
"Parliament should give a cautious opinion which the Council must heed."
"I must thank the Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr Parish, for the steps he has taken to ensure that Parliament is heard and not ignored as the Council and the Commission have so blatantly done to date."
"- (FR) Mr Barnier, Mrs Fischer Boel, I hope that Mr Capoulas Santos's excellent report can form a sound basis for a compromise within the Council during the French Presidency and I hope that the European Parliament and the Council will both tame the Commission."
"Which means, as I have already quoted from Saint-Exupéry, that the Little Prince tamed the fox."
"I hope that we will succeed in doing so tomorrow."
"Totally scrapping the intervention mechanism is highly dangerous for Europe and for European food safety."
"Punishing large-scale farmers will be extremely damaging to European competitiveness, and in the case of livestock farming, it is important to help farmers who have no land."
"- (FR) Mr President, at the beginning of the 2000s we set the financial framework of the common agricultural policy (CAP) until 2013."
"Farmers have made investments based on those figures."
"Now, will we decide, half-way through the campaign, to reduce the payments that they are entitled to expect?"
"This is unfair."
"I am against modulation as recommended by the European Commission or the Capoulas Santos report."
"The CAP is intended to support and give structure to agriculture."
"By way of example, we are seeing a general slump in livestock farming in favour of imports of sheep from third countries."
"Livestock farmers need a CAP that supports them."
"Ewe premiums are required, then, as well as environmental bonuses for keeping pastures and national reserves to deal with the ravages caused by outbreaks of disease, particularly bluetongue disease."
"Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, farmers are counting on us!"
"Mr President, I am sure the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council would expect me to call for the implementation of the key recommendations of the sheep report, which was passed overwhelmingly here in this Parliament."
"On modulation, I would be against the figure of 13% by 2012, and I believe that it should not be compulsory and that each Member State should have the flexibility to decide."
"On milk quotas, I would like to see an increase of 2%, rather than the 1% proposed, and countries that have the capacity to produce milk should be allowed to do so, leading to a soft landing in 2015."
"But, most important of all, at the last CAP reform we were promised simplification and, if there is something that drives farmers crazy, it is bureaucracy and red tape."
"There are now more officials representing the Commission, Member State departments of agriculture and local authorities policing farmers than there are police on the streets fighting crime."
"This is ridiculous: farmers should be allowed to get on and farm and produce the necessary food that is required for an ever-increasing population."
"Let me say from a personal point of view that, in my country, there will be no Lisbon II unless this matter is addressed."
"- (FR) Mr President, the report that we will vote on tomorrow represents the conclusion of a year's work and negotiations dedicated to the future of the common agricultural policy and of our farmers."
"It was actually on 20 November last year that Mrs Fischer Boel came to give us her proposals regarding the health check."
"Now, following the Lutz Goepel progress report, we have the Capoulas Santos report on the Commission proposal."
"Both our colleagues should be congratulated for their excellent work."
"The European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has managed to stand firm in the face of the Commission's initial proposals, which we felt were far too liberal."
"I shall remain vigilant with regard to the milk sector and particularly the measures preceding the scrapping of quotas."
"I am thinking, in particular, of mountain-based milk producers, who must not be the poor cousins of this reform, and we will need to ensure that they are not left out since they will need to be supported more than the others."
"I do not wish to play the role of doomsayer for them, but how can we imagine the French dairy industry consolidated into a single region?"
"I therefore welcome wholeheartedly the proposal to set up a 'Milk fund' and the proposal to evaluate, from 2010, the raising of milk quotas in accordance with market trends."
"Calculation, by the Committee on Agriculture, of progressive modulation is, in my view, fair and would enable us to enhance regional development and rurality, and to preserve biodiversity in a sustainable manner."
"I also welcome the clarification of cross-compliance, the implementation of which was, up to now, a real headache for farmers."
"I also hope that we keep the 'Tobacco fund', which allows us to keep our small farms in Europe as well as significant employment in a region where nothing else can be farmed and which allows us to avoid imported products."
"Finally, Mr Barnier, we have very much appreciated your involvement throughout these negotiations."
"You have managed to show a great deal of patience and determination and you have not rushed things, far from it."
"It was a real pleasure to work with you."
"Your work with us has been invaluable."
"I know that we will be able to count on you."
"(NL) Mr President, in the sixties, Sicco Mansholt, a prominent member of my party in the Netherlands, created European agricultural policy, and we are proud of this."
"His vision was to ensure that there was enough safe food for all Europeans and decent incomes for farmers."
"These are ideals that I am upholding here again with all my heart."
"Much has changed in the last 50 years though."
"There is a rapidly growing world population, climate change, globalisation, unfair trade and speculation regarding food prices, with the recent food crisis being a case in point."
"The discussion about the health check is mainly about resources, instruments and clever exemptions."
"I regret the fact that, in the run-up to 2013, the bigger picture is fading into the background."
"It is time for an intelligent update of our agricultural policy in which we hold onto Mansholt's ideals, but throw out the obsolete bits, such as export subsidies and product subsidies, for example."
"It is high time for fair trade and for more attention to sustainability, health and innovative solutions for the challenges we are actually facing."
"We owe this to the rest of the world, our future generations and the European taxpayers."
"(FI) Mr President, the goals of agricultural policy under the Treaty are to develop agriculture, safeguard the income levels of farmers and reasonable consumer prices, stabilise the markets and guarantee supply."
"The health check for agriculture, apart from anything else, conflicts with the first goal, and for that reason it would actually mean changing the Treaty."
"Aid for farmers would be cut, thus breaking the promises made earlier."
"Consumer prices could rise."
"A restriction on intervention purchases and the elimination of milk quotas would increase market fluctuations."
"Last year we spent more than EUR 500 million on milk export subsidies."
"Decoupling aid from production would decrease production, whilst its acceptability would grow more uncertain."
"The health check lacks solidarity, more than anything."
"The Commission's proposal in no way reflects the principle whereby people must also be able to engage in sustainable agriculture in those areas which are worst off in terms of natural conditions, even if the European Council has confirmed that three times."
"The family farm is too weak a negotiating party when up against multinational food giants and global market forces."
"That is why we need an agricultural policy."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our primary aim is to ensure that Europe has a common agricultural policy after 2013."
"We believe that this is a fundamental point, not only in order to protect the agricultural sector and the socio-economic fabric in our Member States, but also because at the dawn of the third millennium it is more strategically vital than ever to guarantee Europe's food security."
"Commissioner, we would like to stress the fact that we need to continue to implement policies of support for each individual common organisation of agricultural markets (CMOs), where necessary, and specifically we believe that:"
"a) In the tobacco sector the decoupling of aid must provide for the option to maintain partially coupled aid up until 2013, in order to avoid the total abandonment of production, because that would jeopardise entire sectors, creating unemployment and also various economic and environmental problems in particularly disadvantaged areas."
"I would like to remind the Commissioner and the President that the European Parliament has already expressed its support, by a large majority, on this issue."
"b) In the milk sector, in order to rebalance the market in the short term and to make it possible to exit with a soft landing from the quota system in the long term, it would be advisable to increase quotas by 2% in every marketing year during the 2009-2010 and 2014-2015 periods."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Capoulas Santos, and Mr Goepel, on the excellent work they have produced."
"We are debating a common agricultural policy (CAP) that was born in the late 1990s and which itself gave birth in 2003, in a globalised world, in which there was a surplus of production, in which we sang the praises of the excessive assistance given to agriculture."
"We came up with decoupling, modulation, conditionality and an excessive amount of red tape in the system for granting assistance, and within a few years we achieved a development that had been imagined, as Mr Barnier said."
"This development that we had imagined turned out thus: we entered into production deficit, we had a supply problem, particularly for grains, we went into deficit in Europe in meat production and we are seeing an inconceivable number of jobs being lost."
"I therefore believe that the approach that the Commission adopted in modifying the 2003 position should end in the next few days together with the French Presidency, and that we should review the position adopted on these issues, and on modulation, which seems excessive."
"In removing resources from producers and then transferring them to the second pillar, we are taking resources from those who are investing and producing daily in agriculture, from those whom we are asking to respect the land and the health of food products, whom we are asking for safety at work, whom we are asking for animal welfare, whom we are asking for high nutritional value and safety in our food, we are taking away their support in an increasingly competitive and globalised world."
"We therefore need to think again, particularly in relation to milk quotas, in countries such as Italy which have for 20 years already been suffering this tragedy of a deficiency of production, despite having significant potential."
"Coupled aid ought to be maintained: I endorse what my fellow Members said in this regard on tobacco, because there are 500 000 families in Europe living off that sector and removing coupled aid would undoubtedly reduce them to poverty without contributing, if that is the issue, to a reduction in the number of smokers."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very happy to see the evidence of a very positive codecision process in agriculture, which been possible through the enhanced cooperation between the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament."
"This is a good omen and I am sure that you will permit me to congratulate Mr Capoulas Santos on his balanced report on modulation, on young farmers and on security in the workplace, as well as in relation to the new challenges."
"We are going through a difficult transition: we know about the soft landing and decoupling, and other innovative measures."
"As we go through this transition we must protect farmers who will be faced with the removal of milk quotas, as well as disadvantaged areas such as those in the tobacco sector, and we should take the opportunity of this shift to embark upon a serious rethink post-2013 to update the aims and new missions of the common agricultural policy (CAP) and to launch a debate on a way to overcome the dichotomy between the first and second pillars."
"Mr President, my thanks to the Council, Commission and rapporteur for all the hard work that has gone into this."
"The only thing 'simple' about the common agricultural policy, which has been ignored in this debate, is that the budget is fixed and declining, and yet the demands we are making on this policy are expanding, including climate change, biodiversity and water management."
"Intelligent water management is a very good idea, and local authorities need to fix leaks."
"How intelligent is that!"
"Let me move on to milk."
"What is wrong with providing for a 2% increase in quota and trusting farmers who can produce for the market-place to do that?"
"This is not compulsory."
"Let the farmers decide."
"On sheep, the Aylward report has raised huge expectations which we in this Parliament support."
"They cannot be let down when the Council comes to its final decisions."
"On modulation and Article 68, we are talking about recycling funds from agriculture to these new challenges."
"It cannot be done and if it is done it can only be done with fewer rules, rather than more rules, which tends to be the case."
"The biggest threat to the CAP and to European farmers is in the budget review, the legacy of Tony Blair to this institution, where financing of agriculture is under threat."
"In reply to the Lisbon Treaty comment from my colleague Liam Aylward, may I say that, yes, inspections did cause a problem."
"I would suggest that farmers in Ireland will now be more supportive of the Lisbon Treaty because they fear that Member States will have more control over agriculture policy and they know the dangers of that from our budget for 2009 when the Irish Government slashed support for agriculture: they trust Europe more than their Member State."
"We must remember that."
"The biggest problem for farmers across Europe is income volatility and price volatility."
"We need market support measures."
"They have got to be more flexible and more intelligent and used when we need them, otherwise we abandon family farming and we will destroy what we have created in Europe, which is a supply of good-quality, safe food."
"I wish you luck in your deliberations."
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, may I extend my special thanks to the rapporteur, Luis Manuel Capoulas Santos, for the huge amount of work he has completed during the last few months, and for his great ability to find a compromise solution."
"The common agricultural policy must retain its Community character by ensuring that the whole of the enlarged European Union can compete on equal terms."
"Necessary conditions for the achievement of this objective include striving for uniform subsidy rates throughout the European Union."
"I believe that this will happen in 2013, and that no one will want to think of ways of postponing it further."
"As time is short, I will limit myself to one matter only."
"New Member States will increasingly be included in environmental protection, food safety and animal welfare requirements."
"Compliance with those requirements involves huge expenditure, to be incurred within a short period of time, and for those States it will mean significantly reduced profitability of agricultural production."
"For this reason, synchronising full introduction of those principles must be delayed until all payments and subsidies have been equalised."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to congratulate Mr Capoulas Santos on his very fine report and I should also like to thank the coordinator and shadow rapporteur, Mr Goepel."
"I shall comment briefly on three points: first and foremost, as far as we are concerned, the existing tobacco aid scheme should be maintained until 2013 and 50% of financing should be kept under the first pillar and not transferred to the second pillar."
"I think this is both unfair and unjust."
"Why do I think this?"
"Because you only want to apply it to tobacco."
"Secondly, I think this will be catastrophic for over half a million families, especially in my country, where most are poor, small-scale tobacco farmers who will abandon their farms and move to the large towns, which is extremely dangerous for the environment and the countryside."
"I should like to clarify something here."
"We are all against smoking, but we must not confuse two things: for as long as people in Europe smoke cigarettes and the European industry needs tobacco, it makes more sense for us to produce it than to import it."
"Secondly, it also makes sense to maintain the existing special entitlements scheme, especially for special fodder rights."
"Thirdly, I am against the minimum thresholds for granting direct aid proposed by the Commission, whereby the Commission says that anyone receiving less than EUR 250 a year or cultivating less than one hectare a year should not be financed."
"For goodness sake, the European Union wants to support both large and small producers."
"We need them all, but most of all we need small-scale farmers."
"This being so, I call for this to be revised and for aid to be granted to farmers, however small their farms may be."
"(EL) Mr President, firstly I should like to congratulate Mr Capoulas Santos on his report."
"Mr Barnier, Mrs Fischer Boel, regardless of the schools of thought, which illustrate that each of you has a different approach to the common agricultural policy and its role in the development of the European Union, we have achieved the unachievable; in other words, you are generating a lack of trust and disappointment among both small-scale and large-scale producers."
"In other words, with the across-the-board cut, with the proposals for further cuts in the value of entitlements in a period in which the cost of production has risen, we have disappointed both large-scale dairy farms and small-scale producers in small and mountainous areas."
"A proposal for tobacco in which the Commission is proposing a scandalous 50% reduction without any justification on the basis of the Treaty or even of the horizontal policies of the common agricultural policy does not inspire trust."
"Another distinction is the exemption of small farms of 10 hectares, which for Greece in particular means that the island areas will be excluded."
"Commissioner, I am aware of your communication policy and I have the greatest respect for you."
"You speak of a soft landing."
"Be careful which airport we are going to land at."
"There is also an airport in Guantanamo."
"(NL) Mr President, we have already heard a great deal during this morning's long debate."
"Fortunately, I managed to give the Commissioner a portion of school fruit before we started, so hopefully with that snack, we will be able to carry on discussing this important topic for a while longer."
"I should like to turn my attention away from school fruit, though, to the subject of milk."
"Quite apart from the discussion about all kinds of technical instruments, it is, to my mind, impossible to explain to the European citizen that we have paid EUR 340 million in superlevy, while we all remain nearly 1% under the European quota."
"This lack of logic will in any event need to be addressed in the Council."
"Moreover, as I have stated before, the Commission proposal of an annual quota increase by 1% is very 'skimmed', in my view, and this could easily be increased to 'semi-skimmed' in the Council of Ministers later."
"After all, with 1%, we are leaving opportunities unused within the EU and the world market."
"The argument I have heard before in this debate, namely that our quota system would automatically give us a good price, is far too short-sighted."
"This is also clearly evident from the price development since 1984."
"Needless to say, mega stores like they have in the United States are unthinkable in our region."
"We will need to put safety nets in place for very lean years and for unforeseen circumstances, such as animal diseases."
"Also, and I think this is just as important, I would urge the Commission to look at how the returns are divided across the food production chain."
"While supermarkets currently work with economic margins of some 20% and the distribution trade with margins of nearly 10%, many primary producers - the farmers - without whom none of the food would be there - are working with negative returns at the moment."
"Back to the main topic, though."
"As I said, we are talking about our daily bread here."
"Food security should therefore be paramount in this debate, but mainly also in the debate on agricultural policy after 2013, because I think the last thing we need is to have to establish in due course that we have become just as dependent on far away countries for our daily bread as we are for energy."
"- (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, I am extremely grateful to our colleague, Mr Capoulas Santos, for this tremendous work he has done, and in good humour, it has to be said."
"The task of the common agricultural policy (CAP) has always been to guarantee the supply of food for everyone."
"This aim is even more justifiable today, since the crisis we are experiencing leaves both consumers and farmers vulnerable."
"It is essential to guarantee consumers access to food products, but also to guarantee farmers a decent income."
"We must therefore encourage and help young farmers to establish themselves and to develop their activities since it is they who will help to feed the planet in the future."
"I should like to emphasise the difficulties encountered in the sheep and goat sectors, with regard to which Mr Capoulas Santos has been very sensitive."
"It is vital to give them support not only in terms of meat, but also in terms of milk, a sector I am very familiar with in Sardinia."
"- (FR) Mr President, thank you for the work done, and for the conclusions and guidelines that have come out of the common agricultural policy (CAP) health check and Mr Capoulas Santos's report."
"Agriculture is, indeed, an economic sector that cannot respond to market signals alone."
"Agricultural activity certainly affects food self-sufficiency but also, as we see too often, regions and employment."
"Scrapping market instruments would be a serious blow to our agriculture."
"Decoupling, for example, presents real problems for certain areas of livestock farming, namely suckler cows and sheep, and I am very pleased to have heard Mrs Fischer Boel speak just now on this issue."
"What is more, it is clear that strictly adhering to historic references would pose a major obstacle to any possible reform."
"I still believe, however, that the issue of the second pillar of the CAP is an essential one since rural territories need to rely on agricultural activity in order to develop employment in rural areas."
"We must, therefore, think about this issue of the second pillar without, of course, cutting off the first."
"(ES) Mr President, firstly, I should also like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Capoulas Santos, on his magnificent work."
"I believe he has achieved balance and moderation in his report."
"At this stage in the debate, I feel it is vital to send a message of stability to our farmers."
"More than ever European farmers need stability and solutions."
"They need long enough transitional periods as well as the continuation of specific measures for struggling sectors."
"Commissioner, the same solutions cannot be used for all sectors."
"You must remember that we have sectors that are experiencing real difficulties."
"The common agricultural policy must not be the problem, but rather the solution, and for that we need a strong first pillar."
"We believe and trust in rural development, but we do not believe that the modulation proposed by the Commission is the answer."
"Rural development should not be strengthened to the detriment of the first pillar."
"We agree that the Single Payment Scheme must be simplified by revising the market instruments."
"However, this does not mean dismantling them."
"If we get this right, we will be laying the foundations for a common agricultural policy continuing well beyond 2013."
"If we get it wrong, we will put many European farmers out of business."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the great efforts made by Mr Capoulas Santos, our rapporteur, to ensure that the common agricultural policy (CAP) stays closer to farmers and European citizens, rather than the needs of the market, and to reconcile the various concerns that arise when there are so many challenges in play."
"It is therefore vital for the 27 Member States to take a joint approach to the sector, but it is important to maintain the market support and management instruments for key products."
"I am thinking, for example, of the dairy sector or aid for tobacco, the elimination of which would certainly not help to cut the numbers of smokers, but instead would lead to the abandonment of an important European product and the social fabric which is linked to it."
"Such instruments must, however, always take into account the extreme variety of agricultural circumstances in Europe."
"The system of milk quotas currently in force, for example, is a response to criteria that are now obsolete."
"The 1% increase proposed in the compromise is not enough to meet the domestic demand of the majority of Member States."
"We therefore need a more flexible system that gives every individual Member State the option to respond to its own needs, and this would also promote European competitiveness in the sector on the international market."
"Mr President, I strongly agree with Minister Barnier when he talks about food sovereignty and its importance, and with Commissioner Fischer Boel when she talks about the importance of climate change on the agriculture agenda today."
"Can we please marry these two concepts?"
"It is expected that the growing worldwide demand for dairy products - which will be up to a 35% increase by 2020 - will lead to some intensification of Irish dairy production, making it most likely that our suckler herd will be affected if a reduction in our cattle numbers has to be considered to meet EU climate change targets under the effort-sharing proposal."
"Ireland's food production system is accepted as one of the most efficient in the world in terms of emissions per unit of food produced."
"Any shortfall of world food markets - if Ireland cut its livestock numbers - would be most likely to be filled by countries with less sustainable farming systems and systems that generate far higher levels of emission, due to the less efficient nature of their herd management or the age profile of their herds and deforestation."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner Fischer Boel, Mr Barnier, a health check should serve to correct those aspects which are not totally right."
"In the legislation on agriculture in the outermost regions, there is one aspect which is not right."
"This is the regulation of sugar in the Autonomous Region of the Azores."
"I want to urge both the Commissioner and the Minister and also all Members to look at the amendments that I have tabled in order to consider what is at stake, as it is easy and simple to solve this problem."
"However, if this is not solved, it will result in unemployment and the failure of a sector, with extremely serious consequences for the Autonomous Region of the Azores."
"I would insist once again that you give this your utmost attention."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the situation that has arisen recently deserves thanks on our part both to the Commissioner and to the rapporteur."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for the work he has accomplished, because when we discuss agriculture we are discussing food, and therefore the issue is an extremely delicate one."
"I would like to talk about two key points: the first is the issue of milk quotas."
"I welcome the consensus reached on the 1% level - which could also be increased to 2% - but the greater problem will arise after 2014 when, if the landing is not a softer one, there will be enormous problems for those who have made investments in recent years, and enormous losses for agricultural companies relating to this sector."
"The other aspect or issue relates to controls on agricultural prices."
"A year ago, there was a food problem linked to cereals, and now the prices of maize and wheat have halved as compared with last year, while the consumer prices for pasta, bread and feed are still high."
"Perhaps there was a mistake in planning or not enough control ..."
"(PL) Mr President, the European Commission has proposed common agricultural policy spending limits for the various Member States up to 2013 and beyond."
"If we convert these sums into amounts per hectare of arable land, what emerges is a huge disparity in support per hectare between the different States: in Belgium it amounts to approximately EUR 490, in Denmark EUR 390, in Germany EUR 340 and in France EUR 260, whereas in the new Member States it is much less: EUR 210 in the Czech Republic, EUR 200 in Slovakia and only EUR 190 in Poland."
"In a situation where the production costs of old and new Member States are rapidly converging, and the European Commission is proposing decoupling financial support from production, retaining these differences not only no longer has any justification in fact, but also discriminates against farmers in the new Member States."
"If the position of the Commission and the Council on this issue does not change, we will forever have two common agricultural policies: a richer one, targeted at the old Member States, and a poorer one, which will become the lot of the new Member States."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, I want to keep my contribution brief and would like to focus on the fact that we are responsible first and foremost for 500 million consumers in the European Union and then for the farmers in the European Union, who produce food for these consumers."
"We are equally responsible for both large and small farms."
"We are responsible for farms in disadvantaged areas, in grassland regions, and particularly in all areas relating to dairy and meat production."
"Commissioner, I wish to thank you for your positive consideration of the milk fund, something I have been demanding for two years, namely since the debate on the mini milk package and the abolition of support measures in this area."
"I am convinced that this mechanism will enable us to provide help if we do not first withdraw the money from other farmers, but rather use the resources that have been freed up by the abolition of the market support measures."
"Mr President, in this debate we must speak of food safety, food traceability and, above all, food security."
"We cannot decouple these issues from our discussions here today and we cannot ignore the fact that the number of farmers continues to decrease very significantly year on year."
"An increase in compulsory modulation is quite simply putting your hand into the pocket of Europe's farmers."
"The value of the single farm payment has fallen by approximately 15% since 2005 due to inflation and other issues and yet the proposal is to cut it further."
"Simplification seems to be the buzzword."
"However, in Ireland at least, the numbers involved in policing farmers have escalated."
"In recent weeks we had a number of helicopters, flanked by 61 ground inspectors, counting sheep in the hills of Connemara, a small area where the price of sheep would not even repay the investment by farmers."
"To some, it more resembled the invasion of Iraq rather than the benign hand of Europe."
"This is wasteful and conveys an image of an over-bureaucratic Europe, acting in a totally disproportionate manner."
". - (DE) Mr President, while I am unhappy with the compromise, I can live with it, because it may be possible to prevent the greatest damage to our farmers if we do not cut direct payments as the Commission so disastrously proposes."
"If this money goes into the milk fund, the cut will hurt even less."
"Unfortunately I read this morning that the Commissioner had taken to the barricades again, opposing the milk fund."
"It does not matter to Luxembourg's farmers if we do not cut direct payments up to EUR 10 000 because all full-time farmers are above this limit."
"The priority must therefore be to avoid cuts or to keep them as small as possible."
"Otherwise there will be no future for full-time farmers in Luxembourg."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that this is neither the time nor the place to enter into substantive debate."
"The European Parliament has the authority merely to express an opinion on the only issue where the EU has the power of life and death, and on which half of the budget is spent."
"My view is that the health check is conservative; globalisation, which is a goal the EU also has, is paid for by agriculture: the victim of the endless quest for an impossible role of mediation."
"My role as an MEP, however, shows the lack of transparency in the application of the common agricultural policy (CAP)."
"The Commissioner signed Regulation No 250 in 2008, but the Member States are ignoring it and this will continue to be the case after 30 June 2009 too."
"I would argue that the only way left to us in which to proceed is to apply to the appointed control bodies, but we need to remember that we ought to move the debate on agriculture policy in the direction of citizens, who should be provided with information if we wish to take the right route."
"If we do not, we will continue to jeopardise the agricultural world, which is a victim of its continuing isolation."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to refer to milk."
"I am not in favour of a 2% increase."
"I would support a 1% increase because, although a lot has been said about soft landings, I do not believe it."
"I think the world is changing as we sit here."
"Over recent months the milk industry, which 12 months ago was certainly a successful part of our produce, is longer so because of changing world markets."
"I would like to say to the Commissioner that I am a little concerned about Articles 68 and 69."
"I believe that you can take the word 'common' and remove it forever from the common agricultural policy."
"I would be very careful about this to ensure that we do not give too much responsibility, and that money can simply go back and Member States can create an uneven playing field."
"On modulation, I believe we should stick to single figures, but let whatever we have on modulation be mandatory."
"Let everybody throughout Europe pay the same level of modulation from the second pillar."
"(EL) Mr President, I should like to add a number of points: firstly, we need a reinforced first pillar under the common agricultural policy (CAP) so that producers can meet the market's current needs and problems."
"Secondly, any additional differentiation will create income insecurity among producers."
"Thirdly, the recommendation for new support mechanisms, such as the mutual and production security fund, cannot be financed with additional expenditure and, fourthly, cofinancing of the first pillar of the CAP opens the door to future cofinancing of the common agricultural policy."
"Mr President, I wish to congratulate the rapporteurs on their work on the CAP health check, as it is important to highlight the increased work of Parliament in this process, and I would also like to welcome the attitude of the Council and the Commission in these negotiations."
"I believe that it augurs well for future negotiations when Parliament will enjoy full codecision with the Council on agricultural matters."
"Coming from an agricultural area in Ireland, it is sad to see that in recent times farmers have turned against the EU project for various reasons, one of which is the perceived lack of transparency of negotiations in the Council."
"However, if and when the Lisbon Treaty is adopted, Parliament will be centrally involved and thus there will be a bigger role for open, transparent debate on CAP-related issues, leading to greater legitimacy amongst the farming community."
"The way forward in Europe is for Parliament to be fully involved in the decision-making process, and that will only be finally achieved by having codecision."
"(PL) This is a good report."
"What is missing, what needs to be changed?"
"The review of the common agricultural policy does not take sufficient account of the new situation which has arisen in the world as a whole as well as in Europe as a result of the food crisis."
"Too much has happened for this not to be taken into account in a meaningful way."
"Many of the issues contained in the European Commission's proposals fall short of the expectations of new Member States, which demand a fairer direct subsidy system."
"I am convinced that the equalisation of subsidy levels between Member States is inevitable."
"Commissioner, the Council of Ministers meeting will be accompanied by an 8 000-strong demonstration of tobacco planters."
"I hope that their demands will be met."
"On other issues, firstly we need to take a cautious approach to abandoning the milk quota system in 2015."
"We need to develop a way of approaching the situation."
"The milk market is unstable and must therefore be monitored."
"Secondly, we should retain market intervention instruments, for instance storing ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, many thanks for your attention and the questions you have put to us."
"I should like to address several points, one by one."
"Firstly, I would like to talk about modulation, which was mentioned by Mr Goepel, and by Mr Baco, Mr Sanzarello and Mrs Lulling a moment ago."
"The issue of the rate of modulation will be, I can assure you, a key element of any compromise."
"I have taken note of Parliament's desire for a compromise solution to be found."
"I would add that progressive modulation that is too severe could certainly cause problems for several Member States, but we must be well aware that the very principle of progressive modulation responds to a highly publicised social need."
"We, together with Mariann Fischer Boel, must therefore find a compromise and, in that respect, I believe that the position proposed by your rapporteur will shed light on this compromise."
"As for modulation, the issue of the rate of cofinancing for additional modulation is another element that must be included in the package."
"You have proposed 100%, which is to say no national cofinancing."
"That is very ambitious, but I believe that it is the right way to go."
"Next, I should like to address the issue of new challenges."
"I fully understood the position of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, considering de facto support of the dairy sector as one of these new challenges financed by modulation."
"I believe that this is one of the avenues on which we will work with Mariann Fischer Boel."
"Another key issue, ladies and gentlemen, which is wide-ranging and very problematic, is that mentioned by Mr Capoulas Santos, who would like a prudent and moderate approach, a sentiment echoed by Mr Goepel and Mrs Mathieu, and Mr Le Foll just now."
"I have mentioned just a few names, but many of you could speak on this issue, the issue of milk quotas."
"There are two problems to be solved: increasing quotas and the rate of increase, and support measures."
"With regard to increasing quotas, I have observed that the debates in Parliament have revealed greatly differing positions."
"To be honest, the situation is the same within the Council of Ministers."
"The solution you are recommending - 1% per year between 2009 and 2010 - and then to make a decision on the basis of a report on continuing the increase, is a prudent approach, in line with the wishes of your rapporteur, Mr Capoulas Santos."
"At the same time, there is the issue of medium-term visibility for agricultural enterprises, as for enterprises in general."
"That requires plotting a course from now until 2015, and, ultimately, my feeling is that the Commission's proposal is close to a balance."
"We are going to work on it, and on support measures in particular, since everyone agrees on support for sensitive regions."
"The recommended solution of using Article 68 to implement more structural measures, would, I believe, give us a useful range of tools to support this sector."
"With regard to how the financial instruments to be implemented would work, I believe that a discussion is required to find a solution that is acceptable to everyone."
"I am, of course, thinking of the 'Milk fund'."
"I would like to say a word, Mr President, on instruments to regulate the market."
"I have noted the requests seeking to retain instruments to regulate the market and effective instruments."
"I, like you, believe that, in this new global context that many of us have referred to, for agriculture and for food, this production sector, this real economy that affects people's food supply, needs instruments for intervention in the event of serious market instability, and from this point of view, intervention is an important aspect of the negotiation."
"Many Member States, like many MEPs, want to revise the Commission's initial proposals and to discuss them again."
"We are also going to seek a compromise that allows us to retain a genuine and effective safety net."
"Lastly, I should like to talk about Article 68."
"There have been many debates here in Parliament, as in the Council, and a strong demand to open up the possibilities for applying this article, which arouses a great deal of interest, while preserving its commonality."
"Opening up the possibilities for applying this article would perhaps -certainly in my opinion - enable a move towards supporting the kinds of production such as those in the sheep sector, which has been mentioned and which needs support."
"Here too, we are working with the Commissioner along these lines, just as we are going to look for solutions to improve financing conditions."
"I am thinking, in particular, of the demands made by many representatives of new Member States, for more fairness and equity."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have paid close attention to and taken great interest in listening to all the many detailed speeches that have been given."
"On the basis of the opinion that you are going to give, and I would like to thank once again the chairman, Mr Parish, the whole committee and the rapporteur, for the work that has been done, my task is going to be to secure a dynamic political compromise that enables us to adapt the common agricultural policy, while safeguarding it, in the new global context in which we find ourselves."
"That is the task on which we are going to work with Mariann Fischer Boel and all her colleagues, whom I thank for the spirit that we have fostered between us over the past months."
"I should perhaps like to say a final word to take up a comment made just now by Mrs Aubert, who mentioned the situation of food insecurity."
"The Presidency is fully aware that we cannot discuss the common agricultural policy as if we were in a fortress, turning in on ourselves in Europe."
"It was precisely in this spirit that, on 3 July, we organised, at the European Parliament, a conference with the Director-General of the World Trade Organization, the Director-General of the World Bank, the Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization, many MEPs and Commissioner Louis Michel, on the question: 'Who will feed the world?'"
"In the same spirit, we shall organise on 28 November a working meeting, again with Louis Michel, on the link between agriculture and development."
"I, like the Presidency, am therefore paying close attention to what is being said about agriculture in order to preserve the European Union's agricultural and regional food model, which has supported the common agricultural policy for 50 years, but keeping a clear and empathetic perspective on what is happening in other parts of the world."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I have been listening carefully and I think that the record on 'catch-the-eye' shows clearly that there is huge interest in this Parliament in the agricultural sector and the consequences of the decisions that will be taken."
"I should like to pick up a few of the issues that have been mentioned."
"Firstly, I would like to stress that I think you have either misunderstood or missed something when you tried to convince me that modulation means taking the money away from the farmers, which is definitely not the case."
"We need modulation because we have new challenges and we need to bolster farmers' possibilities to make investments in order to meet these new challenges."
"So I think, on the contrary, you can say in modulation we actually increase the funding available for the agricultural sector because there is cofinancing."
"That is what it is all about."
"If you continue to say that we are taking money from the farmers, then there is a certain misunderstanding among those of you who have chosen this argument."
"Milk seems today to have been the big issue."
"Neil Parish said in his first speech that you have 27 Member States - 27 customers - in your committee, but, having listened to the discussion today, I would have thought that you had many more, because listening here you can pick and choose any thing from a 0% increase to a 10% increase."
"The presidency and the Commission are obliged to try to find the right balance."
"To those who talk about a milk fund: it is strange because I still recall the 2003 negotiations where we compensated the milk producers all over Europe."
"Let me take Germany as an example: German dairy farmers were compensated by EUR 1 billion every year - money transferred from their milk payment into their single payment scheme."
"But at that stage I did not hear anyone talking about a milk fund, and that is the reason why, because we know that the dairy sector is facing difficulties, we have now added to the new challenges a milk line."
"I am sure that we will be able to design a very nice package for the milk producers in those areas that are facing difficulties."
"I must say that I am surprised that there is so much resistance to increasing the milk quota, knowing that last year we collected EUR 338 million in superlevy from European milk producers."
"To me this is definitely not the way I want to go forward."
"I want to give farmers the possibility to respond to the markets."
"Increasing quotas does not mean an obligation to produce: it is only a possibility for those who are strong on the internal or the external markets."
"It has to be kept in mind that some of the competitive ones are paying EUR 338 million every year to stay in business."
"Concerning redistribution, it is obvious that there was broad agreement that this health check was not going to be a new reform and that we were therefore building on the 2003 reform."
"I think both the presidency and the Commission can admit that there is strong pressure from the new Member States to get a more equal payment, and I know that this will be a discussion that will be strongly defended in the 2013 reform."
"We might find some solutions even now for the new Member States in the compromise, and I hope you will be surprised in a positive way."
"Finally, could I just say, on the issue of tobacco that was raised, that I was impressed by Mr Gklavakis, who is always trying to convince us that tobacco is important, and we believe that is so in his own region."
"But tobacco is not in the health check."
"The tobacco reform was made in 2004 and was supported by all countries, including tobacco-producing Member States."
"As I have said many times, I am certainly not going to reopen the tobacco reform."
"But I will be open to help all those Member States, all those regions, that face problems, because there are many possibilities available in the rural development policy."
"I am sure we can create solutions that will soften the consequences of the decisions already taken for the tobacco producers."
"I have to keep my remarks short, but my conclusion on the discussion today will be clearly that we need today, more than ever before, a common agricultural policy."
"I agree with Ms McGuinness that a situation where renationalisation would be the only answer would definitely jeopardise the European agricultural sector."
"Let us keep our common agricultural policy with the flexibility that we have included in our different choices within the rural development policy."
"But we do need a common European agricultural policy."
"That would be my conclusion from the discussions today."
"I want to thank all of you for this dedicated approach."
"rapporteur. - (PT) The long list of speakers and the resolute and impassioned way in which they have expressed their ideas once again confirms how much this subject means to the European Parliament and the importance that should be placed on agriculture, farmers and the rural world in Europe."
"There have been no surprises in this debate because, in the main, this has reaffirmed the positions reiterated during the various debates throughout this long discussion process which has lasted over a year and, in the specific case of my political Group, another six months before that."
"However, I feel that it has also been clearly demonstrated that there are no alternatives to the positions which represent the mid-ground allowing a responsible compromise that can be accepted by the majority."
"The Commission and the Council have also reaffirmed their positions, but I am delighted to note the signs of flexibility and openness that have been given."
"I therefore trust in your political realism, dear Mariann and Michel, and in the spirit of compromise to find a final solution which is very close to that proposed to you by Parliament on these vital issues."
"I would reiterate the symbolic importance of this approach on the eve of the European Parliament assuming its codecision powers, because I hope that the problem of ratifying the Lisbon Treaty will soon be solved, given that Europe needs the Lisbon Treaty."
"Mr Barnier, as I have repeatedly said, we are not yet using codecision, but we are already entering into the spirit of this."
"I therefore hope that the difficult negotiations expected today and tomorrow will prove to be very successful."
"I am sure that we will be able to find a consensual solution responding to the concerns of European farmers and agriculture who are watching us closely."
"We are all convinced, and this will be the best conclusion to this debate, that a common agricultural policy is needed in Europe so that European agriculture can be competitive and environmentally sustainable."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday 19 November 2008."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - The common agricultural policy forces British consumers to buy food at inflated prices from continental farmers rather than at lower prices available on the world market."
"It is estimated that the CAP causes prices to be at least 23% higher than those prevailing on the world market."
"It is also estimated by economists that the cost of the CAP to UK consumers equates to at least 1.2% of GDP - which is currently an astonishing £16.8 billion per annum."
"I represent many people in London who struggle to pay their bills."
"They face ever-rising taxes and ever-rising prices."
"They do not owe continental farmers a living."
"If countries want to subsidise their agricultural industries that is their own business, but it should be paid for by their own tax-payers."
"The common agricultural policy is paid for by those least able to afford it: pensioners and those on low incomes, those who pay a higher proportion of their disposable income on food."
"The CAP is just one of the many reasons why Britain should leave the European Union."
"in writing. - (RO) I am pleased to note that, one year after the European Commission launched the consultation process for adapting the common agricultural policy to the current needs of farmers and agricultural producers, we have reached a consensus on certain specific proposals."
"I feel that the compromise which has been reached on Article 68 is appropriate, especially the increase from 10% to 15% in the ceiling for creating the funds required for any new public policy strategic measures in Member States and the introduction of a clear ceiling for use in forms of specific aid."
"I would like to come back to the issue concerning the deadline for the complete application of the cross-compliance package in the case of Romania and Bulgaria."
"Both these countries will reach the 100% direct payment ceiling by 1 January 2016."
"Consequently, it is fair that the deadline for the complete application of the cross-compliance package in both countries should be by then."
"I note with dismay that the amendment supported by us to this effect has not been adopted."
"Bearing in mind the importance of this issue to the new Member States, I urge my fellow Members to take this into account in subsequent discussions so that we can find a solution beneficial to both States and approved by representatives of all the EU's Member States."
"in writing. - (HU) Evaluating the situation does not mean simply a review of the common agricultural policy (CAP)."
"In reality, we are talking about the reform of the CAP and a significant reduction in support to agriculture."
"This is unacceptable from the perspective of Hungary and Hungarian farmers."
"The reforms to date have done nothing but harm to Hungarian agriculture."
"In Hungary, modulation would even affect smaller 20-hectare farms."
"What is needed for these smaller farms is not a reduction but rather an increase in direct support."
"Applying modulation in the new Member States before 2013 would, moreover, be contrary to the accession agreement."
"In the interest of food security, we continue to need support in aid of production and market arrangements, including grain intervention."
"We find it unacceptable that the intervention price should be tied to the price at Rouen port, since transport costs mean prices are lower in the more distant and especially the new Member States, and this constitutes discrimination."
"We oppose an increase to the milk quota."
"The increase to milk quotas in spring proved to be a flawed decision, leading to a fall in milk prices in several Member States."
"Increasing the milk quota is particularly contrary to Hungary's interests, since we have a significant level of unused milk quota."
"Such a step would prevent Hungarian producers from increasing their production."
"We agree with maintaining support to tobacco producers."
"Several thousand families earn their livelihood from tobacco production, notably in the country's most disadvantaged, north-eastern regions."
"I should first like to commend the remarkable work carried out by our rapporteur, Mr Capoulas Santos, who has continually sought to find a balanced and stable compromise to enable the European Parliament to speak with one voice in the face of a divided and uncertain Council."
"The health check we will be voting on today represents an extraordinary opportunity to substantially reflect on how we can free the common agricultural policy (CAP) from the dissatisfaction undermining it and to look ahead to the huge amount of work to reform this policy, planned for after 2013."
"The CAP undeniably needs a breath of fresh air, and particularly in social and environmental terms."
"In this regard, I am delighted that we have managed to amend the European Commission's text in the direction of increased social sensitivity, by proposing, in particular, an increase in aid for small farmers and the introduction of 'work' and 'employment' factors in the rules for allocating aid."
"I am sorry, however, and it is the only reservation I will mention, that the economic and social criteria are not accompanied more by ecological considerations, since 'sustainability' must become the hallmark of our agricultural policy."
"in writing. - (FI) Mr President, more should be done to ensure that agricultural aid is allocated in a way that steers agriculture in the direction of sustainable development."
"The existing subsidies are generally regarded as just a way of topping up the income of farmers."
"Agriculture in the countries on the shores of the Baltic is the biggest polluter of the sea in that region."
"If we pay agricultural subsidies, this actually increases emissions into groundwater and so into the sea."
"Any kind of business, including agriculture, has to participate in voluntary environmental work and projects."
"That is the only way agriculture can claim a right to its own existence in the future."
"Why should taxpayers continue to support an occupation that does harm to the surrounding areas when pollution can be outsourced by buying imported food?"
"Clean water is now a scarce commodity."
"So it is only reasonable that people should have to pay for making it dirty and that that should not come out of public money."
"Agriculture has to make proper use of the countless environmental measures that exist."
"The recovery of phosphorus and nitrogen is technologically possible, and will also soon be financially lucrative."
"These precious natural resources and raw materials must be recycled as is required of other natural resources."
"in writing. - (PL) As expected, the health check has created an opportunity for delving deeper into the principles of the common agricultural policy (CAP) than is the case with other areas of the European Union's policy and budget."
"Agricultural policy, which at one time absorbed most of the budget expenditure and will form one-third of the budget by the end of 2013, has been strongly criticised."
"The crowning argument concerned the disproportion between the role played by agriculture in the economy and employment and its share of the EU budget."
"This is a misunderstanding."
"The CAP as a whole is a Community policy, and its share of the EU's aggregate public expenditure, both national and common, does not exceed 0.3% of GDP."
"In addition, international realities have changed, and the disaster of famine in developing countries must make us think again of the principles of support for agriculture in Europe."
"The European Parliament has discussed the problem carefully, as evidenced by the many amendments."
"From the point of view of a state where agriculture is a relatively large contributor to employment, as is the case in Poland, it would be legitimate to raise milk quotas and to provide national support for sectors that are most disadvantaged."
"When considering modulation, which has proved the most controversial of the issues, it is worth remembering that the 'new' Member States will reach 100% direct subsidy level only in 2013, and that modulation may be perceived as a harbinger of re-nationalisation of agricultural policy, which would be a disadvantage."
"in writing. - (RO) As a representative of a region with a significant agriculture sector in Romania, one of the new Member States, I do not think that the disparities in treatment between farmers from these States and those from the old European Union States are being reduced as a result of the assessments carried out during the common agricultural policy's health check."
"However, it is helpful that national milk quotas for Romania have not been changed, along with the fact that Member States have the opportunity to increase their milk quotas for a certain period of time if these quotas are underused in other Member States."
"Bearing in mind the current crisis affecting this sector too, it is important to propose the creation of a milk fund, intended to support restructuring in this sector."
"Furthermore, I think that, before applying the new regulations on dairy quotas starting from 2015, producers must have the opportunity to adapt to market changes and to invest according to market demands, bearing in mind in particular that the deadlines for investment aid applications are relatively lengthy."
"In addition, to enable producers to invest according to market demands, the limit on the set quota must be removed."
"in writing. - (RO) I heard one of my fellow Members talking about the way to share sweets between two children."
"Continuing the analogy, I would like to draw attention to the fact that, if the same child were to be a Romanian or Bulgarian farmer in the future, I would say that he was going to receive what he deserved after eight years."
"My question is whether he will still be a child in eight years' time."
"When I, as a Romanian MEP, joined the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, my attention was drawn to the phrase 'soft landing', which is often used when referring to milk quotas, for example."
"I asked then and I am still asking today: how can Romanian and Bulgarian farmers reconcile the 'takeoff' procedure with the 'soft landing' procedure?"
"When Romania had barely started the accession procedures, a Danish partner said to me that, during this process, the trickiest chapter would be agriculture."
"I hope today that, two years after joining, Romanian agriculture will provide an opportunity for a united Europe."
"in writing. - (BG) Continuing to reform the common agricultural policy (CAP) is important for allowing Europe to maintain its leading role in this sector."
"This, of course, should not be at the cost of producers or the end consumer."
"It is a well-known fact that the European Union has turned from an exporter to an importer of agricultural produce."
"This shows that the outcome of today's debate needs to be a balanced one, so that we can be sure that the interests of all citizens have been protected."
"I believe that a large proportion of the Commission's proposals are beneficial to farmers in Bulgaria, particularly as mismanagement on the part of the Bulgarian Government in this sector and the abuses committed resulted in the failure to reach the results envisaged in the pre-accession mechanisms."
"For this reason in the past few months we have witnessed protests by agricultural producers, mainly dairy and cereal farmers."
"As a result, without jeopardising the full liberalisation of the market for dairy produce, it is important to provide security for those regions that are highly dependent on dairy farming for their livelihoods."
"In Bulgaria, there are a large number of dairy farmers in alpine and other areas with specific difficulties."
"For that reason I support the idea that more funding should be allocated for their development and a specialised fund for milk producers generated."
"School Fresh Fruit Scheme (amendment of Single CMO Regulation) (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Niels Busk, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulations (EC) No 1290/2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy and (EC) No 1234/2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO regulation) in order to set up a School Fruit Scheme - C6-0315/2008 -."
"rapporteur. - (DA) Mr President, Commissioner Fischer-Boel, Minister Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has tabled an extremely constructive proposal for setting up a school fruit scheme in order to reverse the unfortunate trend of increased obesity amongst European schoolchildren."
"It is a proposal that I warmly welcome."
"The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that children eat 400 g of fruit and vegetables per day."
"Unfortunately, there are very few children who do this."
"In the EU, 22 million children are overweight and approximately 5 million children are severely overweight."
"The worst thing about this is that the number is rising by 400 000 children each year."
"An increased intake of fruit and vegetables reduces the risk of a large number of diseases and prevents overweight and severe overweight."
"Eating habits are established in childhood and the indications are that children who learn to eat a lot of fruit and vegetables continue to do so as adults."
"It is therefore vital that we intervene at an early stage if we are to succeed in influencing our children's eating habits."
"Excessive weight entails a greater risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, high blood pressure and certain forms of cancer."
"These diseases constitute an ever increasing threat to public health in the EU, and the cost of treatment weighs heavily on Member States' health budgets."
"The Commission refers to its impact assessment, in which two studies were carried out which shed light on the link between health expenditure and too low an intake of fruit and vegetables."
"Expenditure on a school fruit scheme should be viewed in this light, and therefore the scheme will represent an actual saving in the Member States' health budgets."
"Thus, it will, overall, have a positive effect, first and foremost on public health, but also on the European economy."
"Until we have achieved the objective of getting children to eat 400 g of fruit per day, it will be the case that the more fruit that children eat the greater the savings."
"Thus, prevention is cheaper than cure."
"As rapporteur, I have proposed that we quadruple the amount that is intended to be appropriated in the Community budget."
"The Commission's original proposal of EUR 90 million would, unfortunately, only stretch to a single piece of fruit once a week for 30 weeks for children aged six to ten years."
"This is far from enough if the scheme is to have any appreciable effect on children's eating habits."
"One piece of fruit one day a week is not sufficient to change eating habits or to have an effect on public health."
"The optimum solution would be for all children to receive one piece of fruit every school day."
"It is therefore necessary to mobilise more funds in the Community budget."
"A majority in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development agreed to mobilise EUR 500 million and dispense with the national cofinancing."
"I do not agree with this."
"I hope therefore that in the vote today we can sort this matter out, as I have retabled a proposal on behalf of my Group to the effect that we should mobilise EUR 360 million."
"This should be supplemented by the Member States' contribution and therefore will, overall, provide a far higher amount than the EUR 500 million."
"A majority in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development also agreed that only fruit and vegetables from EU countries should be distributed under the scheme."
"This, for me, is far too protectionist, and will also make the scheme very bureaucratic."
"It must therefore be the Member States which decide - from the list compiled by the Commission - which fruit can be distributed and which fruit will be included in the scheme."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, we in the Presidency are very happy to discuss this scheme with the European Parliament, as proposed by the European Commission and brought personally - and I should like to pay tribute to her - by Mrs Fischer Boel."
"It is an important scheme for the nutrition of the youngest citizens, and it is a practical and effective step to combat the rise in obesity among young people."
"Mr Busk has just stated the figures, and I can corroborate them: one child in five in Europe is overweight or at risk of obesity."
"Childhood obesity in Europe is growing by 2% per year."
"We must therefore encourage young people to vary their diet and to consume more fruit and vegetables."
"I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that implementing this scheme, which everyone is in favour of, shows the important role that the common agricultural policy can play and does play in encouraging the consumption and, more simply, the production of healthy, quality produce."
"Agriculture is naturally suited to meet this dual challenge, which consists of the challenge of quantity - which was also its first challenge, with the first contract drawn up with farmers in the 1960s - but also, the challenge of quality, relating to the quality and safety of products."
"That, ladies and gentlemen, proves that Europe can respond and does respond to the specific concerns of our fellow citizens and that agriculture is clearly at the centre of the major challenges faced by our society."
"When we talk about this 'fruit and vegetables' scheme, we are talking about a tangible, people-based Europe, centred on citizens, which Europeans expect."
"This programme, ladies and gentlemen, has been very well-received within the Council of Ministers, and the debates we have had, which we will continue today and tomorrow, show that, overall, we are all making progress on this issue."
"It is my intention to achieve a political agreement in the Council this week."
"That is why I am naturally paying close attention to Parliament's position on this issue so that I can include your position and your support in the debates of the Council."
"Finally, Mr President, I should like to offer my sincerest thanks to your rapporteur, Mr Busk, for the very detailed and impassioned work he has done on this issue, and now I am happy to listen to you, and the Commissioner."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, firstly it feels good to have Parliament behind me on the proposal on the School Fruit Scheme."
"I would, as I normally do, thank the committee and the rapporteur, Niels Busk, for the work that has been done."
"Before I comment on some of the issues that have been raised here - and in Parliament as well - I would just like to say something about a topic that has recently been discussed at some length in the Council."
"A number of Member States have asked to be able, in some cases, to ask parents for a contribution to the Scheme."
"The arguments for and against are not straightforward. In the end, the Commission has agreed that Member States should have the freedom to require cofinancing from parents in some cases."
"On the other hand, I see no reason to force this on all Member States."
"Therefore we would make it possible for Member States to choose whether they want to take this possibility on board."
"Then when we review the Scheme in 2012 we would really focus on the end-value to be gained from parental contributions."
"I have said from the beginning that what we are now putting on the table is not going to solve the obesity problems among young people in Europe, but I believe that it will be a helping hand and give a clear signal from the Commission that it is important to give our young people good eating habits."
"With regard to the overall budget, we have allocated EUR 90 million."
"I have seen some different figures, as Niels Busk rightly said - from EUR 500 million down to EUR 360 million - but the EUR 90 million that we have proposed is certainly not written in stone for the future."
"I think that we should also take into account in our review of the whole programme to be made in 2012 whether we need to increase the budget."
"I think it has been important that we have indicated that we are ready to reallocate the money."
"If there is a surplus of money in one Member State, it can be reallocated."
"That will hopefully mean that we spend the money in the best possible way."
"Regarding the type of fruit and vegetables to be distributed, I feel that it is very safe to leave this in the capable hands of the Member States."
"Whether they want to use processed food or to deliver local fruit and vegetables -or even to have the possibility of distributing ACP bananas to their children - the final choice should definitely be made by the Member States."
"I think that in this way we will get by far the best result."
"I am looking forward to a fruitful discussion on this issue."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (RO) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Barnier, first of all, I would like to thank our rapporteur for the work he has done and the efforts he has made to reconcile the different points of view."
"We all agree on how important this scheme is in terms of teaching children to adopt healthy habits and therefore combat obesity, but also in terms of helping families who cannot afford to buy fruit for their children."
"I support the Commission's proposal, but I think that it absolutely must be improved."
"The EUR 90 million proposed in annual funding is not enough."
"Supplementing the funds already allocated is one of the conditions for this scheme's success."
"I also think that the proposal made in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to rule out parents having to contribute to this should be introduced at least for the scheme's launch."
"I would also like to encourage, as part of the scheme, the provision of fresh, traditional fruit, produced on the Community's territory."
"I would like to stress the fact that the Member States need to specify which fruit are to be distributed, taking into specific consideration the seasonal fruit and vegetables produced locally."
"As required by the principle of subsidiarity, Member States should, when determining the target group, be granted sufficient flexibility to enable them, in keeping with their needs, to supply school fruit to as wide a circle of consumers as possible."
"The scheme should equally bring young consumers to appreciate fruit and vegetables and should therefore have a highly positive effect on public health and the fight against child poverty, especially in new Member States."
"Provision may be made for joint measures to promote consumption of certain products, to be combined with an additional health and nutrition education component and to provide encouragement to regional producers, especially those in mountain regions."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, this scheme has been long-awaited by the fruit and vegetable sector, not only because of the difficulties that it is facing, but also because of the worrying decline in consumption."
"This scheme is intended to improve public health and I therefore believe it should be a European scheme, with full Community financing."
"I do not agree that parents should have to contribute to its funding because the same thing will happen as always: those children whose parents can afford to contribute will eat fruit and vegetables in school, whereas those who cannot will be left outside the scheme."
"This scheme must therefore be financed by the Community so that it can be applied uniformly."
"I also particularly want to say that emphasis must be placed on educational measures."
"This scheme must not simply involve children eating apples; rather, they must know what type of apple they are eating and what its nutritional properties are and they must understand the beneficial effects of that fruit on their health and development."
"Naturally, the products must come with full quality guarantees, with priority being given, if possible, to seasonal fruit."
"Also, where possible, I support the distribution of fruits and vegetables of Community origin."
"I believe that the beneficial effects of this scheme, which I applaud and on which I congratulate the Commissioner, will be seen immediately."
"They will be seen not only in the present and future health of our children and their food education, but also, and very importantly, in the fruit and vegetable sector."
"This is a productive sector which truly forms part of our European cultural heritage and which allows us to enjoy a balanced, healthy and varied diet."
"I feel it is worthwhile trusting and investing in this scheme to distribute fruit and vegetables in our schools."
"In my opinion, the budget is somewhat limited so I would repeat that I support full Community financing of such an ambitious scheme."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I very much value the positive and intelligent work done by Mr Busk on this proposal, which forms part of the reform of the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables, designed to reinforce the sector's competitiveness and the way in which it is tailored to the market, and to combat the fall in consumption."
"The proposed scheme to promote fruit and vegetables in schools would help to encourage young people to eat fruit and increase consumption."
"In addition, the free distribution of fruit and vegetables in schools should be aimed at combating the problem of overweight schoolchildren; it is a well-known fact, unfortunately, that over 22 million children are affected by obesity."
"In order to effectively implement the scheme to distribute fruit in schools, it is vital for Community aid to cover all the associated logistical costs, such as the purchase of the appropriate vending machines, which would otherwise have to come out of schools' budgets or from pupils' families."
"National funding ought therefore to be of an additional nature, and ought to be restricted to new schemes and the extension of existing ones."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, there is nothing to dislike in this proposal and I commend our rapporteur for coming up with it, especially with an election in the offing."
"I think any politician in this room looking to June next year will be in favour of seeing Europe's children eating better and eating European local fruit."
"It is good news for Europe's farmers as well because this is creating a local market."
"It is good news for the health budget of the future and more importantly it is good news for the children themselves."
"If we start children eating healthy at a young age, they will keep up the habit."
"Finland has demonstrated and proven that aggressive intervention at an early age does make a difference, and that is very much to be welcomed."
"If we speculate a little on the agriculture budget now, we will accumulate on the health budget of the future."
"Coming from Scotland I am ashamed to say that we have a particular interest in this, in that 21% - one in five - of our primary school children are overweight."
"That is utterly unsustainable."
"We cannot look towards a future of increasing obesity, so this is part of the solution to that and I am delighted to commend it to the House."
"It is good news all round."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (GA) - Mr President, this proposal will fulfil the objectives of the Union in relation to the common agricultural policy (CAP) and will provide a funding framework for initiatives aimed at increasing the amount of fruit and vegetables eaten by children."
"This could help to combat childhood obesity and will also benefit our fruit and vegetable farmers in the long term."
"Eating habits and patterns are developed during the first few years of life."
"As such, it is important that we are able to encourage healthier eating habits among children."
"The Member States should be able to choose the best method."
"Research suggests that eating patterns tend to be unhealthiest in low-income households."
"Therefore, the distribution of free fruit and vegetables in schools could make a large difference to children's eating habits."
"I welcome Mr Niels Busk's report and thank him and the Commissioner for the work they have done."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, this project is being dressed up as all about concern for the welfare of children."
"However, the real agenda is a disturbing mixture of Nanny Brussels, control-freakism, sheer naked propaganda and market fixing."
"Nanny Brussels likes to be in control of everything, including what we eat."
"Putting itself in charge of what children eat at school is the first major step in that process."
"The propaganda angle is that each piece of fruit will have an EU label on it and the whole project will be supported by a massive publicity campaign."
"In regard to the fruit market, I understand it will create a great many opportunities for mischief such as mandatory rules that all fruit must come from inside the EU."
"In the case of bananas, this could at a stroke rule out British suppliers who obtain their bananas from British Commonwealth Caribbean countries, and thus it will provide a lucrative new opportunity for the French islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, we are being bombarded with headlines."
"We are told that we are obese, our children are obese, we are eating the wrong foods and we eat too little fresh fruit and too few vegetables."
"Five portions per day, or around 400 g of fruit and vegetables, is the recommended daily allowance for a healthy and balanced diet."
"It is not always easy to keep to this."
"Food needs to be healthy, last a long time, taste good and cost as little as possible."
"However, the fast pace of life today means that it is often difficult for us to balance the demands of family and work, so that we sometimes do not have enough time to cook and instead choose semi-prepared or fully prepared products."
"There is nothing wrong with this, provided we are aware of the importance of fresh fruit and vegetables."
"People who learn to eat a diet rich in fruit and vegetables at an early stage will also maintain a healthy diet later in life."
"I therefore expressly support the Commission's proposal to introduce a school fruit scheme funded to the tune of EUR 90 million."
"What a wonderful idea, Commissioner!"
"However, as you have recognised in your provisions, Member States must be allowed to organise the scheme according to their own national requirements."
"It must be possible to provide the relevant regional and seasonal produce."
"Member States must also develop a strategy to define the best way in which to implement a school fruit scheme and integrate it into the curriculum."
"Healthy eating is part of general education."
"Children must learn, for example, that, as well as a hot vegetable, carrots can also be enjoyed in the form of soup, salad, cakes or in baked dishes."
"They need to know what a potato tastes like if it is not made into crisps or chips."
"They need to have their interest stimulated in the many ways of preparing regional produce."
"Information is the only way to lay the foundations for a healthy diet."
"Knowledge is the key to a healthy lifestyle."
"The school fruit scheme can make a valuable contribution in this context."
"(HU) Mr Barnier, Commissioner, like every initiative, this one too has many masters."
"After all, seven towns laid claim to being Homer's birthplace."
"Many people think that this was their initiative."
"Based on the report of proceedings, I am proud that on 10 May 2005, in the debate on the reform of the market in fruit and vegetables, I proposed this scheme, and I am grateful to the Commissioner that it is now to become reality."
"Those who have spoken before me have explained why this is very important."
"It is important not just from a social perspective but also in order to teach young people about nutritional culture."
"This is a French pear, but I will not eat it because it is forbidden to eat it here."
"It is very important that, when young people receive school fruit bearing the EU logo, they should know - from childhood onwards - that this is safe and not full of chemicals, but wherever possible organic."
"Let us teach children about nutritional culture, as this is a very important task."
"I congratulate Mr Busk on this."
"I will not eat [this pear], because I will not break the rules, but I think that all of us can be proud of this scheme. Thank you for your attention."
"Mr President, sometimes it is great to be able to come into this Chamber and support a really positive European proposal and, despite Mr Titford's attempt to deflate our good humour, today is such a day."
"This proposal ticks so many boxes."
"It promotes healthy eating habits among young children and adolescents."
"It enhances the overall health of young Europeans."
"It ensures that EU money is spent on a project that is already being shown to deliver positive results in many Member States, and it is a practical, down-to-earth, workable proposal."
"I am very familiar with a similar programme in Ireland called 'Food Dudes' - because my grandson has kept me up to date."
"It has been shown that this programme is effective, with long-standing results across the age range 4-12 and these results stand up regardless of gender, school size and socioeconomic factors."
"Therefore, we are building on firm foundations."
"I am happy to support increased Community funding and to give particular consideration to organic and locally produced fruit and vegetables."
"I want to congratulate the Commissioner and our rapporteur Mr Niels Busk, and I am very pleased to hear the response from the Council."
"This proposal will contribute positively to quality of life and health in the EU."
"(SV) Mr President, the fact that fruit and vegetables are important for people is hardly news, nor is the fact that they are important foods for children."
"For children to be given fruit at school is a good thing."
"It is good for health and provides a badly-needed energy supplement."
"However, what does the proposal we are currently debating actually involve?"
"It is in fact a pure propaganda proposal from the EU."
"The purpose of this initiative is to win cheap political points while presumably at the same time persuading children of the excellent qualities of the EU."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has tabled some absurd proposals, including the claim that European fruit is better than any other fruit."
"Only EU fruit is to be provided, for example bananas from remote regions."
"This is downright protectionism."
"The intention is for children to learn that the EU is good and that fruit from the EU is even better."
"The Commission and the European Parliament should be ashamed of themselves."
"Mr President, I am eating an apple courtesy of Mr Busk."
"He is giving away apples outside so if any Members want to go and get one I am sure Mr Busk will be happy to give them an apple!"
"I think this is an excellent report."
"As Ms Harkin said, we often come to this Chamber and cannot be as glowing and look forward to such a good initiative."
"We must, however, provide more funds to ensure that our young people are able to access, partake of and utilise this opportunity to the full, because this is one of those rare occasions when we can offer something."
"We complain about the situation and read in the press and the media about how bad the problems of obesity and suchlike are among schoolchildren."
"Our young people today are nonetheless excellent people but have lots of pressures on them that maybe we in the past did not have."
"I think this is one opportunity where we can give them the possibility of good healthy eating."
"I welcome this, support this and offer my congratulations."
"- (RO) Mr President, Commissioner, the European Commission has proposed the allocation of EUR 90 million from the Community budget for a scheme where every child aged between 6 and 10 will receive one portion of fruit or vegetables every week."
"I would urge Member States to expand this scheme and its associated financing, both at European and national level, so that all children, including those of pre-school age, can receive a portion of fruit every day."
"I hope that we will all approve the increase in the budget to EUR 500 million."
"I welcome the fact that the scheme must only involve fresh fruit and vegetables produced in the European Union."
"They should be seasonal and come from local, organic farming."
"I would like to present a similar initiative launched by the Romanian Government back in 2003, whereby all children in pre-school and primary education receive a glass of milk and a fresh roll every school day."
"Introducing a proper diet for children of school and pre-school age is part of the health education we need to provide for the younger generation."
"(PL) Mr President, providing primary and secondary schoolchildren with fruit is undoubtedly the right idea, since it has not only an economic dimension, but a much broader social one."
"This is because it develops healthy eating habits and thus improves the general health of society."
"There is no doubt that EUR 90 million is too little to ensure proper functioning of the scheme."
"The involvement of national authorities and school founding bodies as well as the community at large would therefore be desirable."
"I hope that the School Fruit Scheme will be widely supported and that Mr Busk's efforts will not have been in vain."
"(PT) We would highlight the importance of setting up a proper scheme for the distribution, free of charge and on a daily basis, of seasonal fresh fruit and vegetables to schools, with priority being given to pre-school and primary-school children."
"This scheme is essential given its positive effects in terms of healthy eating, public health, the fight against child poverty and the encouragement and stimulus that may be given to regional products, including those of mountain regions, produced locally by our farmers."
"This requires much greater funding than is proposed by the European Commission."
"As a result, Commissioner, the proposals tabled by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, to which we also contributed, should be taken into account."
"I must also congratulate our rapporteur on the work carried out."
"Mr President, I welcome the Commissioner's proposal on school fruit."
"It is very important that we get this scheme going."
"I also agree with her that it needs subsidiarity, because what we want is a system that is not too bureaucratic so that we can actually get it into our schools."
"I also think we need flexibility on the type of fruit that we can provide, because some times of year it will be very difficult to get fresh fruit and we may occasionally need processed fruit."
"Let us not have too many prescriptive amendments but, rather, get this scheme accepted."
"I also think that one or two of Parliament's proposals on the amount of funding needed are too much."
"Because, if we had codecision powers in this Parliament, we would have to sign up to the budget as well as the process."
"If we are to be credible in this Parliament, let us put forward a scheme that is fundable, gives school fruit to the children who most need it and then they will progress to eating fruit in the future."
"This is a scheme."
"Let me say to Mr Titford that I am not worried whether Europe provides it, whether Britain provides it, France provides it or whatever, but what we have to be sure of is that school fruit goes into our schools."
"(DA) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am, in fact, opposed to agricultural aid and any extension of this, but when it comes to improving our children's health, I think that we should actually do an awful lot."
"All organisations fighting against disease have unequivocally recommended the introduction of fruit schemes in schools."
"Even small amounts of fruit appear to make a difference to health."
"I therefore wholeheartedly support the Commission's proposal."
"However, I think that it is important for fruit and health to be the central issue."
"I am therefore opposed to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development's proposal that the fruit should only come from the EU."
"That is totally wrong."
"I think that the focus should be on children's health and not on agricultural economics."
"Mr President, I just want to say a few words to express my feelings on the conclusions of this debate, which has been extremely lively and consensual."
"In general terms, I find it reflects the very original initiative of Mr Busk and Mrs de Lange."
"The debate shows that there is virtually unanimous support for this scheme proposed by the European Commission to encourage young Europeans to eat more fruit and vegetables."
"I can tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that the Council of Ministers also shares this commitment, and we will strive to achieve a consensus based on the position that you will adopt with the Council in broad terms."
"I shall just return to four of what I consider to be important points from among your comments."
"Firstly, with regard to the issue of the budget allocated to this operation."
"The proactive approach taken by Parliament clearly shows that you are committed to this initiative, and I am happy about that."
"I shall report on this proposal to the Council and I agree with Mrs Fischer Boel that the sum of EUR 90 million referred to in the proposal is not, as she said, set in stone."
"The second point I would note is that the main concern we all have is to give young people wholesome fruit and offer them a range of healthy products, with no added sugar."
"The third point relates to the promotion of local products to increase awareness about the quality of Community products."
"I would also add, with regard to the concern just expressed by Mr Casaca about the outermost regions, that there are, on the Community market, products that come from these outermost regions - which form an integral part of our European Union - and that are high-quality products."
"That is also understood in your deliberations, and this concern is also shared within the Council of Ministers."
"Finally, you have a expressed a position that is also in line with that of the Council: a Community framework, like the one presented to you, is required for this kind of action, but we must also give Member States the adaptability and flexibility necessary to implement this scheme as closely as possible to communities, associations and citizens."
"To sum up these four points, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to repeat that this timely initiative is, certainly, limited in terms of budget, but that it is an initiative that is symbolic of a Europe that is positive and proactive, a Europe that acknowledges the new challenges of our society and above all, ladies and gentlemen, a Europe that will go into schools and be spoken and thought of favourably by the young people of Europe."
"I believe that the image that we are projecting through this Commission initiative is one of a positive Europe that is focused on citizens. That is what the citizens of Europe expect."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank you for the overwhelming support for this important proposal."
"Let me say to Mr Titford and Ms Goudin that to say that this proposal is propaganda is pure nonsense."
"(Applause)"
"This was meant - as many of you have mentioned - to give good eating habits to our school children."
"I am quite sure that if we manage it in a clever way, building on the experiences that we have already had from the Irish 'Food Dudes' programme, we can do quite a lot."
"Then in 2012 we can see whether we can improve the system further."
"I completely agree with Ms Salinas García that we can use this in an educational way, not only to educate kids to eat more fruit and vegetables but also to try to explain where the fruit and vegetables come from, how important it is, etc."
"I am looking forward, together with Michel Barnier, to finding the right balance in the Council as well to the benefit to the health of our young people."
"rapporteur. - (DA) Mr President, I would like to express my thanks for the many positive contributions and, in this connection, I would also like to thank you, Commissioner, for your particularly constructive cooperation."
"That is actually to be expected, as we always work well with you and your cabinet."
"I would also like to thank you, Minister."
"It has been an enormous pleasure to cooperate with you and the French Presidency, because you have taken the time, to an unusual degree, to really talk through the issues in depth."
"The Presidency does not always have the time to do this."
"I would also like to remind everyone in the House that all of the contributions made here called for more than the EUR 90 million to be mobilised."
"I would like to remind you of this with the simple observation that, if we do not mobilise more money, this scheme will become a huge administrative apparatus with very little fruit being distributed."
"We cannot allow that to happen if we really want to help change the eating habits of children, which is something that, unfortunately, is very much needed."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday 18 November 2008."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (NL) We are convinced that we have to throw our weight behind projects that guarantee all young people up to the age of 12 a piece of school fruit a day."
"Schools play a crucial role in teaching them a healthy lifestyle."
"Healthy food and sufficient physical exercise help prevent obesity."
"Children who learn to like fruit at school will carry on eating fruit into adulthood."
"Many schools already make huge efforts to offer children fruit every day, but the funds to do this are too limited."
"European financial support for school fruit is therefore important."
"We would therefore make an emotional appeal to the European Commission and the Council to support this budget increase."
"After all, it is the health of our young people that is at stake, and this cost would be recovered in time."
"in writing. - (LT) It is important that the principle of subsidiarity is applied in the implementation of this scheme, so that the Member States themselves decide the age of the children that the School Fresh Fruit Scheme is aimed at and which fruit and vegetables should be supplied."
"I also think that priority should be given to products of Community origin."
"However, we should not refuse products originating from outside the Community, as this would violate competition and World Trade Organization rules."
"I think that the administration of this scheme should be as simple as possible, thus I propose that the rules on strategy preparation be dropped."
"Preparing a national strategy for the implementation of one measure and with a small budget is too strict a requirement."
"Instead of strategy preparation there could be the requirement to prepare national administration rules, incorporating certain provisions set out in the strategy implementation rules presented by the Commission."
"I would like to urge everyone to think about the need for strategy organisation when preparing the scheme implementation rules (this point is important for Lithuania because of the administration)."
"The implementation of the School Fresh Fruit Scheme should involve additional funds from national budgets, as the scheme should be partly funded by the Member States."
"However, even in the midst of the current financial crisis, we must look to the long-term prospects of protecting the health of our children and young people."
"Let us not cast off the weight of responsibility from our shoulders."
"in writing. - (RO) The proposal for a regulation concerning fruit for children at school is part of a series of initiatives launched by the Commission with the main aim of combating obesity and promoting a healthy diet."
"The budget of EUR 90 million proposed by the Commission would have proved to be insufficient to achieve the scheme's objective."
"The ALDE Group's initiative to increase Community funding to EUR 360 million is an important step in the right direction."
"Member States in turn will make their contribution to give a final budget of EUR 720 million."
"I firmly believe that only with such a budget will the scheme prove to be effective."
"We will therefore be able to offer an acceptable number of portions of fruit per week to pupils aged between 6 and 10."
"At the same time, I would encourage educational institutions to introduce nutrition lessons as part of the curriculum to explain the theory behind the role of a healthy diet."
"It is only by making a joint, coordinated effort that we will manage to change the eating habits of future generations."
"in writing. - I am happy to support the scheme to provide school children with fruit in order to encourage healthier eating habits in the young."
"Hopefully, this project will go some way towards modifying the eating patterns of the youngest members of European society."
"Long-term studies have shown that eating habits acquired in childhood serve as a model for life."
"They have the potential not only to influence this generation of children, but also their children."
"More interestingly it has been reported that children's food preferences have an impact on the eating habits of their parents."
"Let us hope that this worthwhile scheme goes some of the way towards making us all healthier and fitter."
"in writing. - (PL) I am pleased that we are setting up a Community scheme to promote eating fruit in schools."
"The positive impact of this scheme can be considered on many levels: social, economic and financial."
"As a member of Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I can see that the scheme will have clearly favourable consequences on European agriculture and fruit farming, in the form of increased demand for fruit and the maintenance of high production levels in Europe."
"I am also a father, and as a father I can see a positive outcome which is hard to quantify: the health of the young generation."
"Increasing the proportion of fruit and vegetables in the diet of school-age children is of huge importance, as their eating habits are formed during that time."
"In Poland, fruit and vegetable consumption is approximately 250 g per person per day."
"This level is among the lowest in the Community: only the Czech Republic, Latvia and Slovakia consume less."
"The Community average is 380 g, whereas the World Health Organization/Food and Agriculture Organization recommended minimum daily consumption of fruit and vegetables is 400 g."
"Countries such as Poland need a major school fruit promotional campaign."
"I hope that the School Fruit Scheme will soon be successfully introduced in all educational institutions throughout the European Union and will remain a permanent element of its educational policy."
"The European Union's desire to support the consumption of fruit in school is certainly to be welcomed."
"Sound nutrition in childhood offers good prospects for a healthy lifestyle later in life, and a properly educated child will popularise healthy nutrition among his or her family and friends as well."
"Those responsible for the scheme also need to look closely at what kind of fruit they are offering children."
"It would be a serious mistake if schools were to end up with fruit filled with pesticide residues and therefore difficult to sell."
"As a result, the scheme needs to be set up in such a way that schools are provided only with healthy fruit containing pesticide levels well below the maximum allowable limits."
"It is likewise desirable, in the interests of healthy nutrition, primarily to use Community funds to provide domestic fruit that contains lower sugar levels and higher fibre, rather than to offer bananas, for instance."
"in writing. - (RO) The illnesses from which modern man suffers are due to diet, but they can be cured through following the right diet."
"I support the distribution of fruit in schools."
"I cannot help thinking of the fact that in Romania a glass of milk and a roll have been distributed in schools for free since 2002."
"While, at the start, we were happy to offer this benefit only to children in primary schools, since 2006 this measure has also been extended to pre-school children and since 2007 to secondary school children."
"The European School Fruit Scheme will, at least in Romania, supplement the one mentioned above."
"There are numerous benefits to this. I would like to mention just two of them:"
"The World Health Organization recommends that children up to the age of 11 consume at least 400 grams of fruit and vegetables per day."
"I am thinking in this case too of the European Parliament resolution of 25 September 2008 concerning the White Paper on diet-related health problems."
"Let us not forget that food and the way we eat play a decisive role in helping us to maintain our health as it is."
"Disparities will be reduced: children come from different socio-economic backgrounds, with some of them being hugely disadvantaged."
"in writing. - (RO) The Commission's proposal to introduce the consumption of fruit in schools will be beneficial to the health of the European Union's citizens, making a significant contribution to the economic and social development of every Member State."
"Eating habits are formed during childhood and can last a person's whole life."
"Schools are the most suitable starting point for determining this type of behaviour as the school is the second form of authority, after the family, which has direct contact with children and significant influence over them."
"This scheme, combined with the launch of a nutritional education scheme in schools, would produce more results in terms of developing preferences for a healthy diet, which includes fruit and vegetables."
"Children need to be, first and foremost, educated and encouraged to eat this type of product with increased nutritional value so that the scheme will achieve its intended objective, in terms of preventing obesity-related illnesses, malnutrition or diabetes, which may occur in adult life."
"The amendments proposed by Parliament will improve the Commission's text considerably by allocating EUR 500 million per year to finance the introduction of the scheme to provide pupils with fruit and vegetables, which will consequently boost agricultural production at European Union level."

"- (FR) Mr President, my request is based on Rule 168 of our Rules of Procedure."
"For 10 years, Mr President, I sat on the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities."
"I carefully read Mr Lehne's report and I must express - and I would say irrespective of the political persuasion of the Member in question - my astonishment that, at this point, we are deviating from the established case-law of the committee, which has been to uphold the parliamentary immunity of members prosecuted for political reasons."
"However, Mr Vanhecke is being prosecuted as the head of the publication."
"He is being prosecuted for an article, whose author is known, and, according to Belgian law, as acknowledged by the report, in this situation, the head of the publication should not be prosecuted."
"What is more, the prosecution is based on the fact that the foreign identity of those who desecrate graves has been revealed."
"It was brought on the initiative of Belgian socialist councillors."
"It is clear, and this is my last point, Mr President ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr Gollnisch, I apologise, but no debate on voting of this type is permitted;"

"The report confuses everything: health, taxation and so on."
"(Applause from the right)"
"It seems to me that the opinion of the rapporteur, Mrs Lulling, is clear, regardless of whether it is shared."
"We will move on to a roll-call vote on the entire proposal, as amended."
"(PT) I want to protest about the statement made by Mrs Lulling who is trying to condition the vote of Members in this House."
"This does not make sense."
"The interpretation being given is one that we do not share."
"It is only in this sense that I would ask Members, who know what this is about, who know that we defending other interests, namely public health interests and the interests of citizens and countries, to vote for the report."
"(Applause from the left)"
"I would like to remind Members that at this point in the conduct of the voting procedure there is no provision for debate."
"Under the Rules of Procedure, the rapporteur is entitled to express her own opinion and therefore I have obviously given her that right, and I did not know whether the next request to speak was on procedural grounds."

"- (CS) Mr President, the extent of the financial crisis shows that neither banks nor consumers have been taking responsible decisions."
"I am strongly in favour of investing in financial education and I have also approved the report, but I cannot agree with superficial campaigns and general principles."
"I am concerned that we have analysis as the situation may vary between the Member States."
"I also know that the education must be narrowly focused on the specific requirements of a range of different groups of citizens in order to be really effective."
"I would like to bring to your attention some exemplary practice from the Czech Republic."
"For the last three years a single person has been running a website called www.bankovnipoplatky.com."
"This website makes a vital contribution to the financial education of those Czech citizens who are on the internet."
"This shows that this issue can be solved cheaply and effectively."
"What is missing, however, is education for schoolchildren and the older generation and we will not manage this without public funding."
"- (SK) The financial crisis has provided European consumers with an excellent opportunity to check their knowledge of financial matters."
"They have been given a wonderful lesson in the importance of their understanding of personal finance, in savings assessment, in the use of insurance products, and in reading of ordinary bank statements and receipts."
"All these subjects require a knowledge of financial terminology and its correct application in the management of their finances."
"For this reason I consider the report from the rapporteur Mrs Iotova to be a further important contribution from the EP in the area of consumer protection and I have voted in its favour."
"I firmly believe that the education of consumers must begin in primary school."
"The Member States should include this topic, especially finance, in textbooks of primary and secondary schools."
"The DOLCETA and EURÓPSKY DIÁR websites should receive more promotion."
"I appreciate activities of consumer organisations aimed at educating not only schoolchildren but also teachers."
"Various competitions, organised with great enthusiasm, attract large numbers of young consumers."
"Under my patronage and within the context of consumer education for schoolchildren, the Slovak Consumers' Association is organising an annual competition called Consumers for Life."
"The competition is generating enormous interest and the winners will be awarded a trip to the EP."
"Mr President, thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to offer my explanation of vote."
"I think there is probably a consensus in this room that the credit crunch and the liquidity crisis that we faced were caused by poor lending decisions taken, not only by banks - and those decisions were forced on them by the Clinton Administration and successive regimes which suggested that banks should lend to communities that were deemed uncreditworthy - but also by consumers making poor decisions."
"Having been encouraged to take out loans which they perhaps could not afford to repay, they then found themselves bearing the brunt of being unable to pay those loans."
"This highlights the importance of consumer financial education."
"However, we seem to be falling into the trap of thinking that, whatever the problem, the EU has a solution."
"If you look at the solutions listed here on the Commission website, in the Europe Diary, they actually do very little to address the issue of consumer education."
"We should be looking at community organisations - like the Croydon Caribbean Credit Union in my constituency - that help solve these problems at the community level and not the European level."
"- (FR) Mr President, I asked Parliament to vote against the report since only a small minority voted for guide levels lower than those currently applied."
"I should like to point out that the Commission is not in favour of guide levels."
"In 2005, this House voted in favour of the Rosati report to abolish guide levels, and now we are taking a step backwards and reducing what we voted for."
"Most Members do not know what they voted for."
"Now we are reducing the current guide levels by 50%, which is to say, instead of 800 cigarettes, you have voted for 400, instead of 10 litres of spirits, you have voted for 5 litres, instead of 90 litres of wine, you have voted for 45 litres, instead of 110 litres of beer, you have voted for 55 litres. You are taking a step backwards and halving current levels for purchase by private individuals."
"I believe that the message to Commissioner Kovács and the Council of Ministers is, all the same, clear; there are only five Members who, in the end, are not going to vote in favour of my report."
"I would therefore like the Council to know that the Commissioner - as he said yesterday evening - agrees with indicative limits, but those which currently apply."
"This must be clear, Mr President; as rapporteur I must say this because it is essential in order to interpret the vote."
"Mr President, it is my privilege to represent the handsome villages, the rolling downs and the bluebell groves of the English Home Counties."
"Like every other MEP for South-East England, I have received dozens of heartbreaking complaints from constituents who have suffered from the arbitrary confiscation of legally purchased alcohol and tobacco at the Channel ports."
"Labour's repeated hikes in the excise duty have served to drive income that ought to be coming to retailers in my constituency across the Channel."
"In time, jobs have also been pushed from the English Home Counties across the water."
"Revenue that ought to be coming to the British Exchequer is instead going to Continental treasuries."
"The Government's response has then been to spend this dwindling income stream on hiring more and more excise officers in a futile attempt to police a system wherein most of our alcohol and tobacco had now become smuggled."
"That is the system which, to their shame, Labour MEPs have just voted to go back to."
"I think it is a disgrace."
"Mr President, I would just like to echo the sentiments expressed by the previous speakers, Ms Lulling, the rapporteur, and my colleague, Dan Hannan, from the South-East of England."
"I, too, as a Member of the European Parliament for London - the greatest city in the world and capital of the greatest country in the world - have received a number of letters from constituents complaining about the heavy-handed approach of customs and excise as they have sought to go about their life and purchase alcohol and cigarettes from the continent and bring them back for their own enjoyment or the enjoyment of their family and friends."
"What do the customs and excise duty officers do in the United Kingdom?"
"They pick on them, they ask intrusive questions, they haul them outside their vehicles, including pensioners, and they question them intrusively trying to find out exactly how much alcohol they drink and how many cigarettes they smoke in some sort of Gestapo-type inquisition."
"This is not the sort of behaviour we expect from law enforcement officers or excise officers in the United Kingdom or across Europe."
"Voting on the report today in the way we did, we have gone backwards - not only backwards before 1992 but to a period previously where there was no free movement, or very limited free movement, of goods."
"- (SK) I voted in favour of the report because the occurrence of excessive weight and obesity in the European Union has increased rapidly over the last two decades, with almost 22 million children overweight and this figure growing by up to 400 000 a year."
"More than 90% of childhood obesity cases are caused by poor eating habits and lack of exercise."
"These children suffer from serious nutritional disorders as well as joint disorders, lower immunity and an increased frequency of illnesses."
"Following the approval of the White Paper on 'A Strategy for Europe on Nutrition, Overweight and Obesity-related health issues', the present directive is good news for the fight against childhood obesity."
"I consider the scheme to increase the distribution of fruit and vegetables in European schools as necessary."
"We should also give more consideration to children in pre-school institutions."
"Counselling and creating good and balanced eating habits would contribute more to the development of a healthy population than this distribution scheme alone."
"(PL) Mr President, the School Fruit Scheme as well as the School Milk Scheme and the scheme to distribute food to the most needy in the EU are marvellous EU initiatives which are very necessary and must definitely be supported."
"The distribution of free fruit and vegetables to schoolchildren will not only contribute to improving their health and changing their eating habits, but will also produce a positive social impact."
"I take a favourable view of a number of the European Commission's proposals, and consider that they will not cause major controversies."
"At the same time, I hope that the Commissioner, and in particular our Agriculture Ministers from the EU-27, will be slightly more generous."
"We must remember that the health of our children is at stake, and we should not economise on it."
"- (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in the same way as the other PPE-DE Group MEPs from the Czech Republic, against the Busk report on fruit and vegetables in schools."
"Parents should have primary responsibility for the healthy diet of their children."
"The European Union has no authority in the areas of either education or health."
"These matters must be administered by the Member States in accordance with their own national preferences."
"There is no rational reason for the European Union to be using taxpayers' money to pay for schoolchildren to have one piece of fruit per week."
"The EU should have concerns about genuine Europe-wide issues, for example, the removal of barriers to the four fundamental freedoms, and it should not contravene its own principle of subsidiarity."
"Mr President, we have come a long way from the time when we were trying to keep schoolchildren out of orchards as they stole apples to the position today, where they have no interest in either apples or orchards."
"So this fruit scheme is welcome."
"The problem is that many parents are not aware of the importance of fruit and vegetables, so it will educate children and parents about the health benefits of fruit and vegetable consumption."
"Of course the key to the success of the scheme will be back in the Member States."
"We do not want a complicated, rule-based scheme."
"We want flexibility and we need to engage with teachers, in particular, who will deliver the fruit and vegetables, and with parents, so that they will ensure that children eat and enjoy fruit and veg and develop healthy eating habits throughout their life."
"(PL) Mr President, teenagers weighing over 150 kg are a frequent sight in American cities."
"I do not want us to make the same mistake."
"The promotion of healthy eating models and the consumption of healthier, non-fattening products in childhood and in youth are an investment in the health of future generations."
"They will also produce savings in the costs of treatment for diabetes and cardiovascular and bone diseases."
"For this reason, a scheme which is too modest will in practice be inefficient both in terms of health and in terms of economics."
"That is why I supported Amendment 7, which quadruples the minimum expenditure on fruit for schoolchildren, and thus guarantees one portion of fruit or vegetables at least four days a week, not just once a week."
"I am pleased that it was an amendment proposed by the Commission."
"The introduction of the scheme should not depend on parents' agreement to cofinance it."
"In particular, the children of poorer parents should have the chance to receive free fruit at school, and therefore the funding for the scheme should be increased."
"Mr President, let me explain why I voted against the report by Ms Pervenche Berès and Mr Werner Langen."
"There are at least three points I would like to stress."
"The very first one is that the report calls for a higher and deeper coordination of economic and financial national policies."
"The second is that it will entail a highly coordinated fiscal policy that will need political unification, and the consequence of the political unification is the third reason why I voted against."
"I do not share the view that political coordination that eliminates natural differences among Member States will become the remedy and a healing answer to current European problems."
"The current European problems are the free movement of labour and the free movement of capital and services."
"(PL) Viewed from the perspective of the 10 years of existence of Economic and Monetary Union, we need to ask ourselves whether we truly associate the euro sign with prosperity and stabilisation."
"There is no doubt that there can be only one answer to this question."
"While accepting that there have been some negative aspects to adopting the common currency, such as price rises during the initial stage, it must be emphasised that the euro has become one of the world's leading currencies."
"Economic and Monetary Union has contributed to the growth of economic stability in Member States and has also had a favourable impact on international trade, thus benefiting the EU."
"The positive impact of the euro became particularly noticeable most recently, when the global financial crisis made us aware of the benefits of a stable exchange rate."
"(ET) I would like to offer an explanation of my vote."
"I abstained from the vote on the application to strip Massimo D'Alema of his parliamentary immunity because, as a lawyer, I have certain reservations about our Parliament's authority in this matter, and I have no right or desire to interfere in the internal affairs of Italy."
"(HU) As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I welcome the result of the vote."
"We are talking about a technology that, if all goes well, can offer a partial solution to climate change, but we must not allow it to distract us from the importance of the entire climate package."
"The new Member States, including Hungary, have significantly reduced their greenhouse gas emissions since the end of the 1980s."
"It would be a serious indignity if they were now punished by those who until now have increased their harmful emissions."
"For this reason, we would like to achieve a proportionate distribution of 10% of the revenues from the carbon trading scheme among those Member States where the per capita GDP is lower than the European Union average."
"Similarly, we would allocate 10% to those who have reduced their emissions in the past 15 years."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has succeeded in gaining an exemption for long-distance heating systems from the Climate Change Levy, an achievement that must be maintained in the interest of millions of low-income European citizens."
"As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, I join those mentioned above in supporting the report."
"Written explanations of vote"
"in writing. - (IT) I am voting for this measure."
"Kazakhstan has embarked upon a process of democratisation which is proceeding more slowly than the extraordinary economic growth that the country has experienced in recent years: there is a huge presence of foreign entrepreneurs investing large amounts of capital in this former Soviet republic."
"Within this context, the European Union ought to be constantly encouraging action targeted at increasing spaces of freedom, democracy and social justice for Kazakh citizens, and not just acting as a trade partner with growing interests."
"Economic growth and democracy ought to go hand in hand."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted during the consultation procedure for the report which approves the conclusion of the Protocol to the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Kazakhstan, and which also took into account the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the EU."
"This report will help stimulate cooperation between Romania and the Republic of Kazakhstan."
"in writing. - I voted for Mr Saryusz-Wolski's report on a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and Kazakhstan."
"I did this despite my continued reservations regarding the human rights record of the Government in Kazakhstan."
"It is important that Parliament and the Commission continue to monitor the situation in Kazakhstan and if it worsens or even fails to improve over the following twelve months we should take action to suspend this Agreement."
"in writing. - (IT) I voted for the report by Mr Saryusz-Wolski and, therefore, for the conclusion of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and its Member States and the Republic of Kazakhstan."
"I endorse the position adopted by the rapporteur, as well as that of the Council, in believing that the existence of a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Kazakhstan prior to the accession of Romania and Bulgaria makes it necessary to draw up a Protocol to the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement to allow the new Member States to sign it."
"in writing. - (PT) The document in question does not fundamentally alter the content of the Regulation adopted by this Parliament in November 2006, which established a public-private partnership to develop a European air traffic management system."
"The amendments now proposed to the Regulation aim to recognise SESAR (new generation European air traffic management system) as a Community body and allow the application of the Staff Regulations of the European Communities to its staff."
"Amendments are also proposed to the quantification of the Community contribution and its transfer to SESAR, with a maximum of EUR 700 million coming in equal parts from the budget of the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development and from the Trans-European Network programme."
"The establishment of this company represents a dangerous precedent in the use of public money for private purposes."
"The public sector approach could have been taken to update and improve air traffic management systems, including with regard to reliability, thus guaranteeing the safety of professionals and users of airspace."
"We consider that these objectives will not be any better achieved by subjecting them to the interests and pressures of the private sector."
"For these reasons, we did not support this report."
"in writing. - This proposal will have a substantial positive financial impact on the European air traffic control infrastructure modernisation programme."
"I support the proposal, the funds which are saved as a result of which will be invested in research, development and validation activities for the benefit of the entire community."
"in writing. - (IT) I would like to declare that I voted for the report by Mrs Niebler on the establishment of a joint undertaking to develop SESAR, the new generation European air traffic management system."
"It is clear that large-scale Community projects in the sector of research and technological development demand joint efforts by the public and private sectors to produce lasting beneficial effects."
"In this case, I believe that new generation harmonised air traffic management is necessary to sustain the future growth of air traffic in European skies in economic and environmental terms."
"I therefore believe that we should warmly welcome the establishment of a joint undertaking in this sphere."
"I would, however, like to emphasise the need to learn from the past (I refer in this case to the liquidation of the joint undertaking Galileo) and to formulate a clearer definition of the status that this legal person ought to have, so that the benefits of scientific and technological progress are not hindered by problems of a procedural or legal nature."
"in writing. - (IT) I voted for the report by Mrs Wallis on the codification of the statutory markings for two- or three-wheel motor vehicles."
"As the Directive on statutory markings for vehicles of these kinds has been amended on several occasions, I believe that codification is necessary to achieve better understanding and accessibility for citizens to this Community legislation and, as a result, to the possibility of exercising the rights that are enshrined within it."
"in writing. - (IT) I voted for the report by Mr Mayer concerning the conclusion of the Convention on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters."
"I join with my fellow Member in his view that the proposal put forward by the Commission designed to replace the 1988 Lugano Convention can help to make the system for the recognition and enforcement of judgments swifter and more efficient in the areas affected, and in particular as regards the registration and validity of intellectual property rights."
"This proposal is particularly important because the application of the regulation control procedure strengthens greatly the European Parliament's rights to observe how implementing measures are being applied."
"The European Parliament is granted the right to control a draft implementing measure."
"Moreover, there are additions to the basic regulations, granting the European Parliament the right to oppose a draft measure or propose amendments to a draft implementing measure."
"in writing. - (IT) I support the excellent report by Mrs Berès on the amendment of the Council regulation on the European system of national and regional accounts in the Community as regards the implementing powers conferred on the Commission."
"Following the introduction of the new comitology procedure, namely the regulatory procedure with scrutiny, which extends Parliament's rights of oversight over implementing measures, I believe that we need to move forward with the general alignment process recommended by the Commission so that the new procedure can be applied effectively."
"in writing. - (PT) Between 2007 and 2008 Italy submitted applications in respect of redundancies in Sardinia (1 044 redundancies, 5 companies), Piedmont (1 537, 202), Lombardy (1 816, 190) and Tuscany (1 588, 461), following liberalisation in the textile and clothing sector."
"For a total of 5 985 redundancies in 858 companies, Italy is requesting a financial contribution of EUR 38 158 075."
"As we have said before, this Fund cannot be used as a temporary 'cushion' for unacceptable socioeconomic costs resulting from the liberalisation of trade, particularly in the textile and clothing sector, and for the increasing insecurity of workers."
"Given the (potential) expiry on 31 December 2008 of the double-checking surveillance system for exports of certain categories of textile and clothing products from China, we need to establish mechanisms limiting imports from any country to the EU."
"Given the increasing number of companies closing down or relocating their production, the rise in unemployment and the increased exploitation of workers - particularly in Portugal - we need to halt the policy of liberalising world trade (instigated by the EU and the Socialist Government in Portugal) and defend production and employment with rights in the various EU countries."
"in writing. - (PT) The mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund at the request of Italy offers an excellent opportunity to consider the reactions that will be needed in the future when the combination of the effects of globalisation and the economic crisis becomes even more acute."
"The format of this Fund, which is based on principles restricted in their scope, suggests that the European Union regards globalisation as a fact and its negative effects as a reality to which we must adapt and not oppose."
"This is a realistic view with significant potential to be effective, in my view."
"Understanding global changes and channelling efforts to react to these changes is more appropriate than believing in the possibility of avoiding these changes indefinitely, or even believing that this opposition is in itself virtuous."
"Adjustment to globalisation is a more appropriate political option than opposition to globalisation."
"in writing. - (IT) I support the report by Mr Böge on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"I agree that the applications put forward by the four Italian regions comply with the requirements for determining the financial contributions as laid down in the EU Regulation and are in line with the reasons underlying the establishment of the fund."
"Today it is more necessary than ever to help those workers who have lost their jobs as a result of changes in the structure of world trade and to assist them to rejoin the labour market."
"I therefore support the application for mobilisation of the fund as expressed in my fellow Member's report."
"in writing. - (NL) I voted against the report for various reasons."
"There was no serious debate in committee."
"Only 7 out of the 28 members were present."
"In fact, it was not even possible to have a debate in the plenary meeting."
"Even before the vote in committee, when Mr Vanhecke was not allowed to learn the content of the report, it was discussed on Flemish public television."
"This is an outrage."
"Worst of all, though, is the conclusion of the report."
"They recommend that immunity be lifted, although Mr Vanhecke is not the author of the controversial text, and the Belgian Constitution clearly stipulates that only the author can be prosecuted if known."
"On account of this crummy dossier, Mr Vanhecke is running the risk of losing his political rights, since the division of power and the Belgian court's independence only exist in theory."
"This matter is a political manoeuvre to single out a Flemish nationalist opposition leader."
"It is a disgrace that the EP should let itself be taken advantage of for this purpose."
"in writing. - (FR) Both the Committee on Legal Affairs and the members of the political groups in plenary today have once again shown just how unimportant they consider impartiality and respect for the law to be, when compared with their obsession with getting rid of all those who are not part of their large family of Euro-federalists."
"My colleague, Mr Vanhecke, is the target of a veritable witch-hunt in Belgium, the sole aim of which is to condemn him and force him to step down from the political stage."
"The European Parliament has forgotten that, when any request is made by a state to waive parliamentary immunity, it has a duty to apply the rules on the protection of MEPs in full, as laid down in its Rules of Procedure."
"Like Mr Gollnisch, who had his parliamentary immunity withdrawn solely for political reasons in 2006, Mr Vanhecke is himself the victim of what constitutes a very real assault, by the transformation of a legal issue into a political issue."
"It is unacceptable for an institution to claim, wrongly, to be democratic."
"On 13 October 1981, in the chamber of the French National Assembly, André Laignel, a socialist MP, issued his famous retort to opposition MPs, arguing that the nationalisation sought by the government was unconstitutional."
"In it he claimed that they were changing the debate from a legal one to a political one and, although they were entitled to do so, in this case, they were in the wrong legally, since they were in the minority politically."
"The European Parliament has clearly taken this phrase to heart since it is getting rid of all those who dare to bother it with political views that are deemed not to be sufficiently federalist or pro-European for its tastes."
"My colleague, Mr Vanhecke, is the target of a veritable witch-hunt within this European Parliament, to which he was legitimately elected."
"This institution is totally wrong and disgraced in accepting the unacceptable: lynching one of its members by flouting all the legal principles and legal protections relating to parliamentary immunity that are currently in force."
"in writing. - (DE) In view of this report and the associated legal proceedings by the Belgian authorities, it must be stated unequivocally that the whole process - in particular the court proceedings - represents a purely politically motivated persecution of the former leader of the Vlaams Belang party, Frank Vanhecke."
"Mr Vanhecke received this writ two days after relinquishing the leadership of the party."
"It is also clear that, with only six months to go to the European elections, the aim is to blacken the name of the Vlaams Belang candidate for political motives."
"According to the Belgian Constitution, it would also have been legally necessary to prosecute the author of the article, as his identity is known, rather than the publisher."
"I therefore vehemently stress that a politically motivated criminal prosecution should not be seen as providing cause to revoke the parliamentary immunity of Frank Vanhecke and that this witch-hunt by the Belgian justice authorities should be condemned in the strongest terms."
"A similar situation arose in 2003, when criminal proceedings were initiated against Daniel Cohn-Bendit from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, although this was rejected by the committee at the time because there were suspicions of political motives."
"The situation is the same in this case, if not even more clear, which is why I am obliged to vote against the motion."
"in writing. - (NL) With not one of my illusions intact, I have to say that the European Parliament is turning into the disgraceful accomplice of a political lynch mob staged by the Belgian courts."
"In the presence of 7 out of 28 members, I was given 20 minutes in the Committee on Legal Affairs to defend myself in respect of a dossier of hundreds of pages long."
"In plenary - contrary to Rule 7 of our own Rules of Procedure - I have not had the opportunity at all of speaking up for myself."
"Should this happen in Russia, we would be up in arms."
"As for me, I keep my head up and continue to stand up for the free expression of opinion in Flanders and in Europe, not least where the issue of immigrants and the danger of Islam are concerned."
"in writing. - (IT) We in the Radical delegation, together with Marco Pannella, are voting against the Lehne report on the immunity of Mr D'Alema because it reaches illogical conclusions that can only derive from grounds - or reflexes - based on self-defence on the part of the Italian and European political class."
"The report argues that the request for authorisation to proceed is unfounded because the intercepted material is already sufficient to support the charges against those under investigation."
"If the request by the public prosecutor's office were in fact directed towards charging Mr D'Alema, then the request would be unfounded, since Parliament does not have to take its decisions in accordance with Italian law."
"If the intercepted material is truly useless, however, and the request unfounded and downright unnecessary, then why should the European Parliament have to decide 'not to authorise the use of the telephone interceptions in question and not to waive the immunity of Massimo D'Alema', as the report proposes?"
"Why should we not follow the decision by the Italian Parliament, which in the context of this inquiry granted authorisation to proceed against Mr Fassino?"
"We willingly give credit to the ALDE Group for deciding, by choosing to abstain, not to align itself with the social unity of the Group of the European People's Party and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament on this dubious decision."
"in writing. - (PL) In recent years, many new financial products have appeared on the market."
"The increasing complexity of these products makes consumers more and more defenceless, and frequently unable, without expert assistance, to determine which financing offer is best suited to their needs."
"This leads to many wrong decisions, especially by those less well off."
"In Poland, we come across many instances of fraud, or simply of consumers making poor financial decisions, unaware of their implications."
"In these circumstances, financial education is essential and is the best way of protecting consumers from making wrong financial decisions."
"in writing. - (LT) Financial education is an important matter on the EU's agenda, especially in the midst of the financial crisis."
"Consumers need basic skills to help them choose and completely understand information and offers."
"Consumers are confronted with an ever growing supply of increasingly more complex goods and services."
"Meanwhile consumer information and advice do not correspond with the level of complexity of financial products."
"As a result of this situation, consumer vulnerability as regards financial matters is on the increase."
"If gaps in the knowledge and financial competence of financial intermediaries and consumers are reduced, the risk of over-indebtedness, defaulting on payments or bankruptcies will also be reduced."
"There would also be an increase in lender competition and the overall efficiency of the market, as consumers with more knowledge can understand how various financial offers differ and can choose the one which best suits their needs."
"Knowledge and skills are not currently good enough to ensure that consumers can manage their finances properly."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted for fair, unbiased and transparent financial education, as well as for the obligation on service providers in this area to offer proper, correct information."
"The information must be clearly distinguished from commercial advice or advertising."
"I hope that Member States will pay special attention to the groups most at risk, such as young people, pensioners or workers at the end of their career."
"Like many texts by this House, Mrs Iotova's report is an example of a seemingly good idea with a deceptive title."
"A cursory reading could lead one to believe that it is about protecting consumers by informing them of their rights and educating them about financial services; in short, about enabling them to have a responsible and informed relationship with their bank."
"In reality, it is about turning people, from childhood (from primary school, so it seems), into perfect little customers of a financial system that is hungry for their savings but mean when it comes to lending, about foisting upon them all kinds of financial products which pseudo-initiates call complex and which, for the most part, are simply absurd, and about getting them sensibly to do their accounts and to prepare for retirement - with the banks, no less - even though they are also paying into compulsory public schemes."
"At a time when the world's financial system has just shown how perverse it is, when the banks are grudgingly granting credit to enterprises and to individuals despite the hundreds of billions of public aid released, when workers and small and medium-sized enterprises are paying the price for ongoing financial folly and when the world's 'big players' pretend to be implementing reforms to prolong the life of this system, that this report is unconvincing is the least that can be said."
"in writing. - (PL) In this time of financial crisis, this report has assumed new importance."
"This is because the mortgage crisis has revealed the dangers which can stem from failing to provide borrowers with appropriate information."
"It has also demonstrated consumers' inability to understand financial and economic information and the impact which changes in macroeconomic indicators could have on the repayment of their loans, and thus their lack of awareness of the risk of insolvency and excessive debt."
"The report calls attention to the need to educate consumers and raise their awareness, and thus enable them to use their own knowledge to assess the financial products offered to them."
"I therefore support the initiative calling for the development of financial education programmes, especially those drawn up with potential users in mind, which take into account their age, income, education, and the area of their employment or interests."
"In addition, financial education programmes must be based on practical and real situations which we encounter in our everyday life."
"I hope that the report will help financial institutions, as well as consumers themselves, to understand the need for financial education."
"I believe that both can benefit, since insolvency and excessive consumer debt represent a problem for the lending institutions whose clients are experiencing difficulties with debt repayment."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the Iotova report on consumer education on credit and finance."
"The world is heading into a period of huge financial uncertainty and many of Europe's citizens are fearful for their jobs, their savings, their pensions and their future."
"In such a period of uncertainty, consumer awareness of credit, debt and finance in general is surely more important than ever."
"This report calls for financial education to be tailored for specific groups and initiatives of this kind at an EU level are to be welcomed."
"in writing. - (FI) I voted in favour of Mrs Iotova's report on improving consumer education and awareness regarding credit and finance."
"This is a necessary and welcome committee-initiative report."
"The crisis caused by subprime loans (high-risk housing credit) has shown that borrowers have been kept too much in the dark."
"This lack of information and understanding has led to a situation where they are not properly concerned about the risks of insolvency and over-indebtedness."
"It also has to be said that consumer awareness and advice have not kept up with the pace of complex financial products."
"An adequate level of financial know-how would, in many cases, reduce the risk of over-indebtedness and defaults on payments."
"It would also give consumers more scope for comparing the competitiveness of loan providers, which in turn would boost the viability of the market."
"I particularly support the suggestion in the report to include financial education more obviously in the national school curriculum and provide young people with all the financial information they need when embarking on their professional career in the face of new challenges with regard to how to use their income."
"in writing. - (DE) We need fair treatment of investors and borrowers with long periods of limitation and a shifting of the burden of proof."
"Risks and costs must be apparent and comparable from the outset."
"In the case of Lehman Brothers in particular, private individuals were massively hoodwinked, for example being told that risky share certificates were secure and even being advised against selling just before Lehman went to the wall."
"Citizens are now faced with a wave of enforced conversions of their foreign currency loans or are required to pay up for the increased refinancing costs of the banks, contrary to public policy."
"In this situation simply saying our citizens are stupid and calling for a general lesson in 'financial education' is a real slap in the face, particularly because not even the self-appointed financial gurus were able to see through the various layers of speculation."
"By calling for greater market efficiency instead of greater competition between lenders, this report continues to pay lip service to the myth of the self-regulating market."
"I cannot express strongly enough my rejection of this report."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted in favour of the report drafted by Mrs Iotova as it encourages Member States to develop educational programmes for pensioners who could be at risk of financial exclusion, as well as for young people starting their professional careers who are faced with the challenge of determining how to make appropriate use of their new income."
"Consumers who do not have any financial knowledge have problems in choosing products and services which best suit their needs."
"It is hard for them to evaluate the advice given and they may therefore be misled, falling victim to unfair selling practices"
"I welcome the Commission's initiatives in the area of consumer financial education, in particular the recent setting-up of the Expert Group on Financial Education."
"I think however that this Expert Group on Financial Education should have clear responsibilities and powers."
"The website already created by the Commission for educating consumers (http://www.dolceta.eu) has proved to be useful."
"I hope that this online tool will continue to be developed and updated in all the official languages."
"in writing. - (PT) One of the most significant factors in the financial crisis has been the extreme ease of supply, or the excessive tolerance of debt."
"The conclusions that must be drawn from this are, firstly, that it would seem beneficial to impose an obligation on banks to ensure that those to whom they lend have the ability and are likely to repay the debt, given the facts of the crisis and its causes."
"At the same time, the lack of awareness among consumers as to the risks associated with credit - starting with the issue of changes in reference rates - suggests that any action aimed at consumers can and must be taken."
"Clearly, the pressure from an economic model based on maximum consumption will be difficult to counteract with campaigns of this type, but the effort to raise awareness is necessary and, in our opinion, useful."
"In any event, this report should encourage greater transparency and the establishment of clearer rules in the conditions for services to be supplied by lenders."
"As for education on credit or any other type of consumption, the most important element is education in general which equips people with the tools to make daily decisions."
"in writing. - (LT) The trust of Europe's consumers is essential for the internal market to work efficiently and thrive."
"The common market encompasses almost 500 million consumers and an abundant variety of goods and services."
"Since 1997 the Commission has been using the Internal Market Scoreboard to monitor and draw attention to the way Member States are implementing internal market legal acts."
"The Consumer Markets Scoreboard determines problem areas, so it can be a universal and flexible means of reporting shortcomings worthy of attention to society, market subjects and institutions."
"In spite of this, the Consumer Markets Scoreboard has never been aimed at reporting to the consumer on the internal market and it is very important to rectify this."
"We must ensure that the market works as well as possible and that consumers are offered services whose price and quality match their expectations."
"For this it is not necessary to adopt more or stricter legal acts."
"Sometimes a more appropriate and more effective method may be the supply of information, education or self-regulation."
"The single market serves not only businesses, which thanks to the successive elimination of barriers have the whole European market virtually within arm's reach."
"It was also created with consumers in mind, to enable them to enjoy the same standards in all Member States."
"The Consumer Markets Scoreboard provides a tool for monitoring, analysing and identifying single market problems from the consumer's point of view."
"It uses indicators which include prices, complaints, satisfaction and switching."
"In spite of the fact that some outcomes shown on the Scoreboard seem questionable - for instance prices, because although simple to communicate and compare, the final price is affected by many variables, not always reflected by the Scoreboard - the indicators undoubtedly represent an extremely useful and appropriate method of assessing consumer outcomes in the single market."
"I should like to stress that this is the first version of the Consumer Markets Scoreboard."
"We can therefore expect a further version which will respond to our concerns."
"It is important for the Scoreboard to be written in comprehensible language, easily understood by a range of users, as its results are undoubtedly an interesting source of information about consumer outcomes in the single market."
"in writing. - (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats in the European Parliament voted in favour of the report on the proposal for a Council directive concerning the general arrangements for excise duty and would especially like to emphasis the importance of the adoption of Amendment 48 on guide levels for importing alcohol and tobacco."
"The reduction (50% lower than the previous indicative guide levels) is a step in the right direction towards a more responsible policy that takes public health seriously."
"However, we would like to point out that we only view this as a first step towards a more ambitious policy in this area."
"Furthermore, we are pleased that Amendment 60 and Amendment 68 have been rejected."
"As a result, excise duty will continue to be collected in the country of destination."
"in writing. - (SV) The June List has chosen to vote in favour of the report, as we are of the opinion that it will go some way to providing the opportunity to unite requirements for efforts at national level with regard to health policy with a free internal market."
"However, we have chosen to vote against certain proposals that have strong federalist overtones."
"The June List feels that it is very important, for example, that Swedish alcohol policy can be pursued in accordance with the values and decisions of the Swedish Parliament."
"This requires the payment of excise duty in the recipient country for distance selling of alcohol, for example."
"This would not be the case if the amendments were voted through."
"On the contrary, it would mean, among other things, that the provisions concerning goods acquired by private individuals would be extended to apply to distance sellers, whereby excise duty is paid in the Member State in which the goods were acquired."
"As the costs incurred as a result of national public health problems, such as alcohol and tobacco-related diseases, are largely funded by the national levying of tax, the proposal concerning freedom from excise duty in connection with distance selling would hamper the prospects of the public sector handling public health problems effectively."
"There is also a problem from the point of view of competition, as a distance seller can offer the same product as national players, but considerably cheaper, simply because excise duty is not paid in the same country."
"The June List is in favour of competition, but is of the opinion that players should compete on equal terms."
"in writing. - I support this directive, which will limit fraud and contraband cases that reduce state revenue."
"This modernised and simplified directive will reduce the obligations on operators while enabling them to combat excise fraud more effectively."
"in writing. - (DE) Our tax systems are very complex and to a certain extent are really only transparent to specialists."
"For this reason, every attempt to improve formalities and general conditions and to combat tax fraud is to be welcomed, provided that the taxation sovereignty of the Member States is preserved and no attempt is made to harmonise tax rates by the back door."
"It is equally important to have clear rules for tax-free sales outlets and for travellers themselves."
"This project seems to have such an objective, which is why I have voted in favour of the Lulling report."
"in writing. - (IT) I voted for the report by Mrs Lulling concerning the general arrangements for excise duty."
"The provisions included in the Commission's proposal are certainly not sufficient to guarantee private individuals and companies in the EU the freedom to make cross-border purchases and sales of goods without encountering unnecessary tax obstacles."
"In fact, although the Commission's proposal contains some improvements and changes, such as Article 37 (the tax markings that Member States may impose must not give rise to a double tax burden), there is a need to extend the provisions governing purchases by private individuals to distance selling, creating a genuine internal market in excisable goods purchased by private individuals for their personal use."
"in writing. - (SV) I welcome the fact that the European Parliament has finally changed its opinion and taken a more restrictive line with regard to alcohol."
"The result of today's vote on the Lulling report on general arrangements for excise duty will entail a 50% reduction in the guide levels for the import of alcohol."
"The opportunities for tax-free shopping at ports and airports will also be restricted."
"Another consequence of the report is that there will be nothing to prevent, for example, the collection of Swedish excise duty on goods ordered from another EU country via the Internet."
"On this matter, the European Parliament merely has an advisory role, but today's results nevertheless represent an important milestone."
"in writing. - Far too little fruit and vegetables are eaten in the EU in relation to the WHO's recommendations of a minimum 400 grams per day."
"There is an obesity epidemic among children. This is particularly severe in Malta."
"A high intake of fruit and vegetables reduces the risk of a large number of diseases and prevents overweight."
"In 2007, organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables underwent a fundamental reform towards greater market orientation."
"Fruit and vegetables are now fully integrated into the single payment system."
"Excessive weight entails a greater risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, high blood pressure and certain forms of cancer."
"A daily intake of 600 grams for people 11+ should be our target."
"The Commission proposes an allocation of EUR 90 million in the Community budget."
"That corresponds to one piece of fruit one day a week for 30 weeks a year and covers children aged 6-10 years."
"To achieve all the positive effects of introducing a school fruit scheme, there must be increased funding."
"A school fruit scheme should consist of a portion of fruit per pupil per day and not only be aimed at school children aged 6-10."
"in writing. - I welcome the adoption of the Report on the School Fresh Fruit Scheme."
"This proposal will produce real health benefits for millions of children across Europe."
"The funding of free fruit for schoolchildren through the Common Agricultural Policy budget will show tangible benefits of the CAP to ordinary European citizens."
"The co-financing of the scheme by the EU and Member States will allow the extension of the existing Free School Fruit Scheme in England and the creation of similar schemes in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland."
"Although a larger budget than the €90m envisioned by the Commission would be welcome - as the Parliament has pointed out in its Report through its request for an increase in the budget to €500m - the creation of this scheme will give children regular access to free fruit and its attendant health benefits, such as a lower chance of developing obesity, diabetes, and other serious diseases in later life."
"As well as providing immediate benefits for child health, the scheme will help to shape young people's views on nutrition, creating a healthier Europe and reducing the costs to State healthcare systems."
"in writing. - (DA) The June Movement has voted in favour of the report as a whole, despite the fact that, in principle, we are opposed to agricultural aid."
"We think that it is important to give children healthier eating habits."
"However, we are opposed to the requirement for the fruit to be of Community origin, as this makes it an indirect subsidy for European farmers."
"Finally, we would also like the fruit that is given to the children to be organic."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted in favour of better financing for this scheme, as well for defining more clearly the products which can be included in this scheme."
"The statistics show that there are approximately 22 million overweight children in the EU, with more than 5 million obese children, mainly due to the excessive consumption of products with high levels of fat, sugar and salt."
"Against this background, it is more than necessary for the EU and Member States to get involved by creating healthy eating habits, especially by providing a varied range of seasonal fruits."
"I also voted in favour of increasing the budget allocated to this scheme from EUR 90 million to EUR 500 million as the initial sum allocated to this scheme is equivalent to offering one portion of fruit to each child aged between 6 and 10 for a period of 30 weeks."
"in writing. - Although I believe parents are ultimately responsible for the health of their children, and that any school fruit scheme must be flexible enough to accommodate local, regional and national conditions, I welcome this report."
"There is an obesity epidemic among children and it is estimated that there are 22 million overweight children in the EU, 5.1 million of whom are considered to be severely overweight."
"Children in the EU are not eating enough healthy food and healthier options need to be made available."
"I hope this proposal can go some small way towards alleviating childhood obesity."
"in writing. - (SV) There is no doubt that children feel better for eating fruit."
"Apples, bananas and oranges prevent obesity and keep us healthy."
"In a way, therefore, it is understandable that many people have today voted in favour of a proposal in the European Parliament to subsidise fruit for school children in the EU."
"The problem is simply that the responsibility for our fruit consumption does not lie at EU level."
"It is first and foremost the parent's responsibility to instil good eating habits in their children."
"In second place the responsibility lies with the municipalities and in third place with the State."
"As a federalist, I would like decisions to be made as close to citizens as possible."
"This is, in fact, something the EU wants too."
"According to Article 5 of the EC Treaty, decisions that it would be more appropriate to take at a lower level shall be taken at that level."
"I therefore voted against the Parliament's proposal to increase the fruit budget from EUR 90 million to EUR 500 million."
"In the EU, we should work to lower emissions and increase mobility and to combat crime."
"More fruit, better exercise and fewer sweets are issues that are much better dealt with by schools, parents and local politicians."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the Busk report on the proposal to set up a scheme to distribute fruit in schools because I feel that Community support for the free distribution of these products to children is vital in promoting healthy eating habits in the European Union and, consequently, improving the health levels of Europeans."
"The increasing prevalence of obesity and overweight among the European population, particularly in infancy, is the result of combining poor eating habits with a sedentary lifestyle."
"We therefore urgently need to develop effective measures for combating this epidemic, not least by promoting healthy eating habits in the early years of life."
"In cooperation with families, schools can play a fundamental role in getting children to eat healthily."
"in writing. - (PT) We support this report to which we contributed several proposals."
"Despite opposition from the European Commission, the report defends the distribution, free of charge and on a daily basis, of fresh fruit in schools to improve the quality of health and life of children, particularly children from more disadvantaged backgrounds."
"Our support for this scheme takes account of the need to encourage young people to appreciate fruit and vegetables, which will have a very positive effect on public health and the fight against child poverty."
"However, in order to be effective, this scheme must be extended to a wider range of children which means that, in the future, it must be extended to other age groups and deprived sectors of society."
"This scheme must incorporate Community preference, in other words priority for national and local production, and its financing must come from the Community to ensure greater social cohesion."
"This scheme could serve as an example of a policy ensuring true solidarity between countries."
"We hope that all this does not simply end up as another propaganda campaign and that agreement can be reached in the Council to make the necessary funds available so that it can effectively applied in all countries."
"in writing. - I support the Committee on Agriculture's proposal for a School Fruit Scheme but along with my British Labour colleagues I want to retain an element of national co-financing to ensure an increased coverage."
"Equally I support the reference to organic, local and regional products, but this cannot entirely replace the necessity of best value for money or variety."
"In the South West of England I would welcome the exchange of our splendid local varieties of apples and pears for the bananas of Cyprus and the Canaries."
"in writing. - I am very pleased that the health of our children is being tackled at European level."
"Obesity amongst children is a growing concern in Europe, and even more so in the UK where almost 25% of the population is obese and 10% of children are overweight."
"This issue is a serious concern to many of my constituents and I welcome an initiative to tackle it."
"Addressing eating habits in childhood is key to preventing obesity later on in life, and the consumption of fruit and vegetables is proven to reduce the rate of obesity and cardio-vascular diseases."
"In the UK, the appeal of convenience food is leading to the development of bad eating habits, which in turn cost our health service an annual GBP 6 billion."
"It is clear, then, that supporting this initiative also makes good economic sense."
"This is why I voted in favour of this report and I hope that Member States will make effective use of the funds to fight what is becoming a real problem for our children."
"in writing. - (SV) An already bad idea from the Commission has been made even worse by the amendments tabled by the European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, particularly when the committee wants to increase the expenditure ceiling from EUR 90 million to EUR 500 million at tax payers' expense."
"The committee emphasises that this only concerns fruit that originates within the Community."
"Fruit originating elsewhere is totally unimportant."
"The committee's proposal, which, in a big brother-like manner, states that seasonal fruit should be distributed, giving preference to a varied range of fruits so as to enable 'children to discover different tastes', is completely ridiculous."
"Once again, the European Parliament is interfering in education policy."
"Member States are to 'incorporate these measures in an educational manner into teaching packages on health and nutrition in schools'."
"The majority in this European Parliament have a distorted view of the common agricultural policy."
"According to MEPs, taxpayers have a horn of plenty with money to throw into agricultural policy and rural development."
"Thank goodness that the European Parliament does not have the power of codecision in these areas - and that is how it should stay."
"in writing. - (PL) I am very pleased that we have today adopted the School Fruit Scheme."
"In the opinion on health issues associated with nutrition, overweight and obesity, adopted by the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I wrote that special importance must be attached to the problem of obesity among children and the young, since overweight is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension and some tumours."
"The School Fruit Scheme aims to promote good fruit and vegetable eating habits and to teach schoolchildren about healthy eating."
"Eating habits are formed in childhood, and it has been demonstrated that people who learned in childhood to eat a lot of fruit and vegetables will keep to a similar diet in their adult life."
"The distribution of fruit to schoolchildren is certain to contribute to increased consumption of fruit and vegetables among the very young, so that the impact of the School Fruit Scheme on preventing an obesity wave among European children and young people is certain to be significant."
"What is more, the impact will be greater if eating fruit in school is more than symbolic."
"I therefore note with satisfaction the vote in favour of a significant (fourfold) increase in the budget allocated to the scheme."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the Busk report and wholeheartedly support this initiative to provide fruit to Europe's schoolchildren."
"My own country, Scotland, has one of the poorest health records in Europe and the government there is actively pursuing a number of policies targeted at improving the health of children in the hope that this will improve their wellbeing in later life."
"This EU initiative will complement the Scottish government's work and is therefore welcome."
"in writing. - (PL) In my view, the School Fruit Scheme is of more than symbolic significance - 'here is the European Union giving something to children' - it is an initiative promoting good eating habits."
"It seems to me that we should include secondary school children in it as well."
"I should like to stress that in this way we would be helping poorer families, which are frequently unable to give fruit to their children."
"Naturally, it offers an additional opportunity to farmers and fruit growers."
"Fruit and vegetables, and in my country especially apples, are relatively easy to distribute."
"However, we must remember that the fruit must be of good quality, clean and fresh."
"We must also prepare our schools to put the scheme into effect."
"Realistically, it cannot be introduced earlier than the start of the 2009/2010 school year."
"As far as cost is concerned, it is not astronomical: the Commission's proposal assesses it at EUR 90 million, and it could perhaps be higher."
"This is true, but at the same time we should be aware of the high cost of treatment of diseases associated with overweight and obesity."
"Let us not make this scheme a one-off initiative, just for show."
"Let us involve in it the national, regional and local authorities responsible for education."
"Let us also retain a sensible flexibility when it comes to the details of selecting fruit or vegetables, remembering that it is intended to promote our children's health in the best possible way."
"in writing. - Having decided to vote against the report by Niels Busk, I declare my full support and sympathy for the topic debated - to provide more fruits for the schoolchildren in Europe."
"Increased obesity among young people is an ominous problem."
"However, I support first and foremost the principle of subsidiarity."
"I am absolutely convinced that Member States and their Governments should be trusted in taking good care for their young generation."
"It is not the business of the EU to regulate concrete problems like the current one."
"The initiative in question is undoubtedly based upon good intentions."
"But starting to solve such problems with all-European regulations is neglecting the role and responsibility of the very actors in question: parents, schools, local governments and national governments."
"I am sure that they all have the same concerns and motivation to address the need to increase fruit consumption in their schools."
"in writing. - I support this scheme which provides funding for free fruit and vegetables for schoolchildren."
"This can only produce positive results, helping to reduce obesity among children by moving closer to the 'five a day' recommendation, which is why I have voted in favour of it."
"in writing. - (NL) In my explanation of vote on the 2009 budget of 23 October 2008, I drew your attention to the value of the EU's involvement in providing schoolchildren with fruit."
"A school fruit scheme can be useful to prevent children from becoming ever more obese and unhealthy."
"The question is why the EU should take care of this, rather than the municipalities that organise education."
"Payments are currently made from the EU fund to the Member States, which are obliged to add a further sum, with the municipalities then being responsible for implementing the scheme."
"This way of working creates much unnecessary administration and time-consuming red tape."
"During the recent budget discussion, the amount was doubled to EUR 182 million, and thanks to the Busk report, this sum will be increased to EUR 500 million in future."
"The Dutch Agriculture Minister, who is in favour of the present scheme, has announced in the press that she considers this enormous increase to be of no value and will be speaking out against it."
"Since it is not Parliament that decides on this, but the Council, it is to be expected that this increase will not materialise."
"Meanwhile, though, school fruit has, in the public mind's eye, come to represent EU priorities that are wide of the mark."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted in favour of Mr Busk's report, based on the conclusions from healthcare organisations about the illnesses from which modern man suffers, many of which are due to poor diet."
"Eating fruit may help to prevent and/or cure these illnesses, thanks to the vitamins it contains."
"We need to teach our children how and what to eat."
"This is why I believe that this may also involve education about diet, all the more so as the World Health Organization recommends that children up to the age of 11 should eat at least 400 grams of fruit and vegetables every day."
"On the other hand, an explosion is being observed in the number of children 'enjoying' an unhealthy, absurd and unsuitable diet, with the blame for this lying not just with the school or family, but with all of us, society as a whole."
"This kind of dietary behaviour needs to be stopped immediately."
"School is one of the areas responsible for forming habits, which should allow us to adopt again the habit of eating fruit."
"For this reason, I give my total support to the distribution and eating of fruit in schools."
"This scheme should be on the list of main priorities in terms of decision-making factors so that it can be implemented as soon as possible."
"in writing. - Conservative MEPs abstained on the Busk Report on the Commission's proposal to introduce an EU-wide School Fruit Scheme."
"While very keen to see healthy eating habits promoted among youngsters in the UK and the EU, we have reservations about the budgetary allocations proposed in this report, which are considerably greater than the EUR 90 million proposed by the Commission."
"Depending on the result of the votes, the Parliament will call for budgetary allocations of at least EUR 360 million and even as much as EUR 500 million."
"We believe that it makes more sense to start the scheme with a lower level of financing and review subsequently the budgetary needs in the light of experience gained - as argued for in the Commission's Impact Assessment."
"in writing. - (SK) The market for fruit and vegetables in the EU is currently regulated by demand."
"The introduction of the School Fruit Scheme will support the consumption of fruit and vegetables in the EU and will increase the demand which will not only boost public health, but it will also benefit European fruit and vegetable growers."
"A high intake of fruit and vegetables reduces the risk of many diseases and prevents the occurrence of excessive weight and childhood obesity."
"The health perspective is therefore the most important reason for a School Fruit Scheme supporting the consumption of fruit."
"As eating habits are created in infancy, it is my view that it is not enough to start in schools but rather in pre-school institutions."
"However, the EUR 90 million which the Commission is proposing to allocate from the Community budget will provide only one piece of fruit per week, which is not enough either to change eating habits or to make an impact on public health."
"I consider a realistic budget for this scheme to be EUR 500 million, as proposed by the EP."
"Such a sum would provide one portion of fruit per pupil per day and at the same time would enable the scheme to target not only schoolchildren between the ages of 6 to 10 years but also younger children in pre-school institutions."
"I firmly believe that the money spent on the School Fruit Scheme to support the consumption of fruit in schools across the EU will bring savings in healthcare costs for the Member States and I have therefore voted in favour of the report by Niels Busk."
"in writing. - (PT) The merits of the scheme proposed in this report are clear."
"Encouraging (and in some cases simply ensuring) the consumption of seasonal fruit by the youngest in society has virtuous aims, both immediately, by promoting a diet rich in variety, and in the future, in terms of developing healthy eating habits."
"There are, however, two points which must be raised."
"Multiplying the guarantee mechanisms to ensure that the fruit offered is produced in Europe makes it feel like the motives behind this action are not just the diet of young people but primarily the promotion of European agriculture."
"Furthermore, although the correlation between this issue and the common agricultural policy is clear, as already mentioned, the need to tackle this at Community level is dubious."
"Obviously, the choice between distributing apples or Rocha pears should be left to the Member States."
"However, we do doubt whether there is a need to establish a Community scheme in this respect."
"in writing. - (FR) On 1 February 2007, when my report on promoting healthy diets and physical activity in the EU was adopted, the European Parliament delivered a number of strong messages, including the fundamental role of education in relation to nutrition and health in order to prevent overweight and obesity, which affects more than 5 million children, and the call for the Commission and the Council to take the necessary measures, within the framework of the review of the CAP (common agricultural policy) in 2008 and 2013, to enhance healthy nutrition incentives within the framework of rural development policies."
"The Commission seems to have heard the message with this European scheme to distribute free fruit in schools for children aged six to ten from 2009/2010."
"Now it is up to the 27 Member States to play the game."
"Obviously a lot of time, money and staff will be needed and menus will also need to be changed in many school canteens for the WHO (World Health Organization) recommended daily intake of five fruits and vegetables (400 grams) to become more than just an advertising slogan written in small print on television screens."
"in writing. - (IT) I voted for the report by Mr Busk on the scheme to promote the consumption of fruit in schools."
"It is clear that the children of the European Union eat little fruit or vegetables, partly because of the bad diets that they have in school canteens."
"High consumption of fruit and vegetables, however, would reduce the risk of contracting serious diseases and would prevent children becoming overweight and obese."
"Furthermore, eating vegetables from childhood is a good habit that continues throughout life."
"I also agree with the rapporteur that the resources earmarked by the Commission for this scheme are totally inadequate."
"In fact, the proposed subsidy allows the provision of only one portion of fruit one day a week."
"It should also be said that I am, to tell the truth, pleased with the fact that the Commission is in any case taking to heart the various existing experiments with a view to making qualitative improvements to the scheme."
"in writing. - (SV) In Sweden, we usually tell our children that fruit is nature's own sweets."
"I like fruit very much myself and I think that it is a good thing for Europe's children to eat sufficient quantities of these wholesome foods."
"Thus far, I share the rapporteur's views."
"That said, the responsibility for our schoolchildren eating a sufficient quantity of apples and bananas must, nevertheless, rest with the children's parents and, possibly, the municipalities providing their education."
"The European Union must not play the part of a supranational fruit police."
"Let us instead concentrate our energy and our resources on more pressing tasks."
"in writing. - I fully support the Commission's proposals on distributing free fruit and vegetables in schools, as part of the strategy on tackling obesity among children."
"Not only do I fully support the use of EU money to tackle a priority public health concern faced by all Member States, but I also support the strong social element attached to the proposals, in that they will allow Member States to support children from more deprived backgrounds who tend to eat less fruit and vegetables and who tend to be more at risk from obesity."
"Furthermore, this is the first time that CAP money will be used to tackle a public health concern, a sign of a change in thinking on the aims of the CAP."
"I am happy that Parliament has sent a strong message to the Commission and to the Council, in supporting an increased budget enabling more children to benefit from the scheme."
"However, I do not agree with Parliament's position stipulating that fruit and vegetables should only come from the Community."
"We should not lose sight of the fact that this scheme is about promoting a wide variety of fruit and vegetables to school children and tackling obesity."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 163(1))."
"in writing. - (NL) The battle against the bulge must start from a young age."
"The supply of fresh fruit in schools can be a huge incentive to eat healthily."
"This is why this scheme, which makes at least one piece of fruit available to each child between the ages of 3 and 10, is to be welcomed with open arms."
"It is estimated that in the European Union, 22 million children are overweight, 5.1 million of whom are obese."
"Not only does this create many health problems, it also increases the cost of healthcare in the Member States."
"If the Commission endorses Parliament's proposal to increase the budget from EUR 90 million to EUR 500 million, every child can learn good eating habits from a young age."
"This gives them more chances of sustaining these habits and preventing obesity as a result."
"This report also comments on the composition of the fruit supply."
"The Member States should give preference to locally produced and seasonal fruit."
"The report calls for health and eating advice for children, together with information about the characteristics of organic farming."
"I am pleased with the content of the report, and for that reason, I voted in favour."
"in writing. - I support the principle of trying to make fruit more accessible to young people in schools."
"The successful Scottish project of trying to get more fruit and vegetables available through schools has seen record numbers of children eating more healthily."
"The programmes have been targeted at those most in need and I would hope that this scheme would target the poorest and most vulnerable children first."
"in writing. - (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats in the European Parliament agree with the analysis of the situation in the euro area."
"We appreciate the fact that social aspects of the cooperation have been highlighted and that the problems with growth are emphasised."
"At the same time, we do not support paragraph 40 of the report, which states that Member States outside the euro area that fulfil the Maastricht criteria and have no derogation in the Treaty should adopt the common currency at the earliest possible opportunity."
"We are of the opinion that this lies outside Parliament's competence to comment on."
"We respect the decision taken by the Swedish people in a referendum and would like to emphasise that this is a matter that should be dealt with in the respective Member States."
"in writing. - (PT) We all voted against this report which deifies the Stability Pact, fails to see the consequences of the current serious economic and social situation, ignores the worsening social and regional inequalities and forgets the rise in unemployment and poverty."
"It is unacceptable that this report insists on the false independence of the European Central Bank, instead of defending its democratic scrutiny and the alteration of its objectives to take account of the need to concentrate on production, creation of employment with rights and improvement of people's purchasing power, particularly among workers and pensioners."
"Regrettably, the proposals tabled by our Group were rejected, specifically those criticising the fiscal and competition policies and drawing attention to the growth in job insecurity and low pay and to the consequences of deregulation and liberalisation."
"It is also regrettable that our proposal to repeal the Stability Pact and replace it with a new Strategy for Solidarity, Development and Social Progress was rejected."
"The least one can say is that the 'generally positive' assessment drawn up by the rapporteurs on ten years of Economic and Monetary Union does not seem completely objective."
"Not surprisingly, the few problems identified are analysed as being the fault of the Member States and of a lack of European integration."
"The truth is that the introduction of the euro automatically led to an explosion in the prices of convenience goods and to a fall in the purchasing power of workers."
"The truth is that the Stability Pact is a budgetary and social Malthusianism."
"The truth is that the lack of an exchange rate policy and the overvaluation of the euro have undermined the international competitiveness of the euro area."
"The truth is that a single monetary policy and a single key interest rate for 11 or 15 economies with very different structures and levels of development are inevitably as ill-suited to the needs of each individual one of these economies as they are to those of the whole."
"The euro has failed to bring the promised prosperity to its members, who, for the most part, are now in recession."
"This is because the euro, in its conception and in its operation, is not an economic tool."
"It is above all a powerful political tool for destroying the independence of nations."
"in writing. - I support this report, which calls for improved economic coordination in order to try to prevent a prolonged, deep recession."
"This roadmap should improve the monitoring of the financial crisis, and should provide valuable support to the economy."
"in writing. - (IT) I voted for the report by Mrs Berès and Mr Langen which takes stock of a decade of Economic and Monetary Union."
"I fully agree with the fact that the European Parliament, the only European body directly elected by the people, has played a very important role over the first decade of Economic and Monetary Union."
"Parliament acts as co-legislator in the field of the internal market, in particular with regard to financial services; it conducts dialogue on the coordination of economic policies through the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs; it has a dominant role in monetary policy, with the appointment of the members of the ECB's Executive Board."
"These are only a very few of the primary functions carried out by Parliament over recent years."
"I would like to end by congratulating my fellow Members on the report, particularly in light of the emphasis placed upon the enlargement of the euro area as a springboard for the EU's new economic future."
"in writing. - (PL) The 'EMU@10: successes and challenges after 10 years of Economic and Monetary Union' report is one of the most important reports presented to this plenary."
"At a time of financial difficulties, it provides a new framework for discussions about the economy."
"The report offers a detailed analysis which enables us to see the positive and negative aspects of Economic and Monetary Union. It contains interesting conclusions about the common currency, the euro."
"There can be no doubt that the introduction of the euro has been a huge financial success for the EU."
"It must be acknowledged that it has withstood a lot of market turbulence."
"However, the common currency does not affect all regions in equal measure."
"Differences in the development rates of different European Union states are becoming increasingly more pronounced."
"Today, at a time of financial crisis, coordination of economic policy has become a necessity."
"We must also abide by the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"It is extremely important to support the independence of the European Central Bank."
"Its powers must be limited to monetary issues, that is to maintaining price stability, and its exclusive power to set interest rates."
"For these reasons, I support adoption of the report."
"in writing. - The Conservative Party has recently published ""Fair Play on Women's Pay: A six-point plan to overcome the gender pay gap""."
"The Conservative Party wants to help to stamp out the pay gap once and for all."
"This includes compulsory pay audits for employers who are found to discriminate, new measures to help women into work and up the careers ladder, and extending the right to request flexible working to all parents of children aged eighteen or younger."
"Equal pay is crucial for a fair and equal society, but national governments and parliaments are generally best placed to act in ways that are most effective for their own societies and economies."
"This recommendation by the European Parliament is over-prescriptive at the EU level."
"The Bauer report is not one we can support, however, as the request for a new legislative proposal on equal pay is based on Article 141(3) of the EC Treaty which is covered by the Conservative Party's pledge to opt out of the Social Chapter."
"in writing. - (SV) The gender pay gap is a huge problem and something that both individual workers and social partners have a particular responsibility to address."
"This type of discrimination violates basic provisions of the Treaty and employers who do not take responsibility for this should even now be prosecuted in court."
"However, this is contrary to our fundamental view of the Swedish labour market and the parties' responsibility, as per current legislation, to create new legal instruments to direct wage formation at EU level or by means of a state wage policy."
"Wage formation is not, and should not be, an EU competence."
"As our request to remove references to new legal instruments for directing wage formation at EU level was given a hearing, we have chosen to vote in favour of the report as a whole."
"Unfortunately, the report still contains a number of undesirable details, such as the proposal for an 'equal pay day'."
"Parliament's persistent habit of requiring the proclamation of days, weeks and years for various phenomena is placard politics which does not distinguish between different subject matter."
"On the contrary, the subject matter itself is viewed in a banal and casual way."
"in writing. - (PT) The gender pay gap is a problem throughout Europe."
"The Community legislation on equal pay for men and women, in force since 1975 and revised in 2006, is clearly inefficient."
"We applaud the rapporteur for asking the Commission to submit a legislative proposal by 31 December 2009, based on the recommendations contained in the report."
"We also congratulate her on the responsible and serious way in which she has presented her recommendations, which are focused on the central issue, unlike some of the amendments tabled by the socialists which do not help to solve this problem as they consist of details from political folklore or recommendations which are unfeasible given that they fall outside the competence of Member States."
"In Portugal, between 2005 and 2006, despite identical circumstances, the gender pay gap increased by 8.9% under the current government."
"The unemployment benefit paid to women in 2007 was 21.1% less than that paid to men."
"The amounts paid to women, including with regard to extended benefits, are below the poverty threshold and actually fell between 2006 and 2007."
"The Portuguese Social Democrat MEPs support this report."
"In spite of socialist folklore, we do not confuse the essential with the additional and we will not allow the additional to destroy the essential, namely to change an unacceptable situation of discrimination."
"in writing. - The principle of equal pay for equal work helps to remove discrimination against women in the workplace."
"But we must go further in protecting women's rights."
"The aim of this report is not only to enhance the value of women's work but improve the quality of public services also."
"More than 30 years after the introduction of equal pay legislation, women in the EU earn 15% less than men and progress has been slow in closing the gender pay gap with men."
"Twenty years ago, the gender pay gap in Ireland was about 25% and now the gap is 13%."
"Even with this progress, the gender pay gap remains a serious cause of concern."
"New challenges arise, particularly in this economic climate, which need to be identified and solved."
"Many women continue to be concentrated in a narrow range of occupations, in part-time and low-paid work, and in jobs where their skills and contributions are undervalued."
"We need a multifaceted approach."
"We need to increase the labour market participation by women."
"We need to improve child care services and child benefits to help reintegrate women with children back into the work place."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted in favour of abolishing direct and indirect discrimination, social and economic factors, as well as segregation on the labour market."
"The report urges a neutral professional evaluation which should be based on new systems for classifying and organising staff, on professional experience and productivity, evaluated primarily from a quality perspective."
"It is also being proposed to arrange a European Equal Pay Day to make the general public and employers aware of wage inequalities."
"in writing. - I supported this report as we need proper enforcement of existing laws on the principle of equal pay."
"However, while the enforcement of existing laws on the principle of equal pay for the same work and for work of equal value is crucial to achieving gender equality, the restoration of choices to all women is also very important."
"There needs to be flexibility in the system and a proper work/life balance."
"Women must be given: the choice to marry or not; the choice to have children or not, to have a career, to have further education or not, to stay at home, to go out into the workplace, to start a business or to have access to property."
"The challenge is to ensure that economic pressures do not remove these choices."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the Bauer report on equal pay for men and women because it is unacceptable that women earn less (the difference in the EU is 15%), even though they possess more skills (58% of graduates and 41% of doctorate holders are women)."
"The report suggests ways of revising the current legal framework, including proposing the introduction of penalties for non-compliance and calling for greater dialogue with the social partners."
"The principle of equal pay for equal work or for work of equal value is not just a fight of women, but of all society."
"Women are needed in all areas of business, particularly in those traditionally regarded as masculine."
"This is proven by the fact that women make good managers."
"In the current context, and to achieve the growth and employment objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, the active participation of women is essential."
"in writing. - (PT) Although the report has been adopted with most of the amendments tabled during the debate in the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, which made it into a good report, the PPE-DE Group could not refrain from weakening its scope during the vote in plenary, knowing that an absolute majority of 393 votes was needed."
"As a result, certain proposals have regrettably fallen and are not contained in the final resolution, including some detailed recommendations on the content of the new proposal requested from the European Commission on compliance with the principle of equal pay for men and women."
"However, this is still a positive resolution which we voted for."
"We would stress the need for measures which value work, which give priority to employment with rights and a fair distribution of wealth, which help to overcome pay differences and stereotypes linked to certain tasks and business sectors that discriminate against women, and which value the professions and activities in which women predominate."
"These particularly include the retail and services sectors, and industries such as cork, textiles and clothing, footwear, food and others where very low pay exists in the professions and categories dominated by women."
"in writing. - I am speaking on this today as the gender pay gap is a concern to many of my West Midlands constituents, as well as to most of us here."
"The gender pay gap in the UK is wider than the European average and women have recently received the dire news that this gap is now increasing."
"Equality between men and women is a fundamental right and a democratic necessity."
"Only with the equal participation of all our citizens will we achieve the EU objectives of growth, employment and social cohesion."
"Economic arguments to change are compelling: unlocking women's potential could contribute up to 2% of GDP."
"In times of financial instability, it is crucial to ensure that our economy uses all the resources it has."
"It is also crucial to make sure that women do not suffer even more."
"Although legislation has been passed and initiatives have been proposed, it is not enough."
"Many of my constituents are in favour of stronger action to fight the gap."
"This is why I welcome this report and proposals to introduce pay audits and attribute more power to equality bodies."
"in writing. - (SV) After careful consideration, the June List has chosen to vote in favour of the report."
"Increased equality on the labour market, reduced pay gaps between professional women and men and equal pensions are important objectives in a just society."
"Thus, the ideas for more statistics, revised legislation and training to counteract common notions in society concerning gender are important."
"However, the June List is critical of the EU's seemingly insatiable need to incorporate more and more policy areas within its sphere of competence."
"It is our fundamental view that issues relating to regulation of the labour market should primarily be dealt with by individual Member States and should not be taken up at EU level."
"in writing. - The principle of equal pay for men and women is explicitly stated in the Treaty of Rome and it is therefore a scandal that such huge disparities between the genders still exist across the EU."
"It is therefore essential that the European institutions take real action in this area and I accordingly voted in favour of the Bauer report."
"in writing. - The pay gap, which was one of the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs but which has not been adequately addressed by some Member States, has a serious impact on the status of women in economic and social life."
"I support this report, which will address women earning 15-25% less than their male counterparts in Europe."
"in writing. - (DE) In today's vote I voted in favour of the report by my colleague Edit Bauer."
"However, I did not find this easy as I have some reservations about the content of some points."
"A policy of equality has existed at European level for almost 50 years."
"For the last 50 years we have had a clear statutory framework."
"Nonetheless, despite all our efforts in the direction of equality, both at European level and in the Member States, we still have not succeeded in fully eliminating the discrimination against women in terms of pay."
"The call for new laws as formulated in the Bauer report should be rejected."
"It is not possible to achieve a change in attitude in our society through legislation."
"Experience in recent years shows that the causes of the pay gap between men and women are mostly outside the ambit of the legal system and that legal regulations cannot by themselves improve the situation of women in the labour market."
"New laws simply create more bureaucracy and thus increase the burden on small and medium-sized enterprises in particular."
"For this reason, I am in favour of a more consistent implementation of the existing regulations to abolish gender-specific pay differences and against additional legal regulations."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted in favour of Mrs Bauer's report, given the gender inequalities which, unfortunately, still exist."
"Equality between women and men is a fundamental value of the European Union."
"Promoting the principle of equal opportunities between women and men is a relatively recent concern for the European Union - featuring in the Maastricht Treaty or Amsterdam Treaty - although various aspects have been highlighted by many declarations or international agreements, such as the Declaration on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women of 1967."
"In Romania two of the fields in which the majority of workers are women would be health and social services and education (69.5%)."
"Professions and workplaces dominated by women still tend to be undervalued compared to those where men predominate."
"Inequalities and discrepancies in applying gender criteria have a definite impact on pay."
"The average wage difference between women and men is 8.5-15%, and even bigger in the private sector, in the latter's favour."
"This contravenes Directive 75/117/EEC relating to the application of the principle of equal pay for women and men."
"in writing. - (RO) Unless we have equal pay for women and men, we will find it difficult to achieve the objectives proposed for 2010: improving living conditions, achieving economic growth and eradicating poverty."
"The fact that in the European Union women earn on average 15% less than men and need to work roughly until February (418 days per year) to be paid the same amount as men sounds an alarm bell."
"Specific measures need to be taken to combat this."
"Equal representation in the European Commission and European Parliament may be our political signal for a better representation of women in all decision-making bodies and, implicitly, for eliminating these pay gaps."
"I voted in favour of this report and I congratulate the rapporteur."
"in writing. - (IT) I voted for the report by Mrs Bauer on the application of the principle of equal pay for men and women."
"For years this age-old problem has been under debate: it is disconcerting to note that, in some EU countries, differences in pay are primarily attributable to the high level of job-related segregation and the impact of the pay structure."
"We therefore need multi-faceted policies targeting the implementation of legislation that already exists, but which is not very effective."
"I applaud the work accomplished by my fellow Member, which is designed to consolidate the legislation in force, but to take into account the fact that it is difficult to influence economic segregation through legislation of this type."
"Finally, I support the cause because we need to have pay policies designed to reduce inequalities in pay and to achieve better pay for low-paid workers, among whom women predominate."
"in writing. - The creation of a European Equal Pay Day is something I support."
"The fact that women are still discriminated against, being paid an average 15% less than their male counterparts for the same work, is totally unacceptable in 2008."
"in writing. - (EL) The Communist Party of Greece voted against the report, because it uses equal pay to reduce working women's rights to the lowest common denominator."
"Working women should not forget that, on the pretext of applying the euro-unifying legislation on gender equality, the EU and the centre-left and centre-right governments of the Member States have proceeded to abolish their vested rights, such as the ban on night work for women."
"The EU and the New Democracy and PASOK parties have used the same legislation to engineer an increase in the retirement age for female civil servants in the name of abolishing discrimination and of gender equality."
"Not only does the report fail to address the real causes of unequal pay between men and women for the same work, and the fact that women and young people are the first victims of part-time work, flexible contracts of employment and flexicurity, on the contrary, the solutions it proposes move in precisely this direction."
"The argument of 'reconciling family life and work' is used to generalise flexible forms of employment for women and propose hot money from public funds and public works contracts and financing as a reward for 'good capitalists' who apply what is self-evident: an equal day's pay for an equal day's work for men and women."
"in writing. - This report makes recommendations to the European Commission on applying the principle of equal pay for men and women, and that principle is the key to ensuring dignity, fairness and equality in pension entitlements."
"For years now I have strongly backed the Plymouth Senior Citizens' Petition calling for the just treatment of older women."
"I was proud to submit three amendments to the Bauer report, reflecting the Plymouth campaigners' demands, and I am delighted that all three have been accepted."
"The European Parliament has recognised that many women lose out on earnings as a result of their work caring for children and older people."
"It has called on the Commission to eliminate the risk of poverty among pensioners and secure for them a decent standard of living."
"And it has set as a goal the equality of male and female pensions, including the retirement age."
"Now we need the European Union and national governments to take heed of these words and turn fine sentiments into forward steps."
"Pension equality for senior citizens is a worthy goal, and I am proud to support this report."
"in writing. - (SV) We have chosen to abstain, as we think that it is, in principle, wrong to pre-empt the legislative process that is currently in progress concerning precisely these issues in an own-initiative report."
"in writing. - (PL) I support Mr Ehler's report for two reasons."
"Lacking its own raw materials, the European Union is becoming one of the largest energy importers in the world, increasingly dependent on external oil and gas suppliers."
"These are the sectors associated with the greatest geopolitical risk."
"Coal reserves will remain available for longer than oil and natural gas reserves, and may acquire strategic importance for us, in the event that energy supplies are threatened for political reasons."
"In addition, producing energy from fossil fuels such as coal can be viable in spite of stringent environmental standards, and this offers good prospects to European and Polish mines."
"The introduction of clean coal technologies will contribute to the significant development of Poland's infrastructure and its economy."
"in writing. - (LT) The Commission communication on 'Supporting early demonstration of sustainable power generation from fossil fuels' is a very important step towards further discussions on political and financial measures."
"Today it is obvious that the European Union will only be able to implement its ambitious goals in the area of post-2020 climate policy if it ensures the use of broad CO2 capture and storage technologies at power stations."
"We really must make progress in preparing and adopting legal regulations on geological capture and storage of CO2."
"Although at the moment attempts are being made at European level to adopt a directive on geological capture and storage of CO2 as quickly as possible, there is a shortage of appropriate initiatives at national or regional level, which are particularly necessary in the area of transport infrastructure."
"in writing. - (SV) For as long as fossil fuels are required to meet the EU's energy needs it is important to support initiatives that aim to alleviate the environmental effects, for example using CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage) technologies."
"However, we are of the opinion that proceeds from auctioning emission allowances should go to the respective Member State and not be earmarked for different projects."
"Otherwise, there is a risk of the emission allowances system becoming ineffective and controlled from the top."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted for this report because it emphasises the importance of increasing the allocation of European funds for research, aimed at implementing new technologies for capturing greenhouse gases, especially CO2, particularly funds aimed at implementing pilot projects which will raise the profile of this research, along with the opportunities offered by it and the safety of new technologies."
"Europe cannot give up yet the biggest energy resource it owns, fossil coal, as many of the Member States still guarantee their energy independence by processing fossil coal."
"We need to guarantee future generations that producing electricity from fossil fuels is sustainable and causes as little pollution as possible."
"in writing. - I supported this report, as it is in line with the amendment I tabled on the financing of large scale CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage) demonstration plants, in my report on the review of the EU's Emissions Trading System."
"Our dependence on fossil fuels is likely to persist for some time and we should be exploring all options in order to mitigate their harmful effects."
"CCS extracts and buries the carbon from any hydrocarbon source rather than allowing emissions to enter the atmosphere."
"If implemented without delay and given proper financing CCS could reduce CO2 emissions in the EU significantly."
"in writing. - This report recognises the need to reduce emissions from fossil fuels which will be used to bridge the gap until we can become reliant upon renewable energy sources, which is why I support it."
"in writing. - (IT) I voted for the report by Mr Ehler on supporting early demonstration of sustainable power generation from fossil fuels."
"It is clear that the European Union will only attain the ambitious targets in its climate policy if it succeeds in ensuring broad use of CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage) technologies in power stations."
"The strategic importance of coal must not prevent us from finding a way to use this precious resource in a manner that does not have an impact on climate."
"In addition, I agree with the rapporteur on the paucity of measures adopted by the Commission to ensure that such ambitious projects can be completed by 2015."
"Finally, I welcome the assessment made by Mr Ehler, stressing the absence of an appropriate legislative framework that has financial resources available to it."
"It is absolutely vital that we remedy this absence."
"in writing. - (DE) By adopting the Ehler report the European Parliament has decided on a completely outmoded energy strategy."
"CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage) is intended to make production processes that are damaging to the climate seem 'climate friendly'."
"However, it does not avoid or reduce CO2 production, as would be the case with renewable energies for example."
"In the opinion of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, massive public funding of CCS makes little sense at an economic level."
"This money would be put to better, more sustainable use if it were invested in research into the more efficient use of renewable energies."
"The Ehler report goes further than the Commission: it seeks to use European structural funds for CCS investment, which will deny these resources to disadvantaged regions and their sustainable development plans."
"A CDU member who represents Brandenburg, Mr Ehler is seeking to put money in the pocket of Vattenfall, Europe's fifth-largest power company, enabling it to open more lignite mines in Lusatia (Brandenburg/Saxony), threatening more villages with resettlement."
"It is known that Vattenfall intends to generate power from lignite for the next 50 to 60 years, even though this is only possible with an efficiency factor of less than 50%."
"Energy-intensive CCS technology will reduce this by a further 10% to 15%."
"This is a retrograde step, which is why we do not accept this report, but instead have lodged an alternative proposal."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.05 p.m. and resumed at 3.05 p.m.)"
"Approval of Minutes of previous sitting: see Minutes"
"EU response to the world financial crisis: follow-up of the informal European Council from 7 November and of the G20 Summit from 15 November 2008 - Commission's legislative and work programme for 2009 (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on the EU response to the world financial crisis and the Commission's legislative and work programme for 2009."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the effects of the financial crisis on the economy are becoming more clearly apparent."
"The Commission's autumn forecasts predicted a significant downturn in growth in the European Union for next year."
"Several Member States have already entered into recession, and, in 2009, economic growth could, at best, remain at zero in the European Union."
"Furthermore, financial tensions are beginning to have repercussions on the financing of economic institutions."
"Public authorities within the Member States are making every effort to ensure continuity in the financing of businesses and households facing the growing risk of credit restrictions."
"Europe and its international partners are therefore facing the worst financial crisis since 1929 and they must face up to an economic slowdown on an exceptional scale."
"As you know, since our last debate on 8 October, the Council Presidency has pursued only one objective and held only one conviction: the essential unity of Europeans in the face of the global financial crisis."
"Faced with the threat of a real breakdown in the European financial system, the French Presidency has succeeded in promoting a European action plan to support, as a matter of urgency, financial institutions threatened by the crisis, and together the Member States have decided to guarantee interbank financing and to recapitalise the banks."
"The effectiveness of this joint European action was also demonstrated last weekend at the G20 summit meeting of Heads of State or Government in Washington, attended by President Barroso."
"Europe, represented by the President of the Council, President Sarkozy, and by the President of the European Commission, Mr Barroso, initiated this historic summit."
"It demonstrated great unity in giving the Council Presidency, on 7 November, clear positions to defend with our major partners."
"We can now feel very pleased about the outcome of this approach, since the summit's conclusions keep the main issues that Europe upholds - that is, transparency and responsibility - central to the functioning of the international financial system."
"We have also achieved positive decisions in line with the European Union's proposals, such as registration of rating agencies, the principle of monitoring or regulating all the activities of financial institutions, and linking remuneration with the avoidance of excessive risk taking."
"For the first time all the major economic and financial institutions have agreed to respond strongly in order to avoid a recurrence of a crisis of this magnitude."
"They have all agreed on an ambitious plan of action, which the Finance Ministers will have to spell out in detail in the weeks to come."
"The European Union will obviously have to continue to bring all its weight to bear in international discussions."
"You know that you can count on the French Presidency to promote European unity and thereby to offer a common ambition with regard to fundamental reforms on all the issues identified in Washington."
"We are counting, of course, on the Czech Presidency to take these initiatives forward."
"With regard to rating agencies, accounting standards, monitoring of hedge funds, the fight against tax havens, the accountability of private institutions and the reform of multilateral financial institutions, the European Union must continue to speak out strongly in order to achieve definite results."
"It must also, in terms of Community legislation, quickly take up its responsibilities by speeding up the adoption of the measures proposed by the Commission regarding the supervision and regulation of banks and rating agencies."
"The French Presidency knows that it can count on the full and active involvement of your Parliament and its groups, and for this I am grateful to their chairmen."
"Europe will thus be able to assume a position of strength at the next international meetings scheduled for 2009."
"These initial results in the financial sector are evidence of the effectiveness of Europe's united approach."
"Nonetheless, they are only one part of the European response to the crisis."
"Indeed, this united approach must also inspire the European Union and its Member States to respond to the effects of the crisis on economic growth."
"The Council Presidency stands firm in its conviction on this issue."
"Just as in the financial sector, the Member States will not achieve any concrete results in supporting growth unless they cooperate closely with each other, and, beyond that, with their major international partners."
"The G20 summit delivered a strong message in this respect."
"We have to involve, on a global scale, all the macroeconomic instruments in order to avoid a long-term slowdown of the economy."
"As the situation has developed, the central banks have reacted quickly by reducing interest rates."
"The Presidency welcomed the European Central Bank's robust decision, at the beginning of November, to reduce its interest rates by 50 basis points, and on several occasions we have applauded the ECB's action in response to the financial crisis and its active participation in the deliberations of the Eurogroup and the European Councils."
"With regard to budgetary matters, the G20 has indicated that significant room for manœuvre should be used wherever it exists."
"The Member States of the European Union have responded to this call by saying that we should use all the room for manoeuvre permitted by the Stability and Growth Pact when there is a sharp turnaround in the economic cycle."
"The French Presidency, working closely with the Commission, intends to do everything possible to ensure that national plans in support of the economic cycle are closely coordinated with Community initiatives so as to maximise the economic effects as a whole."
"We are expecting, Mr Barroso, new proposals by the end of the month."
"It is a matter of finding responses that can be applied at Community level and of harnessing all instruments with the capacity to help support the European economic cycle."
"Certain European budget appropriations - I say this because I was present at the debate in this House - could be rapidly mobilised to respond to the slowdown."
"Furthermore, while ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market, we should also ensure that all the flexibility of European state aid rules is used so that the Member States and the European Union give effective support to those economic institutions that are most threatened."
"We also want the European Investment Bank to be fully involved in the efforts to support the European economy."
"Resources, as you know, have already been made available to ensure financing for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The support measures should be part of a more global plan, making it possible, in particular, to support the sectors most at threat, as the entire EU car industry is today."
"These additional efforts at Community level will need to be actively enhanced at Member State level by means of closely coordinated national recovery measures."
"Looking ahead to next month's European Council, the Presidency intends to lead the discussion between the Member States on the priorities for such recovery action."
"Several Member States have said that they were considering support measures for certain sectors of industry."
"Such measures must be the result of consultation between partners in order to be fully effective and to preserve the integrity of the internal market, and the Ministers for Economic and Financial Affairs, together with Commissioner Almunia, will prepare the European Council discussion on these themes at their next meeting on 2 December."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has shouldered its responsibilities effectively within a few weeks in the face of an unprecedented destabilisation of the world economy."
"Europeans have managed to unite in the face of immediate danger in order to take effective and urgent action."
"We must learn all the lessons from this action, which has been crowned with success."
"This European unity must be preserved so that we continue to act together, so that, faced with our partners and alongside our partners, we press for a fundamental reform of the financial regulatory system, and so that, together, we deal with the turnarounds in the economic cycle."
"In this way, we - Council, Commission and Parliament - shall prove together that the European Union has the means to effectively take control of its destiny and to do what all Europeans expect, that is, to act as a global player."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you to the Council's representative, Mr Jean-Pierre Jouyet."
"I am very pleased to see so many members of the European Commission here."
"The vast majority of the members of the Commission are present and I now have the pleasure of inviting the President of the Commission to address us."
"President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to commend the European Parliament's excellent decision to organise two debates in one today: on the European management of the global financial crisis, in the wake of the G20 summit in Washington, and on the Commission's work programme for 2009."
"This double debate perfectly reflects the political reality to which Europe must respond: rising to the challenge of an emergency whilst resolutely continuing with the fundamental work already begun."
"You will therefore not be surprised that the Commission's work programme for 2009 also has a dual purpose: continuity and action in a time of crisis."
"I shall come back to that."
"First of all, however, I should like to return to the assessment of the Washington summit, which was also given by Mr Jouyet on behalf of the French Presidency."
"Allow me to remind you that the political initiative of starting a global process for reforming the financial system came from Europe, and I think we can congratulate ourselves on that. The European Union was equal to the challenge."
"It was also from Europe that the key issues in the debate came."
"I am not going to repeat them as we spoke about them together, in this House, last month."
"The guidelines laid down by the extraordinary meeting of the European Council on 7 November, inspired by the joint work of our three institutions, served as a platform for the discussions."
"The Commission made proposals."
"The President of the European Parliament, Mr Pöttering, also took part in these discussions, and we worked out a common position."
"I invite all those who are sometimes inclined to criticise to look at the proposals that we, as Europe, have made and at the results of the G20."
"We need, of course, a bit of distance in time to judge whether an event marks a turning point in history, but my feeling - and I should like to convey this to you very openly - is that this first meeting of the G20 Heads of State or Government genuinely marks the beginning of a new era in the collective steering of the global economy, and perhaps more than that, since the crisis has made the protagonists realise the need for a global approach to global problems."
"That is my feeling."
"The Washington summit also laid the foundations for a new global governance based on the principles of a market economy, but an economy as envisaged by Europe is not just a market economy; it is, as we say very often in Europe, a social market economy."
"That is one of the European Union's assets."
"In fact, the G20 reached agreement on four fundamental decisions."
"Firstly, not necessarily in terms of importance, but in terms of the order of the decisions, an action plan for the short and medium term to reform the financial markets, to avoid further crises and to protect consumers, savers and investors."
"Secondly, the principles of a new global governance to rectify commercial, monetary and budgetary imbalances that are detrimental to the global community."
"Thirdly, and this is the question that I believe needs to be discussed most urgently, the need for coordinated action to stimulate the global economy and minimise the consequences of the crisis for the jobs and purchasing power of our fellow citizens."
"Fourthly, the need for open markets and the rejection of all protectionism."
"That, moreover, is why we shall endeavour to reach a consensus by the end of 2008 on ways to conclude the Doha Round for trade and development."
"At the same time, the summit has sent out a clear signal, which will, I believe, be very important to Europeans."
"Economic and financial issues must not be dealt with in ways that are detrimental to the other global challenges, which also call for a collective effort, namely, achieving the Millennium Development Goals, energy security, combating climate change, food safety, the rule of law, combating terrorism, poverty and disease."
"I personally emphasised this point."
"I even said that, in my opinion, it would be obscene to discuss major issues of global finance and ignore the needs of those who do not have enough to eat or do not have access to clean water."
"(Applause)"
"A new chapter in politics is now beginning, and we must write it rapidly and in practical terms."
"In this sense, we must make matters clear."
"If Europe has played a major role with its proposals to the G20 and if it has made itself heard, it is because it was united."
"I should like to say once more how proud I am of the excellent cooperation we have achieved between the French Presidency and the Commission, and also with your institution, the European Parliament."
"The European Union now faces a real challenge to continue to speak with one voice."
"Sometimes it will be difficult, but it is the condition that is vital for our success."
"Be that as it may, in Europe we have not been slow to take some very important decisions already."
"After successive European Councils and debates with the European Parliament, the Commission has already made some important legislative proposals, which are now before the co-legislators."
"On 29 October we also outlined an economic recovery programme that we are going to formalise with a document that the Commission is to adopt next week."
"This is where the Commission's work programme for 2009 comes in."
"Of course, we have already covered much ground over the past few months."
"Of course, we are still going to make headway with certain elements by the end of the year, but there will be many things left for us to do next year, too."
"This programme contains four priorities on which we were, moreover, broadly in agreement with the views of the European Parliament during the September debate on the annual political strategy for 2009."
"The first of these priorities is self-evident: growth and jobs."
"In 2009, we will initially strive to achieve two things: limiting the consequences of the economic slowdown on jobs and businesses in Europe, and continuing with our reform so as to be better prepared for the post-crisis period."
"We must apply to the real economy the same approach that we used successfully when the financial crisis erupted: defining clear principles and coordinated measures at European Union level."
"I think, in fact, that our citizens would not understand if the governments of the 27 and the European institutions, having been able to agree on a common platform to respond to the financial crisis, were not now capable of working out a common platform to respond to the economic crisis."
"The least we can do, therefore, is to accept the principle of coordination between all the Member States and, of course, with the European institutions."
"Such is the framework of the recovery plan that the Commission will present on 26 November under the umbrella of the Lisbon Strategy."
"We have the instruments in Europe, we have the Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment, we have the Stability and Growth Pact, and we can demonstrate that these instruments, with political will, and especially with European will, can respond to the crisis that we are currently going through."
"We are living in exceptional times, and they call for exceptional measures."
"We need a genuine common strategy to bring together the conditions for an economic recovery, a programme that seeks, above all, to limit the impact of the crisis on citizens - households, workers, entrepreneurs - a programme that uses all available levers - fiscal, structural or regulatory, both at European level and at national level - in a coordinated effort, and on this point also, I want to say how much we have appreciated the cooperation of the European Central Bank up till now."
"No Member State, in fact, could emerge from this crisis by means of national measures alone."
"Our economies are much too interdependent for that."
"One of the most interesting results of this summit in Washington is that everyone understood that, with globalisation, even those who had been least exposed to financial market integration now know the effect of interdependence."
"If the entire world is ready to accept the effects of interdependence, we in Europe must not only recognise this interdependence, but must also be able to respond in coordinated and consistent ways."
"That is why we believe that we need a budgetary stimulus programme in order to sustain demand, to exploit synergies and to avoid negative chain reactions, a programme of measures that are timely, targeted and temporary: the three 't's'."
"We need these measures urgently, and that is what we shall propose to our Member States."
"I am thinking above all about efforts to encourage training and retraining, to invest more heavily in innovation, interconnectivity and in transforming Europe into a low carbon economy."
"I am thinking above all of the need to adapt certain sectors of our economy to our other goals of combating climate change."
"This will be a splendid opportunity to show that the agenda to combat climate change is not an agenda against economic growth."
"On the contrary, it will perhaps be an agenda that encourages modernisation of European industry."
"I am also thinking about increased efforts to reduce administrative costs for businesses and thereby unlocking the potential of SMEs in particular, a central feature of our Better Regulation Review in January 2009."
"We are increasingly committed to the goals of better lawmaking, that is, 'better regulation'."
"We must reduce all unnecessary administrative burdens, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The Social Agenda for opportunities, access and solidarity is also part of the European response to the economic crisis, because there will be social difficulties to be dealt with, we are not denying it, particularly as a result of an increase in the rate of unemployment, which now seems more than likely."
"That is why we must move forward the Social Agenda."
"I would emphasise, in particular, the measures to promote consumer interests and to open up the job market to young people, but there will no doubt be many other issues that we shall want to discuss with the European Parliament."
"With regard to finance, I am relying on the Members of this House to swiftly adopt the Commission's proposals on capital adequacy, deposit guarantees and rating agencies."
"It is essential to re-establish a climate of confidence."
"In 2009, the Commission will take concrete measures to strengthen the regulatory framework of the European financial system."
"It will look into the regulation, supervision and transparency of financial markets, including the areas mentioned in the Rasmussen and Lehne reports."
"It will let you have, before the spring Council, the first analyses of the high-level group responsible for financial supervision, which we have set up."
"To conclude this first part of the debate, I think that, in spite of their negative effects, crises always have one virtue."
"They shake up our fixed patterns of thinking and our certainties, giving a certain plasticity to situations and leaving the flexibility necessary for remodelling or reshaping them."
"I would like once more to convey to you very sincerely and very openly the feeling that I had in Washington last weekend."
"I saw an open-mindedness that, frankly, we would not have had a few months ago."
"It is the crisis that has changed many attitudes."
"There is now an openness not only among the great powers but also among the emerging powers, towards changing the world and promoting European values: the value of freedom and the value of solidarity."
"In the case of Europe, I believe that this is the moment for it to make its mark on the course of events."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President of the Commission, thank you for your contribution."
"I am sure my fellow Members will allow me to observe that, in recent weeks, when you have had to attend a marathon number of sessions, you have always - in my opinion - upheld Community law in a clear manner, as is naturally your duty."
"This is very important in relation to our governments."
"You need to meet the demands of the European Parliament, as well as the demands of the various governments."
"This was clearly so in your case and I would like to thank you on behalf of the European Parliament for your efforts at this difficult time."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the European Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the current financial crisis does not, as some people have said, constitute the defeat of capitalism but is well and truly the result of a political error, that is, the inadequacy of rules and controls on the quality of financial products in the US since the 1990s."
"It is the result of a lack both of market transparency and of an effective financial markets monitoring body."
"The centre-right political family is not and never has been in favour of a financial system without rules or arbitrators; we are now paying very dearly for the economic and social consequences of this."
"What we, the centre-right, advocate for the global economy is the European model of a social market economy, which has proved itself."
"What we, the centre-right, are asking is that, in difficult times, we focus our attention on the situation of people who work and who save, and on that of entrepreneurs, and especially of small and medium-sized enterprises, who take risks every day to create growth and jobs."
"We will only guarantee a future for them if we stand up for our model of society and if we maintain the conditions for a free, fair and transparent market, conscious of our responsibilities and faithful to our values."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to express my Group's great satisfaction that, in this crisis, as in the Georgian crisis this summer, Europe, when it wishes, has a presence in the world, makes itself heard and influences its partners."
"What I mean here is that Europe, which supports a model of society that is unique in the world and which puts people at the heart of that model of society, is a major tool in the context of globalisation."
"The Council Presidency with Mr Sarkozy, supported by the Commission and its President, Mr Barroso, have shown that there can be a common, consistent approach by the 27 Member States, even on very sensitive and complex matters, and that Europe can have an influence on the world if it tries to stand united."
"It was thanks to repeated requests from the Council Presidency and the Commission President that the G20 meeting was made possible."
"This meeting of the richest countries and the emerging economic powers was both a symbolic and a historic event, but it also resulted in concrete measures that our Group strongly supports."
"The G20 has, indeed, identified the causes of the problem, worked out a strategy and planned a timetable."
"Disgruntled people say that it is not enough and that it is too late."
"I have some questions myself, such as why in Europe did we not pre-empt the crisis when the warning signs were already there last year?"
"Why did our supervisory authorities not monitor more closely the quality of US financial products?"
"We have to have an answer to the question of what happened in our big banks, where the top floor did not know what was going on with our computer-game players on the third floor."
"It is our duty now to take action to stimulate our economy, to stimulate growth and thus to limit the impact of this crisis on social cohesion."
"We must simplify the internal market, invest in research, strongly support our SMEs and help families in difficulty."
"We must do all that without putting a strain on public finances, for example, by considering Euro-bonds as an additional source of funding and by keeping up the impetus of reforms undertaken at national level, which are now more necessary than ever."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the face of a historic crisis, global governance has made an advance that is also potentially historic."
"We must go further, while guarding against the danger of protectionism, which is always detrimental to the poorest countries in the world."
"It is in times of crisis that we can take brave measures for the future."
"Mr President of the Commission, it is in a time of crisis that we can change some rules, and only during a time of crisis because, after the crisis, everyone forgets very quickly."
"Europe must not deviate from this path."
"Europe, united, showed that it was able to find solutions to the crises and to help our fellow citizens to overcome this crisis, which will continue to pose huge problems for us during the coming months."
"I would say to you quite simply that Europe must be united, Europe must be strong, and above all, Mr President of the Commission, that we have felt the symbiotic relationship between the different institutions, Parliament, which I will mention first, the Commission and the Council."
"That is how we will succeed and set an example to our fellow citizens."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that the G20 states have held a meeting shows that progress has been made."
"The fact that they have convened in this way indicates that the world is changing, that we are developing into a multipolar world in which the European Union can, and will, play a central role if it stays united, if we do our homework and if we actually perform the task that we have been set."
"Therefore the decisive issue is, President of the Commission, whether we have enough time."
"From your speech, I understand that you intend to present the measures, which you are going to develop in the Commission in connection with the report from Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, at the spring meeting."
"That is too late."
"As far as the hedge funds and the private equity funds are concerned, we want the measures now."
"If I have understood matters correctly, Mr McCreevy submitted initial measures concerning the banks to the Commission last week."
"It is only a very small package."
"If we want credibility, we need to discuss the rating agencies now."
"We want to discuss the regulation of these agencies as quickly as possible."
"We want measures in connection with the private equity funds and hedge funds now."
"We want to discuss managers' salaries now."
"We want to discuss short selling now."
"The fact is, people are already getting used to the situation."
"We are experiencing a financial crisis and large-scale discussions are taking place but the ladies and gentlemen from the world of finance are already taking up their positions again."
"I would like to read you a short quote from a letter from Mr Ackermann, the Chief Executive Officer of Deutsche Bank, to George W. Bush - two very interesting correspondents."
"We must prevent, writes Mr Ackermann, the public sector from taking a permanently larger role in the international financial system."
"No, this must not be prevented, it is precisely this that is the aim of the action which we are now taking, namely that there is more regulation and more international cooperation to enforce this regulation."
"We have now reached a decisive crossroads, a decisive point in time when we have to ask ourselves the following question. In the future, will there be stricter requirements, stricter controls and, I might add, legal prohibition of certain types of speculation and abuse or are we protecting banks, are we protecting funds from collapse?"
"They gratefully accept the money and then carry on unimpeded."
"It is almost like giving a burnt-out gambler, who has lost everything in a casino, more money just for him to happily carry on just as before."
"No, what we have to find out is who owns the casino, what rules are used for gambling, how the winners are taxed and, most importantly, whether the procedures in the casino are transparent and whether those who are responsible for what goes on there can also be brought to account."
"That must be our goal."
"The goal of the EU must be to define its own rules which the EU itself then enforces within the G20 countries and in the international organisations."
"Things cannot go on in the same way as before."
"We must also be clear in our minds that we have a responsibility towards the ordinary citizens of the European Union whose money is used to pay for the disasters that others have caused."
"I will give you a brief example. Just imagine, Mr Barroso, that you go to your bank."
"You are one of the better paid people in Europe, just like I am."
"You go to your bank and say: 'Here is EUR 1 000 and I would like a 25% rate of return.'"
"The man in the bank would reply: 'Mr Barroso, are you feeling unwell?"
"You are usually such a sensible person. You actually seem really rather clever.'"
"However, when Mr Ackermann speaks to his shareholders and says: 'We want returns of 25% this year', he gets a standing ovation."
"At long last, we have to close the gap between the philosophy of these people and everyday life."
"It is not acceptable that in international business, dealings are done based on these cool, cold considerations of financial returns alone."
"In order to achieve this we need the rules to stop this kind of abuse."
"(Applause)"
"If, in the next few months, by the end of this parliamentary term, we have acted sensibly, we will have closed the gap between the business world's perception and what it views as the real world, and what the ordinary people, the people in the companies, perceive as being the real world."
"The real world in companies is the world in which the money that has been thrown away, and the money for the deficits which the community of states now convening is confronted with and which have to be financed by means of rescue packages amounting to billions of euros, has to be taken from taxpayers' wallets and from the real economy."
"Therefore we cannot limit ourselves to just rescuing the banks and the funds."
"Investment in the real economy is also of primary importance."
"We must secure jobs."
"We must protect the economy from collapse."
"Yesterday, my friend Mr Steinmeier presented an interesting plan, a plan which aims to revitalise investment in all national economies in the European Union and which, above all, presents the Commission with one particular question."
"Can we use the resources that we have already set aside for the next six or seven years for investment in infrastructure, in the Lisbon Process, in research, in qualifications and in setting up a telecommunications infrastructure in Europe?"
"Can we invest them now in order to trigger employment and growth quickly?"
"In my opinion this issue is just as important as regulation of the international financial markets."
"I believe that we have reached a turning point."
"Thank you, Mr President. You pointed out that I might have been wrong about when the Commission will be ready."
"Be ready before the spring meeting."
"Be ready soon, because the horse racing will start again in the spring and so Mr McCreevy will once again no longer be here."
"We need the Commission's measures now, as soon as possible."
"I expect you to make the relevant proposals here in December."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I should like to congratulate the President of the Commission: this was the first time the Commission has been represented at such a summit and it is, indeed, very welcome."
"I would also like to congratulate the President-in-Office, not only on the excellent work that he has done for the French presidency, but also on his reward, at the presidency of the Autorité des marchés financiers."
"If 1989 was a decisive victory for the free market economy, then 2008 must be the year in which we remind ourselves of Adam Smith's warning that unbridled free markets have their limits."
"Adam Smith, in the Wealth of Nations, foresaw many things, and there are many lessons there for us in what he said."
"My group welcomes the success of the G20 meeting."
"We welcome its commitment to a shared belief that market principles, open trade and investment regimes and effectively regulated financial markets foster the dynamism, innovation and entrepreneurship that is essential for economic growth, employment and the fight against poverty."
"After 1929, countries made the mistake of seeking individual salvation."
"This time we have recognised that salvation must come collectively."
"Many of the measures proposed in the Commission's work programme for 2009 will help us on that road."
"I congratulate the Commission on that work programme, especially on the plan to ensure regulation and oversight and transparency of financial actors and significant capital market investors."
"Free markets thrive on transparency and honesty."
"In the current difficulties, some are still seeking scapegoats."
"They are arguing that warning bells were not sounded."
"But they were!"
"Otto Graf Lambsdorff and Jacques Delors and others wrote a letter to the Slovenian presidency very early this year warning of the dangers of the overheating of the world economy."
"Jean-Claude Juncker reminded us last night, in his excellent speech in our debate on the 10th anniversary of the euro, that the Eurogroup made a number of representations to the Americans and others about the dangers that we were facing."
"Liberal Democrats are not going to waste time looking for the guy who failed to spot the iceberg: we will concentrate on getting people into lifeboats."
"We are concerned by one aspect, however, of the European Union and the G20's response."
"Our Heads of State and Government appear to believe that we can go back to business as before, that all that is needed is economic growth."
"I fear they simply have not understood so many of the lessons of the last 30 years in politics."
"The recession should be a good time to take stock."
"Even with the recession, world GDP is forecast to double in the next 20 years, and yet that growth is based on finite resources, on failing to factor in the cost of waste, and on another coal-fired power station in China every week."
"The Presidency Note of 28 October to inform the EU's preparatory summit on 7 November had four innovation points."
"One of them was about sustainability."
"It said that internationally coordinated macroeconomic responses, based on promotion of environmental investments, including in developing countries, are important."
"Well, clearly, some minister or official in the French presidency has been doing some joined-up thinking."
"But that did not get into the agreed language which passed for the conclusions of the preparatory summit, which talked only about climate change in one sentence in a list of other challenges."
"Nor did it get into the G20 conclusions, other than as the penultimate point in the penultimate point, which talked about examples of other critical challenges, mentioning climate change as No 2."
"There is no contradiction between Keynes and fighting climate change."
"A modern-day Maynard Keynes would put people back to work installing solar panels and wind generators on every house in Europe, fostering innovation and providing jobs simultaneously."
"A modern-day Roosevelt, seeing that we have a global economy of which the contours are drawn in the computer campuses of West Coast America, the factories of China and the coal centres of India, would have us seek a global culture, global governance and a coherent vision of global concern."
"That is the way forward."
"It will never again be business as before."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (GA) Mr President, Mr President of the Commission and Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I firmly believe that the European Commission has adopted a strong position by acting directly and decisively to deal with the crisis in the international financial markets."
"The bottom line is that the European Union, the United States, India and China must work together to ensure that there are common rules and standards in place to control international financial services from now on."
"It is inevitable that, in every crisis or every point of danger, people say that it will never be the same again."
"Yet, if we study history - not just economics - it does all go in cycles."
"It does all come around."
"Even the simplest of fishermen would be able to tell you that the tide comes in and the tide goes out."
"That is in no way to excuse the problems that we now find ourselves in or to excuse those who have precipitated this crisis by reckless lending, dubious practices and, most particularly of all, when everything goes wrong, by running to the father and mother countries and saying 'bail us out'."
"The biggest danger there is today - in business, economics, employment and in social life across Europe - is not just the financial crisis, but the fact that banks will not lend money for working capital to small and medium-sized enterprises to allow them to grow and to take opportunities."
"There is no point in making solar panels if you do not have the people to put them on the roof."
"If you do not have people to put them on the roof - who can pay for them and buy them - you will not have people who will make them."
"The reality that we are looking at here today is that the crisis we now face in the current economic turmoil presents us with an opportunity to correct the wrongs of the past and to ensure that we now invest in research and innovation and use that money to find new ways of dealing with problems and finding solutions to the problems that people face in their lives, as well as ensuring that we give hope to people."
"Sometimes people forget that what people really need is encouragement, an idea to go forward and a slap on the back saying that they do a good job, because there is a desire for hope."
"The G20 and the actions of the Commission and in the presidency in bringing forward this G20 meeting - albeit with a lame duck presidency in the United States -is forcing India and China to come to the table and to say that they now have responsibilities as emerging economies."
"China and India have a role to play with regard to what must be done."
"My last point is that I would hate people to think that this crisis means that we must put the hindrance of the block on the innovation and creativity of the peoples of Europe."
"If we want to feed our people, give them equal rights and certainty and lift them out of the trap of poverty, our first responsibility is to ensure that they have money through jobs, that the countries have money to invest in social services and health services and, most importantly of all, that we give them the tools and the skills of education and training to be able to benefit from those new challenges that come before us."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the financial crisis is now biting the real economy too, as we might in any case have easily predicted."
"We believe that this is the price that the European Union is paying for the delay in constructing or even the refusal to construct a European regulatory system and to establish in good time financial solidarity mechanisms and banking supervision that is worthy of the name."
"Those responsible for this delay, and the advocates of this approach, which has placed Europe in a situation of extreme insecurity and recession, include you, Mr Barroso, you and the majority of your Commission."
"Mr President, I would like you, when you eloquently debate and talk of possible solutions, to say loud and clear that those who wanted rules and transparency, those who refused the totem of deregulation, were right, and I and a section of my committee - one of whom is even sitting behind you - were wrong."
"This is the only way that what you say today can be credible, and I am sorry but it is not true that the majority of the Member States was opposed to all these things."
"As I have said to you on very many occasions between 2004 and now, you have systematically chosen to align yourself with the national governments, instead of with Parliament, and with industry rather than with consumers."
"If I were somewhat of a moralist, I would even say that you have aligned yourself with the strong rather than with the just."
"This approach, put forward by Joschka Fischer in his famous Humboldt speech laying down for the Commission a simple role of acting as secretariat for the Council, is faithfully reflected in the work programme that you are presenting to us today, in the priorities of internal and external policies."
"Regarding the priorities in external affairs, I would particularly like to stress a continuing, reprehensible lack of attention to the issue of human rights, starting, of course, with China."
"There is also a rather superficial defence of the Doha Agenda, without the realisation that the financial crisis has removed all the assumptions on which it rested."
"On internal policies, regarding immigration, once more your Commission has in recent years ceded to the pressure of the Member States, and this is why today, when we talk about legal immigration, in reality we are referring to legislative instruments which remain very weak, and exactly the same can be said with regard to social policy."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, this is certainly not the way to succeed in setting in motion what the Greens have for many months now been calling the Green New Deal, and which today is very much in fashion."
"A Green New Deal has a very specific meaning and it is certainly not that confused babble that can be heard circulating and which in fact means 'everything as before with a little bit of green here and there'."
"We are talking about a joint long-term investment strategy to achieve the aims of energy efficiency and an environmental shift in the economy, reductions in CO2, with an enhanced role for the European Investment Bank, which ought to be, however, consistent in its decisions on who and what to finance."
"There should be no ambiguity on useless mega-infrastructures or on nuclear power or on windfall funds for projects that are not good ones."
"There should be no public funds or blank cheques for the car industry, as it now is."
"This would be like carrying on throwing money down the drain, and we, I believe, do not want to throw any more money down the drain."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, only a few days ago in this very Chamber President Sarkozy told us that the crisis that we are experiencing is structural and that what is needed is a rethink of capitalism itself."
"Naturally, I think that rather than escaping from the crisis of capitalism we need to escape from capitalism in crisis; in other words, we need to start to think about a new future which provides for a genuine transition to an economy which is described in social and ecological terms, an economic democracy based on equity and cooperation rather than on inequality and war."
"Above and beyond these substantive differences, however, which do count for something, I can see that very little remains of the solemn statements on the rethinking of capitalism in the rather modest and fairly disappointing outcome of this G20, for which Europe also bears some responsibility."
"Certainly, it has been discovered that laissez-faire dogma can be falsified and that therefore there can be huge public intervention and even nationalisation, but all this will not change the underlying philosophy that created the structural crisis."
"Certainly, it is said that we need rules to reduce the risks of speculation, but there is no idea of intervening with regard to this financial speculation - for instance with a Tobin Tax on transactions - and we are not touching the Stability Pact that, in this time of recession, is likely to dramatically worsen lives in this continent of ours."
"However, most of all, we are not asking ourselves what lies at the bottom of this crisis and so we are not succeeding in tackling it."
"I would point to just two issues: the first is the systematic devaluation of work that has been pursued with laissez-faire policies over recent decades, which has ended up by creating, as well as injustice and suffering, a significant part of the lack of financial liquidity."
"In 1929 John Maynard Keynes proposed that we should invest in salaries and jobs, but today this is not being done."
"The second is the ecological and energy dimension of the crisis, which calls for decisions that are much clearer and starker than the stammering of the G20, but on the other hand it is very difficult for those who created the crisis to resolve it."
"We need a clear, different signal from the left."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (DA) Mr President, like other speakers here today, I would like to quote Keynes."
"It has seldom seemed more appropriate."
"I will quote in English:"
"'Speculators may do no harm as bubbles on a steady stream of enterprise."
"But the position is serious when enterprise becomes the bubble on a whirlpool of speculation."
"When the capital development of a country becomes a by-product of the activities of a casino, the job is likely to be ill-done.'"
"The Commission's proposal for a solution to the financial crisis really beats about the bush."
"The EMU structure is not a bulwark against general crises, and certainly not financial crises."
"The four freedoms and the restrictive Stability Pact do not make things any easier; in fact exactly the opposite."
"We need to redraft the institutional framework for the economy and economic policy."
"It is all very well to suggest that a new financial architecture will be created, but the structure has not been described well enough to have a chance at architectural college, or on an economic course."
"This is surely connected to the understanding of the crisis."
"Naturally enough, the initial focus was on doing something about the liquidity crisis, to ensure the supply of lubricants."
"In this regard, the various countries have chosen slightly different models - that is the way of things - but what does the Commission actually mean when it says that the EU shall (and I will quote from the programme):"
"'ensure that the restructuring of the banking sector is done in a way which will ensure fair and healthy competition in the sector for the future'."
"Does this mean that the public sector is required to inject capital?"
"Is that what this sentence means?"
"I would also like to ask the Commission whether new credit rating agencies are to be set up."
"Many of the old ones have, in any case, proven to be totally untrustworthy."
"What does the Commission mean when it talks about the 'structural reform agenda'? Does it mean labour market reforms, 'flexicurity', without security?"
"Is it the intention that increased job insecurity should be the workers' contribution?"
"In general, it is unclear whether or not the Commission intends wages to be a crucial competitive parameter."
"Are wages viewed solely as costs?"
"We also need to view wages in relation to the effect they have on demand."
"Finally, I would like to ask a question on behalf of my colleague, Mr Blokland, who is the first vice-chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, relating to the environment: when is the Commission going to publish the national emission ceilings?"
"- (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that the preposterous idea of the Council President, Mr Sarkozy, to alter the foundations of capitalism failed at the talks in Washington."
"I hope that the European Union will see the return of a rational spirit which respects the freedom of the market as a fundamental value and a precondition of prosperity."
"This applies even in times of crisis."
"I believe therefore that neither the European Commission nor the Czech Republic, which is taking over the Presidency, will succumb to illusions of their own grandeur and infallibility and that, in contrast to the French Presidency, they will abandon the absurd and above all hazardous attempts to use taxpayers' money to override the natural economic cycle."
"I am also delighted that the G20 rejected protectionism."
"After all, it is well-known that those who exchange some of their freedoms for greater security end up losing both."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the current crisis was not caused by capitalism but by the greed of irresponsible banks that were unwilling to bear the risk for their own decisions."
"This kind of thing represents a threat to the free market just as much as excessive government control does."
"Simply to pump money into banks without securing direct influence over how it will be used is therefore a theft of the hard-earned money of our citizens."
"We must keep an eye on the banks to ensure that they use the money not only for improving their own balance sheets but also for lending to businesses."
"To allow managers to accept financial assistance without the government dictating how the money should be spent amounts to a denial of the principle of political responsibility."
"This is tantamount to an immoral payment for losses incurred through the unprincipled operations of financial institutions, with neither the institutions nor the actual managers bearing ultimate responsibility."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Madam President, I shall be very brief, because this has been an extremely fertile debate, but I should like to make five observations before ceding the floor to President Barroso."
"The first is that we all agree on the historic and highly innovative nature of the G20 meeting."
"This global step is innovative and historic, but so was the initiative taken by Europe, as the President of the Commission has emphasised, this being a Europe that acts on the international stage, as Joseph Daul stressed, whenever a common will emerges."
"Secondly, we all agree that what is happening, whether we like it or not, marks a break and that, as Mr Watson stated, we cannot go back to business as before but must be imaginative in the ways in which we respond to this crisis."
"My third observation is one that several speakers have made, including Mr Schulz, chairman of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, and Mrs Frassoni, and it concerns the importance of remaining truly responsive, of maintaining our momentum and rapidly adopting any essential legislative measures, particularly those relating to financial regulation."
"My fourth observation is that action is needed to lessen the highly detrimental impact of this financial crisis in terms of both relations between the financial system and SMEs, as Mr Crowley indicated, and the link between social regulation and economic recovery, to which Mr Daul referred."
"It is also essential to act on the basis of a broad vision, taking account of the elements of Keynesianism that can be enlisted in the fight against climate change, as Mr Watson, chairman of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, suggested."
"Lastly, as you emphasised, Mr President of the Commission, and as several speakers and group chairmen emphasised, the important thing is to consider all the dimensions of the crisis."
"As you said, it is a development model which is at stake, and there is a need, as Martin Schulz pointed out, to reappraise the demarcation lines between the role of the public sector and that of the private sector."
"As you stressed, and as others have said, including Mrs Frassoni, it would be wrong to focus solely on the financial world and forget the most disadvantaged, the weakest, those who are starving, whom you also mentioned, Mr President."
"I also endorse the view that we must re-examine the foundations of the system; if greed forms part of those foundations, there will be no alternative but to re-examine them."
"Lastly, it must be appreciated, and this is my final point, that the crisis should not cause us to slow down or to be faint-hearted but rather to respond more quickly and to remain ambitious in our development objectives and in our environmental aims and our fight against climate change."
"(Applause)"
"President of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, since we have decided that I should now present the whole work programme for next year, I should like to answer Mr Schulz's specific question before continuing my remarks."
"Today the Commission approved its response to the two reports - the Rasmussen report and the Lehne report - and you can see how we intend to monitor the various elements and how we have already initiated such action."
"It is a very wide-ranging response and we shall present other proposals, some of which, indeed, we have already presented."
"When I spoke about the spring meeting of the European Council, I referred to the findings of the high-level group I set up under the chairmanship of Jacques de Larosière."
"As far as the proposals are concerned, Mr McCreevy, the Commissioner responsible for these matters, tells me that those on hedge funds and private equity in particular, which may be the very proposals you had in mind, can be presented soon; in principle, they will be ready for presentation in December."
"Moving on to the Commission's work programme for 2009, it is, as I have said, inextricably bound up with a specific political context."
"I must tell you that the financial storm is still raging, that it is not yet over, and that we are on the verge of a serious economic slowdown."
"This is why we must waste no time in pursuing the efforts that have already been launched to adapt to the globalisation process and to modernise."
"It is not a case of our having just discovered the need to respond to globalisation."
"I must emphasise that, within this Commission over which I have the honour of presiding, we have been referring for a number of years to a new era."
"What this means specifically for Europe is that we must promote our values and defend our interests in the context of the globalisation process."
"It is precisely in this context that we must present ambitious proposals."
"The present crisis, however, must not distract us from the other priorities of our work programme, which, in fact, are also priority responses to the challenge of globalisation."
"I refer especially to the struggle against climate change and the pursuit of sustainable development."
"These are priorities for 2009, which assumes special importance as the year of the Copenhagen Conference."
"May I warmly commend the huge volume of work that the European Parliament has been putting into the climate and energy package."
"We face exceptional circumstances, and I am proud to see the response of the European institutions, which have risen to the challenge."
"I firmly believe that, by working together, we shall achieve our common goal of a political agreement in December."
"To be perfectly honest, I am convinced that such an agreement will also serve as a catalyst for a European strategy designed to obtain an ambitious agreement in Copenhagen."
"I have no wish to exaggerate what is at stake, but we must all be aware that Europe is putting a great deal of its credibility on the line in this debate, in which it is the main driving force."
"It was Europe that launched the global debate on the fight against climate change."
"It was we who told the US Government that it needed to do more."
"We have said the same thing to the Russians, the Chinese and the Indians, telling them that we must not give up at a time when the prospect of better cooperation with the new US Government is on the horizon."
"Let us not give any sign of being about to scale down our ambitions."
"I believe that would seriously dent our credibility."
"Tomorrow we shall propose a truly golden opportunity, and we have no right not to seize it."
"For this reason, our response to the economic crisis must demonstrate that programmes to fight against climate change can also be part of an economic response strategy."
"I should not like to see the kind of stand-off that sometimes surfaces between those who champion the economy or industry and those who promote the sustainable-development agenda."
"In actual fact, the two things go together, and I must applaud what some of you have said to that effect."
"Another priority is a people's Europe."
"In 2009 the Commission will devote itself particularly to the quest for progress in the European area of freedom, security and justice, for example, by establishing the common immigration policy and integrating it into the broadest policies of the European Union, such as its growth, competitiveness and social-inclusion policies, by making the European immigration network operational and finalising the common European asylum system for 2010, by reinforcing compliance with the rules governing consumer protection in Europe, by improving mutual recognition of certain instruments of civil and criminal law, such as judgments and inheritance settlements, and by combating new forms of criminal activity, such as child abuse and cyberattacks."
"The other priority for 2009 - and I am moving on very quickly, of course, because of the time factor - is Europe's role in the world."
"Here, too, challenges await us, namely the enlargement process and reinforcement of the neighbourhood policy, as well as the establishment of closer relations with developing countries, especially those in Africa."
"This is a categorical imperative, and I must remind you of the need to approve the Commission's proposal on agricultural aid in developing countries."
"It is a question of credibility."
"Once again, we cannot confine ourselves at major summits to the discussion of financial matters."
"We must show that we do not hold discussions with the large emerging powers alone but that we are also concerned about the developing countries, especially the countries of Africa."
"Our relationships with these countries are also an important factor in the resolution of a number of global issues."
"Let us not forget that we have major meetings like next year's Copenhagen Conference to enable us to engage more effectively with them on common issues such as energy security, the fight against climate change and migration, as well as the completion of the Doha Development Agenda and the pursuit of bilateral trade negotiations."
"It clearly emerged from the Washington summit that there is an urgent need for a global trade agreement."
"Doha, moreover, besides being a trade agenda, is also a development agenda."
"I believe that we are now closer to the right track, for the real alternative to Doha is not the status quo but rather, because of the present financial crisis, the option of turning in on ourselves, the possibility that countries in various parts of the world will take backward steps on tariffs and enact unilateral measures to protect some sectors of their economies."
"In that case, economic nationalism would resurface on a grand scale, with a return to protectionism that would damage the global economy and, I need hardly add, the European economy too."
"As you know, Europe is the leading power in terms of trade."
"Last week's summit has also strengthened my determination to pursue relations with Russia based on mutual interests."
"These relations will sometimes prove difficult."
"There are issues on which we have different positions, but I honestly believe that last week's summit in Nice confirmed that it is better to engage with Russia than try to isolate it."
"Russia is also a major partner on the global stage."
"Lastly, the intense pressure to which the world has been subjected in 2008 has demonstrated how important it is to share a common vision with the United States."
"A fantastic opportunity is now opening up with this new administration in the United States."
"During his election campaign, the President-elect made very clear statements on matters such as the fight against climate change and the adoption of a more multilateralist approach."
"Let us grasp this opportunity and present ideas for an agenda to deal with globalisation."
"We face some very formidable common challenges, and I believe that more active cooperation between Europe and the United States can make the world a better place."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in 2008 Europe has provided evidence of unity in the way it has coordinated its actions in major crises."
"Georgia and the financial crisis have made the Union more efficient."
"A united approach is the only path to pursue if we want to meet the challenges of 2009."
"In a few months' time, 375 million electors will be summoned to the polls to exercise their great democratic right to choose a new European Parliament."
"Let us take advantage of the momentum that recent crises have lent the Union."
"They have opened people's eyes to the merits and the effectiveness of the European dimension as a means of guaranteeing their economic, social and environmental welfare and protecting their interests while reaffirming their values."
"I believe that today, in the midst of this crisis, clear opportunities are there for the taking."
"For example, there is a far more favourable climate than there was a few months ago for recognition of the importance of our currency, the euro."
"Let us therefore seize this opportunity."
"I believe it is important, at least for all those who believe in the European project - and I think they are in the majority - to be more upbeat in conveying the European message and not to keep succumbing to cynicism or inertia."
"To that end, I do believe it is incumbent on our institutions to work together."
"I know that there are times when the Commission, for example, could more easily court popularity in some circles by making proposals that the Member States would be sure to reject out of hand."
"That is not the way I look at things."
"I certainly do favour an ambitious outlook, but it must also be realistic, for we have to act with the other institutions and with the Member States, which are all democracies, otherwise they would not be members of the European Union."
"The Commission will continue to play its part, to perform its role as a driving force and initiator, but in so doing it will not act against the Member States and Parliament but rather with the European Parliament and with the Member States."
"I believe it is increasingly necessary to adopt this attitude."
"Any other approach would be a form of populism."
"Making proposals as a mere publicity stunt is also a form of populism."
"Another form of populism involves making proposals under the guise of Europeanism when we know that they have no chance at all of being approved."
"Our role in the European Commission, of course, is to act as a driving force but at the same time to seek consensus with the other institutions."
"That is how Europe can stay at the heart of the action, where it has managed to position itself."
"Interinstitutional cooperation has enabled it to play a key role in setting the international agenda."
"We are at a very important political juncture for Europe, perhaps even a turning point."
"Europe also carries great expectations."
"It is by continuing to take initiatives and to plan ahead together that the Union can best meet these expectations, and that is precisely the spirit which will inspire the European Commission in 2009."
"(Applause)"
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there are three main crises that demand action from us."
"The first is the financial crisis - as has already been discussed - which is encroaching on the real economy to an ever increasing degree."
"Secondly, we must not forget the crisis involving the Treaties which underpin our Union, reflected in the fate of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Thirdly, there is an EU crisis with respect to its acceptance amongst the public, which is, I believe, an important aspect to mention ahead of the elections."
"Mr President, you have presented a work programme for the rest of the term of this Parliament and of your Commission, and I would like to say that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will be happy to follow the main principles of this programme."
"We will support you."
"However, we will put different emphases on some aspects."
"Emphasis will be placed in line with expectations."
"These expectations are aimed at the last few months of your term of office and maybe even beyond."
"The PPE-DE Group would like to see itself reflected in the Commission's actions."
"We are aware that other groups are making the same request, and rightly so."
"We will rely on your political skills for the response."
"You have rightly made employment and growth your highest priority."
"The response is increasingly linked to the issue of how we should react to the financial crisis."
"We support the measures required in connection with the regulation and transparency of the financial markets."
"We need extremely specific proposals for reorganising the regulation of the financial markets as quickly as possible."
"The implementation of the action plan from the Global Financial Summit is surely first and foremost the concern of the nation states."
"However, in view of the globally interconnected markets, close cooperation in connection with all regulatory measures - if only to prevent various different standards from being applied - is imperative."
"This represents a broad and important area of activity for the coordination work of the Commission."
"Regulation - and we must not forget this - is not an end in itself, but, in a particular crisis, it is a tool used to achieve certain goals."
"We need to keep reminding ourselves of this fact."
"You mentioned the climate change and energy package which is scheduled to be adopted by December."
"I am sure this goal enjoys broad consensus within Parliament."
"The PPE-DE Group - and I want to make this absolutely clear - also wants this problem to be solved before the end of this legislative term."
"It is a strategic aim."
"However, you are asking a lot of Parliament."
"Based on the current situation, we can assume that just after the December summit we will be presented with a package containing hundreds of pages in one language and we will be expected to say yes or no to it."
"While we respect the goal that we also share, this is a significant abuse of the rights of Parliament and its Members, and maybe we will be able to come up with something more ingenious than this unrefined option."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, at the end of your speech you said that we must send out a clear signal to the electorate."
"I totally agree."
"However, when I take a look at the programme, the theme often seems to be 'carry on as before'."
"That may be the right thing to do in some areas but in other areas - above all in the area that we are discussing today - it cannot be right."
"We have to send out the signal that we have learnt from the crisis and that we are going to act differently to the way we have acted in the past."
"If you add the sentence, 'Europe benefits from open societies and open markets but rules have to apply to both of them', then it would be right, but perhaps not clear enough."
"We need rules so that Europe can benefit from open societies and open markets."
"This must be made clear and it has not always been the principle followed by the Commission."
"In your composition - if I may put it that way - you mention a 'sudden crisis of confidence'."
"For a long time now, Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen has been pointing out what might happen."
"Mr Schultz has also been talking about it for a long while now."
"The crisis in confidence was therefore not that sudden."
"Yet some people in the Commission were of the opinion that we do not have to regulate anything, that it would turn out alright, that the market would regulate everything."
"However, that was not what happened and change must be made."
"(Applause)"
"My second point is this. There is a subject which is still not part of this programme but which is very important for the citizens of Europe, namely the general public and public sector services."
"I mention this specifically because a crisis has now developed in some countries in connection with the postal service."
"This is not the fault of Europe or the Commission alone."
"However, it can be attributed to a particular attitude, namely that the market should rule in all sectors and it should be open in every respect, thus giving some postal services the incentive to acquire higher profits elsewhere instead of providing services to consumers, to the general public."
"This is taking us in the wrong direction."
"At the very least, I would have liked to have seen an unambiguous statement at the end of your programme indicating that you will speak up for these public sector services and say how they should be dealt with, both regionally and locally, and that the market does not regulate everything after all."
"Finally, I would like to endorse one of your points: we have a new US Government."
"I would like to ask you, Mr President, the Commissioner and everyone else to use the time and the next few weeks to work with this government to ensure that we create a genuine partnership for a European, and also global, social market economy."
"Let us take advantage of the opportunity afforded by a new US President."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, as regards the world financial crisis and the Commission legislative work programme, in a sense, the latter should be our response to the former."
"Now, perhaps some would say that we have not one crisis, but several: financial, of course, but environmental facing up to climate change, confidence in Europe after the Irish vote, and security after the recent events in Georgia."
"But perhaps without in any way belittling what confronts us, for 'crisis' we should probably read 'challenges' - challenges to Europe to really step up to the mark and fulfil its role."
"Europe is surely the best equipped region of the globe, with our institutions really able to get at these issues and challenges which go beyond national reach, beyond the control of any individual Member State."
"We, above all, should be able to respond together through a strong and collective response to give confidence to those whom we represent: Europe's citizens."
"Let me give you an example. In respect of the financial crisis I believe this Parliament can rightly claim to have been at the front of the game."
"We had a strong foretaste in the work we did in our committee of inquiry into the collapse of Equitable Life."
"It was the first warning shot of the financial crisis to come."
"This Parliament made a number of recommendations coming out of that inquiry in June last year, recommendations about financial regulation, about administrative cooperation between regulators, about access to redress and compensation - in short, on most of the topics in the financial sector where our citizens need most reassurance at the moment."
"Those recommendations would repay attention from the Commission but most particularly from the Member States, particularly the British Government, which has yet to respond to it fully, and more importantly yet to compensate Equitable Life victims, despite pushing its own way to the front of the queue against the Icelandic banks."
"The financial and other challenges that face us need us to act together in solidarity, not just with an eye to national protectionism if we are to emerge unscathed as a continent."
"Our group, the ALDE Group, intends to respond to the work programme with a positive and progressive resolution."
"Many of my colleagues will give details of some of the items, but we will emphasise above all an open Europe, a green Europe, an entrepreneurial Europe and a safe Europe."
"(PL) Madam President, Mr President, the financial crisis and in time also an economic crisis will affect all of Europe, and therefore we must bear responsibility together and make our decisions together."
"Since all Member States will be affected by the crisis and will face the task of counteracting it, slowing it down and mitigating its consequences, all Member States must decide together about the joint action to be taken."
"A situation such as the one prevailing today, whereby the EU is divided into Europe A - the euro area countries with the addition of only Great Britain - and Europe B - which consists of the new Member States together with Sweden and Denmark - represents a division of the EU, all the more so now that we are facing a crisis."
"It represents a negation of one of the basic principles on which the operation of the European Community has hitherto been founded: the solidarity principle."
"This is not the way, Mr Barroso."
"The Commission's action plan, put forward 13 days ago, confuses fundamental matters with unimportant ones and with matters which may have been important at one time, but have lost their importance in the face of the economic crisis."
"At the present time, economic growth and fighting the increasing threat of unemployment are a hundred times more important than climate change issues."
"I am glad that the European Commission regards further expansion of the European Union, that is the inclusion of the Balkan countries, as a priority."
"The real issue here is to stabilise this explosive region of Europe, since stabilisation of the Balkans will mean lower costs for European taxpayers: the citizens of our Member States."
"- (FR) Madam President, it is indeed the task of the European Commission to guarantee transparency, better information and protection for our citizens and consumers, as Mr Barroso rightly said."
"There is, however, one domain, Mr Barroso, in which your Commission has been particularly unsuccessful in that respect, namely the authorisation procedures for genetically modified organisms (GMOs)."
"These procedures have drawn criticism from all quarters."
"They ought to be reviewed at the next meeting of the Council of Environment Ministers on 4 and 5 November."
"There are 44 European regions that have declared themselves GM-free."
"Six Member States have invoked the safeguard clause for Monsanto maize."
"In the face of opposition from a large majority of Europeans, what are you doing, Mr Barroso?"
"You are fast-tracking marketing licences."
"You are issuing approvals, meekly following the advice of the European Food Safety Authority, whose opinion is itself based on toxicity studies conducted by bio-engineering companies."
"European procedures in their present form are a veritable sieve through which the commercial interests of agribusiness can percolate freely."
"People want to know about the toxic effects of GMOs, and they must be told."
"Do you yourself know how toxic they are, Mr Barroso?"
"Do you know?"
"What effects does the toxicity of GMOs have on public health and the environment?"
"Why is there no requirement to publish the raw data on which the findings of studies are based?"
"Why are tests not compulsory after three months?"
"Why make do with studies conducted by the companies themselves?"
"The public are entitled to transparency, to information, to discussion."
"These should be the aims of the Commission when it comes to approving GMOs."
"What we want, Mr Barroso, is the publication of raw data."
"We want to see dissenting studies, we want public debate, and we want long-term testing."
"We want to know the health impact of GMOs."
"Your initiative, Mr Barroso, to create a group of sherpas from the 27 Member States to bypass the Presidency's ad hoc group and to bypass your own Commissioners who are competent in these matters sows confusion and obscurity in an area where it is your responsibility to guarantee the clarity and reliability of procedures."
"You want the public to have confidence in Europe, do you not, Mr Barroso?"
"Then prove it!"
"(DE) Madam President, the result of the G20 summit is a reduction in the lowest common denominator."
"Regulation and transparency are supposed to prevent another financial crisis."
"However, the specific measures to be implemented are still undecided."
"The International Monetary Fund (IMF), which plummeted people throughout the world into poverty and despair due to its neo-liberal structural adjustment policy, is now due to become the overseer of the global financial market."
"A departure from the system of global redistribution, which is primarily responsible for the crisis, is not even being attempted."
"It is paradoxical that up to now the inconceivable amount of EUR 2.5 trillion has had to be found in order to rescue banks throughout the world."
"However, there has never been such concerted action for any human disaster."
"With this amount of money we could have combated the most severe poverty in the world and saved the climate."
"What are the consequences?"
"A social global economic order must replace the free market economy and the United Nations should play a leading role in this."
"A new global financial order must promote social welfare policies, stop the process of impoverishment and make progress with respect to ecologically sustainable economic activity."
"The European Union can play a decisive role in shaping this new order, provided that it demonstrates that the recession, as a consequence of the financial crisis, is being combated successfully by united European action."
"However, this will only work if the EU puts its own house in order first."
"The President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, said earlier, 'Extraordinary circumstances require extraordinary measures'."
"Correct, but then act with courage."
"Have the courage to replace the practically obsolete Stability Pact for Europe with an economic and social pact which obliges all the Member States to coordinate their economic and financial policies with each other."
"Then have courage and show the Commission's colours at long last, and, with no ifs and buts, put the subject of social justice at the top of the European agenda."
"Once again, social aspects are not given a high enough priority in the legislative and work programme."
"Social pressure is only mentioned in a vague manner, as something that one has to respond to in times of economic emergency."
"Why do you not mention the grave social problems specifically?"
"Why do you not say quite clearly that the ever-widening gap between rich and poor is no longer acceptable?"
"Why do you not say quite clearly that profits being privatised and losses being nationalised is no longer acceptable?"
"I ask myself when the Commission, faced with the drastic situation with respect to unemployment, poverty and inequality, will finally understand that we cannot keep going on as before, as suggested in the work programme."
"Neo-liberalism has plainly and simply ruined the economy and a wind of change in Europe is long overdue."
"- (FR) Madam President, I am struck - and I believe I am not the only one - by the antithesis between the most cogent contemporary evidence and what I am hearing in this Chamber, particularly from the representatives of the Council and the Commission, but also from my dyed-in-the-wool Europhile colleagues."
"In the face of this antithesis, I cannot help thinking of Byzantium, of the balsamic and self-satisfied utterances of the Byzantine administrators at a time when their world was sliding into oblivion."
"What we have here is not a mere crisis - surely a ludicrously inadequate term to describe a recession - but the collapse of the very foundations of the globalisation process that left such a mark on the 20th century."
"I do not see this as a credit crunch."
"It is a credo crunch; it is your political credo that has been thrown into crisis, and I ask you to have the courage to acknowledge the real gravity of the situation."
"I do not have the time to enumerate all the tenets of this credo, but the liberalisation of credit and these stacks of loans are obviously the consequence of blind faith in the invisible hand and perhaps even in the inevitability of progress."
"It goes without saying that the answer is government control of credit."
"By the same token, free trade - the accelerated spread of free trade - is no solution."
"On the contrary, the solution is to revert to protecting our borders, as our peoples are well aware."
"Political power should not be usurped by superstructures such as those we have here, and in that respect the failure of the Treaty of Lisbon should set you thinking."
"What is needed is a return to the real legitimate authority, namely the sovereign state."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the financial crisis and the slowdown in the economy underline the central role that the Member States and then the European Union ought to play in ensuring socio-economic welfare, but it should also be stressed that politics ought to take back full control of the economy and combat in every possible way the virtual finance that still controls the destinies of millions of people."
"Reducing the impact of the global slowdown on the European economy, in terms of employment and economic activity, ought to mean promoting an approach based on the European social model."
"This ought to be the priority for 2009: employment and social protection for growth."
"Finally come practical steps to reform the rules of the European financial system, at last, after the banking and finance system has been allowed to plunder and squeeze public assets and private individuals."
"The Commission's strategy to support those who are losing their jobs seems to me to be too little, too late, just like the support for small and medium-sized enterprises and investment in research."
"Above all, I note that the speeding up and implementation of cohesion programmes is distracting attention from other needs."
"Before worrying about creating confidence in the markets, governments and commissions ought to re-establish citizens' confidence in the independence of those who govern them from the influence of off-shore finance."
"(ES) Madam President, I am not really going to talk about the diagnosis of the financial crisis."
"We all agree that this started as a crisis of liquidity which then became a crisis of solvency and which has ended up as a crisis of confidence, resulting in a lack of credit which has now damaged the real economy."
"The response, contrary to what has been said here, has not been a united European response."
"In the best-case scenario, it has been a coordinated response."
"You may say that, in the current situation, nothing more can be done."
"However, I believe that more can definitely be done."
"As regards the financial rescues and also liquidity and solvency, it is shocking that three institutions are assisting the markets and giving loans all at the same time: namely the European Central Bank, the European Investment Bank and the Commission itself."
"All three are competing with each other, to everyone's detriment."
"As regards fighting the crisis in the real economy, the Washington Summit announced budgetary remedies but did not say what these would be."
"Some countries will opt to reduce taxes, whereas others will opt for a public spending programme in the purest Keynesian style."
"We would do well to find out whether, if all these actions are not coordinated, those which work will benefit those which do not."
"We would also do well to lay down rules on the Stability and Growth Pact."
"In international terms, it is true that my country of Spain and also the Czech Republic and the Netherlands were present in Washington but did not attend the preparatory meetings, and no one can guarantee that they will do so in the future."
"I should like the Council and the Commission to tell me how they plan to reform the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund and what they plan to do so that all the countries that should be are represented in the Financial Stability Fund."
"I will end with a warning."
"Parliament is being asked to cooperate with the Commission's plan: we always have done."
"If the Commission had heeded the warnings that we have been giving since 1999 in repeated reports ignored by the Commission and Mr McCreevy in particular, things would now be very different."
"- (FR) Madam President, 2009 will go down in history as the year of the second great global economic depression."
"In his book on the 1929 crisis, John Kenneth Galbraith wrote, and I quote: 'The singular feature of the great crash of 1929 was that the worst continued to worsen'."
"The subprime mortgage crisis has triggered a deflationary spiral which is not only ravaging the financial system, having wiped out more than 60% of the global value of shares."
"This liquidity and solvency crisis is increasingly affecting the real economy too."
"The term 'real economy', as opposed to the financial sector, is interesting."
"It emphasises the virtual nature of most financial assets."
"In the wake of the debacle in the financial markets, we are experiencing the great resurgence of national governments."
"We have seen a succession of summits."
"The Washington summit produced an impressive catalogue of commendable intentions."
"With the gift of hindsight that characterises the leaders, great and small, who govern us, vigorous measures have been prepared with a view to assessing risks properly and avoiding excessive leverage effects."
"Supervision is to become more effective without stifling innovation."
"'Hear!"
"Hear!' we say, while awaiting details of an appropriate system of regulation that will avoid any excessive risks without falling into the trap of overregulation."
"The return of national governments to the role of market regulators has to be welcomed, but the unfortunate thing is that this often means the return of the self-seeking nation state."
"In a more open world than that of 1929, any national action will quickly run out of steam."
"The recession calls for action in a spirit of international solidarity."
"The European Union must mobilise all its forces, pool all available national budgetary resources to invest them as a matter of priority in infrastructure for growth and bolster purchasing power."
"President-elect Barack Obama is said to have the intention of launching an economic recovery programme costing the equivalent of four per cent of US GDP."
"The 27 Member States of the Union, which are collectively less indebted than the United States, should make a similar effort in order to pull Europe and the world out of a financial crisis that threatens to bring distress to everyone."
"- (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in 2009, as we all know, there will be European elections."
"The year 2009 will also see the appointment of a new Commission."
"In 2009, there will, of course, be changes of presidency."
"However, the importance of all these things is only relative."
"Life goes on, and our citizens expect our institutions to respond to their concerns, always with an eye to the future, pursuing long-term objectives and able to initiate immediate action to achieve them."
"In this spirit, I wish to emphasise two fundamental areas of action for 2009."
"The first, which has been mentioned by every speaker, is to respond to the financial crisis."
"I certainly noted, as every one of us did, the gold stars that the Commission and the Presidency were awarding themselves."
"I would go so far as to say, Commissioner, that we can celebrate having scored the first goal, but the match is not over."
"As a result, if I may make a suggestion, the Presidency and the Council should get a move on and strike while the iron is hot so as to ensure that the 27 Member States come up quickly with effective responses to the financial crisis."
"As is often said, however, one crisis invariably conceals another; unless we wish to be taken unawares by the next crisis too, the programme for 2009 must be able, as President Barroso seemed to indicate that it will be, to respond to the challenges confronting us."
"As my colleague Mrs Wallis has said, this is why we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe are making a number of proposals."
"Some of my colleagues will be speaking about some of these proposals."
"I should like to emphasise one of the points that I consider essential and on which we intend to focus sharply, namely the need to ensure that, in 2009, your Commission takes full account of the Structural Funds, which currently make up 36% of our budget and which will enable us to take far more effective action, to engender solidarity between our regions and to avail ourselves of the instruments without which we cannot meet the challenges of our age."
"Lastly, as winter sets in, let us not forget the housing crisis."
"We are counting on you to take action in this domain, Commissioner, particularly in response to our two requests for studies on the housing problem."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, seen from our point of view, this crisis has necessitated a restructuring of our continent's banking landscape, but has not led to the emergence in Europe, to speak plainly, of a group of serious financial operators genuinely able to plan the future framework of the markets."
"This is not apparent, and cannot be seen."
"One thing is, however, certain: all the regulations envisaged by the G20 will remain as just many words if tax havens remain inviolable."
"That is the major issue which is missing, and which is not mentioned in the official discussions of the Member States; those tax havens that make it possible to completely circumvent the rules that we wish to put in place, that are being promised on the financial markets."
"When he was a senator, President-elect Obama proposed severe measures against tax havens and we may well wonder whether, as a new president, in view of the web of high finance that seems to have controlled movements and, above all, in view of generous multimillionaire funding of the elections, he will have the courage to act on this issue and to convince not only the United States but also Europe and, in particular, Great Britain."
"I believe that instead of general declarations of principle we ought to ask for effective, concrete initiatives to be adopted, that are truly capable of bringing about a recovery of the economy and production, as is needed to prevent further economic crises and to escape from the current crisis."
"In view of the current situation, featuring general and widespread indebtedness of the market and violent deflation due to insufficient monetary circulation, it is absurd to suggest further indebtedness of the Member States to private central banks to provide liquidity to the credit system itself and to the consumer market."
"I would like to end with one remark: it seems to me certain and clear that there is a chance that the crisis will lead to the proposal of a world body for the economy, as well as for politics; that world order which until a few months ago was feared by all, avoided by all but which today we seem to feel has become inevitable, and to be welcomed as if it were salvation."
"No to globalisation!"
"(DE) Madam President, firstly, I would like to say that everything that the Commission and the Council have said today about a 'New Green Deal' in the light of the global financial crisis is, in my opinion, incorrect and that as yet no political resolve of any kind is behind the pronouncement of the 'New Green Deal'."
"For several months now, European industrial organisations have been mobilising against our European climate and energy strategy."
"The proposals made by Commissioner Dimas, Commissioner Piebalgs and Mr Michel in connection with development policy have been systematically softened up, diluted and delayed."
"This attitude has not been abandoned in any way in the light of the financial crisis; instead industry has begun to use the financial crisis to exert even more pressure against a systematic climate and energy policy."
"I believe that this fact has to be recorded at this point as the truth will out and no progress will be made by only claiming to develop a new policy."
"If you take a closer look at the current trialogue, the negotiations on climate policy between the Council, the Commission and Parliament, you will be able to see that I am right."
"This is because these negotiations are not exactly characterised by ambition, but by precisely that outdated industrial policy that nobody here wants to hear anything about, or so we are told."
"The President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, and the Commissioner for Industry, Mr Verheugen, are, in my opinion, responsible for this."
"I am in favour of this Parliament finally deciding to show their support for those people, such as Mr Dimas and Mr Michel, who actually do stand for sustainable strategies."
"What is needed at the moment is sincerity."
"Mr Steiner from UNEP (United Nations Environment Programme) presented a very good plan in London the week before last."
"Let us get down to business and stop making vacuous speeches as was the case in the first part of the debate."
"In the next few weeks we will have the opportunity to bring the trialogue to a conclusion, and then we will be able to assess whether the Commission and the Council have just been faking it today or whether they were serious."
"(FI) Madam President, Commissioner, the world is suffering from 'Mad Money Disease'."
"It is an American disease that has been caused by cheap, loose money."
"The value of property was harmonised when investors were collectively drunk on the stock exchange and on heat around real estate."
"Spreading through the stock exchanges in the form of derivatives and swaps, the disease became a pandemic."
"Now it is time for the hangover."
"The United States of America is the fatherland of capitalism, where money is the mother tongue and where power is wielded by the dictatorship of the market."
"The government oversees all and, as the writer of the rules, has become satanised: there are no legal barriers or ethical restrictions when it comes to the lust for mad money."
"There they had the most colossal growth boom in economic history, which was consumption without saving, and the United States became the world's biggest debtor."
"Then the China Syndrome-like reactor that is Wall Street suffered a meltdown and the system was suddenly full of toxic securities and radioactive debt."
"They are killing off the sick banks that have suffered the excesses of speculation."
"Whereas the speculator's profits were once privatised, now the losses are being socialised, and private debt is being replaced with public debt."
"The markets were free, and nothing and no one protected capitalism from itself, the totalitarianism of money."
"The investment banks were like a swarm of locusts in an open field."
"The value of currency trading in the markets is 125 times the practical value of the money itself."
"Most of the loose cash is virtual 'funny' money, which is now returning to the banks' balance sheets as a series of write-offs."
"It is a threat to the credit recession: there is a danger that the debt and bank crisis will become an all-embracing economic crisis, manifesting itself in hunger, unemployment and poor social health."
"We know who the guilty ones are: the number of victims remains to be seen."
"Madam President, I should like to say to the Commissioner that now and in her coming work programme she will be dealing with the financial crisis."
"This crisis has hit different countries around Europe in different ways, but one thing is certain: the financial institutions in all countries have, to some degree or other, bought toxic US mortgage debt based on subprime lending."
"Do you know to what extent Europeans have bought devices such as CDOs, which had been represented to them as having a certain rating by the American rating companies, but which, in fact, on subsequent examination after they blew up, proved to be toxic bonds?"
"They were found to be dodgy projects."
"It seems to me that there must have been wholesale misrepresentation of the quality of the debt by these agencies for such a huge amount of it to have been sold so easily."
"I would like to know if the facts about the claims made when selling these devices have been examined yet by the Commission, and, if so, to what extent is it thought they have been misrepresented?"
"If this is the case, I would also like to know if the Commission thinks that there is any recourse in law against the rating agencies for those who have suffered from their negligence or worse, since at this stage our whole financial structure has been attacked by them."
"(DE) Madam President, the EU is currently enjoying increasing popularity and greater trust, as the nations and the public are seeking protection behind the walls of the EU, hoping that they are strong enough to combat the financial and economic crisis."
"Due to the size of the internal market and due to the euro, the Union has undoubtedly got a better chance of overcoming the crisis."
"However the Union also has obligations and it must fulfil its obligations to the sovereign and to the citizens, by protecting them from unbridled greed and the consequences of globalisation."
"A response to the crisis must not only consist of many billions of euros worth of loans for the automotive industry; small and medium-sized enterprises, which, after all, are the largest employers, must also be supported."
"On no account must the European workforce be condemned to unemployment in favour of a wave of 'blue card' skilled labour from third countries."
"Therefore it is the EU's responsibility to ensure that its citizens do not soon wake up to a Europe without the last remains of their national wealth, in a Europe of mass immigration."
"Madam President, things rarely happen at convenient times and any crisis, by definition, is going to be inconvenient."
"The financial and economic crises currently confronting us are unwelcome in themselves, but they also come in the closing months of the Parliament and the final year of the Commission, when all of us might normally be thinking of the next election and new appointments."
"This Commission work programme almost has the feel of a 'business as usual' exercise, yet the situation demands fresh thought on how to head off what threatens to be a deep recession."
"It presents Europe with a big challenge because most measures of fiscal policy need to be taken at national level, yet the EU has a crucial role of coordination."
"The magnitude of the challenges facing us makes that particularly important."
"In the field of energy, we have a pretty good idea of things that need to be done, but most of them are on a timescale well beyond the next year or two, so perhaps the only area where swift action - which could help - could be taken is in the field of energy efficiency measures."
"Specifically, allowing lower VAT for improvements in the energy efficiency of buildings and launching an information campaign to encourage a change in people's behaviour are two specific ways to help the situation."
"Beyond that, it seems to me that there will never be a better time to set up one of the EU's famous groups of wise people - and in this case I suggest it should be wise men and women - to reflect on the challenge we face and come up with original solutions beyond the short-term remedy of throwing money at tax giveaways."
"I hope that Council and Commission will give this idea a fair wind."
"Madam President, we are in the middle of a vicious circle now in the sense that, when the economy becomes negative, financial institutions get further losses on their balance sheets, which means that there will be further strains on the interbank market, which leads to further credit constraints, which leads to further negative growth."
"People will not be capable of understanding how we can use taxpayers' money to save the banks and not use taxpayers' money to create some jobs."
"That is why I would focus today on how to reassess this credit crunch, but also - and first and foremost - the recession we are in the middle of."
"As I see it we are at risk of negative growth next year in the European Union as such of -1% - not only -0.3%, but -1%."
"If we take that prospect - which is not unlikely - our aim and our duty are to avoid that recession. Minus one percent next year will correspond to a Growth and Stability Pact of more than -3%."
"My point is that we cannot save the Growth and Stability Pact by doing nothing."
"It will get worse if we do not do something."
"Now, what something can we do?"
"I know it is not easy."
"I know there is disagreement among governments, but I think that the Commission has a duty to try to bring all the governments together to get one easy job done."
"I know that in Berlin you are saying 'no thanks' to coordination because that means further expenditure from the German Government to other governments."
"I would say that you do not need to do that, dear friends in Berlin."
"We can do things together without having further expenditure from one government to others."
"It is about understanding that by investing at the same moment in time in the next couple of years you will have added value."
"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has made one simple calculation."
"Imagine that the G20, all of them, invest just 1% more of their GDP in jobs."
"If they do that simultaneously then there will be an extra percent for free."
"So what I am saying is that every government in Europe can make it, if they do it together."
"If every government in Europe were to invest 1% of their GDP to counteract the recession, were to do it intelligently, and were to do it socially for more and better jobs, caring for the most vulnerable groups, then they will have an extra percent for free."
"That is why I simply must appeal to the Commission, Vice-President Wallström, asking you to present one simple scenario showing what would happen if all our major governments were to do what I am saying here, showing that all of them will be better off, not only in jobs, but also in public budgets and also in the Growth and Stability Pact."
"It is a simple exercise."
"If you do not have the instruments, I have."
"I would willingly advise you how to do it."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, the crisis is going to have a dramatic effect on the future of the euro."
"Denmark and Sweden should become members before they expected, and in Britain, too, it is time for the debate to begin."
"In 1997 Mr Brown established five famous so-called tests before we could adjudge sterling's accession to the single currency."
"Suddenly, in this crisis, all these five are met."
"The pound has fallen to a competitive exchange-rate level, labour markets are flexible, the City, once so proud, now risks being pushed aside by stronger supervision and regulation inside the euro zone, and the economic cycles of Britain and the euro zone are now completely in sync as we plunge into recession at the same time."
"Mr Brown's cleverly disguised appearance at the Paris Eurogroup summit was a notable achievement of the French presidency."
"I appeal to Mr Brown to now change the terms of the debate inside the United Kingdom."
"If he fails to achieve that, the pound will be like a permanent ping-pong ball, bouncing in an uncontrolled manner between the big footballs of the euro and the dollar."
"- (SK) As a Slovak MEP I appreciate very much the entry of Slovakia into the euro area."
"We have here clear evidence that predictions and visions from experienced economists often do not come to fruition."
"Sixteen years ago European forecasters and economists rejected the idea of an independent, viable Slovak Republic."
"Slovakia is currently the leader of the twelve new Member States in terms of economic performance."
"I recommend that the European Commission should focus directly on citizens and their needs, instead of producing economically worthless forecasts when setting its priorities."
"I am thinking here mainly of health and of high-quality social conditions for a decent standard of living."
"At a time of economic stress and social pressure we must not forget people's health."
"The free movement of people within the European Union is not backed up by access to healthcare, especially not in the area of prevention."
"Another area is the need to secure the effective implementation of cross-border patient care."
"A healthy Union cannot exist without healthy citizens."
"(ES) Madam President, it is clear that the Commission's work programme for 2009 in the area of foreign policy, as in all other areas, is indissociable from the international financial crisis, as the Commission President, Mr Barroso, has told us."
"By this we understand that it is right to support reform of the Bretton Woods institutions, encourage the resumption of conversations on the World Trade Organization and closely follow the attempts to reform the United Nations system and bodies which will begin in February."
"It is also clear, Madam President, that we must establish a new relationship with the incoming administration in the United States, a country with which we agree on many issues, but also disagree on others, such as the death penalty, the International Criminal Court and the Kyoto Protocol in particular."
"We must agree positions on the next Copenhagen Summit, the laws with extraterritorial effect and other aspects."
"It is also important to agree positions on the Central Asia issues: the nuclear crisis in Iran, the announcement of a calm and responsible withdrawal from Iraq, and the US administration's request for an increased western presence in Afghanistan."
"We must also look at how the breakdown in negotiations in the Middle East can be resolved."
"Talking about the American continent, Madam President, it is vital to support the efforts of the Commission, and Commissioner Benita Ferrero in particular, to conclude association agreements with Central America, and especially the new direction to be taken in the negotiations with the Andean Community."
"Further to the strategic association which the European Commission has initiated with Brazil and Mexico, this process could perhaps also form the approach to be taken in the negotiations on the Mercosur agreement, which have been stalled for too long."
"On our continent, Madam President, we must drive forward the association agreement with Russia, but only on the basis of respect for international law."
"In this context, we must very clearly emphasise respect for borders and human rights, develop the neighbourhood policy and, at the same time, promote association and stabilisation agreements."
"As stated by the Commission President, it is clear that we have much to do with regard to the situation in Africa."
"Madam President, I feel it is very important, once the reform (through the Lisbon Treaty) and enlargement processes have been completed, for the European Union to adopt or rather resume a basically geographical status, taking into account that, between now and the year 2050, China and India will absorb 50% of the world's gross domestic product, as previously happened in around 1800."
"To this end, Madam President, advance planning is needed and I can say, Madam Vice-President, that our political Group will support the Commission in this work."
"- (FR) Madam President, with regard to the G20, I believe that the European Union went to that summit with good proposals."
"When one reads the conclusions of the summit, they seem to be somewhat lacking in bite."
"How are we going to deal with the issues of rating agencies, hedge funds and tax havens?"
"Good intentions abound, but if we rely entirely on self-regulation and codes of conduct, we shall not succeed."
"Let us be realistic and ambitious."
"As far as the representation of the European Union is concerned, the picture, quite frankly, was less flattering."
"We need to make progress."
"This is something that the large Member States must recognise, but so must the small ones, which sometimes provide the heads of IMF (International Monetary Fund) departments and have no wish to relinquish these positions."
"Every country must play its part so that we can improve the future representation of the European Union."
"With regard to the real economy, I heard what President Barroso said, and I was quite surprised."
"In his view, when the Commission exercises its right of initiative, it is engaging in populism."
"This being the case, I invite the Commission to adopt the proposals made by my colleague Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, even though it might regard them as populist."
"The fact is that, if we take no action in the realm of the real economy, we shall experience the same collapse and adopt the same strategy for economic recovery that Ireland has launched to rescue its banking sector, an 'every man for himself' strategy which, at a time of global crisis in a globalised economy, cannot possibly succeed."
"That would be a waste of public money and would not in any way help the European Union to catch up with the United States, which has already devised a large-scale recovery plan."
"We must think European, we must think global, and our national action must be concerted and coordinated, with scope for the Commission to take initiatives."
"That is what we expect from its communication of 26 November."
"We expect an ambitious European recovery plan."
"Madam President, a crisis should not only be a time for action but also for reflection."
"Getting the climate package together will not only save the climate - saving us from disasters and epidemics and avoiding costs - but is also the best preparation for times to come."
"In a recession we must prepare for the time afterwards and for new markets."
"I think that there is a danger today of us throwing good money after bad."
"When we are over this, will consumers really want to buy a big high-consumption car, or will they want a small, smart car?"
"I once had a professor in my student days who said: 'when in doubt, leave it out'."
"What we need instead is a green new deal for investments, innovation research and energy smart technology, including in cars."
"We need a green new deal for new jobs and new wealth in a sustainable way."
"The ALDE Group will work for an open, green, safe and entrepreneurial Europe, and in these areas we will support the Commission's work programme."
"(DE) Madam President, Madam Vice-President, today I would like to talk about internal security and the work programme."
"However, before I do this I would like to mention another issue."
"We spend all our time talking about the banks."
"A few weeks ago in my local area, a large company with 2 000 employees filed for bankruptcy and the employees are facing ruin because the banks are cutting back the lines of credit."
"This shows that the crisis is already hitting the real economy in no uncertain terms and therefore I propose to the Commission that we take a look at one of the responses and investigate the law on subsidies, which we are now abandoning as far as the banks are concerned and that suddenly has no effect any more, and change it in light of the present crisis."
"In this way we can also help the medium-sized enterprises."
"However, the main topic I want to discuss concerns the Commission's work programme and the subject of internal security."
"On reading the programme I was disappointed, because in addition to the economic issues there are also other major challenges."
"I can see that enormous achievements have been made with the Schengen Information System (SIS)."
"Switzerland is now joining, and even before joining, it has reported significant successes due to access to the SIS."
"Nevertheless, the programme does not seem to explain how the Commission wants to finally get SIS II up and running."
"It is delayed month after month and no progress is made."
"We are also not making any progress in the second area which is of extreme importance with respect to police cooperation, namely the fight against organised crime and practical cooperation between police organisations."
"We are lacking a clear legal framework."
"Unfortunately, I have also found nothing on this subject in the work programme for 2009."
"I should like to see more commitment in this area."
"Thirdly, migration, the migration network, immigration and the blue card, which we will discuss tomorrow, are described in the programme."
"The general public would go along with increased openness for immigration if we explain to them clearly that we are fighting against illegal immigration and that we will also bring an end to this illegal immigration."
"This is one of the interconnections that we must not overlook."
"(SV) Madam President, Commissioner, it is good to have a joint debate about the economic crisis, the downturn in the real economy and the Commission's work programme."
"These issues belong together."
"It is also good that the Commission is proposing coordinated efforts."
"However, in my opinion, this is not so clearly reflected in the work programme."
"Voices have been heard within the Council to the effect that we should now cut down on environmental investments and our ambitions relating to the environment."
"I totally disagree with this view."
"Nor do I share the view, as expressed by a number of others, that we must now cut back in the social area."
"In fact we must do the opposite."
"What we need is investment in research and development, new environmental technology and a new infrastructure that is much more environmentally friendly than the infrastructure we have today."
"We must train the workforce and ensure that young people get the right training so that we maintain our competitiveness, but also strengthen individuals for the future."
"If I then turn to the work programme and look at the social area, I can see that this is not a Commission that has prioritised the social area."
"Allow me to give two examples."
"We have listened to Mr Rasmussen; now I think we in the social area should also be heard."
"The report that I was responsible for dealt with equal treatment on the labour market within the EU and the right to take industrial action for equal treatment."
"The Commission must now respond to this with concrete measures for equal treatment on the labour market in the EU by amending the Posting of Workers Directive and by means of a social protocol."
"That is the first issue."
"The second is what is happening in the area of the working environment, where we are seeing an increase in the number of accidents throughout the EU, at least in certain Member States, because we are giving this area lower priority."
"This is also something that the Commission must respond to so that we tie together long-term sustainable development, that is to say economic, environmentally-friendly and social development."
"Madam President, I want to talk from the perspective of the Committee on the Internal Market about what is going on in the real economy."
"I went to see some small businesses two weeks ago - successful companies supplying aerospace, automotive, energy industries."
"Their problem is that they have taken on lots of skilled people but their order book has slowed down or, in some places, collapsed."
"They are the people that we need to be thinking about because if they are not there after this recession, if those skills are not there, then we are in serious difficulty."
"These are the companies that we want to invest in new products, in new services, to develop and train those staff that are there."
"So I say to the Commission that small businesses are going to be the engines of job re-creation."
"We have a Small Business Act going through here now."
"The implementation of it is probably in this rather long and tedious document somewhere, but surely you, the Commission, should be looking at the real priorities for bringing in some of the things that we have worked on here that will actually help the real economy."
"That is where your priorities lie."
"I do not get any sense that this is a real response to the crisis at all."
"There are some nice words at the front here but I do not see the programme as changed."
"So my message to you, Mrs Wallström - and I hope you will take it back to President Barroso - is that this is not good enough."
"And, we need real action on the things that are going to make real differences to jobs out there now and in the future."
"Of course, the other people who can help us are those public investors, the people who are keeping and sustaining projects and construction, sustainable building, buying greener vehicles and particularly investing in the next generation of telecom networks."
"I will just conclude on this crucial point."
"Next week the Council (and I am sorry the minister is no longer here) will have the opportunity to sign off a common position on the Telecoms package that will pave the way for that investment."
"We hear that some Commissioners are not keen on that."
"Well, I hope you will tell them that it is crucial for the future of the European economy that that package is approved by the Council next Friday."
"(NL) Madam President, I should like to make a preliminary observation."
"It is true, as has been said by many people, that Europe should play a greater role on the world stage, but Europe should also speak much more with one voice rather than it being fragmented as it is at the moment."
"The large Member States will need to conform and recognise that we now have to show a united European front."
"After all, the leading role in regulation, re-regulation, supervision and the improvement of the financial markets is not the brainchild of Gordon Brown or Nicolas Sarkozy, but the European institutions."
"We in Europe should now defend what has been set out."
"Apart from the agenda for the financial markets, all attention should now go to the economic crisis we are facing."
"All the alarm bells are ringing."
"Here too, while we should act internationally, we in Europe should also act in a more European manner, with a European rescue plan."
"This should not just be more of the same; we would like to see a real U-turn."
"The Brueghel economists have really lost their faith and now plead in favour of more spending."
"Reserve should turn into thought-provoking policy."
"In my view, what they propose, this one percentage point, is far too little and we will not get there with the 1% reduction in VAT they proposed, because the figures of the decline are much bigger."
"In the Netherlands, for example, the building industry is facing a 20% decline, so I think that we should apply the low VAT rate there to ensure that the housing market across Europe receives a shot in the arm."
"(NL) Madam President, Commissioner, as coordinator of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats for regional policy, I want to help find solutions in a very proactive manner."
"Europe should indeed come up with an action plan now."
"I endorse Mr Barroso's position in this respect."
"Investment through the Structural and Cohesion Funds - with EUR 60 billion a year from Europe, doubled to EUR 120 billion by the Member States - would make it possible to be active and more flexible and to gather speed."
"This concerns specific investments, both through the Lisbon Strategy in terms of knowledge and through the Gothenburg Strategy in terms of energy and ecology."
"It is about jobs, as ever."
"It is about retraining people who have lost their jobs so that they can find their way in the new economy."
"Only with this attitude and with people who have sound qualifications can we, after the crisis, look forward to the future again."
"The programme as it stands needs to be finely tuned in a number of areas."
"For example, the 2007-2013 regulations can become more flexible."
"Funds can be transferred within the operational programmes in the Member States themselves."
"Funds that have not yet been allocated - and these involve quite large sums - can be spent more quickly."
"We can translate the position adopted by Parliament, namely to use funds not yet allocated under the n+1, n+2 and n+3 rules in the current period, as well as possibly funds left over from the previous period, into action."
"We would ask the European Commission - and I know that Mrs Hübner is on the case - to draft an amendment package to demonstrate our dynamism to the public before next year's elections."
"We are eagerly awaiting these proposals and would urge you to react promptly."
"Congratulations to the Commission so far, but more efforts will need to be made in future, something which Parliament is prepared to do."
"(ES) Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the G20 Summit has set a very ambitious agenda, which is simply to ensure that financial globalisation is subject to rules."
"In Europe this means learning from our experiences and taking advantage of the lessons of capitalism which is an interest-based system in which, without rules, if you are too greedy, you can end up with nothing."
"The Commission President has raised certain issues with us so as not to give in to populism, but there are things that can be done."
"Mad cow disease taught us that you cannot sell harmful and rotten products in supermarkets or butchers' shops and that there must be rules."
"In Europe we can do things if we learn from our mistakes, as has happened in my country."
"For example, we could decide that the banks, building societies and financial institutions must establish funds for times of crisis or also, Madam President, that off-balance-sheet transactions and unproven securitisation processes are prohibited."
"This would be a step towards the prudent management that financial institutions should practise and that we have still not achieved in Europe."
"I believe that the Commission would do well to also work in this area."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the face of the financial crisis, enormous amounts of money are suddenly being freed up, including sums to ease the economic crisis."
"If I understand my colleagues correctly, we all also want to ensure that this money can flow."
"I would like to tell the Commission, at this early stage, that we expect it to do its job."
"This means that the issue of regulating this money remains on the agenda."
"Therefore it is not possible for us to be satisfied with the work programme that the Commission has submitted for 2009."
"We are disappointed that this aspect of your work has not been the central focus."
"The Barroso Commission has achieved a lot with respect to this issue but it also makes it clear to us that it does not consider the subject important for 2009."
"I would like to advise you against this."
"We are also disappointed that the Anti-Fraud Office is not being better equipped with a new legal basis."
"There is a risk that the Council will reach a deadlock as the 27 Member States can no longer come to an agreement on the subject of combating fraud."
"We also have expectations of the Commission in this regard, expectations which, after reading the work programme, do not seem to have been fulfilled."
"We are also disappointed not to find more detailed information on the national statements."
"If we are exercising more freedom for expenditure on the one hand, we must also make sure that the Member States are subject to appropriate obligations."
"What I do not understand is that the Barroso Commission does not want to develop and demonstrate its greatest success: the disclosure of the recipients of subsidies."
"Why are you not using this to disclose how EU money is being spent?"
"Why are you not analysing whether we are actually achieving our political goals using the information gained from this data?"
"I believe that we are right to have high expectations of you, that we should expect more than has been presented in the legislative and work programme."
"However, you should definitely use our critical solidarity and our questions for further development."
"(EL) Madam President, prime ministers in the midst of a crisis should be jointly planning their social, not just their economic interventions."
"Obviously the banks had to be saved, but Europe should already be focusing on directly rescuing people on low and average incomes and stimulating employment and social cohesion."
"The social state and social cohesion cannot be at the tail end of open and uncontrolled markets or of the economic policy of Europe, a survival bait that we throw to all those who are foundering in times of crisis."
"On the contrary, they are the core of European economic growth and that is how they should be treated."
"Secondly, in order to achieve this, we need to urgently adjust the terms of the Stability Pact; we need a new social Maastricht, a sustainable pact for growth, employment and social protection based on strict rules and preconditions."
"Thirdly, Europe should be at the global vanguard of innovation and new technologies by investing capital in education and research into green development; this is, of course, something which will mean a huge increase in the European budget."
"We need at long last to move forward."
"Sun, wind and water will be the oil of the future."
"Whoever makes early use of them will create millions of jobs for their citizens and a prosperous society."
"If Europe gets left behind, as some people are saying now, the America of Barack Obama, whose election we are all hailing, will take the lead and we shall lose out."
"Fourthly, we need new market transparency, control and supervision rules."
"The current system which caused the crisis, in which profits are reaped by a few private individuals and society as a whole bears the losses, will result in new crises."
"Madam President, at a time when the world is seeing the most important financial crisis that has ever hit us, we are looking at a failure so far on the Doha Round."
"It is of crucial importance."
"I have just spoken to Baroness Ashton - or Commissioner Ashton as she is now - and I do believe that she is taking us forward in a progressive and futuristic way."
"The financial crisis has to be underlined, as has the need to deepen Europe's relationships with its key partners, including the new US Administration, but probably more importantly when the Director-General, Pascal Lamy, is up for so-called re-election - we will see whether or not he gets the post, but there is a good chance that he will."
"We need more action and less rhetoric in this."
"Brown has called for leaders to avoid putting up barriers to trade and investment during the times of economic crisis."
"This is crucial to the WTO negotiations."
"The EU must not be Dickensian in its approach to the way in which we approach trade."
"We must open our barriers."
"We must not put in place trade defence instruments."
"Reform is only going to be successful on the grounds of a free market principle."
"That includes, as I say, open trade and investment."
"Last week Pascal Lamy met with the G20 to work with a proposal that will see a possibility of a settlement coming up in the short term."
"We hope to see something even before Christmas."
"That is the way the Commission sees it at the moment."
"I congratulate the previous Commissioner and the present Commissioner on their approach."
"The EU has led for the first time in the trade negotiations and must be congratulated."
"(PL) Madam President, the informal meeting of the European Council and the G20 summit in Washington attempted to respond to the most important current challenge: the financial crisis which, without a doubt, represents a defeat for neo-liberal economic theories."
"The declarations issued by those meetings resemble nothing so much as closing the stable door after the horse has bolted, and I was sorry to hear Mr Barroso say that it was only the crisis that has changed their thinking."
"They have failed to address the burning issues of how to arrest the recession, how to create new jobs and, finally, how to combat climate change without incurring unnecessary economic costs."
"European Socialists have long since been calling for a reform of financial markets and for coordinated action by European Union governments."
"It is my view that we cannot concentrate just on financial markets, where financial institutions and greedy managers have brought about the present situation."
"We must protect our citizens against food, energy and rent price rises so as to maintain their real income levels and thus to protect their purchasing power: the consumer demand which, together with investments and exports, has such a significant impact on economic growth in the European Union."
"We must also protect the profitability of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"If the climate and energy package is retained in its present form, especially where the emissions trading scheme and the demands on power plants and heavy industry are concerned, I must warn that in Poland and in other new Member States this will lead to considerable costs and above all a tremendous increase in energy prices."
"Fighting climate change is a legitimate objective, but the battle cannot be fought by means which will quickly lead to another crisis, when we have not yet managed to overcome this one."
"(ES) Madam President, as regards the plans for the fisheries policy, certain proposals that we have been waiting for have been so long coming that what we now need is a fixed work programme allowing us to determine with greater certainty those issues that will come before us in this parliamentary term."
"Despite our requests in this respect, and aside from the reform of the monitoring policy which has just been presented, we have so far been unable to obtain any better idea of what is to come."
"The Commission document tells us that one of the priorities will be the presentation of the Green Paper on the reform of the common fisheries policy."
"However, in reality, this simply represents the start of a debate which will not end until 2012."
"The promised reform of the common organisation of the markets also appears in the communication, but we are again unsure whether this will reach us in the first half of 2009."
"I want to point out that there is a whole series of issues which, either because of international commitments, such as fisheries agreements, or multilateral obligations, such as the need to transpose the recommendations of the regional fisheries organisations into Community law, should appear in the legislative programme."
"There are also other issues, such as the future of European aquaculture or the proposal on discards which appears and disappears like a ghost from the Commission's work programmes, which we believe should also become priority issues, given the importance attributed to them by both the sector and this Parliament."
"We therefore hope, Madam President, that an amended work programme for 2009 will be presented as soon as possible, taking into account these repeated requests from the European Parliament."
"(DE) Madam President, those that are weakest economically are always the ones to suffer the most in times of financial crisis."
"Incomprehensible financial services products, the quality of which were no longer assessed by rating agencies, lack of transparency and the erroneous belief that the market regulates itself only added to the casino mentality."
"Unfortunately, the Commission also vehemently refused to consider legislative regulatory measures for the financial market and showed itself to be totally resistant to advice from the European Parliament."
"However, the task we now face is to put this behind us and to learn political lessons from it."
"Employees who are losing their jobs now, and who have to accept substantial losses to their pensions due to the high-risk investments of their pension funds, will have to bear the costs in several ways."
"The priorities now, after and in the light of the analysis of the situation, are the introduction of an emergency plan, better control mechanisms and damage limitation, as well as securing access to loans for emerging economies and developing countries, in order to be able to create sustainable growth once again."
"Just as important is that the principal sceptics with respect to the necessity for a larger EU budget must have now understood that we have to set up a stronger tool as a precautionary measure in order to be able to deal with crises more effectively."
"Madam President, I would just like to make a small and medium-sized intervention on my favourite subject of SMEs."
"I was delighted that Commission President Barroso made many remarks about SMEs in his opening comments."
"But if I have a concern, it is a concern that he talks words - as one has to when one talks - but we have not yet seen enough action - a comment that Malcolm Harbour made earlier on today."
"I notice that in section 3 of your Legislative and Work Programme for 2009, a very important section entitled 'Better regulation - delivery on promises and change of regulatory culture', there is a comment that 'a simpler and better regulatory environment without unnecessary administrative burdens will, therefore, remain a key component of the Commission's legislative work'."
"With due respect, Commissioners - and I speak as a great fan and supporter of the Commission in this regard - I have not yet seen evidence of this being in this legislative programme."
"There is a lot of talk of that: yes, we will do it, we will reduce by 25% - but where is the beef?"
"Where is the reduction?"
"We have not yet seen it."
"So, going back to the heading 'Better regulation - delivery on promises', if there is one word that you remember for this legislative programme, Commissioners, that word must please be 'delivery'."
"My final thought is that I do recognise that changing culture takes time and also, speaking as the coordinator for employment and social affairs for the PPE-DE Group, I do realise that the committee on which I have the great good fortune to sit is not always the greatest ally in the cause of better and simplified regulation."
"But I have to suffer in this committee, and my invitation is that one of you should come and suffer too - if only briefly - because we may be part of the problem."
"But if we could somehow create a new precedent that, ideally, the Commission President would come and address our committee, maybe that would help make our committee help your work, and we could then become part of the solution."
"(DE) Madam President, I would like to address one issue that until now has not been addressed very often, namely the role of the state."
"We can see that integration into the global economy also means that we have to increasingly learn that the state has to integrate internationally and globally, so that it is at all capable of interceding and exercising the necessary controls."
"I think that the European Union has an excellent opportunity to take on this role."
"We can see that more and more trust is being placed in it."
"We should do everything we can to show that this trust is justified."
"This includes the European Union examining its legislation once again."
"I can see Commissioner McCreevy sitting there."
"I would advise him with great urgency to approach the Volkswagen Law in a different way to what he has planned."
"This would be a significant signal that he has understood the sign of the times."
"I would also like to express my support for Mrs Gräßle."
"She is absolutely right that we have to be much more stringent with the control measures and I wish that the European Union also understood how to organise itself on an international level."
"Why not approach the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund with a single voice?"
"It works wonderfully with the World Trade Organization, but we have not learnt how to do this in another sphere."
"I also hope that you will all give your support to making G20 an organisation that will continue for a long time."
"Madam President, I think lots of things have been said about the financial crisis but it is very important to have one viewpoint."
"We are too self-critical at the moment in this Parliament and also too self-critical vis-à-vis the EU institutions."
"Let us not forget that we have had a very radical overhaul of our financial services legislation during the last eight years."
"We have proper laws."
"We have proper regulations and the supervisory system has also been improved."
"Of course we could not avoid the crisis, but we were not the birthplace of this crisis: it was born in America."
"It was born in the United States because of their lack of regulation, their lack of supervision and their lack of proper implementation."
"We should avoid over-reacting in Europe."
"This is not the proper time to give in, having good impact assessments and a better regulation agenda, as Mr Bushill-Matthews just said."
"This is the perfect time to have well-targeted, well-prepared proposals and take them through."
"If we react incorrectly it might have serious consequences."
"It might even bring a more serious crisis upon us."
"For example, if we accept legislation which makes it more difficult for financial markets to recover, it is not to the benefit of European citizens."
"We should now take it coolly and we should try to avoid improper, ill-targeted and ill-prepared legislation and not be too self-critical. The Commission should be thanked for bringing through this very important change in European legislation and supervisory regime."
"Madam President, we are in the midst of a deep financial crisis that is unique from very many perspectives."
"It is unique because it is the first global financial crisis we have seen and we are also in a recession in the world economy."
"But it might be good to have some sort of perspective on the events and the developments we are going through, because we have also seen 25 years of unprecedented and unique global economic growth that has made it possible for more than two billion people to leave poverty."
"I must say I have heard very little of this from that part of the Chamber here tonight when they are saying that the open economy has failed."
"Is it a failure that two billion people have left poverty?"
"Of course not."
"But we do see a new structure in the global economy today, and the fact that the meeting in Washington was a G20 meeting and not a G7 meeting is an expression of the new reality we are living in."
"I think that is good, because the whole dominance of the transatlantic economy is not there any more."
"In general, that is a good thing because it means that other parts of the world have been able to develop prosperity."
"It has, during this period, created imbalances: huge surpluses in countries such as China, and huge deficits in countries such as the US, coupled with a unique and artificially low interest rate in the US economy which has increased the credit volume more than ever."
"It is interesting to note that we have had the same debate in this Chamber with colleagues from that side calling for lowering interest rates even further."
"Had we done so, the problems in Europe would have been even bigger than they are."
"Now we need to see to it that we can restructure and recover the global economy, and I think that the European Union has an important and crucial role to play in that."
"We need to make sure that we do what was said at the Washington meeting, secure free trade and open markets and say 'no' to protectionism, because that would hinder recovery more than anything else."
"We need to make sure that the regulatory framework of the global financial markets catches up with the reality of how the world economy looks today."
"That is our task, and we must take a lead in that and develop prosperity even more."
"Madam President, there is a grave danger of rushing to excessive misguided regulation and to unintended consequences."
"An example in the new capital requirements directive is the proposed 5% retention of securitisation proceeds."
"This will only clog up credit creation."
"Lack of securitisation possibilities is the principal reason that credit has dried up now. We need the banks to lend but no, this misguided principle, which lacks an impact assessment, will prevent a restart of securitisation and the credit which our business and industry so badly needs."
"Ask the motor car industry how it will prosper if securitisation is snuffed out."
"That is only one example."
"If we suspend true and fair accounting, if we go out of our way to kill hedge funds and private equity and incentives to innovators, risk-takers and even bankers, as Mr Schulz and the Socialists require, we will only delay and kill altogether that recovery."
"Madam President, a number of speakers here - including my colleague, Brian Crowley, from Ireland - have blamed the bankers for acting like bankers, maximising short-term profits to the limits of the law."
"This crisis was allowed to develop because governments everywhere abandoned their responsibility to sufficiently govern the economy, including banks."
"Most of those in power have ignored history and accepted the ideological mumbo-jumbo which we have just heard now from the last three speakers that the market is a self-balancing natural phenomenon and government has no role in interfering with it."
"The fact is that Adam Smith's invisible hand is a pickpocket."
"The pockets that are being picked are the pockets of working people who are losing their jobs, families who are losing their homes, and those who are poor already and who are losing their savings and pensions."
"It is not bankers and right-wing politicians who are losing."
"This will happen again unless we clearly define a new economic framework which enables us to ensure that banks and industries serve society and enable governments to govern in the public interest."
"Madam President, I think Adam Smith has been very successful, especially in Ireland!"
"I think we are aware of the consequences there."
"(SV) Madam President, Commissioner, I think it is important that, through the G20 summit, the EU and the world have taken action and have said they are willing to continue to act together."
"This is something new in world politics."
"A European and global system for supervision represents further important steps."
"Let us then ensure that we create flexible rules for the future, not in order to solve yesterday's problems."
"I would like, in all humility, to issue three warnings: a warning against over-regulation, which could slow down the world economy even further; a warning against too large a state aid package to rescue industries in crisis - we have a few examples at home in Sweden, as the Commissioner knows very well - and a warning against protectionism and closed borders."
"We must not fall into the same sort of crisis we had in the 1930s."
"- (FR) Madam President, I shall address myself to the Commission because the representative of the Council is no longer here."
"I truly believe that Mr Barroso's proposals will not resolve the current crisis, because he has forgotten one factor, namely the causes of this crisis."
"These are our production-driven system and our concept of development, which destroy and exploit the planet and its people."
"The crisis is not over;"
"I believe we must be aware of that."
"Indeed, I think it is only beginning; our society has been sent reeling, and there is far more to come."
"As I see it, while the leaders of this world, with its globalised economy, are failing to recognise the need to change course, our fellow citizens, for their part, are unable to understand how billions of euros can be found to bail out banks today and the motor industry tomorrow at a time when the content of housewives' shopping baskets is being steadily whittled away."
"You propose economic recovery measures, but if it is the same thing that has been tried over these past years and has led to chaos, you are on the wrong track."
"I believe we really must reduce our ecological footprint."
"That is the issue."
"How do you intend to resolve it?"
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Madam President, we talk sometimes about grand designs and great plans and ambition."
"I was touched recently by the words of the Canadian finance minister who spoke about being boring, unexciting and prudent."
"I suggest that maybe we look carefully at what he had to say, because he said that good regulation begins at home and before we start looking at the world we need to look at ourselves - although I am inclined to the view that excessive regulation is as bad as none whatsoever."
"Therefore, we need to be very balanced in this."
"But, whatever we do, there are people now in business, on farms and in households who cannot get small amounts of credit to keep themselves going."
"I was on a farm in Ireland recently and they could not renew their EUR 25 000 overdraft."
"This is a really serious problem and we need to address it."
"On the work programme, we will have the budget review, the implementation of the health check and review of fisheries."
"It will be a busy year and I wish you luck."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, thank you for all these interesting interventions."
"Maybe this is another mission impossible to try to collect and respond in a satisfactory way to all Members' different views on the legislative and work programme."
"They range from GMOs, as we heard, through fish to the WTO and the whole financial crisis."
"So I might not have the time or the possibility to respond in a fully satisfactory way to all your detailed questions."
"I would first of all say that there has been nothing like 'business as usual' since we entered this crisis."
"By my side you see my colleague responsible also for much of the response, as well as Mr McCreevy behind us here, and they will know better than anyone else that we have had to work on this from the very first moment."
"I would also say the Commission has responded to the financial crisis with unusual speed."
"I remember that in the past we congratulated ourselves on responding within three months to one of the oil spills that we had and we thought that that was a kind of record, but this time we actually managed in 24 hours to get proposals on the table and to adopt important proposals."
"So I think that there has been nothing like business as usual and we will not see anything like business as usual from now on."
"We have to continue to respond to a recession that we have already seen the beginning of."
"So that is absolutely clear."
"I also think that all your interventions have illustrated the need to get the balance right."
"To get the balance right in terms of environmental concerns as well as the social issues - all of these have to be covered."
"But why do you believe that what you find in the strategic initiatives like the report on the Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs and proposals beyond 2010, a European framework for recovery, financial markets for the future package supervision, will not contain the social issues and cover the whole sustainability criteria?"
"Of course it has to reflect that balance, and that is what we will work on, as well, in completing it with the very detailed proposals that will have to come on-stream from now on."
"So that balance, and also getting the balance right between regulation and letting the market work, is crucial to us and something that we are fully aware of."
"I think that this also will affect our credibility because it is only when we also fill out these strategic initiatives, the things we have listed as strategic and priority initiatives, with the very concrete follow-up and implementing measures that we gain credibility and that we can also continue to play a leading role within the G20 or in the IMF context or affecting the rest of the world on energy and climate as well; we will get this credibility from delivering what we have promised in this work programme."
"We have appreciated very much the dialogue that we have had for a long time now with the different committees in Parliament and the kind of overall political debate that we have engaged in and I want to thank you very much for that."
"I think that helps us to deliver."
"It helps us to also bring the right details to the lists of proposals."
"But, as you know and as is clear also from our work programme, this is a very peculiar time because it is a kind of transition, with a new Parliament, a new Commission; and, with the elections to Parliament coming up next spring, you have also asked us not to go on delivering when you can no longer receive it and do something meaningful with it."
"I must just mention one more thing, and that is SMEs, because several of you have mentioned the small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Of course they will be absolutely key to any success in dealing with the financial crisis, so we will deliver, we have already produced a SME business act and of course there is a follow-up, an implementation of the business act."
"The same is also true for the social package that we presented."
"Now it is a matter of the implementing measures."
"So if you do not find every proposal in every area in this particular proposal, that does not mean that we have stopped working on it or that we will not come back with detailed proposals, but the balance is absolutely crucial."
"And when we speak with one voice, it helps if we have one message as well or a coordinated message in everything we do and I think that will remain crucial for all of us."
"Let me finally say that in this Legislative and Work Programme you will see that we have for the first time identified communication priorities and since this is my portfolio I want to underline this and remind you all that we proposed four items to become joint communication priorities for next year: the EP elections of course, energy and climate change, the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall and growth, jobs and solidarity, meaning that the package also covers fighting the financial crisis."
"We are already working together to prepare work on these priorities and I can assure you that we will contribute to the work that Parliament is doing in preparing for the elections; tomorrow I will talk to your Bureau's working group on communication to see how we can help and support and back Parliament's work plans for communicating the EP elections."
"So that will be very important work for us."
"If we want to keep credibility and legitimacy, we have to mobilise voters to make sure that they cast their vote in June next year."
"With a combination of good policies and good communication I think we can actually face the difficult year ahead with at least a little confidence, and if we work together, the confidence will be even greater."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote on motions for resolutions on the Commission's legislative and work programme for 2009 will take place during the December session in Strasbourg."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (PL) The recent Washington summit was basically the start of a process to which national leaders must become committed in order to minimise the impact of the global financial crisis."
"In an era of globalisation, when the economies of individual countries are closely interlinked, international cooperation aimed at arresting the crisis must be a priority."
"What I have in mind is not only a common EU position on many issues, but also specific joint action and practical intervention aimed at mitigating the effects of the financial crisis."
"Experts maintain that the Polish economy is one of the few that will be able to withstand a possible economic depression, though no one can predict the scale that the crisis might reach globally."
"We must even now be prepared to introduce appropriate crisis prevention measures, with the governments of the various states playing a key role."
"Where necessary, they should offer capital support to financial institutions threatened with bankruptcy."
"Once again, may I emphasise the important role the state has to play in preventing a global crisis, through intervention in local financial markets."
"in writing. - In a way, this is a key part of solving the problem, for unless we can achieve a truly common stance in the EU, achieving effective global rules for the financial markets becomes wishful thinking."
"Sensible people would say that a massive failure of both regulation and oversight, as well as the flaws revealed in a highly simplistic economic philosophy, provide a clear answer as to what to do."
"Some still argue, however, that soft regulations should be the lynchpin of the new system."
"In my view, they are wrong - either if they genuinely think so, or are driven by parochial interests."
"The world has changed dramatically in the last couple of decades."
"The decline of a misleading paradigm (which equates free markets with no regulations) has to be seen in conjunction with a rising multipolar economic world in the attempt to forge a new international financial system."
"Arguably, the fate of an open world economic system hinges on the latter."
"I hope that the new American administration will be forthcoming in this respect, but we at home in Europe have to rise to the momentousness of this period."
"Some of our own bickering and inability to compromise serves as no good omen in this respect."
"in writing. - (HU) Our first task is to restore confidence on the financial markets, in order to prevent a further deepening of the crisis."
"From this perspective, politics bears enormous responsibility."
"Not only do we need rapid and confidence-building macro-solutions, but we need to prevent a similar financial crisis from occurring again."
"All this is not simply a minor hurdle for blind capitalism, as we have heard it said in recent times, but rather a marvellous opportunity to bring about a much more effective as well as legitimate financial and supervisory regulation."
"At last we can now humanise capitalism!"
"We must also be attentive to the fact that the crisis threatens not only banks and big business, but causes daily problems for citizens as well."
"We need a sustainable solution for addressing the crisis, and if this means we have to reshape the world, then we will have to make it much more just, humane and rational."
"There are regions in Europe where even before now life has seemed hopeless."
"Besides fixing the economy, we need to focus on concrete solutions for the most disadvantaged, that is to say, those who suffer and will suffer most from the effects of the crisis and who face the greatest economic and social hardships."
"If we do not do this, the average person will survive the crisis and grow again, but we will entrench destitution for a long time."
"The financial crisis has engulfed the whole world."
"In my view, this is an economic crisis, while finance, which normally greases the wheels of the economy, is truly in the grip of a typhoon."
"René Thom's catastrophe theory seems to have been validated."
"At the same time, its moral aspects need also to be noted, and this has been pointed out by many economists."
"At this point, let me quote Ettore Gotti Tedeschi: 'Is it consistent with logic and ethics to create an illusion of development based solely on the growth of private consumption, is it consistent with logic and ethics for the growth of consumption to be absorbing the growth of social costs (pensions and health services), thus provoking tax rises, is it consistent with logic and ethics to transform a society of savers into a society of debt-ridden consumers, and is it consistent with logic and ethics to force the globalised man to seek work far away from home?'"
"The cost of this lack of an ethical dimension will be high, because we are paying for greed and for risks taken with other people's money by irresponsible individuals who have created tax havens for themselves."
"It is the taxpayer, both in Europe and in America, who has to pay for this rapacity and dishonesty."
"We are becoming poorer."
"Banks are becoming less important in the economy which, producing less, needs fewer workers, and thus a domino effect is created."
"Today's markets need certainty and observance of rules."
"We need measures to shield the very poorest and at the same time to protect our assets from being bought up for next to nothing."
"At least several years will be needed for this emergency treatment to work."
"in writing. - (DE) A particularly welcome feature of the Commission's legislative and work programme are the measures planned to combat the economic crisis in Europe."
"Next year, European politics must manage to identify long-term prospects for the EU and, in cooperation with the general public, limit the adverse effects that the crisis in the financial market is having on the entire European economy."
"The effects of crises such as this are often only felt in the real economy at a later point in time."
"In addition to action taken by the individual states, Europe must introduce measures in order to keep the negative consequences to a minimum."
"The year 2009 will be decisive in the fight against climate change."
"Next year, Europe will have the chance to set itself up as a strong international partner in connection with environmental protection issues."
"Establishing the EU's negotiating position for the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen is not only a high priority as far as environmental issues are concerned, there are also interconnections to other political fields."
"The European Union can prove itself to be a pioneering force, not only with respect to the continent of Europe but also in connection with protecting the climate on a global basis."
"Nevertheless, next year we must ensure that ongoing work is not forgotten due to the important forthcoming initiatives."
"Even though the state of the common agricultural policy has been reviewed this year, the interests of the agricultural sector must continue to have high priority within European politics."
"in writing. - (EL) The credit crunch, this deep crisis in the capitalist system, is the current scourge of workers, exacerbating the problems of unemployment, undermining social insurance and pension systems and further reducing the income and standard of living of working class families."
"Capital and its political representatives are placing the burden of the credit crunch on the shoulders of workers and are attempting an all-out attack on workers' rights in order to safeguard their profitability."
"The Council and the Commission in their statements and the European Parliament are adopting the positions of capital and persisting with the same catastrophic economic and monetary policy by calling for faster capitalist restructurings and reforms at workers' expense."
"They support Economic and Monetary Union, the Maastricht Treaty and the four freedoms, the Stability Pact and the reduction in social spending within the framework of financial discipline."
"They are calling for stricter supervision of the Member States by the EU and they welcome and are strengthening its socially uncontrolled role in order to support capital more effectively."
"They are calling for faster and more faithful application of the anti-labour Lisbon Treaty and the general orientation of the economic policy of the EU."
"The experience of workers and the working class itself is leading them to rebut and counterattack the policy of barbarity."
"Question Time (Council)"
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0484/2008)."
"The following questions are addressed to the Council."
"Subject: Christians in Turkey: Mor Gabriel monastery"
"What is the Council's opinion of the situation of Christian minorities in Turkey, and in particular the current state of the dispute about the partial expropriation of the Mor Gabriel monastery in Eastern Turkey?"
"Madam President, may I reply to Mrs Harkin by telling her that the Council attaches great importance, as it has demonstrated on several occasions, to the question of religious freedom in Turkey."
"The specific case to which Mrs Harkin refers is still under examination by the Turkish courts, and it is not for me to comment at this stage, but we are monitoring this case very closely."
"In general terms, your question relates to religious freedom in Turkey."
"This is a very important subject, and there is an urgent need for Turkey to make progress and adopt concrete measures with a view to establishing a proper judicial framework."
"These matters are constantly being raised by the European Union in the context of its dialogue with Turkey and were specifically addressed at the last meeting of the EU-Turkey Association Council on 27 May 2008."
"On that occasion, while noting the Turkish Government's declared intention and renewed undertaking to pursue the reform process and tackle the existing shortcomings, the European Union emphasised the need for such undertakings to be translated quickly into effective concrete measures."
"Some advances are observable: Turkey has taken action, for example by adopting amendments to the law governing foundations in February 2008."
"Thanks to these amendments, the ban on foreigners establishing foundations in Turkey has been lifted, and the principle of reciprocity now applies."
"In spite of these commendable features of the law governing foundations, however, there is still a need to resolve the numerous difficulties that religious communities and minorities continue to experience, particularly as regards their legal status and, I must stress, their property rights."
"Accordingly, the question of religious freedom was raised once again in the framework of the political dialogue at the ministerial meeting in Brussels on 15 September, and the Council can assure Mrs Harkin that it will continue to monitor very closely the issue of religious freedom, including the implementation of the new law governing foundations, and that it will raise this matter with the Turkish authorities at every level at which it sees fit to do so."
"Unfortunately, I have just learned that Mr Posselt actually asked the question."
"That is not what I had on my sheet of paper, and I do apologise, Madam President."
"(DE) I am much obliged to the President-in-Office of the Council."
"That was my question."
"Thank you for the very good reply."
"France has traditionally had a long-standing connection with Christians in the Near and Middle East."
"I would like to ask an additional question."
"In addition to its religious function, Mor Gabriel is the cultural and economic centre of the Assyrian Christian minority in the region."
"What is the Council doing to protect this minority, whose existence is under threat?"
"What is the Council's stance on building churches - which continues to be very difficult in Turkey - as far as other Christian communities are concerned?"
"- (FR) Madam President, let me begin by offering my sincere apologies to Mr Posselt for my inadvertent error."
"I hope he did not take it personally."
"In answer to his question, we are extremely vigilant, as I said in my initial remarks, on the exercise of religious freedom in Turkey, as in other countries, and on the guarantees given by national authorities, especially with regard to minorities."
"In Turkey, as in some other countries, the minorities happen to be Christian, and, as Mr Posselt indicated, we are particularly watchful in these instances."
"The case of the Mor Gabriel monastery is pending, and we shall have to await the judgment regarding that monastery."
"As far as our dialogues with the Turkish authorities are concerned, as part of the negotiations on what we call the revised Accession Partnership for Turkey, it is very clear that everything relating to fundamental freedoms, to religious freedom, and to the need to take the measures required to establish a climate of tolerance in which full respect for religious freedom can be guaranteed, has been raised and is at the heart of our dialogue with the Turkish authorities."
"I should like to reaffirm that, Mr Posselt."
"(DE) Mr President-in-Office of the Council, problems with Christian churches are not restricted to Turkey itself, but are also to be found in the north-east of the divided island of Cyprus."
"Are discussions taking place on this issue at Council level and, in particular, are there any actions involving Turkey in order to ensure that it uses the influence that it undoubtedly has in this area in the correct way?"
"I would like to direct the Minister's attention to the sustained campaign against the very tiny Protestant community in Turkey, epitomised at present by the farcical trial which has been going on for some months of two young men - Turan Topal and Hakan Taştan - who have been on trial charged with insulting Turkishness."
"Their crime, apparently, is the practising of their religion."
"With such a view of freedom of religion, is it not clear that Turkey has a very long way to go indeed before it meets the basic standards of human rights and of freedom of religion?"
"- (FR) Madam President, in answer to Mr Rack's question, we are, of course, well aware of the strong Turkish influence on the northern part of Cyprus, and we shall raise these problems."
"As you know, a delegation of elected representatives from Northern Cyprus will be visiting the European Parliament on Thursday, and that will be an opportunity to express our deep concern about these matters."
"Let me reassure Mr Allister by telling him that we naturally monitor the fate of all confessions, and I thank him for reporting the case of these two young men from the Protestant community who have indeed been subjected to threats or aggression because of their religious beliefs."
"We shall therefore bring this point to the attention of the Turkish authorities, Mr Allister."
"Subject: New migratory pressures on Europe"
"In recent weeks an increase has been felt in the migratory pressure on the Mediterranean countries of the European Union."
"Is the Council considering new diplomatic measures or other types of action to help those countries hold back the fresh wave of illegal immigration currently affecting that area?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Madam President, in reply to Mr Ortega, if I am not mistaken, but you have already helped me with this, Madam President, the migratory policy that the European Union intends to implement is based on a principle of solidarity, solidarity between the Member States, especially those which would be subject to a strong migratory pressure, and solidarity with the countries of origin, to respond, in particular, to the underlying causes of poverty."
"This principle is at the basis of the global approach to migration defined by the European Council in December 2005."
"This global approach to migration aims to strengthen dialogue and cooperation with the migrants' countries of origin and transit."
"It intends that the dialogue with these countries will cover all the dimensions of migration, especially legal migration, the prevention of and fight against illegal migration, and also the link between migration and development."
"Subsequently, the European Council has constantly reaffirmed the necessity of pursuing this approach, intensifying it and making its implementation increasingly effective."
"It was in this spirit of cooperation between the countries of origin, transit and destination that the first EU-Africa Ministerial Conference on Migration and Development was organised in July 2006 in Rabat."
"A second Ministerial Conference on Migration and Development will be held in Paris on 25 November 2008."
"It will be invited to adopt an operational programme, which will last over several years and consist of a series of actions that the partners concerned with the migratory flow along the western African routes will be asked to implement, especially related to the prevention of and fight against illegal immigration and human trafficking."
"Border management, including reinforcement of the physical and human resources and operational cooperation with Frontex, is also an area of primary importance in the dialogue and operational cooperation with third countries, especially those on the Mediterranean rim."
"Thus, for example, the Joint Operation Hera 2008, carried out under the aegis of the Frontex agency, has achieved a significant reduction in the number of migrants landing on the coast of the Canary Islands."
"In the same spirit, migration issues will form part of the questions addressed in the negotiations that the Commission is going to open this month with Libya, in the light of the mandate given to it by the Council in September, with the aim of concluding the framework agreement between the European Union and Libya."
"Finally, as you know, the principle of responsibility was reaffirmed in last October's European Pact on Immigration and Asylum."
"The pact also underlines the need for solidarity with the Member States who are exposed, due to their geographical situation, to an influx of immigrants or whose resources are limited, and invites the Commission to present solutions which, in a spirit of solidarity, will take into account the difficulty faced by these States."
"(ES) President-in-Office of the Council, I agree with the approach taken by the Council."
"The question is whether we can adopt concrete measures: time is passing and the problems are getting ever bigger."
"In particular, the Mediterranean countries are facing difficulties."
"Some have the economic resources to tackle these, whereas others do not, for example Malta which, due to its small size and limited resources, is facing enormous difficulties."
"There are also problems deriving from international rules, such as the Hague Convention on Protection of Children which effectively prevents children from being returned to their families of origin."
"I do not know whether the Council has taken into account that the rules on protection of children are written in such a way that we find ourselves in this absurd situation where children come to Europe and cannot be returned, even to their families of origin, despite these having been identified."
"Finally, I must mention the more specific issues: I know that, at the moment, there are some specific initiatives with African countries, for example Mali, to set up immigration centres so that the countries of origin or transit can manage this problem themselves, in order to avoid the dramatic situation where dozens of people perish in the sea while trying to unsuccessfully reach our coasts."
"(FR) Madam President, I thank Mr Ortega for his constructive, pertinent questions."
"He is quite correct."
"We have to ensure the reinforcement of states with fewer resources: the case of Malta is perfectly clear, I know."
"We need to consider redeployment to strengthen the resources around Malta, and we also need to look at ways of reinforcing the Frontex mechanism in this respect, especially in Malta's case."
"Secondly, as Mr Ortega knows, there will be a second EU-Africa Ministerial Conference on Migration and Development in Paris, on 25 November 2008, to follow up on the Rabat Conference, and in this framework there will be three technical meetings on legal migration, illegal migration, and migration and development."
"I promise that I will ask the General Secretariat of the Council to report more precisely on the standard for the protection of minors, as I am unable at the moment to give an answer."
"As for the third element, as regards Mali, Mr Ortega is perfectly correct to underline the significance of these agreements."
"What we wish to do as the Presidency, and what we also invite the Council to pursue, is indeed to conclude such agreements with the countries of origin of immigration."
"It is in that respect that codevelopment and dialogue with the countries of origin are important and, for me, this agreement with Mali will serve as a reference."
"This is what I wished to say to Mr Ortega."
"(DE) My question relates to the Union for the Mediterranean, initiated by President Sarkozy."
"Can it be used as an effective tool with regard to this matter?"
"I would like to mention two specific issues."
"Firstly, the immigrants from North Africa: what is being done to create jobs there?"
"Secondly, the transit immigrants from West Africa: is it not possible to create reception centres in North Africa itself?"
"(FR) Madam President, I wish to say that Mr Posselt's question is pertinent."
"The Union for the Mediterranean is, to begin with, a union for practical projects."
"It also has an intercultural vision."
"It is obviously linked to economic development, and everything related to codevelopment is included in economic development."
"Thus, in one way or another, I can confirm to Mr Posselt that these aspects will be dealt with at the appropriate time, in the framework of the projects and discussions on economic development between the two shores of the Mediterranean."
"Subject: Opening of dialogue in Cuba"
"The Council Conclusions on Cuba of 23 June 2008 have been very well received in Cuban democratic circles, which appreciate the fact that the unconditional release of all political prisoners is a key priority for the EU and that it supports respect for human rights and genuine progress towards a pluralist democracy."
"In line with the commitments the Council made in its Conclusions, can it indicate what effective measures it is taking to further develop dialogue with the representatives of civil society and the democratic opposition?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Madam President, Mr Masip, as you have underlined, the Council did indeed decide, on 23 June, to resume relations with Cuba, in light of certain recent positive human rights developments."
"The Council first decided to resume a dialogue, without pre-conditions, between the European Union and Cuba, based on reciprocity and dealing with all issues of mutual interest."
"This dialogue is seeking concrete results, especially in human rights issues."
"In this framework, Mr Masip, the first session of the political dialogue between the European Union and Cuba at ministerial level was held in Paris on 16 October."
"Secondly, in its conclusions of 23 June, the Council reaffirmed that it would continue its dialogue with representatives from civil society and the democratic opposition during high-level visits, where questions on human rights will always be raised."
"If necessary, meetings with the opposition will be organised in the framework of these visits."
"The Council also stressed that the Union would continue to offer, to all sectors of Cuban society, its practical support for peaceful change on the island."
"To apply these conclusions, the organisations which represent this opposition will be regularly invited to present their views on the current political developments at the time."
"Finally, the Council reaffirmed that the Union stands ready to contribute constructively to the development of all sectors of Cuban society, including development cooperation and, in the context of this commitment, as you know, Commissioner Louis Michel has just been on an official visit to Cuba to agree the outlines of this cooperation and practical projects which may be initiated."
"Besides Mr Michel's visit, you will see that the Council has introduced many measures in application of the June conclusions and, next June, at the end of the Czech Presidency, the Council will begin to assess the political dialogue with Cuba and assess its results."
"The dialogue will continue on these bases, if it appears that Cuba is meeting the expectations expressed by the Union, especially on human rights issues."
"(ES) Thank you very much, Mr Jouyet, on behalf of my colleague, Luis Yañez-Barnuevo García, a person of dignity and democracy who supports the Cuban opposition and the Cuban people."
"You must keep up with your efforts to maintain these priorities and to keep the focus on this dialogue with the Cuban opposition."
"We have to achieve democracy in Cuba and ensure Europe's commitment to Cuba."
"- (SK) Despite reports of 'changes' in Cuba, the facts show that Cuba is still not a free and democratic country."
"The reason for imposing political and diplomatic sanctions against Cuba has still not gone away, since 55 of the original 75 dissidents still remain in prison."
"In my view, any political decision of the European Union on ending sanctions against Cuba should have been preceded by a transparent assessment of the situation's development, particularly in the area of human rights and civic freedoms for citizens of Cuba."
"What has the Council done and what will it do in order to secure the release of all political prisoners from Cuban prisons?"
"(FR) Madam President, Minister, I was thrown out of Cuba in May 2005."
"On arrival at the airport, I was expelled due to being an MEP."
"I recently requested a visa to be sure that I would be able to cross the border and it was refused."
"May I rely on you, on the Presidency, to ensure that an MEP is free to visit Cuba?"
"(FR) Madam President, I wish to reply to Mrs Pleštinská and then to Mr Sonik."
"The 1996 Council common position remains valid."
"It recommends encouraging a transition process towards democratic pluralism and respect for human rights and, to this end, intensification of the dialogue with the Cuban authorities and with all sectors of society."
"The European Union declares itself ready to support the process of opening up the country, as the Cuban authorities progress along the path of democracy."
"As for your situation, Mr Sonik, I have noted it and it is evident that, for all MEPs, we must show the greatest vigilance and give you our support in your actions."
"That is the Council's position."
"Subject: Lessons from the financial crisis"
"What lessons has the Council learnt from the current financial crisis?"
"What short-term and long-term measures are presently under discussion?"
"Do these talks involve Iceland and other European countries outside the EU whose economies are nevertheless closely interlinked?"
"Subject: Member States' responses to international financial crisis"
"Does the Council consider that the interventions of individual Member States to protect their banks and economies against the worst impacts of the international financial crisis are a retrograde step?"
"Subject: EU response to the financial crisis"
"With confidence in the financial markets at a low and the banking sector in disarray, is the Council working to tackle the crisis and restore confidence by implementing a coherent and combined approach, or is it felt that Member States are better prepared to manage the financial turmoil unilaterally?"
"Subject: Financial crisis and the Stability Pact"
"The global financial crisis has exposed the inconsistent behaviour of European Union governments and the European Central Bank, which are able to find funds to save banks from collapse, thereby breaching the provisions of the Stability Pact, when for many years they would not permit the slightest departure from the Pact's rules in order to meet important social needs."
"What is the Council's view?"
"Does it consider that, in the light of recent events, there is a need to review the provisions of the Stability Pact and the one-dimensional concept of the market economy, which has been the sole ruling principle for the development of Europe?"
"Subject: Eastern Europe's situation and prospects in the context of the financial crisis"
"Eastern Europe's fragility in the face of the financial crisis is a matter of concern for EU policy-makers."
"Leaders of Eastern European states feel that their economies are more vulnerable than their Western partners."
"What main threats could the Council highlight for the Eastern European countries and Baltic States in particular in this financial crisis?"
"What prospects does the Council see for the Eastern European countries and Baltic States in particular in the near future (2009-2010) and in the longer term?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Madam President, I will try to reply to all of the questions relating to the financial crisis affecting the world's economy over the last 15 months or more, and which continues to affect the finances of the European economies."
"As regards the Union, I would remind you that the European Council of 15 and 16 October stated its commitment, under all circumstances, to taking all necessary measures to maintain the stability of the financial system, support the major financial institutions, avoid bankruptcies and assure protection for savers' deposits."
"As for the financial system, the European Council also made a forceful call for all players in the system to act responsibly, especially in the banking sector."
"It stressed that the real performance of company directors should be reflected in their remuneration, including severance payments and everything relating to golden parachutes."
"Similarly, it agreed to ensure that stock option arrangements should lead neither to excessive risk-taking nor to an over-emphasis of short-term objectives."
"Following this meeting, the informal meeting of the Heads of State or Government on 7 November, whose task was to prepare the coordinated European approach for the G20 meeting, which took place last weekend in Washington, had the objectives of taking quick decisions on transparency, worldwide regulation standards, especially accounting standards, financial supervision and crisis management, of preventing conflicts of interest and of creating an early warning system, in such a way as to create saver and investor confidence."
"To reply more particularly to the honourable Member's question, tabled on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and echoing the question from Mr Evans, on the practical measures being examined to respond to the crisis, I wish to refer to the reform of the Capital Requirements Directive, which the Council is currently considering."
"The work of the Council on this proposal is already well advanced."
"The Commission has also just proposed a regulation on an approval system for rating agencies."
"This proposal is going in the same direction, insofar as capital requirements depend on the ratings awarded."
"As for the protection of savers' deposits, the Commission has proposed to amend the current Directive to increase the minimum guarantee to EUR 50 000, with a further increase to EUR 100 000 planned in future."
"The European Parliament and the Council are in the process of considering this proposal."
"I also note, following the European Council of 15 and 16 October, the introduction of the financial crisis team."
"This team, as you know, is an informal mechanism for warnings, information exchange and assessment among the representatives of the Council, the President of the European Council, the Commission, its President, the President of the European Central Bank, the President of the Eurogroup and the governments of the Member States, as well, of course, as the President of the Economic and Financial Committee, which is the linchpin of this early warning team."
"To reply to the questions put by Mrs McGuinness and Mr Mitchell, I would stress that the European Council approved an action plan to offer Member States a complete common framework of national rescue and aid measures for the financial sector."
"The European Council called on Member States to take into account the potential effects of their national decisions on the other Member States."
"We also recognise that Iceland has experienced severe difficulties."
"A message of solidarity was sent to this country by the European Council in October."
"There were meetings in the wings of the Ecofin Council on 4 November and, finally, with the Council of the European Economic Area, I personally met representatives from Iceland and believe that we were able to find satisfactory solidarity mechanisms and also adapt the agreements which unite us with this country in the framework of the Council of the European Economic Area."
"As for the question raised by Mr Papadimoulis, on the Stability and Growth Pact, I would remind you of the conclusions adopted by the Council on 7 October, in which it confirmed its desire to see the pact applied, whilst taking into account the exceptional circumstances with which we are familiar."
"Implementation of the 7 October decision must, of course, take account of the G20 conclusions, which call for the use of all available resources to sustain activity."
"To respond now to the question from Mrs Andrikienė, I would remind you that, according to the Commission, Hungary, Lithuania, Estonia, Bulgaria and Romania are affected more severely by the financial crisis than the other Member States."
"These States have, for years, benefited from favourable external financing conditions, creating, of course, deficits in the current balances of payments and an accumulation of external debts."
"It is evident that, now, financing conditions are much less favourable and the problem facing these States is one of refinancing their external debt."
"As for Hungary, the Council has just granted a loan of EUR 6.5 billion in the framework of the mechanism for medium-term financial assistance for balances of payments."
"In addition to the Council's loan, there are loans from the International Monetary Fund, for EUR 12.5 billion, and from the World Bank, for one billion. I do not know if the latter is in dollars or euros."
"With current funding of EUR 12 billion, there is a risk that this mechanism will prove inadequate to meet future requirements, so this is why the Commission has just proposed increasing the assistance available to this country to EUR 25 billion."
"The Council has asked Parliament to give its opinion on this proposal."
"I welcome Council's remarks and the general approach to the financial services crisis and, indeed, I hope that we will be able to build on the recent G20 results."
"As you mentioned, we need to build on that movement to create global results for global regulations and particularly financial supervision."
"I have to say that financial supervision requires financial support as well."
"We have seen this."
"This is taxpayers' money, of course."
"But supervision, to be appropriate, needs appropriate solvency, not just for banks but also for insurance companies."
"I wonder, therefore, if you will also support group supervision and group support as stated in Solvency II, something not mentioned in your list of financial regulations, but which was thought up outside a time of crisis and could help us in crisis."
"If this is the case, perhaps the presidency could explain why, on 2 December, it intends to delete group support from this proposal, and realise how unhelpful this can be."
"Our questions were framed some weeks ago and the situation is now worse than, and different to, the situation then."
"So, on that basis, could I ask how united the Council is in its joint action, and, where you have a situation in which Member States have to act alone, is the system working effectively?"
"Is it not time we had something like a Marshall Aid Plan, perhaps a Sarkozy Plan for Europe?"
"How would you fund that?"
"Supposing China was to lend money to the European Investment Bank or the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and you were to give grants to Member States - that would not affect their debt/GNP ratio."
"How would you refund it?"
"From the customs and excise that you would collect from trade and perhaps from an extra 0.5 % VAT contribution from the Member States who would draw down this facility."
"Will you give consideration at your December meeting to a Marshall Aid-type plan and stop tinkering at the edges?"
"We are now just entering into this recession, and, if we take it head on with calculated risk, we can see our way through it."
"(EL) Mr President-in-Office of the Council, even Mr Prodi, the former President of the Commission, said the Stability Pact was stupid, because it only cares about inflation, deficit and debt, at a time when Europe is sinking into recession and needs measures which will foster development, employment and social cohesion."
"My question is: are you considering replacing rather than just relaxing it?"
"If you cannot or will not, then please convey to the Council President that this crisis dumping must stop."
"(LT) Mr Jouyet, you spoke about Hungary and the solidarity shown towards Hungary, which is encouraging, but I am also very interested in the other countries you mentioned: Bulgaria, Romania and especially Lithuania."
"Can Lithuania also expect the solidarity of the European Union in the current financial crisis?"
"(FR) Madam President, to reply to the honourable Member who echoed the question from Mr Evans, you are perfectly correct."
"Issues of solvency not only affect banks, but also concern insurance companies, and our monitoring mechanisms need to be adapted to deal with groups in this sector which may be consolidated or transnational."
"This is why we are determined to bring a satisfactory conclusion to the work on the Solvency II directive."
"We are hoping the work will be concluded as quickly as possible and we support the Commission in the performance of its work."
"We are hoping to find a compromise on this issue, but it is clear that we need features which will strengthen solvency monitoring at the insurance group level."
"To reply to Mrs McGuinness, I think that the response from the G20, the way it was prepared, the fact that there is an action plan agreed by the G20, shows that the Council was united in its action."
"I would remind you that, in the context of this action plan, there are also those who say that we should call on all the resources available to maintain activity; in this action plan you have very practical financial regulation measures that I listed just recently, which I do not intend to repeat, and whose rapid implementation we are awaiting at European Union level."
"We have requested, not only in response to the financial crisis, but also to the economic crisis, that the Commission takes the legislative or practical initiatives required and that the House supports these by adopting the texts required as soon as possible."
"As regards the coordination of the Member States, I would say to Mrs McGuinness that I think it is important that the early warning team, this coordination team, should function correctly in the framework of the Economic and Financial Committee plus the representatives of the Member States and the various institutions concerned, whether this be the European Central Bank or the Eurogroup."
"As for Mr Mitchell's speech, I think that, without mentioning the Marshall Plan, and in application of the G20 principles, and speaking in the name of the Presidency, we wish to see all the levers for action at Community level put to use, combined with those at national level: whether these be existing loan facilities from the European Investment Bank, the resources available in the Community budget which should also be used to sustain activity, the resources, of course, available in national budgets, especially those relating to future spending and business support projects, or even, at Community level, the relaxation or adaptation of certain rules to help those sectors in greatest difficulty."
"From this point of view, we are looking at things with the greatest pragmatism, but it is clear that we must act in this area."
"You are, in any case, quite right, and the Presidency shares your point of view entirely."
"As for what Mrs Andrikiensaid, I am sorry, but Hungary has received financial aid."
"The Fund, as I said and can confirm, has granted EUR 12.5 billion, with EUR 6.5 billion from the Union, and it is clear that this solidarity is benefiting the countries affected by serious crises in their balance of payments and with problems in refinancing external debt."
"Rest assured that, within the Union, we are implementing the required solidarity mechanisms."
"We were faced with a particularly serious situation in the case of Hungary."
"I alluded to Iceland too."
"We have found ourselves in a difficult situation."
"If, and I do not wish it, the Baltic countries or certain countries with which you are most familiar should find themselves in the same difficulties, the same solidarity mechanisms should come into play."
"That is the Presidency's position and, of course, there can be no unity without solidarity."
"I wish to say to Mr Papadimoulis that, first, I do not always agree with President Prodi."
"It is like that sometimes."
"Secondly, there is a need for a certain budgetary discipline."
"Thirdly, as I said in referring to the G20 conclusions, it seems obvious that these principles need to be adapted to the exceptional circumstances, and that exceptional measures are required."
"It makes sense, and here I do agree, that one should never be dogmatic."
"Finally, and fourthly, as for tourism, I know the Council President sufficiently well to know that he has other favourite spots and that he is putting all his energy at the service of the European Union."
"I trust you note that this is essential for us."
"(ES) Mr Jouyet, through the financial technique of securitisation, US subprime mortgages have been included in the mortgage notes and other funds purchased by European banks and citizens."
"Does the Council know how much of this financial garbage has been sold to us from the other side of the Atlantic?"
"I would like to know whether the French presidency finds itself isolated at the Council table in any way in terms of its historic fondness for regulation of the market and, in this particular instance, for financial services."
"(FR) Madam President, to reply to the honourable Member, I do not have the exact figure in my head."
"The orders of magnitude that I am familiar with are really high and the excesses of securitisation, mainly from across the Atlantic and which have spread to Europe, are greater than the GDP of many Member States, or even of the EU."
"It is really considerable."
"That is what I can tell you."
"Securitisation has, therefore, left us to deal with a destabilising shock of an unprecedented severity."
"That is what I can tell you today."
"To reply to Mrs Doyle, I hope here that, as with other issues, we are not totally isolated and that the Presidency is confident."
"Financial regulation is certainly not an easy matter, Mrs Doyle, but I think that we are making progress."
"This afternoon, we have had exchanges in your House with the President of the European Commission and we are relatively confident about the action plan as defined by the European Council and as shaped by the whole of Europe at the informal meeting of the Heads of State or Government, and then guided by the work of the G20 this weekend in Washington."
"There is no longer any argument, I would say, at least about the theory."
"We have to deal with this lack of regulation."
"There is no need or desire for more regulations, but we have to adapt some of them and need to ensure there is a system which is secure and transparent for savers and investors."
"I think the whole world agrees with us on this."
"Thereafter, it is a question of adjustment."
"Subject: Political responsibility for abuses that occur during EU military operations"
"Testimony has emerged in Sweden that the French military force involved in EU operation Artemis in Bunia, Congo, engaged in the torture and fake execution of a prisoner."
"This incident is alleged to have taken place on 13 July 2003 and has been investigated by both the Swedish and French armed forces."
"This incident raises many issues regarding future cooperation."
"Are there any guarantees that the forces sent by EU Member States on EU operations observe signed conventions and have competence under international law?"
"How does the Council intend to follow up the findings of the current French investigation into the Bunia incident?"
"Subject: Political responsibility for abuses that occur during EU military operations"
"Testimony has emerged in Sweden that the French military force involved in EU operation Artemis in Bunia, Congo, engaged in the torture and fake execution of a prisoner."
"This incident is alleged to have taken place on 13 July 2003 and has been investigated by both the Swedish and French armed forces."
"The Swedish evidence gave contradictory accounts and the French investigation came to the conclusion that no abuses had occurred, but the incident does raise a number of issues for the future."
"Who should assume political responsibility for excesses committed by a Member State's military force engaged in an EU operation abroad?"
"If a Member State's military force is found guilty of a war crime during an EU operation, is it possible to suspend that Member State from EU operations for a lengthy period in order to defend the good name and reputation of military forces from the EU Member States?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Madam President, these are serious questions raised by Mrs Goudin and Mrs Dahl."
"I can assure both them and your House that the operations of the European Union are carried out in compliance with the conventions protecting human rights and international law."
"This principle is clearly specified in all planning documents approved by the Council and included in the individual instructions which are given to active forces."
"This is what is known as the 'soldiers' corps'."
"Where certain individuals deployed in foreign and defence operations go beyond their duties, the disciplinary and legal consequences fall within the competence of the Member States."
"All Member States adhere to the conventions that protect human rights."
"In the case referred to in this joint question, allow me to take off my President-in-Office of the Council hat to say this: for the sake of transparency, the French authorities, after contacting the Swedish authorities, carried out a thorough inquiry."
"This inquiry was carried out for the French authorities by the Inspectorate for active forces and national defence."
"This inquiry showed that the young man captured by French forces on 13 July 2003, during Operation Artemis in the Democratic Republic of Congo, suffered neither torture nor cruel treatment."
"Thus, the serious accusations levelled against the French and Swedish forces are unfounded."
"(SV) I should like to ask the following question: this young man has, as we know, disappeared."
"How is it possible to prove that nothing has happened to him?"
"(DA) Madam President, I would like to follow up the question by asking for clarification as to whether, if there is doubt about whether a Member State complies with the international conventions in connection with an operation for the EU, it is possible for the Member State to be excluded from participating."
"I think in some cases it could be necessary and quite important to be clear on that."
"(FR) Madam President, without going to extremes, I want to give a factual reply to the questions from Mrs Goudin and Mrs Dahl, and so I will give your House, as well as my hat, the information from the report on the inquiry carried out by the French Inspectorate for active forces and national defence."
"For the House's information - I am not obliged to deal with these questions as part of my functions, but I will do so - I will summarise for you the inquiry into the occurrences of 13 July 2003 in Chem-Chem camp in Bunia, in the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"This inquiry, carried out with the support and cooperation of the Swedish forces, shows that the young man captured by French forces on 13 July 2003, during Operation Artemis in the Democratic Republic of Congo, suffered neither torture nor cruel treatment."
"He was detained for several hours in the camp, then released."
"The inquiry was ordered on 31 March 2008 by the head of the army, to complement the preliminary inquiries carried out by the Swedish and French authorities in their respective countries."
"There was very good cooperation between these authorities and, as a result of the inquiries, it appears that the serious accusations levelled against the French and Swedish soldiers and the two colonels involved are unfounded."
"To conclude, it is evident that the protection of human rights and the international conventions must be respected in every phase of foreign policy security and defence operations, from planning to the implementation phase, and this must be achieved, especially, by continuous training for the teams in this sphere."
"(DE) Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I should be interested to hear what you view the role of the UN to be as far as these issues are concerned."
"Do you think that the UN will have a job to do in these areas?"
"I am reassured by your comments - both with your French hat and the wider Council hat."
"But would you not agree that this incident, and any such incidents like this, are very bad from the point of view of our EU operations and that we need to be very clear and very careful about how we handle any such reports so that we deal with them timely and that it does not cause a slur, if you like, on our good work?"
"- (FR) Madam President, as for what Mrs McGuinness said, I share your opinion entirely."
"It is evident that, whatever the foreign operations, whether pursued in the framework of European Security and Defence Policy or in a joint framework, they should obviously be announced and reported on."
"Transparency must be absolutely vital."
"I am in full agreement with Mrs McGuinness and this is why we need to develop everything to do with 'Military Erasmus'."
"I hope that the work of the next European Council, which will be held in December, can expand on the aspects relating to training and the exchange of best practice and experiences between the Member States in the framework of the European Security and Defence Policy."
"In response to Mrs McGuinness, I think that this is an extremely important element, if we wish to develop a strategy for European security and presence on foreign soil."
"You are quite right, Mrs McGuinness."
"As for Mr Rübig's question, this will be dealt with tomorrow morning in our debate on the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"I believe that the UN's role is indeed important."
"The question is how its resources can be strengthened and complemented."
"I see Mrs Dahl asking for the floor again."
"I can only give you one supplementary question and that is it, I am afraid."
"I am sorry, but that is it."
"(Interjection from the floor)"
"I am not in a position to force exactly what you would like to hear, maybe."
"The President-in-Office has answered, and I am afraid that has to be an end to it unless you address further correspondence."
"Subject: Coordination of national social security systems"
"Will the Council say what progress has been made in the process of updating and simplifying European legislation on the coordination of national social security systems, the first stage of which was the adoption of Regulation (EC) No. 883/2004, to enable EU citizens to move freely within Europe, whilst retaining their rights and social benefits (health care, pensions, unemployment benefit)?"
"What stage has been reached in the adoption of an implementing regulation to replace Regulation (EEC) No. 574/722, which will also contain provisions designed to strengthen cooperation between national agencies and improve methods of exchanging data?"
"Madam President, to reply to Mrs Panayotopoulos, I would say to her that the Council fully shares her opinion on the need to reach an agreement, as soon as possible, on the proposed regulation setting out methods for applying Regulation No 883/2004, which relates to the coordination of social security systems."
"This means establishing the conditions for the adoption of this regulation in order to complete, by May 2009 if possible, the reform of the coordination of social security systems."
"This proposed regulation, presented by the Commission in January 2006, has since, given the breadth and highly technical nature of its provisions, been subject to chapter-by-chapter examination under the successive Presidencies."
"Thanks to the sustained efforts of the preceding Presidencies, partial general approaches have been adopted."
"This process was completed last month under the French Presidency with the adoption of the partial general approaches on the two remaining chapters, relating to benefits for accidents at work and occupational illnesses and also death benefits."
"Meanwhile, Parliament gave its opinion last July at first reading."
"The Council welcomes the broad convergence of views with Parliament."
"It sees in this the fruits of some highly constructive cooperation, initiated between the two institutions from the very beginning of the examination of this text."
"The adoption of a common position on the draft regulation is, for the French Presidency, one of the major steps towards increasing personal mobility within the Union."
"This is why the Presidency will do whatever it can to have this common position adopted at the Council meeting on 15 December, so that Parliament can adopt it in its part-session next January."
"(EL) Madam President, I should like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council about the new Commission proposal 2008/414 on the rights of patients to cross-border services."
"What is the French Presidency's position on this new proposal?"
"(FR) Madam President, it is clear to the French Presidency that we must support this proposal from the Commission."
"In practical terms, it facilitates the procedures for insured persons, speeds up the response and processing times for cross-border situations by institutions in the various social security spheres, such as accidents at work, occupational illnesses and invalidity."
"We need to make progress to adopt rules on this issue."
"As you know, the French Presidency asked Alain Lamasssoure, whom you know, a question about ways of overcoming the obstacles to cross-border mobility."
"Harmonisation in the social security sphere is one of the responses."
"An appropriate balance has to be found between maintaining national social security traditions, which are important in each of our Member States, and making the changes which are vital for facilitating cross-border mobility."
"In this framework, we support the proposal you mentioned and the Presidency, under the aegis of Xavier Bertrand, is making all possible efforts to achieve its adoption."
"(DE) I believe that one of the biggest problems that we have is double taxation within Europe, which, in the area of social security in particular, unexpectedly leads to additional tax burdens."
"I would be interested to know whether an initiative from the French Presidency of the Council is to be expected."
"With electronic transfer of payments and the ease of electronic reimbursement, surely it is not beyond the collective competence and wit of European institutions to put the technology in place to allow the essential single market right of freedom of movement or cross-border mobility of all our citizens - including the disabled and old age pensioners and others - or is it the fact that there is no collective will to do so?"
"Is any country standing in the way of a collective resolution to this problem?"
"(FR) Madam President, I wish to reply to Mr Rübig and Mrs Doyle, as these are questions which have already caught my attention."
"Firstly, I think that Mrs Doyle is correct."
"All technologies, and electronic technologies are especially useful here, should be used to facilitate the processing of patient files."
"Secondly, Mrs Doyle, we are in favour of a collective solution, providing that, in the cause of mobility, we do not threaten each country's social security traditions."
"Thirdly, I agree with Mr Rübig."
"It has been seen that there are legal issues relating to contribution payment problems, relating to double taxation."
"Mr Rübig is correct."
"To give you my own view, having considered these problems closely only last week, as we come from border countries, Mr Rübig, I think that national administrations are not always properly trained, confident or sufficiently motivated to solve this type of problem."
"This seems to me, to reply to Mrs Doyle, the real difficulty."
"That is why a collective Community approach is required."
"The Commission, really, has to push hard."
"The Presidency is pushing this work forward too, because there is administrative, bureaucratic and cultural reluctance in each of our Member States."
"Now, the question of cross-border mobility is a real issue for European integration, for developing a new European generation and simply for allowing our citizens to see the practical advantages of the European Union."
"There are far too many administrative obstacles to these cross-border movements, especially in the social and fiscal spheres."
"That is a real issue."
"I believe that this also requires in-depth reforms and coordination between the Community institutions, especially the Commission, and the national administrations."
"That concludes Question Time."
"Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will be answered in writing (see Annex)."
"(The sitting was suspended at 19.05 and resumed at 21.00)"
"Publication and translation obligations of certain types of companies (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs P-N. Kauppi, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directives 68/151/EEC and 89/666/EC as regards publication and translation obligations of certain types of companies - C6-0171/2008 -."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, this report is part of the simplification package on company law."
"It is very important that in the European Union we try to simplify the environment for companies to flourish and to create growth for the European economy."
"The aim is to diminish administrative burdens as regards publication and translation obligations of certain types of companies."
"The proposal is part of the wide-ranging administrative burden reduction exercise; it would free up and redirect business resources and thus enhance the competitiveness of European economies."
"Nowadays, under the First Company Law Directive, companies need to publish certain information in the national gazettes that has to be entered into the Member States' commercial registers."
"In most cases, publication in the national gazette entails additional costs for the companies without providing any real added value."
"The objective of this proposal is therefore to remove any additional publication requirements in national law that cause additional costs to the companies."
"Anyhow, the Commission leaves flexibility for Member States concerning these additional publication requirements."
"It is still possible for Member States to have additional requirements, but these should be covered by the single fee proposed for the new electronic platform."
"Member States should all have electronic platforms containing the full information and providing access to this information in the companies' electronic file in the register."
"This would be a cost-effective and easily accessible way of providing all the necessary information regarding the companies."
"Some Member States already have these electronic registers and databases, but others do not have this kind of digital database."
"The most important thing is to introduce the single fee set by the Member States that covers all the costs related to the publication and administration requirements."
"This single fee should also cover any additional national requirements for the publication of information in local and regional newspapers as well."
"However, the Committee on Legal Affairs also wanted to introduce some flexibility regarding these costs and we now say that, if there are well-founded reasons, it would be possible for Member States to have additional fees."
"Regarding the 11th Company Law Directive, this proposal deals with the translation requirements for documents to be filed in the registers of company branches."
"When registering a branch, companies also have to file certain information in the register of the company branch."
"This often leads to significant additional costs for companies as they not only have to ensure the translation of certain documents into the language of the Member States where the branch is situated, but also have to comply with sometimes excessive requirements for certification and/or notarisation of that translation."
"So now we are trying to ease translation obligations by having this certification and authorisation abolished."
"The objective is to reduce the costs for translation and certification to the minimum."
"This also leads to benefits for companies by achieving a certain reduction in costs while ensuring the reliability of the translations."
"I agree with the Commission proposal and tried to keep my wording as close to the Commission proposal as possible."
"However, it was not possible to reach a consensus based on the Commission proposal here in Parliament."
"In the report we introduced some amendments to clarify the practical implementation of the provisions relating to publication costs and translation provisions, and we also introduced some technical amendments in order to ensure correct cross-referencing with the Second Company Law Directive."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs introduced three compromise amendments tabled by several colleagues to the effect that these additional publication requirements may be permitted if they are well-grounded, but we put them into recitals - they are not in the articles."
"I think it is very important that there is a recommendation in the recitals for the Member States to use this flexibility, but we do not call on them to do so."
"If the Member State feels that its companies really need to have this publication in the national gazette - and this is really something that Member States wants - they can do that, but we have not put any call to this effect into the articles."
"The second issue is that I, personally, tried to introduce a transition period, which I still think would be a very good way forward."
"During the transition period these publication requirements would be there, but once the transition period is over we would have only the electronic database."
"I think this kind of proposal for a transition period would also be in line with the issue of internet penetration, namely that some Member States have better internet penetration than others; maybe after the transition period we could then make sure that there is enough distribution of information in all Member States."
"In this way we could take into account the fact that internet penetration in all the Member States is not at the same level."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work on this file, which has turned out to be more complicated than expected."
"We are taking our commitment to reduce regulatory burden on companies very seriously and are grateful for Parliament's continued encouragement in this regard."
"However, it is difficult not to be disappointed with some of the proposed amendments to the First Company Law Directive."
"Let me recall that the European Parliament, in its resolution of 12 December 2007 on the Commission Work Programme 2008, welcomed the Commission's determination to reach the goal of a 25% reduction in administrative burdens on undertakings at EU and national levels by 2012."
"Parliament stated that it would regard this as a key priority for the coming months, in particular as regards SMEs, and as an essential contribution to reaching the Lisbon targets."
"Parliament therefore underlined that it would examine legislative proposals in this light."
"Furthermore, in its resolution of 21 May 2008 on a simplified business environment, Parliament supported this specific proposal for modifications to the First Company Law Directive, agreeing that it should be easier for companies to publish statutory information."
"In particular, Parliament strongly supported the use of new technology."
"However, the Legal Affairs Committee's report that is now on the table completely undermines the objective of the Commission's proposal."
"The Commission's impact assessment estimated the reduction potential at about EUR 600 million per year."
"Under the draft report, Member States could not only continue to impose all current administrative burdens on companies, but add new ones."
"So, whereas the Commission proposal is based on the idea that the new publication tool of an electronic platform should replace the current cumbersome publication methods, the draft report would, instead of reducing administrative burdens, add new ones."
"The objective of the Commission's proposal has been supported by an overwhelming majority of stakeholders."
"It was also supported by a very large majority of Member States in the discussions in the Council that have taken place so far."
"But adopting the directive in the form currently proposed by the Committee on Legal Affairs would risk jeopardising the credibility of the entire administrative burden reduction exercise."
"To the extent that the objective of the Committee on Legal Affairs amendment is to secure the financing of newspapers that currently depend on the fees for company publications, this objective can in principle be shared by the Commission."
"However, other ways for this financing have to be found."
"It cannot be imposed on the companies by obliging them to comply with publication obligations that do not provide any significant added value in today's technological environment."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - (EL) Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I should like to convey our opinion to you."
"We endorse to a large extent the root cause of this Commission proposal, which is well structured and, of course, is designed to minimise administrative burdens."
"We think that, alongside translation, the simplification of procedures and the recognition of translations by other certified translators from another Member State is absolutely justified and fully endorse this approach."
"Now I come to the question of publication."
"Our committee believes - as the Committee on Legal Affairs, in my opinion quite rightly, believes - that, in addition to companies, there are also citizens who also have the right to know."
"Unfortunately, Commissioner, citizens do not have the same access to electronic media to which your initial proposal directed them."
"We live in a pluralistic Europe, with different models and different values."
"You, as a Commissioner from Ireland, know that the outcome of the referendum in your country, the perception of many of your fellow countryman about one model for all of Europe, cost us dearly."
"We do not therefore want to introduce this model in Europe, knowing full well that in my country, in my region, access to the Internet is restricted."
"Why should we therefore deprive these people, these European citizens, of the right to learn about things which concern them via other traditional channels?"
"I therefore consider, Commissioner, as do the Committee on Economic Affairs and the Committee on Legal Affairs, that the electronic platform must be compulsory and quite rightly so."
"However, it must not be the only platform."
"We must allow all European citizens to access information."
"We do not want a situation in which someone in a region of Europe has to find out what is going to happen in his region on a BlackBerry, because where I live many people do not have a BlackBerry."
"I therefore consider that, as the representative of the Commission, and I believe that we should send the Council the same message, you must take serious account of the position which we expressed unanimously in the Committee on Legal Affairs and by a large majority in the Committee on Economic Affairs."
"May I say that, if you are thinking about ignoring it, I would advise you to think again, because it is only through productive democratic dialogue that we can find mutually acceptable solutions for the benefit of the many, not just the few."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (EL) Mr President, the European Council in March 2008 ordered new, fast-track legislative initiatives to be taken in order to improve the business environment for companies in the Union by reducing administrative obligations and costs."
"In my opinion, the Commission's proposal for a directive which we are debating contributes little to the objective set."
"The core problem for companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, is that objective conditions are needed for improving the bureaucratic, legislative and fiscal environment in general and we expect an even more substantial contribution on the part of the Commission in this direction."
"In this particular instance, the main purpose of publishing companies' annual accounts and other financial statements is to apply the principle of transparency and publicity in commercial activities."
"However, the low level of penetration of the Internet in a significant number of Member States of the Union does not constitute an adequate guarantee."
"Apart from that, having compulsory records in purely electronic format would also mean the loss of thousands of specialist jobs in traditional printed media."
"Furthermore, the press is an essential component of the principle of the transparency and democratic life of the Union, the contribution of which to the multilingualism and diversity of the European Union is beyond question."
"I consider that the safety valve of adopting a single fee and of maintaining the parallel facility to publish in the printed media, in conjunction with the introduction of an electronic register, as formulated in the consensus reached and voted by all - I repeat all - wings of the Committee on Legal Affairs, is the balanced and rational solution needed."
"In closing, allow me to emphasise that what is required of the European Parliament and what it has a duty to provide is productive consent to Community lawmaking whilst retaining the full independence of its legislative will."
"It is the will of the Committee on Legal Affairs, as already formulated, that plenary adopt the report by Mrs Kauppi, whom I congratulate on her work."
"In post scriptum to you, Commissioner, I do not know if the consensus proposal by the Committee on Legal Affairs comes as a disappointment to you, but I should like to say to you and I honestly hope that, as soon as the Lisbon Treaty enters into force, the culture of cooperation between the Commission and the European Parliament will - and must - change."
"That is what we are waiting for now; that is what the democratically elected European Parliament is waiting for."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, firstly I shall say something about the procedure."
"It is a pity that we did not discuss it this morning, Commissioner, when we were sitting together, because I was a bit surprised that you are so harsh now in your speech to Parliament."
"On the procedure, I am particularly harsh on the way that the French presidency has dealt with our proposals, in not meeting any requirements to negotiate or try to have a dialogue on a possible compromise."
"It is the same for the Commission."
"With these types of issues it is normal to try to get together and find a solution that meets the concerns of the different parties."
"I regret that this has happened, and I hope that in the time between the plenary and the vote in committee there will be an opportunity to do that."
"On the content, I think we do not differ so much."
"I am also very much committed to relief of administrative burdens."
"I am always pushing for the XBRL system in accounting and this type of electronic platform."
"I think we all agree that it is necessary, precisely because in some Member States the electronic society is not yet completely in place."
"It is necessary to have this temporary transitional solution so Member States still have the option of using this type of paper registration."
"This is really a temporary problem and there could be a pragmatic solution."
"I heard this week that it is only 20 years since e-mail was first used and since the first internet connection, so in 10 to 20 years' time it will be completely normal for everything to be processed electronically."
"It is only a very temporary problem that we are facing and we should not make a big issue of it."
"We should try to find a reasonable, pragmatic solution in the spirit of what you are always telling us you want also."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I first want to thank our colleague, Piia-Noora Kauppi, for her excellent report and for her efforts to allow a reasonable solution to be found to the various issues, especially that of the platform."
"The proposed directive is part of the wider action undertaken to reduce the administrative burden on companies, to reduce the restrictions upon them and increase their competitiveness."
"We, of course, actively support this objective which will benefit SMEs."
"We approve the creation of an electronic platform containing all information and the principle of a single fee to cover all of the costs related to the necessary publications."
"It is appropriate, however, to provide the best possible information and to allow continuation of the usual publication methods, which are still needed, especially in the printed press."
"The text proposed by the rapporteur after negotiations, and unanimously adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs, will allow the Member States to provide for the retention of the usual publication methods, as their cost is included in the single publication fee."
"We have therefore, Commissioner, complied with the spirit of the proposal by making the platform a requirement and by maintaining the principle of a single fee."
"We have, however, taken account of the reality in various countries without the IT infrastructure that some other countries have, and which have information habits that should not be ignored."
"Commissioner, you know that the citizens' views have to be taken into account and that Europe must not appear to be a source of new restrictions or difficulties."
"This is why we are looking for the flexibility to take into account the realities of the different Member States, whilst retaining an economical system."
"You harshly said, Commissioner, that the Committee on Legal Affairs' proposal undermines the Commission's position."
"I do not think this is accurate, nor is it accurate to say that the Committee on Legal Affairs' proposal introduces new formalities."
"On the contrary, it is agreed that these are existing formalities which will be retained and we obviously reject the introduction of new formalities."
"What is needed, Commissioner, I believe, is for Europe to show it is capable of reducing bureaucracy and administrative burdens, whilst respecting national identities."
"(ES) Mr President, I want to thank the Commission for having presented this proposal."
"I believe it is positive and will help us to reduce unnecessary administrative burdens."
"As previous speakers have said, this Parliament has a duty to bring down to earth the Commission's very generous and very altruistic proposals."
"The reality is that we have 27 countries with different legal systems and very different languages which means that, in each country, we must adapt to the realities of that country, including on the issue of languages."
"However, as mentioned just now by Mr Gauzès and also by previous speakers, it is vital that the recognition of these national specificities does not lead to increased costs, that fees are uniform and that governments, if necessary, shoulder this additional cost."
"However, there is also another issue: the issue of translations."
"In the European Union we do not have a common language."
"Different languages are spoken in all the 27 countries, and even within some of these countries, such as the Commissioner's."
"We have to live with this."
"Also, in legal terms, we are faced with a reality in which legal documents differ."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs has, for example, proposed amendments on the certification of documents, together with the certification of translations."
"At this moment in time, the Committee on Legal Affairs is preparing a report on the recognition of certified documents in various European Union countries, which should complement this report."
"Finally, I believe that the Commission has done well in presenting this proposal."
"The rapporteur has done a magnificent job and we have all tried to develop a proposal for a legislative text that can be recognised throughout the Union, thus guaranteeing rights and which is based on the reality of a Union that is still being constructed, that has different national legal systems and that has different levels of access to electronic communications."
"(FR) Mr President, firstly I wish to congratulate Mrs Kauppi, the rapporteur, on her excellent work as, thanks to her, the Committee on Legal Affairs has found a compromise which was, I recall, Commissioner, adopted unanimously."
"This is, then, a clear signal."
"It will reconcile the need of companies, especially SMEs, for administrative simplicity and the citizen's right to information, whilst leaving Member States the option of retaining publication requirements, if they so wish."
"I am convinced that the European Parliament will follow the lead from the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"The 27 Member States have their traditions."
"Some advocate the Internet exclusively."
"Others still use more traditional paper methods of communication."
"These traditions have to be respected."
"Let us not forget that 50% of Europe's citizens have no Internet access."
"If the information were only available on a single electronic platform, those unable to access the Internet, or who prefer to use paper, would be unable to receive information about companies in their region."
"I believe that the European Parliament well understands that simply abolishing the publication of judicial and legal announcements in regional newspapers, for example, would have disastrous consequences."
"As a result, the Member States must be able to organise the distribution of information via complementary channels, under specific conditions."
"Commissioner, this is not an ideological debate."
"Do you not think, in the current circumstances, that you have other things to do instead of hindering something which is working well in the Member States?"
"In seeking always to simplify, there is sometimes the risk of making things more complicated."
"Reducing costs?"
"Yes, but at what price?"
"Easing the restrictions to increase competitiveness?"
"Yes, but what happens to competitiveness when the simplification risks severely damaging the economy of an entire sector?"
"There is a strong desire for the Commission to take notice of the fact that we support solutions which will allow the printed press to overcome the difficulties it currently faces."
"Commissioner, you should not be impervious to the traditions of the Member States."
"By acting in this way, you are responsible for risking redundancies for a certain number of journalists and a lack of information for a large part of the population."
"We are looking for a balanced directive incorporating the electronic platform and the single fee."
"We are convinced that we have achieved this solution, and you must respect the European Parliament's vote."
"(PL) Mr President, the European Parliament has long been raising the issue of unnecessary and disproportionately high administration costs imposed on European enterprises."
"These costs not only make doing business more difficult, but represent a barrier to meeting the challenges of today's highly competitive world economy."
"It is therefore pleasing that the Commission has finally turned its attention to this issue, proposing to apply the fast-track procedure to the amendment of the 1st and 11th Company Law Directives, which will contribute to a faster improvement of European enterprises' business environment."
"In the case of the 1st Directive, the elimination from national law of all additional disclosure requirements which increase enterprise costs seems very appropriate indeed."
"The proposed electronic platform with full information about companies will provide an economical and easily accessible solution, as will the single payment covering all costs, whether administrative or associated with disclosure requirements."
"The proposal relating to the 11th Company Law Directive concerns the translation and certification of documents to be entered into the commercial register of a branch of a company established in a different Member State."
"The mutual recognition of translations proposed by the Commission as a way of reducing the administrative burden will undoubtedly contribute to reducing the costs borne by companies, while ensuring the reliability of the translations."
"Finally, may I congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Kauppi, on the excellent report."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to use the privilege of being the last speaker to make a political comment and two technical comments on the directive which we are debating."
"My political comment is that today we are witnessing a rare moment in the European Parliament: complete unanimity in all wings of the House, from the right wing to the left wing, on the direction in which Parliament wishes to take a specific legislative initiative."
"Numerous members have said and I too wish to emphasise the fact that this is a rare occurrence and must of necessity be taken into account in the Commission's final decision."
"We are not undermining the Commission's proposal."
"We are trying to modernise it and make it more human, more logical and more practical."
"That is my political comment."
"I have two brief technical comments: on the question of publication, Members have said and I too shall add that it is absolutely fair and absolutely right for the Member States in which access to the Internet is severely limited to be given the facility, alongside the general rule of electronic publication, of publication in the press for obvious social and financial reasons."
"I should like to comment briefly on the question of translation, with which there is no problem whatsoever."
"The facility for there to be just one recognised translation gives us a practical solution."
"The question of translation raised here is not a question of language, it is not a question of transparency, it is not a question of style."
"It is a practical question which can be very simply resolved by recognising the translation."
"There is a distinction, therefore, between the political issues and the technical issues."
"We are not undermining the proposal, we are improving it."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me begin by saying that if Ieke van den Burg had raised this issue this morning, I gladly would have dealt with it."
"I had asked you whether there were any other issues you would like to raise and, if you had, I would have spoken to you about it."
"If you had raised any issue at all - including the weather in Ireland - I would have discussed that with you as well."
"I have no problem doing that."
"I do not have any problem at all as to what the European Parliament decides, because that is your job and that is what you must do."
"But the background to this particular proposal has to be kept in mind and, since I appreciate your position, I would ask you to appreciate mine."
"This particular proposal was put forward in the context of reducing the administrative burden on small companies."
"It was part of the simplification of the business environment."
"There are estimates of what this proposal would achieve: reducing the cost annually by EUR 600 million."
"So the reason for putting forward this proposal was to reduce administrative costs for small business."
"As I pointed out in my earlier remarks, the whole project of reducing costs has been welcomed by the European Parliament in various resolutions."
"So this is the context in which this was put forward."
"With the idea of bringing down administrative costs and simplification for smaller business we came up with this particular proposal."
"You can hardly expect me then to accept amendments by the European Parliament that go in totally the opposite direction by not reducing administrative costs but increasing them."
"If the European Parliament feels that, in this particular instance, the balance of advantages weighs further in keeping this the way they want, so be it."
"That is a perfectly legitimate viewpoint."
"But this cannot be reconciled with the original objective which you brought forward, which was to reduce costs."
"If Parliament and others feel that for all the reasons you have outlined it should be kept like this, you can hardly expect me to stand up and agree with you that this is going to reduce administrative costs when it is going to do the opposite - in fact it is going to add to costs rather than reduce them."
"The amendments tabled by the two European Parliament committees mean that the only change that Member States would have to implement following the adoption of this directive would make the use of an electronic platform mandatory."
"No reduction in the current administrative burden would be achieved by the savings which we expected from our original proposal, which have been assessed, as I said, in the impact statement, at around EUR 600 million per annum."
"So adopting a directive that leads to no reduction but only to cosmetic changes would definitely give a bad signal concerning the overall reduction of the administrative burden that we have been talking about."
"So I would ask Members of the European Parliament to respect my position also."
"If the view of Parliament seems to follow that particular line - and there will be a vote on it tomorrow - that is your view and you are fully entitled to that position."
"I have no difficulty with it. But you have to respect my position in that I can hardly accept amendments that go in the opposite direction to the original purpose of bringing this forward in the first instance."
"We should not fall out about it, but I will not be in a position to turn logic on its head and say that what the European Parliament is doing is all right, because it is increasing administrative costs rather than reducing them."
"I can listen to the reasons you put forward for keeping it as it is - and perhaps there is some validity in them - but that is not what we started off doing; that is not the reason why we brought forward this particular proposal."
"So, c'est la vie!"
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I would like to make a comment about the procedure."
"Mrs van den Burg already said that the French presidency has not behaved very well with this dossier."
"We have tried to propose several possibilities for trialogue meetings to discuss possible compromises."
"Unfortunately the French presidency is unwilling to come to these meetings."
"They are unwilling to organise meetings in the Council working group in order to discuss the way forward."
"Also they are not present here today to discuss this very important matter."
"The view of the Committee on Legal Affairs gives a lot of flexibility for the Member States."
"It gives much more flexibility than my personal view."
"However, the view of the Committee on Legal Affairs is going as far as we can possibly go."
"This is the only proposal on the table in Parliament at the moment."
"My opinion is that if the Council is not able to accept Parliament's view, i.e. the view of the Committee on Legal Affairs - which is to be voted on tomorrow - as we have requested them to do, then we have to go to second reading."
"We cannot allow Council to play us."
"If this is not accepted in the form voted on tomorrow by Parliament, we will certainly have a delay in the process."
"Perhaps we will not have this project ready before the elections and there is a risk perhaps that the Commission will withdraw the proposal."
"I think that it would be very disappointing if Council does not have a qualified majority behind it and does not come up with proposals on how to reach a compromise."
"We would be willing to discuss compromises."
"I would personally be very happy if the Council would propose something in the trialogue meeting on which we could then base the compromise, but it is hiding and not coming to meetings and it is not organising trialogues."
"It leaves us in a very difficult situation."
"That is why I am upset about the discussions about the procedure."
"I hope that the Commission does not withdraw the proposal."
"I hope there will still be an opportunity to have a compromise that would suit all the Member States and also the European Parliament."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"European statistics (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr A. Schwab, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on European Statistics - C6-0346/2007 -."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I am sorry to see Commissioner McCreevy leaving the Chamber as with this dossier he could have experienced the conclusion of a very successful and relatively lengthy procedure with the European Parliament."
"This experience is now reserved for you, Commissioner Almunia."
"I am pleased that today we can bring a successful, lengthy process to its conclusion at first reading, with a large degree of consensus."
"To begin with, I would also - in contrast to the previous dossier - like to thank the Slovenian and French Presidencies of the Council for the sustained and sometimes difficult negotiations that you have conducted in order to reach a compromise."
"This dossier also involves reducing the administrative burden with regard to statistics within the European Union, as well as for companies at local level."
"Therefore I believe that we can put this report in the context of reducing bureaucracy."
"In Germany, for example, the proportion of costs for official statistics is, according to calculations by the Deutsches Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung (German Institute for Economic Research), less than 10% of total bureaucratic costs when analysing the entire economy."
"This is approximately EUR 230 million."
"If we, as the European Union, really can take this situation in hand, I believe that we will make an important step towards less bureaucracy by reducing statistics-based obligations."
"Thank you, Commissioner Almunia, for your proposal."
"Now I would like to discuss the new regulation on European statistics specifically."
"The regulation on European statistics represents the legal structure for producing statistics at European level and revises the existing basic legal framework for producing statistics at European level."
"Even though the shadow rapporteurs from the other Groups are not present this evening, I would still like to take this opportunity to thank you for the constructive cooperation."
"The discussions were not easy but they proved successful in the end."
"The proposal is part of a whole series of regulations which the Commission has adopted in the current legislative term in connection with producing and distributing statistics and which were debated in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"We will make the following changes to the contents of this regulation proposal."
"We will redefine the European statistical system and fix its activities within Community law."
"We will define the role of the national statistical offices within the European statistical system, while at the same time ensuring that the subsidiarity principle continues to be fully applied in the Member States, as is prescribed, and we will strive for reference to the European Statistics Code of Practice and its entrenchment in Community law."
"In this respect, a response is being made to the difficult situation concerning statistics after the introduction of the euro in some of the Member States of the European Union."
"Finally, the proposal sets up two different bodies - an ESS Partnership Group and an ESS Committee - which together replace the former Statistical Programme Committee."
"The clear-cut committee vote and a successful trialogue prove that coherent legislation has been achieved."
"In the minutes that remain, I would like to present this legislative project once again in connection with two important issues."
"We have been able to ensure that, in the future, this regulation will enable Eurostat to gain faster, unrestricted access to all the statistical data which is required to collect important economic criteria."
"In this way, we will provide a bit more transparency for statistics at European level and therefore make the euro area that bit more competitive."
"This is good news, particularly in the light of the financial crisis and the difficult discussions concerning the statistical system."
"Secondly, I believe that it is very important that this report reinforces the scientific independence of statistics even more."
"This is a positive signal to the staff working in this sector."
"Finally, I am grateful that a compromise with all the Member States has been achieved."
"I know - even though the Council's benches are empty this evening - that it was not easy for many people, but I believe that with this regulation proposal we are able to satisfy all those involved and that we can be happy with the regulation."
"I would like to thank you for listening and for the successful cooperation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, official statistics undoubtedly play a fundamental role in today's society."
"Institutions, policy makers, economic operators, markets and individuals rely heavily on statistics to describe as accurately as possible the developments in economic, social, environmental, cultural and other spheres."
"Statistical information underpins transparency and openness of policy decisions, and official statistics therefore represent a public good providing a basis for the smooth functioning of democracy."
"At European level, European Statistics are increasingly important for the development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies decided here, in this Parliament, and in the Council, and that we propose from the Commission."
"The objective of the Commission proposal being debated today is to revise the basic legal framework governing the production of statistics at European level."
"I want to welcome the rigorous work carried out in a constructive spirit by this Parliament, and in particular by Mr Schwab as rapporteur and by Mrs Ferreira - who is not here today, but is represented by Mrs van den Burg - and Mrs Starkevičiūtė, who worked in cooperation with Eurostat and the Commission to arrive at this debate."
"This revision is led by changes in society and the need to more clearly define the role of the European Statistical System (ESS)."
"The previous Regulation on this subject dates from 1997 and, since then, many things have changed which have necessitated this revision."
"This revision will give a new impetus to the established cooperation between the national statistical institutes of our 27 Member States and Eurostat and will undoubtedly lay down the foundation to address the statistical challenges of the future."
"Furthermore, this revision is the culmination of a series of measures undertaken by the Commission since 2005, with the support of this Parliament and the Council, to modernise the governance of the European Statistical System."
"In this process, the European Statistical Governance Advisory Board and the European Statistical Advisory Committee have been set up and will shortly begin work."
"In this respect, as proposed by the new regulation, in order to enhance trust in European Statistics, the statistical authorities must enjoy professional independence and ensure impartiality and high quality in the production of European Statistics, in accordance with the principles laid down in the European Statistics Code of Practice endorsed by the Commission in its Recommendation on the independence, integrity and accountability of national and Community statistical authorities."
"I should also mention, among the principles having guided the Commission proposal and set out in Mr Schwab's report, the objective that the proposed improved regulatory environment for European Statistics should respond to the need to minimise the response burdens on businesses and contribute to the more general objective of a reduction of administrative burdens arising at European level."
"I must conclude, Mr President, by once again thanking the rapporteur, Mr Schwab, and the whole of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for their excellent work aimed at giving the Union a more solid and reliable statistical structure which will, in a context of total security, prove extraordinary useful in these times of crisis in which the production of statistics, particularly statistics on public accounts, will play an even more crucial role."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, there are times when politicians might like to influence statistics - particularly at the moment."
"If the statistics on the economy are so bad, you might wish to take them away and dream that it is different and that this does not influence the spirit of consumers etc."
"I fully agree with what everyone says about this report: that decent, true and fair statistics are an important instrument for politics and that this is an important reason to have independent statistical bodies to present these statistics."
"I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur and the Commission on the proposals on this regulation."
"We had good cooperation with the Council to reach compromises on what we have stated in this document."
"It is important to have these independent bodies to have a clear contact point for the Commission in the Member States and for this European system of statistics to include the statistics code of practice, which has been elaborated by the experts, into European legislation."
"I think this is a good achievement and I hope that it will really work and help us to overcome the bad statistics and really try to face the recession that is coming and get clearer measures to counter it."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (LT) We are considering a very important document, which should help reform the European Statistical System."
"I would like to point out, as my colleagues did, that the European Parliament rapporteur, the Working Group on Statistical Reform and experts from the Council, the Presidency and the Commission were very thorough in their preparation of this document."
"It is a splendid example of our joint efforts."
"In the last few days, weighed down by various problems, perhaps we have sometimes blamed each other, but if we all work together, we can achieve really good results."
"The ALDE Group supports the proposal presented and hopes that it will lay out our regulations in the area of statistics."
"Above all, statistics must be reliable, protected from the influence of various interest groups."
"Today doubts do still occasionally arise, especially as regards the quality of state financial statistics."
"When talking about financial market statistics, there are problems of confidentiality and here we also have to work with the European Central Bank."
"The quality of statistical data depends not only on the quality of work done by specialised institutions, but also on the methods used and we would like academic institutions to play a more active role in the preparation of these."
"The gathering of statistical data must be organised more effectively using data from existing state registers, applying generalised methods and thereby reducing the administrative burden of statistical reports on business."
"There are certainly many untapped reserves in this area."
"Economic and social development is dynamic in today's world, therefore statistical data should be presented in a more effective manner, so that decisions can be taken more quickly."
"Let us hope that statistical reform will also help solve this problem."
"The European Statistical Programme is financed by the European Union budget."
"I would like to hope that the proposals presented will help these programmes to be better coordinated, which will allow Community capital to be used more effectively."
"Mr President, I simply want to reiterate my thanks to the rapporteur and the Members who have just spoken for their excellent work."
"As said by Mrs Starkevičiūtė, working together produces results like these which are positive for everyone."
"What I hope, as do we all, is that, through these excellent statistics, we will shortly be able to offer our citizens good news on the economic situation."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, many thanks for the constructive comments at the end, and above all for the constructive cooperation."
"I do not want to repeat anything that has already been said."
"Therefore I would like to mention two items that, in my opinion, should be thought through as a follow-up to the discussion on this report."
"Firstly, the fact is that we have been dealing with Article 285 of the EU Treaty, which discusses the scientific independence of the statistical authorities."
"In this report we have now also placed a strong emphasis on professional independence as we have discovered that there have been difficulties in this regard in the past. It may also have to be enshrined appropriately in primary law at some point, to ensure long-term clarity."
"However, I would expressly like to add that, with regard to German law, this does not mean that there can be independence with respect to professional supervisory regulations."
"Secondly, this report places setting priorities for producing statistical data and recording it very much in the foreground."
"Mrs Starkevičiūthas also pointed this out."
"Commissioner Almunia, I hope that by setting these priorities we can also manage to reduce the statistical burden for medium-sized companies in the medium term, as we will be able to search for data which we actually need for our statistics in an even more targeted way."
"With this in mind, thank you very much."
"I hope that the vote is completed quickly tomorrow."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"A facility providing financial assistance for Member States' balances of payments - Financial support to Member States (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate:"
"on the report by Mrs Berès, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 332/2002 establishing a facility providing medium-term financial assistance for Member States' balances of payments - C6-0389/2008 -;"
"the Commission statement on financial support to Member States."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, behind this obscure title, each person is assessing the importance of the discussion we are holding this evening following Hungary's request for financing, which was first made to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)."
"The European Union has looked at the issue to verify the conditions under which it could give its support to one of the Member States."
"It is true that there was a discussion amongst the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs as to why Hungary first approached the IMF."
"That is a question for Hungary as a country, as a member of the European Union of some years standing, and also for the institutions of the European Union in the sense that, manifestly, at this stage, we have been unable sufficiently to develop this climate of confidence, this climate of solidarity, this climate of cooperation to allow a country like Hungary, in its current difficult situation, to consider that its first circle of solidarity, its first circle of cooperation, should be the European Union."
"I believe, finally, that the plan implemented for a balance of payments assistance facility, on the basis of Article 119, achieved on the initiative of the Commission and Mr Almunia, whom I thank, will allow an appropriate solution to be found jointly with the IMF."
"Evidently, we all think now that, unfortunately, Hungary's situation is not an isolated case, and we must in some way consolidate the cushion which will allow the European Union to meet such requests."
"In the resolution that we adopted in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and that I hope will be supported by plenary tomorrow, we ask the Commission to examine how and whether the banks of some Member States of the Union have helped to aggravate this situation."
"I believe that this is important information for the European Parliament to have in the coming debate, and which, doubtless, Jacques de Larosière's group will examine thereafter."
"We have also said that we think, essentially, that the Council's proposal was to raise the level of the facilities to a given threshold, which we have accepted, believing that this, perhaps, will not be the last discussion we will have with the Commission."
"At this stage, we understand that this is the basis for agreement in the negotiations with the Council and, therefore, we accept this situation."
"In the future, we hope that the European Commission, Council and Parliament will all regularly approve these amounts, because, in 2002, when the European Parliament voted on the Regulation we are now amending, we asked for a regular update to be organised."
"Evidently, and unfortunately, I have to say that we were right."
"We are now therefore asking you for it again, Commissioner, and I believe it is reasonable to ask that it be carried out in that manner."
"Finally, in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I asked for the tools and processes of Article 100 of the Treaty to enable us to act to support some Member States more widely, and not just on balance of payments problems."
"Unfortunately, I was not supported by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in this matter, but I am using my position as rapporteur to urge the Commission to examine this mechanism which the Treaty offers us and which, to date, we have failed fully to exploit."
"Mr President, Mrs Berès, ladies and gentlemen, when the founding fathers of the European Union drafted the Treaty of Rome, they had the foresight to include, in one of its articles, a mechanism to help Member States whose balance of payments was seriously threatened."
"That foresight in that article of the Treaty of Rome has been passed on through successive treaty reforms and is now in Article 119 of the current Treaty."
"After many years of non-use, this legal basis has now been used by the Commission to assist a Member State which needed urgent help, namely Hungary."
"This article of the Treaty was developed in a 2002 Regulation which is what we have used in the case of Hungary and which is what we are now proposing to amend with regard to the maximum ceiling of the amounts that can be made available to help Member States facing this kind of difficulty."
"Yesterday we debated in this House the ten years of Economic and Monetary Union."
"This afternoon we have debated the economic situation."
"Yesterday and again today we have discussed the problems caused by this situation and, unfortunately, there are some EU Member States which are outside the euro area and whose macroeconomic and financial imbalances are putting them in a particularly vulnerable position, given market pressures."
"In the case of Hungary and in light of these difficulties, at some point the Hungarian authorities contacted the International Monetary Fund (IMF)."
"Immediately after establishing contact with the IMF, they contacted the European Commission."
"As I have said to the Hungarian authorities, this was not the right procedure for a Member State."
"The logical procedure is firstly to contact the European authorities and then, if necessary - and in the case of Hungary, it undoubtedly was - to jointly contact the IMF."
"I must say to you all that the IMF and its Managing Director, Mr Strauss-Kahn, have proved to be absolutely open to this cooperation between the IMF and the European Commission, the European authorities and the EU Member States which are members of the euro area and need to access the facilities provided by the IMF."
"In the case of Hungary, we have acted in cooperation."
"Although the procedure was not started correctly, the end result has been right as we have acted in cooperation."
"The European Union is providing Hungary with EUR 6 500 million within a global aid package worth EUR 20 000 million."
"This same approach, but in this case using the right procedure of firstly contacting the European authorities and then jointly contacting the IMF, is now being used in the case of another country."
"Unfortunately, the situation is proving so difficult that this may not be the last case, or at least we should be prepared for there to be other cases, other Member States which need this type of help."
"That is why, at the same time as we presented the Council with the proposal to help Hungary, by using Article 119 of the Treaty and the 2002 Regulation, we also presented a proposal to raise the maximum ceiling of the facility established by the 2002 Regulation to EUR 25 000 million."
"Hopefully we will not have to use these funds, but we cannot rule out this possibility."
"If we have to use them, then we must demonstrate our solidarity, as the founding fathers did in the Treaty of Rome in 1957, and we must also plan for a possible increase in the ceiling above EUR 25 000 million, if this proves necessary."
"As a result, I would ask Parliament, when discussing this issue in the future, if this proves necessary, to show the same willingness that I am pleased to witness here today."
"I would ask Parliament to give its opinion quickly and flexibly on help that, due to its very nature and characteristics, will be urgent."
"There are elements in the motion for a resolution tabled by Parliament, together with the debate on the proposal to raise the ceiling of the balance of payments facility, with which I agree."
"These involve concerns about the vulnerability of some of our Member States and about the need to assess how we can protect ourselves and protect those Member States affected by this particular vulnerability, as in the case of Hungary, but which may also arise in the case of other countries."
"We have to make this defence of the stability of Member States' economies and financial positions compatible with the free movement of capital and with the principles on which the internal market is based."
"However, we must be aware that we have to react to unnecessary risks and situations in which certain private interests may threaten the higher interests of Member State citizens and the economic and general security of our States."
"I have taken due note of the suggestions made in this motion for a resolution."
"We will assess these in the Commission and report our findings to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"As stated by Mrs Berès, these will also be conveyed to Mr De Larosière so that his group can present its findings within the period set for its work, in other words by March."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (HU) Thank you for the floor, Mr President."
"As a matter of fact we are faced with a sad situation, since we need to debate a request for immediate assistance."
"I would say, however, that I can make a positive comment because the European Union has finally, after a lot of searching - which was far from easy - discovered Article 119 and the legal basis on which it can provide such assistance."
"For a long time, as the news wafting in from Hungary indicates, they could not find a legal basis for doing so."
"Before going any further, let us examine the reasons for this."
"One reason is convergence - as we debated yesterday - or rather the lack thereof."
"In recent years, there has been no reinvestment in capital movements from east to west within the EU, and consequently there is an enormous capital drain from eastern Member States to the western ones."
"This means we face an ongoing imbalance of payments, which, moreover, will prevent true convergence."
"The other problem is that obviously the surveillance system is incomplete, since the countries which do not use the euro can simply run up debts in foreign currency."
"If I have heard correctly, until now the European Union did not entirely have the power - though in my view it does have a voice - to tell these countries to 'be careful, do not allow the population and businesses to run up endless and irrational debts in foreign currency, because there could be trouble if there is a crisis', and so the problem has indeed arisen."
"Therefore, surveillance must be extended to cover this, and should already have been extended long ago, for as I say, the Commission has a strong voice in Central and Eastern Europe, and can open its mouth."
"The crisis has now arisen."
"The Hungarian Government first ran to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) out of fear, this we know, but they say that they did of course try to approach the EU as well, and that the latter tried systematically to find a legal basis."
"The government also say that they lack sufficient capacity to analyse the crisis."
"To this I say, let us create it."
"It should not be the case that everyone has to rely on the IMF whenever they need crisis analysis."
"What will the outside world think of us, if we try to use IMF funds to rescue Member States of 1-1.5 million inhabitants from an imbalance of payments?"
"A crisis mechanism will not work when a system, at times of crisis, has to stop a capital drain from a non-euro area country, for instance in the monetary sphere, for that is when the drain really begins to operate."
"Even the European Central Bank cannot do much, since in spite of coverage in forints, it does not really want to help with the liquidity problem, although all Hungary needed was foreign currency liquidity, since the banks were not heavily in debt."
"As far as the Hungarian report is concerned, its 2006 analysis began with an improving situation."
"It reminds me a bit of Chernobyl in 1986, when on the first day they reported that there was no problem, and thereafter the situation was steadily improving."
"In the end we worried that there would be negative radiation."
"In this case as well, everyone is forgetting."
"We started out with what happened until 2006, and since then there has been a serious lack of surveillance of currency flows."
"This EUR 25 billion ceiling, I would like to observe, seems very low."
"It includes from the outset that we want to work with the IMF, whereas it is hard to imagine a more terrorising situation than relying on the IMF."
"It would be very important, of course, for the European Parliament to be involved and at the same time to act speedily."
"In my view, the two are now happening at once, and for this I am grateful to the Commission as well as to Parliament."
"I would, however, reiterate that we should create a mechanism which will prevent a recurrence of the various misfortunes that occurred in relation to the Hungarian crisis, and which has done nothing to increase the prestige of the European Union in Central and Eastern Europe. Thank you for the floor, Mr President."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (HU) Thank you for the floor, Mr President."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as I am not a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, please allow me to approach the question before us from a different perspective."
"Last year's financial crisis in America has reached Europe this year, and our financial markets, which we had believed to be stable, were shaken in their very foundations."
"Instead of devising a unified EU solution, it was only after long hesitation that we were able to address the crisis with an individualised, harmonised response that is costing several billion euro per country."
"These individual national solutions cannot be the way to handle crises in the new EU Member States, which are unable on their own to move billions of euro."
"Initially, these countries trusted that, since their banks did not get involved in dubious, speculative overseas transactions, this international credit crisis might not affect them."
"The lack of liquidity and crisis of confidence that accompanied the international financial crisis has, however, greatly shaken the finances of those States that rely on foreign credit, and the speculative attacks on national currencies further contributed to this turbulence."
"In this situation it was important for the new Member States to receive not only moral but concrete, tangible financial assistance from the European Union, and for the EU to extend its protection to those countries that have not yet joined the euro area."
"This is not just solidarity, as inspired by the fundamental European value, but a shared European interest to avoid a domino effect by preventing even a single bank - not to mention an entire country - from becoming insolvent."
"Bearing this in mind, we are now looking at raising the facility from EUR 12 billion to EUR 25 billion."
"In this context, the European Central Bank provided Hungary, which was most severely affected by the crisis on the money markets, with a rescue package of EUR 6.5 billion euro."
"This was a very fair and dignified solution, since Hungary has not only spearheaded reform and European unification for decades, but has also, since last year, halved its approximately 10% budget deficit, in accordance with the convergence programme adopted in 2006; that programme has been implemented systematically since that time, and the deficit this year is being reduced to 3%."
"In order for the consolidation process required by the EU to continue, assistance is needed from international financial bodies."
"As a consequence of the financial and credit crisis, the entire world economy is now facing difficulties; yet individual EU Member States are trying to deal with these with their own instruments and in accordance with their own very specific goals."
"In order that the new Member States, which do not have such instruments at their disposal, should not lose out in the process, what is needed in order for Europe to weather the crisis jointly is not only to harmonise current actions but to adopt a common European strategy to deal with the economic crisis."
"I hope that this financial rescue package constitutes the first rung on this ladder, and that once it has been adopted, we will be able to concentrate all our efforts jointly on solving the crisis of the real economy. Thank you for the floor."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, speaking on behalf of the UEN Group on the Council Regulation establishing a facility providing medium-term financial assistance to EU Member States, I should like to draw attention to the following issues: first, the situation in world financial markets is having an increasingly adverse impact on the real economy, with the result that GDP is expected to fall in 2009 in the US and in many of the European Union's most developed states."
"Second, since those countries constitute the main market for the new EU Member States, this threatens their economic growth and will therefore have an adverse impact on their balance of payments."
"Third, this being the case, we must definitely support raising the ceiling of Community financial assistance to EUR 25 billion for each Member State not in the euro area, because only a ceiling this high will guarantee the effectiveness of any assistance granted by the Community."
"Fourth, should a Member State outside the euro area need immediate financial support, the Council, European Commission and Parliament should act with sufficient speed to prevent confidence in their effectiveness being undermined."
"Fifth and last, we welcome the European Commission's rapid response to Hungary's financial needs, granted in spite of the fact that Hungary had in the first instance approached the International Monetary Fund and not the European Commission."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when I read up on the subject that we are now debating, the balance of payments problem, I felt like Marcel Proust with his madeleine cake, In Search of Lost Time."
"There is an aroma of the 1950s and 1960s about the approach to the problem."
"The balance of payments problem?"
"This is something that we are to set aside EUR 25 billion for."
"Why on earth should we do this?"
"Is this what we are doing today?"
"This is intended for those countries, those poor countries, as I understand it, that are in the EU but not in the currency union and that may then need to be rescued from a fate worse than death: the balance of payments problem."
"This has, in that case, been created by the European Union itself, of course."
"What we are talking about here no longer exists in fact."
"My own country, Sweden, is part of the EU and loyally supports it, implementing everything that is decided there much better than most other countries, but we have not joined the monetary union."
"Wisely so, in my opinion."
"However, if we should now experience problems in Sweden, will we then have a balance of payments problem?"
"The answer is, of course, no."
"Naturally, it is possible to imagine that Sweden could start to mismanage its economy and experience a much higher rate of inflation and increase in wages than other countries."
"What happens then?"
"Do we get a balance of payments problem?"
"No, the Swedish krona falls to compensate for this."
"Nothing else happens at all."
"This is also the case in other countries in the same situation, for example in the United Kingdom."
"What is the problem then?"
"Well, the problem is that, if these countries are members of the European Union - which they should be - but are not members of the monetary union - which they should not be - then they are to be forced, as you intend, to keep a fixed exchange rate with the euro."
"The worst-case scenario is to be forced to keep a fixed exchange rate with your most important trading partners."
"It is clear that if a country mismanages its economy, experiences a higher inflation rate or suffers a structural setback in its most important export industry, its exports will decline and its imports increase."
"Suddenly the question is, how is this to be financed?"
"This is, however, a totally artificial situation."
"It is thoroughly old fashioned for countries that are not members of the monetary union to choose to fix their exchange rate and then need to be rescued by the International Monetary Fund or the EU or by anyone else."
"Why, for goodness sake, should this happen?"
"It is a form of economic policy that is completely out of date."
"Either a country joins a monetary union - that could be right sometimes, I agree - or it remains outside, standing on its own two feet with its own independent monetary policy, and takes care of itself."
"If the country takes care of itself, nothing in particular will happen."
"If it mismanages itself, the currency will fall to compensate for that."
"This is not particularly dangerous, either."
"I would therefore like to point out that, while we are discussing whether we should set aside EUR 25 billion for this purpose, it is a purpose that is actually not at all necessary."
"It is a problem that we have created ourselves, or rather you have created yourselves."
"Put an end to it."
"Those countries that are members of the EU but have not joined the monetary union should maintain a regime with a floating exchange rate."
"Then the problem disappears."
"- (SK) The limit for mutual assistance to an EU Member State that is not a member of the euro area and that is experiencing balance of payment difficulties or is facing the risk of serious problems as a result of an overall disequilibrium in its balance of payments is currently EUR 12 billion."
"The examples of Denmark and Hungary show that the consequences of financial crises in some states can be so great that, if such a crisis occurred in a larger state, then this limit would be too low."
"I would therefore like to stress that I do not consider the primary reason for increasing this limit to be either the expansion of the European Union or the greater number of states outside the euro area, as is stated in the explanatory report."
"We need to be aware that the financial problems in some Member States are mainly the result of inconsistent economic and social policies."
"These problems are aggravated and made more profound by the financial crisis, thereby creating pressure for increased levels of assistance."
"Hungary is just a typical example."
"I support increasing the limit on medium-term assistance to EUR 25 billion."
"I also support, however, the opinion of the European Parliament that there is no need to create a special process allowing the Commission to revise this limit outside the usual decision-making procedures."
"I believe that such an approach will maintain high levels of diligence in the assistance system while also giving sufficient scope for action."
"I mention this as Hungary is a textbook example, since its political leadership has been unable to decide on reform and recovery measures for a long time."
"In the final analysis, the adoption and implementation of such measures could also lessen the impact of the financial crisis in this country and reduce the need for financial assistance from the European Union."
"On the other hand, however, I must defend Hungary over the fact that the new rules for financial markets must not allow excessive flow of liquidity from subsidiary banks to parent banks and that a sufficient level of supervision must be maintained over national central banks."
"It is true that he who acts in haste may pay twice over, but it is also true that he who takes in haste will not always pay back on time or in full."
"It is therefore essential for the system to set out clear rules in respect of assistance, based on a regime of recovery measures which covers both schedules and matter-of-fact issues."
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, may I begin by responding briefly to two statements made by fellow Members."
"First, I should like to point out that countries not in the euro area are not required to maintain a fixed exchange rate with the euro."
"Poland is an example of a country with a floating exchange rate."
"Second, I should like to say that even a country which has a perfect domestic policy and makes no mistakes could be affected by the crisis, due to the contagion effect."
"Of course, the Hungarian situation largely originated in incorrect government policy, but Hungary had also been affected by a flight of capital, which was not the result of the Hungarian situation, but had external causes."
"Commissioner, I wish to support the Commission's proposal."
"It seems to me to take into account the fact that we are all in a single market, and that the situation of individual countries is of importance to the other countries."
"We should therefore be aware of the ties that bind us and feel a sense of joint responsibility for our partners."
"The proposal is also an expression of European solidarity, which should be among the main values underlying our actions."
"The amount of EUR 25 billion proposed by the Commission seems reasonable, though of course there could be situations requiring more money, and therefore I also support the proposal to grant the Commission the right to decide to revise the ceiling where there is an urgent need to do so."
"It is my view that using the full procedure involving the consent of Parliament or a parliamentary consultation would be impractical in such circumstances."
"Let us suppose that a crisis occurs in the summer, when Parliament is not sitting."
"It is hard to imagine that we would wait six weeks for Parliament to convene before helping the relevant state."
"I therefore support the Commission's proposal granting it the right to raise the ceiling within a very short period of time."
"May I also say that I see the proposal as lacking a reference to possible action on the part of the European Central Bank."
"The Bank granted a loan to Hungary."
"This action should be coordinated, and it is my view that a reference should be included."
"Finally, I think that the proposal should not refer to Article 100 of the Treaty."
"Article 100 deals with quite different situations and should therefore be treated separately."
"(HU) Thank you, Mr President."
"Commissioner, Mrs Berès, it is precisely the principle of solidarity that makes Europe more than an economic association and enables it to display the features of a strong political community."
"When the crisis began, it seemed for a moment that Europe would split in two economically and socially, but thanks to rapid and effective action by the Commission, we were able to prevent that from happening."
"Hungary turned first to the European Union to ask for its assistance."
"However, the EUR 20 billion which we needed in support, or financing, would not have been possible from that source alone."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Commissioner and the European Parliament for their quick response, for the solidarity of our colleagues, which shows the value of being European. Thank you for your attention."
"(DE) Mr President, the proposal concerning amending the Regulation on assistance for Member States which are not part of the euro area, in order to increase the ceiling from EUR 12 to 25 billion, if they are hit by grave payment difficulties, has been made at the last moment."
"The primary requirement for ensuring that these ad hoc measures work is that the EU does not make the same mistakes as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) with respect to counter demands."
"At the IMF, Mr Strauss-Kahn alone is not a guarantee of a sensible policy."
"We know the shock therapies used for countries devastated by crises in the old neo-liberal style only too well."
"We also know those who have previously profited from this only too well."
"I hope that better, more sustainable stability will be achieved using the EU tool, based on the example of Hungary."
"Hungary shows us in particular that the EU has to realise that it was the conservative opposition that obstructed Hungary's premier with respect to stability and reform measures."
"The stability of Hungary will certainly not be achieved by curbing social expenditure alone, social expenditure which is actually not too high anyway; this will only help the anti-European right-wing populists."
"Yes, Hungary has been put under pressure, especially due to the rapid depreciation of the forint, which hedge funds have been partially responsible for."
"In the case of Iceland, the IMF has demonstrated that it is still enforcing shock therapies, for example by imposing high base interest rates to the detriment of the national economy concerned, in this case the national economy of Iceland."
"Commissioner, please take into account that I do not want my neighbour Hungary to be plummeted into social conflict due to corrective measures such as this based on counter demands."
"Hungary needs confidence-building, supportive action from the European Union, which, after all, will help not only Hungary but all of us."
"(DE) Mr President, I believe that this debate is taking place at exactly the right time."
"I would like to remind you that Hungary is the country that has used the budget deficit to the greatest degree: minus 5%."
"This shows us that stability in this country also has a political background."
"It makes no sense that, in the future, we abandon the state - and after all, this refers to all the taxpayers - to the risks involved in some businesses."
"In this case I completely agree with Mr Ettl, we cannot burden the taxpayers with the risks of hedge funds and derivatives as this would lead to limited purchasing power."
"This is precisely what we need in Hungary: more purchasing power."
"We need people to invest in the country and in the companies again and this means that we need tax reductions so that investment is possible once more and not only for companies but, above all, for employees."
"I believe that I am drawing the right conclusions."
"Decisive factors are that allowances are granted, for example for energy efficiency measures, that investment bonuses are given, and that appropriate progressive depreciation is carried out."
"I would like to ask Commissioner Kovács, who comes from Hungary, to set up appropriate initiatives at European level."
"Mr President, I came down to the Chamber while I was watching the debate in my office just to make, I suppose, a broad point."
"In Ireland we have the bank guarantee scheme, because of the financial crisis, and we have more unity now in the EU as to how we deal with this."
"But we now realise that our banks will need to be recapitalised and, perhaps, as a matter of more urgency than we first thought."
"I wish to express the hope that that would happen, because we have a real problem, as was said by the previous speaker."
"We need people to spend and to invest and there just are no credit lines available."
"I think it is most important that something happens swiftly to restore confidence and capital to the banking system."
". - (RO) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that we have this opportunity this evening to discuss such an important issue, the economic crisis, which is affecting not only Member States, but the whole world."
"We therefore need to find solutions to this problem."
"Mutual support for Member States should be one of the steps to be taken in this direction."
"Bearing in mind that we want EU Member States to resort to this fund when necessary, we must welcome the decision made by European political leaders at last week's summit."
"I believe that this European financial assistance fund for Member States needs to be increased to at least EUR 25 billion for one reason: we need to save this market economy."
"Before I finish, I would like to express my confidence that we will take the measures required to overcome this crisis, both at a European and global level. We urgently need to find the resources required to avert the problems which our citizens are going to be faced with, such as unemployment."
"We all wish the best for the EU."
"(LT) I would like to thank the Commissioner for pointing out quite rightly today that this problem is linked to the question of how to make the free movement of capital compatible with the stability of macroeconomic nations."
"I do not really like my fellow Members saying that this is a problem for the poor countries of the European Union."
"Ladies and gentlemen, if the economies of Germany and France were to grow by 2 and 3 percent, that would pose no problem for those of us who have integrated into the common market."
"Therefore, if some kind of package is also required as a stimulus for national economies, it should be implemented by the countries mentioned and then we would not be talking about stabilisation funds."
"In truth, we do not need that money, but guarantees that the European common market will function well and grow."
"If there are such guarantees, which must be achieved through our joint efforts, then all the problems will be solved."
"Mr President, I want to thank the Members for the support expressed in most of their speeches for the Commission's decisions and proposals on this issue."
"I should like to make three very quick comments on three of the issues raised in your speeches."
"Firstly, I share Mr Becsey's concern about the risks posed by families and businesses taking on debts in foreign currencies, in countries which have a floating exchange rate and which are subject to risks of excessive volatility in their exchange rate, as was the case with Hungary."
"Mr Becsey knows of my concern because the budgetary and economic surveillance that we carry out in the Commission is sometimes not sufficiently heard or heeded or does not have the desired effects when comments are made on this type of risk."
"We are, I believe, more effective in budgetary surveillance."
"The case of Hungary is very positive in this sense, given the major budgetary adjustment that has occurred in that country between 2006 and now."
"However, on the other hand, we have had no success in terms of the risks posed by taking on debts in foreign currencies."
"I hope that, from now on, given the circumstances not only in Hungary but also in other EU countries due to the crisis and excessive volatility in many financial indicators, particularly in exchange rates, this type of comment and recommendation will be heeded more."
"Mr Lundgren is no longer here but he made comments that were totally incorrect."
"He criticised Hungary and the Commission for recommending to Hungary that it should have a fixed exchange rate, whereas the situation is exactly the opposite."
"In other words, the exchange rate in Hungary is floating and the excessive volatility in this exchange rate aggravated the problems and was one of the factors that caused the crisis having led to the request for this help."
"As a result, when criticisms are made, people should ensure that these are based on correct information and not on totally wrong information."
"If Mr Lundgren had stayed until the end of this debate, he would have been aware that his information was totally wrong."
"As he is not here, I hope that one of you will let him know."
"Finally, with regard to the comments made by Mr Rübig on the deficit, it is not true that Hungary has a 5% deficit as this has been significantly reduced."
"In 2008 the deficit will be clearly below this figure, in fact it will be below 3%, and in the commitment made by Hungary as a condition of this help, the target deficit for next year is 2.6%."
"Therefore, if this target is met - and I hope that it will be - Hungary will have to face another kind of problem."
"Undoubtedly it will have to face this and will continue to do so, unfortunately, but at least next year it will not have an excessive deficit."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have four comments."
"The first is that the Commissioner is asking us to give a fast, flexible response to any such new request. I believe that the European Parliament has shown that it can come up to the mark."
"Today, we are accepting the threshold of EUR 25 billion to amend the 2002 liability regulation, insofar as we know the conditions for negotiating with the Council, but of course, we are showing ourselves to be open and available to, unfortunately, envisaging other scenarios."
"My second comment is to remind you that, for us, one of the lessons of this stage of European integration is that, for each Member State, whether or not they belong to the euro area, the first circle of solidarity, the first circle for discussions, should be the European Union."
"I hope that, today, for each of us, for the institutions and for the Member States, that is clear."
"My third comment is to note with satisfaction the Commission's commitment to make public, or first to examine, then make public, both in our Economic and Monetary Committee and in Mr de Larosière's group, the lessons to be learned from the situation which has developed in Hungary."
"My final comment is to note with you that, in this crisis, everyone believed that there would be two channels for transmitting the crisis, the complex financial markets on one hand and, on the other, the real economy."
"In fact, we now see that there is a third transmission channel, namely, the movements of capital which can affect even simpler, less opaque financial markets."
"This is why the interweaving of the real economy and the financial markets, whose extent, I believe, we have yet fully to gauge, is so important."
"Unfortunately, we are finding out more day by day, and we are faced with an issue which needs us to show flexibility and collective intelligence to find suitable solutions."
"Parliament has, I believe, once again shown its ability and desire to contribute to finding suitable solutions to each new aspect of this crisis whilst hoping that, finally, we will also find what we need to allow our economy to face the challenges in these very difficult times."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 20 November 2008."
"Documents received: see Minutes"
"Agenda of the next sitting: see Minutes"
"Closure of the sitting"
"(The sitting closed at 22.50.)"
"Opening of the sitting"
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (NL) Mr President, on a point of order, I should like to make a request on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance with regard to tomorrow's debate and vote on Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), or the Gräßle report, in other words."
"It appears that the Commission is considering ending the present process of reviewing the regulation further to recent revelations about irregularities within OLAF, and would consequently like to withdraw the present proposals in the course of the codecision procedure with Parliament."
"On behalf of the Group of the Greens, I should like to ask you to check with the Commission to see whether this is the case, and if it would issue a statement before tomorrow's debate, so that the European Parliament knows whether the debate and the vote still have any value."
"The question was addressed to the Commission."
"Mrs Ferrero-Waldner will have the opportunity to answer it."
"I welcome Mr Jouyet."
"We are all here and can start on the next item of business."
"Documents received: see Minutes"
"Response of the European Union to the deteriorating situation in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statement on the response of the European Union to the deteriorating situation in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, my dear Benita, ladies and gentlemen, I know how concerned you are, as are we, by the deteriorating situation in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo and I recall, as we have already debated the matter with you, that we were becoming increasingly worried when we raised the issue in your Committee on Foreign Affairs in October."
"The Foreign Ministers of the Union discussed the issue at length in the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 10 November last and the President decided to put this item on the agenda for the next General Affairs and External Relations Council on 8 December, in the presence of the Commission, represented by Louis Michel and Benita Ferrero-Waldner."
"It must be said that the situation in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo has deteriorated greatly since the end of August, when the CNDP, led by rebel leader Laurent Nkunda, launched an offensive against the Congolese armed forces."
"The latter proved unable to resist, leaving only MONUC, the United Nations peacekeeping force, to protect the civilian population."
"The rebels' successes on the ground took them to the gates of Goma, the provincial capital of North Kivu, and enabled them to significantly extend their area of influence in this border province with Rwanda."
"The continuing crisis once again shows the potential for instability which is caused by the presence of all the rebel groups in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo: not only the CNDP, but also the Hutu rebels of the FDLR."
"The rout of the Congolese armed forces also shows that this complex crisis cannot be settled by a military solution and that the path to a sustainable settlement requires a political solution which takes into account both the local and the regional players."
"I will return to this in a moment."
"In the depths of the crisis and at the height of the offensive by Laurent Nkunda's rebel forces, the European Union mobilised vigorously, followed by the rest of the international community."
"The urgent task, you will recall, was first to prevent the capture of Goma and to try to stabilise the conflict."
"That is why Commissioner Louis Michel went out to the region to see for himself."
"On 1 and 2 November, he was followed by Bernard Kouchner, in his role as President-in-Office of the Council, and David Miliband."
"The political message of restraint was delivered by both ministers, in Kinshasa, Kigali and Dar es Salaam."
"The ministers also went to Goma to demonstrate, on the ground, that our full attention is on this crisis, to assess the requirements of the displaced populations, and to meet the humanitarian organisations since, once again, the civilian population is the first victim of the resumption of fighting."
"This fighting has led to a major deterioration in the humanitarian situation."
"It is estimated that a further 250 000 people have been displaced in the most dramatic conditions, taking the current total to over one million displaced persons in the province of North Kivu alone."
"Add to this the serious infringements of human rights perpetrated by the rebel groups, including summary execution, widespread sexual violence, the recruitment of child soldiers and acts of pillage, both by the rebel groups and certain elements in the Congolese armed forces."
"The resumption of fighting has also interrupted the implementation of the agreements concluded in November 2007 between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, known as the Nairobi process, with which you are familiar and which focuses on the struggle against the Rwandan Hutu rebels of the FDLR located in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"The agreement between the Congolese government and the Congolese rebel groups, including Mr Nkunda's CNDP, in January 2008, known as the Goma process, has also broken down."
"The priority, currently, is to deal with the humanitarian emergency and secure access to the displaced populations."
"In accordance with its mandate, MONUC is playing an essential role."
"It is presently continuing to reinforce its measures in North Kivu and we encourage it to continue its efforts in this direction."
"The Secretary-General of the United Nations has requested extra resources for this mission and discussions on this matter, which we hope to see concluded very quickly, have begun in the Security Council."
"Faced with the emergency, the European Union has significantly strengthened its humanitarian efforts."
"Many Member States, as well as the Commission, have made exceptional emergency contributions to support the actions of the non-governmental organisations and the United Nations agencies, such as the World Food Programme, and the High Commissioner for Refugees."
"Extra provision, to a current value of over EUR 43 million, in the form of contributions to the airlift - I am referring to countries like the United Kingdom, Belgium and Italy - make Europe the main contributor, by far, to the humanitarian effort undertaken in this crisis."
"Now we need to re-launch the dynamic which will give a sustainable settlement to the issue of the illegal armed groups operating in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, all of the illegal armed groups, whether they be Congolese or foreigners, in the knowledge that there is no military solution to the crisis and that any solution requires the re-launch of the Goma and Nairobi processes which I have just described and which form the appropriate framework for the lasting stabilisation of the situation in this Congolese province."
"The resumption of dialogue and cooperation between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda is essential in this matter, and I wish to acknowledge the action of the European Union's special representative to the African Great Lakes, Roeland Van de Geer, in attempting to resume the threads of this dialogue."
"It is around these objectives that the international community, in particular the European Union, has mobilised in the last few weeks."
"These efforts have borne their first fruits, especially in the resumption of the dialogue between Kinshasa and Kigali at ministerial level and in the organisation, in Nairobi on 7 November, at the initiative of the states of the Great Lakes Region and the African Union, of an international summit dedicated to the crisis in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, in which, in particular, the Congolese and Rwandan presidents, Joseph Kabila and Paul Kagame, participated."
"Amongst the main advances of this summit, we should especially note the commitment of the states in the region to send, if necessary, peace-keeping forces to the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo and, if necessary, to appoint a high-level team of facilitators, consisting of the former president of Nigeria, Mr Obasanjo, and the former president of Tanzania, Mr Mkapa."
"At its extraordinary summit in Johannesburg, on 10 November, the SADC also stated its readiness, if need be, to send a peace-keeping force to the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"The European Union welcomes the commitment of the African states and remains determined to continue its cooperation with the UN, the African Union and the countries of the Great Lakes region to achieve a solution to this crisis."
"However, let us be clear that it will not be possible to resolve this crisis without strengthening the resources designed to stabilise the peace, especially those of the United Nations."
"Member of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, first, I will quickly say to Mr van Buitenen that I have indeed noted what he said and that I will certainly take his message to my colleagues, who will definitely reply tomorrow."
"Mr President, honourable Members and Mr President-in-Office of the Council, my dear Jean-Pierre, today I am standing in for my fellow Commissioner, Louis Michel, who is unable to take part in this session for health reasons, and who has asked me to send his apologies to you."
"You know the regard in which Commissioner Michel holds the Great Lakes region."
"Indeed, as the President of the Council has already stated, he was the first to travel to the Democratic Republic of Congo and to Rwanda, on 30 and 31 October last, at the height of the crisis, to try to resolve matters."
"From this shadow diplomacy mission arose the idea of organising the Nairobi conference, whose practical conclusions today give us new prospects for emerging from the crisis."
"As for the response that the Commission is able to make, I would like to share with you an analysis of the situation from two aspects, although these are very similar to those described by the President of the Council."
"First, on the humanitarian level: the international community, including the European Union, is in the process of providing a response to the crisis."
"The Commission immediately mobilised EUR 6.3 million to meet emergency needs."
"However, we remain very vigilant, so that we can adapt this amount as the situation develops; the humanitarian needs are, on the whole, covered in Kivu and there is really good coordination between the humanitarian agencies."
"The Commission and the Member States jointly announced, in Marseille on 14 November, new contributions totalling an extra EUR 43.5 million to meet the crisis."
"The biggest problem remains, however, one of access to the populations in some areas where there is continuing fighting between the Congolese Armed Forces, their Mai-Mai allies and the FDLR, on the one hand and the CNDP on the other, as no party is respecting the ceasefire."
"Secondly, on the political and military level: in eastern DRC, no military solution is possible."
"There is only room for a balanced political solution, built on dialogue."
"This was also recommended by the countries in the region, at the Nairobi Summit on 7 November and, above all, this also seemed to be what the CNDP rebels and a large part of the political establishment in Kinshasa, such as the National Assembly, were hoping for."
"The Commission is, therefore, highly satisfied with the conclusions of the summit held by the heads of state of the Great Lakes countries, more particularly with the decision to involve African diplomacy at a high level in the resolution of the crisis and to introduce a verification mechanism to allow the heads of state in the region to monitor developments closely and to provide the necessary responses in a timely fashion."
"In this respect, the visit just made to the region by Mr Obasanjo is very encouraging."
"The visit has reassured us about the possibilities of military intervention by certain countries in the region, and it obtained guarantees from President Kabila that Kinshasa would be ready to listen to the CNDP demands and also ready to go down the path of dialogue."
"During the visit, the CNDP's grievances were also heard and General Nkunda reaffirmed his readiness to observe a ceasefire and do everything to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid in the areas under his control."
"It is, therefore, crucial to maintain the current political momentum and do all we can to ensure that the declarations of the various players are put into practice."
"It is, then, high time to treat the underlying causes of the crisis in the east of the country, with which everyone is familiar: the presence of the FDLR, the organised pillage of mineral resources, the political frustrations of communities and minorities, and ideas must be made to converge."
"On this matter, it is crucial for the entire international community to support the diplomatic efforts introduced in the wake of the Nairobi Summit and that the international efforts be coordinated to allow sufficient space to Presidents Obasanjo and Mkapa to continue the negotiations."
"It is also important to highlight the role of MONUC."
"It is not MONUC which is responsible for all sorts of abuses of power."
"MONUC is actually doing important work, despite the poverty of the resources it receives and the restrictions on its functions."
"It is also carrying out a job which would be difficult to replace, that of ensuring peace, rather than waging war."
"However, it is even more important to support the current efforts to strengthen its mandate at a moment in which, in the coming days, the Security Council is to consider this question."
"The mandate, we think, should be extended, to include, for example, control of the pillaging of natural resources and, especially, as the President of the Council said, increasing the resources available to enable it to do so."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, currently we are facing a financial crisis which will go down in the history books."
"Nevertheless, in only a few weeks, it was possible to set up a G20 meeting which delivered concrete results, the most notable of which was the decision to use 2% of GDP to stimulate the economy and help the financial sector."
"On the other hand, we have not managed to fulfil our commitment to use 0.7% of GDP for development."
"If we had done so, the DRC would certainly be more developed and maybe this entire conflict would not have happened at all."
"But let us take things as they are."
"We do not have time now to discuss development for Kivu: we are facing a humanitarian crisis there."
"Two hundred and fifty thousand additional people have been displaced over recent weeks."
"People are dying as a direct or indirect result of the fighting, and diseases such as cholera are spreading rapidly."
"Since 2005, the UN has accepted the concept of responsibility to protect."
"The UN sent the peacekeeping force MONUC to the DRC."
"With 17 000 troops, MONUC is the largest peacekeeping mission in the world operating under a strong Chapter 7 mandate."
"But what can MONUC do?"
"The quality of soldiers and equipment is very poor and the size of the DRC is enormous."
"I therefore strongly support the call to strengthen MONUC, but realistically speaking, it will be months before this reinforcement can be on the ground - precious months, during which people will die."
"For that reason, I propose sending a short-term European force to stabilise the region quickly until the reinforcement of MONUC is operational and deployed in the field."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first, in the middle of these quiet debates, in this very comfortable atmosphere, I want to paint the scene for you, as I have been over there three times in recent months."
"Over there, as we hold our discussions, there is violence, rape and death."
"Today, that is daily life for many citizens living in this horrible part of the world."
"For me, this is no time for rhetoric, it is time for action."
"This dirty war is not at all, in my opinion, an ethnic war, as some are beginning to say; ethnic wars can always be created, because it suits us, the Europeans, because when there is talk of ethnic wars, that means the Africans are fighting amongst themselves and that it is not our problem."
"No, the origins of the war going on over there are to be found at the bottom of the mines - the diamond mines, coltan mines and gold mines - which, despite the massacres, continue to operate calmly and efficiently."
"Their minerals are exported, under the noses of the UN forces, from Goma airport or down the road to Kigali, and so they are still making some people very rich."
"That is the war."
"To stop this war, this is the first issue which needs to be looked at."
"How can these mines be closed and what measures are needed to stop this scandalous trade?"
"We could go back to processes, such as the Kimberley process, which was introduced for diamonds."
"I suppose some of our fellow Members will talk about that here."
"Roughly speaking, over the last ten years, and while this figure is contested by some, I assure you that it can easily be verified, over 5 million Congolese have suffered violent deaths in this region, either direct victims of the war or victims of the collateral damage, such as disease and so on, brought about by the war."
"The question then is to know whom this war suits and who will benefit from its continuation."
"I think that is the first major point."
"As for the European Union, I and my group think that there are three important questions."
"First, we must indeed support the peace efforts that are underway - not in recent weeks, but they have been going on for some time."
"We have nominated Abbot Malu Malu for the Sakharov prize, because this gentleman has, for a very long time, been committed to trying to find peaceful solutions in this region."
"In Goma, he brought together not only the CNDP - because the CNDP came, went, came back and went again - but all of the rebel movements and the DRC government."
"This is something that I consider to be important."
"There is the Nairobi process and the recent Nairobi Summit, to which the Commissioner alluded."
"I believe it is, of course, necessary to support these efforts and support our Commissioner, Louis Michel, who, and I say this as a socialist whilst he is a liberal, is making huge efforts in this area."
"Secondly, we must defend this population, at all costs."
"We are told that MONUC is not there to wage war, that it is there to keep the peace."
"Maybe, but MONUC has a 'Chapter 7' mandate."
"It is not like 1994 in Kigali, where nothing could be done, where we had to stand and watch impotently as massacres occurred."
"Now there is a chapter 7, and MONUC's mission is to defend the civilian population."
"Well, the civilian population over there is being massacred and MONUC has not budged."
"A short time ago, in a village whose name escapes me for the moment, a real massacre occurred in Kiwanja, on the edge of a MONUC camp."
"MONUC must therefore be reinforced by European forces; that is my group's opinion."
"We will, in any case, be tabling an amendment to this effect."
"Finally, I believe, and I will have to say it very quickly in conclusion, there is, of course, a need to proceed to the decisions required to halt the exploitation of, and the trade in, minerals which, in essence, are responsible for all the massacres which are being perpetrated over there."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this corner of the world seems to be cursed and, as Alain Hutchinson has very aptly stated, there have been almost five million deaths since the start of the 1990s."
"This area is like a death chamber - mass killings in North Kivu, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi - there is no end to it and each year the deaths start up again."
"I know that the same causes always produce the same effects; there are ethnic conflicts because the boundaries we marked out were often artificial boundaries."
"There is a form of exaggerated nationalism: everyone attempts to be a small-scale Napoleon III and have a Mexican adventure so that the problems of their country are forgotten."
"Of course, there is the taste for money, Alain pointed this out, the often incommensurable wealth of this area."
"There is also madness, for how else can we qualify the action of the Lord's Resistance Army?"
"So what can we do?"
"Oh, I would also like to draw attention to the action of Commissioner Michel, who has a long interest in this matter."
"We have seen his action at the meetings in Kigali and Kinshasa, which resulted in Nairobi."
"There is also the SADC and Obasanjo."
"Once again, we shall have large diplomatic summits."
"However, is that a reason to rely solely on diplomacy?"
"We are facing a very serious humanitarian situation."
"In my capacity as humanitarian aid rapporteur for your Parliament, I went to Kinshasa at the beginning of November to meet with Mr Botswali Lengomo, the new Minister for social affairs and humanitarian action."
"I also met with Apollinaire Malu Malu, to whom we almost awarded the Sakharov prize, and who is in charge of the Amani programme."
"Above all, let us not forget the considerable humanitarian effort that we must undertake."
"So what are we really doing?"
"Are we sure we are doing everything we should?"
"What is MONUC doing?"
"It appears to be absolutely right."
"17 000 men, with 6 000 in the area, that is the equivalent of an armed division with tanks."
"Who is going to believe that this is insufficient to guarantee access for humanitarian assistance, even if I am aware, as you are too, of the vast territories to protect?"
"Hence, the solution is, of course, a diplomatic one."
"We must therefore support an African solution, assuming we are able to implement it."
"Obviously, we must ensure that the ceasefire is permanent to ensure humanitarian aid access."
"Without this prerequisite, humanitarian aid will not get through."
"The source of income must also be stopped."
"Needless to say, we must close the mines but also, perhaps, start criticising companies in the West who purchase the coltan and other minerals that enable arms to be purchased."
"We must, of course, give our full support to the peace initiatives by displaying a continued, rather than a sometimes indefinite, political interest"
"I shall conclude by calling for a much stronger military presence to stabilise the peace and that is something only the United Nations can do."
"It is my understanding that the European Union has sometimes been known to be able to convince the United Nations of where its duty lies."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (GA) Mr President, the current situation in the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo is getting worse every day, and the international community is very worried about this."
"More than one and a half million people have been displaced in the Kivu province, which demonstrates how bad the problem is."
"I support the efforts of Roeland Van de Geer, European Union Special Representative for the African Great Lakes Region, and former Nigerian President, Mr Obasanjo, who took part in intense talks with the political and military groups that are engaged in this violence."
"I ask the African Union to make further efforts to ensure peace in the Great Lakes Region."
"The governments of Rwanda and Nairobi signed a peace settlement in November 2007 as an attempt to resolve the animosity between the two countries."
"The implementation of this settlement must be ensured, but the violence has to be ended first."
"The European Union gives more money to the Great Lakes Region than any other organisation or country in the world."
"I ask Louis Michel, European Commissioner for Development, and the Council to attempt to end the fighting and establish peace."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, the atrocious fighting in the east of the Congo is not simply a case of a civil war, it is also a regional conflict involving many neighbouring countries."
"It is also about strategic raw materials such as coltan, which we need for the production of our mobile phones, DVD players and computers."
"It is also about gold, diamonds, cobalt and precious wood."
"These are the deeper causes of this conflict."
"What can and what must be done?"
"The United Nations must be beefed up so that it is capable of meeting its responsibility to protect the civilian population from all the armed troops active in the region."
"The United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC) needs a clearer mandate, more equipment and more manpower."
"The Member States of the European Union have repeatedly waived away the pleas to re-supply MONUC in recent years."
"Yet we have then seen sharp criticism of MONUC's failures and mistakes."
"This case of double standards must be brought to an end."
"We do not need a branded EU military contingent right now, we need MONUC to be actively re-supplied and I have listened with interest and approval to how this is also the way that the Council and the Commission wish to go."
"The second important point to be made is that the extraction of, and trade in, raw materials from Congo must be monitored strictly and on an international basis."
"The international corporations involved in this trade that profit from the extraction of the raw materials in Congo must be monitored and compelled to be transparent."
"There is, of course, already an official UN Panel of experts on the illegal exploitation of natural resources from Congo."
"This panel of experts has put forward a series of recommendations, including sanctions against people and businesses who participate in such illegal exploitation."
"The European Union must push for the implementation of this UN recommendation, including, specifically - and this in an area where there is scope for action - insofar as relates to imports into the EU, as this is clearly an area in which we can act on our own and one where we can actively implement these UN recommendations."
"The third point to be made is that the initiative for an international conference on the Great Lakes region must be brought forward."
"Only political cooperation and the economic integration of the region can provide peace there in the long term."
"Europe can, and must, play a key role in this."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, a whole series of neighbouring countries are physically involved in this war and there is, above all, direct participation from Congolese government troops, together with militia and Angolan troops on one side, with General Nkunda, Tutsi soldiers and Rwandan support on the other."
"It is a regional war which does not just concern eastern Congo."
"One key point is clear: the Congolese government has thus far not been prepared to negotiate directly with the rebels."
"That is a point on which pressure must be applied."
"It is very important to examine the real background to this conflict."
"The Federal President of Germany himself has made reference to the fact that this is a conflict about raw materials."
"Crude oil, gold, diamonds, copper, cobalt, coltan, zinc, tin and so on play a very important role here."
"Above all, it is also about who actually holds the relevant licences to exploit these materials."
"Action really has to be taken against these companies."
"I just want to name one of these companies: Gesellschaft für Elektrometallurgie mbh, based in Nuremberg, is clearly the direct owner of one of the central mines over which this conflict is being fought."
"I would like to talk a little about the role of the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC), since everyone in the House seems to be calling for MONUC to be re-supplied."
"According to what I read, it is the case that MONUC is part of the problem rather than part of the solution, because MONUC itself describes its situation as having developed into fighting on four fronts."
"MONUC's role should actually be quite different."
"In the meantime, we have found out from Human Rights Watch that Indian or Pakistani MONUC soldiers are conducting direct weapons trading with irregular militias and are clearly involved in the conflict for raw materials."
"That cannot be allowed to happen."
"MONUC's role must be something else entirely and completely neutral."
"That being the case, calling for MONUC to be re-supplied is not all that helpful."
"I would also like to again point out that Congo played an important role once before in a previous European Union operation."
"At that time, it was the security of elections that was our role and Mr Kabila was installed as president - the same Mr Kabila whose troops are now a significant escalating factor."
"With that in mind, there should be close scrutiny of the actual role played by the EU in Mr Kabila's installation."
"I find what the EU did to be very problematic."
"The point must clearly be made that Mr Kabila and his troops must also be criticised in this respect."
"The report by the local correspondent of the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper, who was captured, made very worthwhile reading."
"He described the set-up of the conflict very well."
"His article shows the interaction between official and unofficial troops, which is to say that calling for the re-supply of MONUC alone is pointless, as what is really needed is to get to grips with the causes of the conflict."
"Mr President, last night, I had the privilege of speaking directly to an experienced aid worker about the war in eastern Congo."
"He knows the crisis in both North and South Kivu like the back of his hand."
"His account, without wanting to put a gloss on the prevailing misery in the region, offers us a few rays of hope."
"One ray of hope is certainly that, more than a week ago, the Congolese presidential guard, in cooperation with the police, rounded up government soldiers engaged in looting."
"This is a hopeful sign of the Congolese government making a start on putting law and order in place, and is a development that emphatically deserves our European encouragement and support."
"Another ray of hope is that rebel leader Nkunda has, to date, appeared unable to mobilise and recruit the Tutsis in South Kivu for his power aspirations."
"My contact considers this to be a positive expression of a Tutsi identification with the Congolese state and civil population."
"A third ray of hope is the religious reconciliation initiatives at local and provincial levels."
"The elected authorities are just as actively involved in these platforms as the traditional authorities and the tribal representatives."
"These platforms in North and South Kivu deserve dual European support: financial aid and professional input in resolving conflicts."
"For humanitarian aid in both Kivu regions to be effective, it is of crucial importance for the local authorities to be involved, which includes, therefore, both groups of local leaders, traditional tribal representatives and the elected authorities."
"Based on his own experience, my contact stresses that, despite all war conflicts and even when people are fleeing, these power structures that are in place continue to be effective, hence his urgent appeal to provide cash to the throngs of refugees in the villages of North and South Kivu, as well as the village people themselves."
"After all, my insider states: 'If you have money, you can get food."
"Surprisingly enough, it is always market day somewhere."
"In Congo, it is perfectly possible to work with cash handouts."
"It does not make the people dependent, because they can decide for themselves what they will spend the money on."
"You boost the local economy and make instant use of it."
"In order to ensure that this runs smoothly, we go and talk to the elected village committees, who will point out the most needy.'"
"Following such a discussion, and with Europe's heart-warming efforts that are aimed at reconciliation, there has to be a future for North and South Kivu and, indeed, for the whole of Congo."
"I would therefore call on the Council, the Commission, the European Parliament and the European institutions from the bottom of my heart to do what is necessary."
"(NL) Mr President, there is little point in discussing today how tragic we find the desperate situation in eastern Congo."
"We should be able to call a spade a spade and, of course, ask the question whether Europe, and particularly countries such as France and Belgium, who have especially evil reputations in that region, should intervene in a military sense."
"To me, the answer is no, for what have we noticed?"
"In Congo, Europe has managed to prove once more how divided and how weak it is and what an illusion it would be to think that a common foreign and security policy would be possible at this stage."
"Indeed, let us remind ourselves that Paris, the current Presidency of the Council no less, has just had the head of protocol of Rwandan President Kagame arrested in Germany for the attempted murder of President Habyarimana in 1994."
"He is seen as an involved party in the conflict."
"Even my own country, Belgium, is disingenuous since, only yesterday, the Belgian Foreign Affairs Minister, Karel De Gucht, heaped heavy criticism on the policy of European Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid, Louis Michel, precisely on account of the latter's policy in relation to Congo."
"I quote Karel De Gucht: 'If the present situation in Congo is the result of Michel's policy, then this is quite something."
"The situation has never been as distressing as it is now.'"
"Ladies and gentlemen, these words were spoken by one of the Commissioner's political allies."
"In this cacophony, we can only conclude that the protection of the civil population should, in the first place, be the responsibility of the African Union, which must be supported, and of the UN Mission in Congo."
"Europe would therefore do well not to send its own troops to that region."
"Mr President, I echo the sentiments of my colleagues in expressing my extreme concern regarding renewed fighting between the Congolese army and resurgent militias in North Kivu in the DRC."
"The increase in violence in North Kivu has seriously overstretched the UN peacekeeping mission (MONUC) in operation in this country."
"The humanitarian situation is particularly grave with more than 1.5 million internal displaced persons in Kivu province."
"The operations of the World Food Programme and other NGOs have been seriously restricted by the violence and there is widespread theft, rape and killing of civilians by both government and rebel forces."
"MONUC has a mandate under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter to ensure the protection of civilians under imminent threat of physical violence, but lacks the resources and quantity of troops needed to fulfil this mandate."
"The international community and the UN Security Council must strengthen MONUC by providing appropriate materials and staff to enable it to fulfil its mission."
"Seeing that the European Union has decided not to initiate steps towards another ESDP mission to deal with these further escalations in violence in the DRC, I would urge the European Union to enhance its cooperation with MONUC to the greatest degree possible."
"The current French-drafted UN Security Council resolution proposes a temporary increase in MONUC's authorised military strength by up to 2 785 military personnel."
"This increase would bring the maximum permitted number of troops and police deployed under MONUC, already the biggest UN peacekeeping force in the world, to just over 20 000 to cover a country roughly the size of Western Europe."
"I urge the UN Security Council to vote on this resolution as soon as possible, given the urgency of the current events in the DRC."
"I am outraged by the massacres, the crimes against humanity and acts of sexual violence against women and girls in the eastern province of DRC, and I call on all relevant national and international authorities to bring the perpetrators to justice."
"(PT) The new horrors in the Kivus and the international community's inability to put an end to these are as shocking as the greed of the Rwandan and Congolese leaders who are perpetuating this situation of organised chaos in order to conceal the sinister plundering of the region's natural resources."
"What can the European Union do?"
"What can it do for a country where there have been, and still are, various ESDP (European Security and Defence Policy) missions and where the first democratic elections would not have been held without Europe's support?"
"What can it do for a country receiving millions in development and humanitarian aid?"
"What can it do for a country of unparalleled strategic importance where five million people have died at the mercy of the most barbaric violence in recent years?"
"The European Union must go much further than the minimum decided since this latest military escalation began."
"It is not enough to increase humanitarian aid and launch diplomatic initiatives in which promises to disarm and declarations of good faith are repeated for the umpteenth time."
"The European Union urgently needs to strengthen MONUC (United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo) so that it can regain its lost credibility and effectiveness."
"To this end, it is not enough to table resolutions in the Security Council."
"The European Union must immediately link up with the DPKO (United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations) and provide equipment and, if necessary, soldiers to help fill the gaps in MONUC."
"As a last resort, if the proceedings in New York and the situation on the ground justify this, the EU cannot, and must not, rule out sending a military mission under the ESDP."
"It is our responsibility to protect what is at stake, namely the lives of defenceless civilians who need immediate international protection."
"Never again!"
"We have to get serious and not let the genocide in Rwanda and the massacres in the Congo happen again."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the statements by the Council and the Commission on the EU's response to the serious crisis in the Congo are, as usual, hypocritical and ineffectual."
"Behind Laurent Nkunda are Rwanda and Uganda, countries which have always been interested in the region, so much so as to try to invade it on several occasions in the recent past: the underground resources and the resources in the east of the DRC are too great to be left in the hands of others."
"Between January and now, three times the number of weapons have been purchased compared with 2007, and some of these, as far as the Rwandan sector is concerned, were destined for the rebel Laurent Nkunda, with the results that we see today."
"For years, however, Washington has focused its interest on the Great Lakes region, particularly by supporting Uganda and Rwanda."
"For instance, the largest US embassy in Africa is in Kampala; nothing happens in Uganda or Rwanda without the agreement of the United States."
"Now, this swift about turn by the European Union regarding the possibility of sending a peace-keeping force to the region sends the wrong signal, as usual, because our preference is for focusing on diplomacy, as if diplomacy were enough to convince an ugly customer like Laurent Nkunda to withdraw."
"As usual, our discussions amount to nothing, and then we hear Commissioner Michel almost eulogising Mr Nkunda. Thank you for that!"
"Mr President, we all understand the complexities of the current appalling situation in eastern Congo, which is ethnically based and has its origins in Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda."
"An effective mediation process between Rwanda and the DRC must be started as a matter of urgency."
"A ceasefire needs to be put in place and properly enforced, and the civil population clearly needs protection and urgent humanitarian assistance."
"I am reminded of the recent statement by the Permanent Representative of the African Union to Brussels in Parliament's Subcommittee on Security and Defence, when he indicated his preference for Africans to deal with security issues on their continent."
"I am pleased, therefore, that the EU has not sought to use the Congo tragedy as an opportunity merely to put its label on another so-called EU military operation."
"It is primarily Africans who must take responsibility for resolving the present situation, but we must give them every possible assistance in doing this through the African Union and the United Nations."
"Meanwhile, there seems to be some ambiguity concerning the mandate, rules of engagement and use of force by MONUC."
"MONUC's commander, Lieutenant-General Vicente Díaz de Villegas, recently resigned after seven weeks in the job."
"He cited personal reasons, but I wonder if it was not professional frustration."
"However, it is encouraging that on 6 November, a thousand-member South African force deployed near Goma as part of MONUC."
"The MONUC head claims that they have instructions to open fire if necessary."
"MONUC must be able to act to protect civilians against imminent threats of violence."
"Clearly, there needs to be a substantial increase in numbers of effective UN and AU troops deployed in eastern Congo and a clear idea of where they come from - there are many countries that could contribute to this that are not doing so at the moment."
"If the West fails to do all that it can to assist operations in the Congo, there are other less high-minded actors waiting in the wings."
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Jouyet, I am a member of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly and during the last session held in Kigali, Rwanda, I listened to President Paul Kagame, who spoke of the need to stabilise the situation in Central Africa."
"He spoke of wanting peace, but while in Kigali, I visited the holocaust museum which commemorates the death of a million Tutsis massacred in just three months - a hundred days."
"That was in 1994."
"Will we now witness a repetition of what happened then?"
"We cannot allow it."
"I consider it to be our duty."
"I think that the European Union must do more."
"I do not know whether sending additional troops will solve the situation."
"Personally, I doubt it, but it does seem to me that we need a radical review of the sources of funds which, as noted by my fellow Member, are derived from the exploitation of Congolese natural resources and are then not channelled to small traders and unnamed individuals, but enter European markets as well."
"This is both the source and the solution of the problem."
"Let us now move on to the humanitarian situation, which is clearly getting out of control."
"This is where we can play a role, and this is where the European Union must do everything to protect those 1 600 000 people in need of water, food, blankets, tents and care."
"Let us address this problem."
"(PT) Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at this moment in time, the world's powers are tackling the international financial system."
"They are trying to get it under control, and not before time."
"It is also perhaps time that we solved another problem that we have been talking about for decades."
"For years, we have been listening to tales of the shameful pillaging of resources."
"How many times, and now again in the Congo, have we heard about the blood of people being shed?"
"I believe it is also time to prosecute these companies, halt this disgraceful trade and freeze the accounts holding the shameful profits from this exploitation of mineral resources at the cost of the blood and suffering of people."
"I do not understand why these companies are not listed in the same way as we blacklist terrorist organisations."
"I do not understand why the international community is incapable of prosecuting these businesspeople who are not strictly businesspeople, but actually bandits who are threatening regional and world security."
"I urge the French Presidency and the Commission to lead an international initiative in this respect."
"Mr President, names like Lumumba, Mobutu, Chombe, Dag Hammarskjöld and Katanga dominated my late childhood in the early 1960s."
"Fifty years on, Congo - now the Democratic Republic of Congo - is again ravaged by internal unrest bordering on civil war."
"Only this time the war in the eastern parts of the DRC comes after, and in spite of, important EU efforts in the form of money, programmes, missions on the ground - including military missions - and intense diplomatic efforts."
"The current situation in the DRC, therefore, is not just another crisis."
"Rather, it is a test case of the capacity and willingness of the EU to play the international role it now claims in world politics, since the crisis has all the ingredients the Union maintains it is best equipped to deal with, and is taking place on a continent, Africa, whose geo-economic importance is increasing exponentially."
"(NL) Mr President, Mr Hutchinson started the debate by saying that we should stop the rhetoric and leap into action."
"I think that he is absolutely right."
"Allow me to mention two essential elements from the debate."
"First of all, what matters most is for the recommendations of the UN Panel of Experts on the illegal exploitation of the DRC's natural resources, as well as the sanctions against persons and companies whose participation in the looting of the resources has been proven, to be implemented."
"The EU must swing into action."
"Secondly, we must put an emphatic stop to the illegal exploitation and implement systems of traceability and proof of origin of gold, tin ore, coltan, cobalt, diamonds, pyrochlore and timber, so that this blood trade can be brought to a halt."
"My explicit question to President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Jouyet, and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, is what initiatives will you be developing in this respect in the next few months?"
"I think we are entitled to an answer to this question."
"Mr President, I do not regard myself at all as an expert in relation to Congo, nor do I have any ready-made solutions, but I do know this: if five million people have died over the last 20 years, then we all need to be concerned."
"That concern for me is accentuated when I read some of the strictures which come from a number of NGOs involved in the area."
"For example, a few days ago, I read that Amnesty International - not an organisation I always agree with, I should say - had this to say of the human rights, and particularly the humanitarian tragedy in North Kivu province: 'The UN Security Council, the European Union and the African Union are sitting on their hands."
"They have so far failed to give the UN peacekeeping force the reinforcements and equipment it needs to provide effective protection to civilians."
"I have listened in debates for an answer to that criticism."
"I have to say, frankly, that I have not really heard it."
"Diplomacy is good, but diplomacy of itself will not deliver all the answers."
"Mr President, it would be easy for us to forget about Africa's problem, given our own economic difficulties, but it would be a dreadful mistake."
"I think we need to put pressure on the African Union to realise its own responsibilities in the region."
"If the African Union is ever to assume the same kind of gravitas as the EU, it needs to put words into action - something it has conspicuously failed to do, for example, over Zimbabwe."
"We should also not hesitate to link our long-term trade and aid relationship with countries like the DRC to their respect for human rights, good governance and transparency."
"In this light, I hope the Commission will reiterate its support for the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative."
"(NL) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, after everything that has been said, I should like to put the following to you."
"You both stressed the fact that there is no military solution to this conflict."
"Whilst I could not agree with you more, there is nothing wrong with the agreements of Goma or Nairobi."
"There is nothing wrong with the process that is being brought back to life, except that the agreements are never observed."
"Needless to say, Europe should press for a stronger and better MONUC mandate and more troops."
"The big question we should ask ourselves though is whether MONUC could ever succeed, even with a Chapter 7 mandate, without any European intervention?"
"Mr Jouyet, I should like to ask you what the good reasons were on the part of the EU ministers for rejecting European intervention of this kind?"
"Mr President, honourable Members, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, many thanks for this very interesting debate."
"We are fully aware of the appeal made in Parliament to the European Union to deploy a military mission in this region of the Republic of Congo."
"However, I feel I should point out that the European Union is already committed in the Republic of Congo, firstly through community aid: EUR 50 million in 2008, then EUR 6 million in emergency aid as mentioned by Benita Ferrero-Waldner."
"There are two ESDP missions supporting reform of the Congolese police and army, whose unpreparedness and lack of efficiency were, as we have seen in this case, only too tragic."
"Moreover, the European Union has already intervened, this was back in 2003 via a military mission referred to as Artemis."
"However, the conditions were different since, at that time, the European Union was preparing the way for the arrival of a United Nations mission, which then took place."
"Therefore, beyond rhetoric, how can we respond to the tragedy in this region?"
"The quickest solution to address the humanitarian crisis would be to strengthen the existing measures, in other words MONUC, through a broader mandate and additional manpower."
"I mean that, in the case of France, it is ready to participate in this reinforcement because if we wait for the deployment of a European Union mission, we run the risk of losing time."
"As you know, the Union is already committed in Chad and the Central African Republic, so there is the problem of deployment and, to put my point quite clearly, a number of States within the Council would not, at this time, be able to participate in these reinforcement operations."
"As several speakers have pointed out, reinforcing MONUC would offer advantages since its mandate is based on Chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter."
"We must also consider that the halting of the Nkunda offensive on 29 October has enabled MONUC to begin redeployment."
"The next stage for the United Nations mission is to reconfigure with new elite troops, in particular, the Indian Ghurkhas expected this month."
"3 000 men need to be added to the 17 000 men already present, and this was the thrust of the steps we undertook in New York at the Security Council over the last few days."
"However, as several speakers have indicated, we cannot stop at the military situation alone since, faced with the atrocities which, as many have pointed out, have been going on for far too long, priority must be given to a political solution, as the visits by Commissioner Michel, Bernard Kouchner and David Miliband have shown, to enable contact to be resumed between the protagonists in the region."
"Priority must be given to the negotiations conducted within the African framework, whether this is the African Union, SADC or the Great Lakes Conference, to revive the Goma and Nairobi processes."
"In the longer term, the Union must help the Republic of Congo to equip itself with a real army, there is no real army, it is totally dilapidated, enabling it to ensure the security of the country which is vast and very difficult to control and to prevent further humanitarian crises."
"I share the opinions of those who have stated that we also need to tackle the causes of the conflict and this is what the Council has done, on 10 November, in its call to combat the illegal exploitation of the natural resources of the region by rebel groups in particular."
"Should this task of monitoring the fight against illegal exploitation be entrusted to MONUC?"
"The question is open, but faced with a humanitarian crisis situation, and several others have also stressed this, MONUC's priority must be protection of the civilian population and I believe that what is important, and this has also been stated, is that one of the solutions to the plundering of resources must be found at regional level in order to put a stop to the exploitation and exportation of these resources to our countries."
"Finally, I note that we should indeed execute the resolutions made by the United Nations panel on these issues."
"Those are the additional elements that I wanted to bring to the attention of this House."
"Mr President, honourable Members, first of all, I believe the debates have shown that we are all agreed: now we must act fast, very fast, in a terribly tragic situation."
"As regards sending a European force to the east of the DRC, I believe that it emerged that only a European force with the strict aim of securing the humanitarian space could possibly be accepted by all the countries in the region."
"This would therefore mean imposing on all parties in the conflict a humanitarian ceasefire to allow delivery of aid to the populations near the frontline."
"This is precisely what the Great Lakes countries want, and for them a ceasefire and the delivery of humanitarian aid is an absolute and immediate priority."
"In this respect, they have also indicated the avenues to explore: political negotiation and, above all, and this is what we have all said, reinforcing MONUC."
"While the humanitarian situation is gradually coming under control, some Member States appear not to rule out the possibility of a CFSP mission."
"However, no final decision will be taken until there is unanimous European support on this issue and the United Nations Security Council has stated its official position on this."
"With regard to the reinforcement of MONUC, I believe this is absolutely essential, as does Louis Michel."
"MONUC brings a constructive and objective approach to this conflict, but it cannot be asked for things that are not part of its mission."
"MONUC must ensure peacekeeping in a specific approved framework and not impose peace on all the parties using military means."
"It is sometimes difficult to grasp, but the nuance is, I feel, significant."
"On the other hand, it is clear that, for the scale of the Congo and the complexity of the problem, MONUC is not sufficiently equipped - you have all said this and it is true -, neither in resources, nor perhaps with regard to its mandate and, for this, the request by the United Nations Secretary-General for more resources, in particular, three thousand additional men, is no doubt justified."
"Moreover, the extension of MONUC's mandate, in particular regarding the monitoring of the illegal exploitation of natural resources - which, as you said, is the real sinew of the war - is very important, as many have already rightly stated, in order to be able to have any influence on the development of the conflict."
"Once peace returns, this question must be examined by the international community."
"The example of the Kimberley process certainly opens avenues to be explored in this sense and, in practical terms, the Commission has already released EUR 75 million for the programme in the east of the Congo, for rebuilding governmental structures such as justice and the police, and to re-establish resource exploitation monitoring."
"This programme is being put in place and I hope that the first results will materialise."
"I have received six motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 20 November 2008."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (IT) The resolution on the Republic of Congo represents a clear commitment for the European Union with regard to this part of the world."
"This time, however, we have the responsibility, in view of the serious nature of the crisis, to ensure that words are followed by deeds."
"As ever, the UN is stammering out solutions."
"Let it be the European Union that takes the initiative to attempt to mediate for peace between the parties in conflict."
"I would like to thank the Commission for a particularly important signal given in recent weeks in the DRC: the allocation of a subsidy of EUR 75 million for a programme that aims to reconstruct the administrative and governmental structures in the country, including the justice and police systems."
"This is a particularly significant step, because it is being made in the present with a view to the future and makes a start on tackling what lies at the heart of this dispute: the exploitation of the Congo's natural resources, currently the object of very harsh and unregulated dispute between the various combatant groups"
"Crises in the car industry (debate)"
"The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the crisis in the car industry."
"Madam President, Commissioner Verheugen, ladies and gentlemen, in the third quarter of this year, the European automotive industry has been hit by the deepening crisis in the global economy."
"This comes after the industry's good performance in the second quarter of the year."
"All the leading automotive markets in the world are being affected, but with differing levels of seriousness."
"Sales in the United States have fallen by 32% in a year, reaching their lowest level in 25 years."
"The three big American car manufacturers - General Motors, Ford and Chrysler - have requested emergency aid from the Federal State."
"The emerging markets which, until this summer, offset the fall in sales for these countries, have also been hit by the crisis, but to a lesser degree."
"In China, sales were down 1.4% in September."
"This is the second consecutive month of falling sales in China, following the 6.3% drop in August."
"In Brazil, car sales were down 11% last month, for the first time since 1999."
"The automotive market has not yet fallen in Russia, but there is a significant slowdown in this market and it could experience the first falls at the beginning of next year."
"We can clearly see, then, that the situation is also worsening in the large emerging countries."
"In Europe, vehicle registrations were down almost 4% over the period from the start of the year to last August."
"The end of the year may prove difficult and the decline in the automotive market could be around 5% for the whole of 2008, which, for this market, would be the worst result recorded since 1993."
"Throughout the world, however, the automotive industry is making considerable efforts to tackle the crisis and is trying to find the foundations for new growth."
"The measures to reduce production will have negative knock-on effects on jobs in all value chains as well as on demand."
"We shall see this in the next few days."
"Despite the difficult economic situation, the leading European car manufacturers will still be profitable in 2008, even though the growth rate in margins is obviously slowing down."
"They are able to maintain this profit situation given the very high productivity gains made over the last few years."
"The competitive position of the European automotive industry remains, therefore, relatively good - I am not saying this lightly -, and this is explained by three factors."
"Firstly, the fact that the European automotive industry is increasingly present in the emerging countries, which are both markets and production sites."
"It is in these emerging countries that growth, even if it is slowing down as I have already mentioned, remains a driving force."
"The second factor is that there is a better new models policy, with models that are now more economical, ecological and in tune with consumers' demands."
"Finally, as I pointed out, given the productivity gains in previous years, the financial situation of the European industry is, at present, still relatively healthy."
"Above all, in this situation, vigilance is required to prevent State subsidies granted to non-European manufacturers by their governments from distorting fair competition on the world market, in particular, on the emerging markets."
"Targeted and temporary support measures for European producers could prove useful, in particular, to improve the technological and ecological performance of the European car population, where the regulatory environment, as we know, is the most demanding in the world in terms of environmental legislation."
"This is what led European manufacturers to invest more heavily than their main American competitors in research and development to face up to these ecological challenges."
"We can be pleased that this has given our industry a lead in the environmental sector, but we must be vigilant and make sure that it effectively maintains this lead."
"The Commission - I shall leave Commissioner Verheugen to expand on this - will make proposals on 26 November regarding European measures to support industry, especially the automotive sector."
"The European Investment Bank is also being asked and should participate in the efforts underway at European level."
"Member States must provide the Bank, if necessary, with the appropriate resources so that it will be in a position to make available new resources to support the automotive sector."
"Member States are also considering national actions to support their manufacturers."
"These efforts must be coordinated in order to maximise the effectiveness of this support."
"As it has done in other areas in response to the crisis, the French Presidency shall do its utmost to obtain joint European action on this major industrial issue."
"The December European Council will debate the Commission's proposals and the various national support plans that may have been put in place by then."
"This will, of course, involve acting consistently with the other political objectives of the Union."
"Support for the automotive sector must, in particular, respect the integrity of the internal market."
"It is in no one's interest to take advantage of the crisis to create distortions on the automotive market and, naturally, this support must resolutely fall within the environmental objectives that the Union has set in the energy and climate change package."
"I believe the Commission is working towards this."
"The Presidency is determined to promote the emergence of a balanced agreement between Member States and Parliament on a coordinated offensive approach in support of the automotive industries."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, it is not surprising that the first full impact on the real economy of the crisis in the financial markets has hit the car market."
"The car market is particularly sensitive to consumer behaviour."
"It is clear that, in this situation, consumers who are unclear about their own economic future, who do not know whether they will still have a job next year, whether their income will be as high, or whether they will still have their capital, are not going to rush out and buy a new car."
"That is a well-known and also probably a natural reaction."
"It is not just the crisis in the financial markets that leads to this restraint, however."
"There is also uncertainty amongst manufacturers and consumers in respect of the requirements that politics will make of the car of the future."
"Consumers do not know, for example, whether they can count on tax incentives or allowances if they buy or do not buy certain cars."
"It is therefore necessary for the statutory conditions for the industry to be cleared up as soon as possible."
"The situation is clear."
"The motor industry is a key industry, if not the key industry, for Europe and it consists of more than the manufacture of cars."
"We have to look at the entire supply chain and the entire car market which, of course, also includes the vehicle trade and vehicle repair shops."
"This is a sector which, all told, employs 12 million people in Europe and has a far-reaching impact stretching into other sectors."
"The President-in-Office of the Council has already described the decline."
"I will give you another figure."
"So far this year, 700 000 fewer new cars have been registered across Europe than last year."
"This has essentially been over a nine-month period, which means that by the end of the year, the figure will probably have risen to over a million. I am sure you can quite easily imagine the economic consequences of this."
"We still have no reason to hope that this will change very quickly in 2009."
"In other words, we must assume that 2009, too, will be a crisis year for the motor industry, which will have significant effects on capacity utilisation, the number of people employed and the ability of car-makers to invest, especially as relates to large investments such as are needed to meet the requirements for low-pollutant and low-consumption vehicles."
"This economic development has also given rise to an extremely negative development in relation to the environmental situation."
"The older the stock of cars on the roads of Europe, the greater the pollution produced - and this is a very important point that we must keep an eye on. If we really want to bring down pollutant emissions, in particular of CO2, and that is our joint priority target, the crucial thing is to replace the old cars currently being driven around the roads of Europe quickly."
"For a little while now, exactly the opposite has been happening."
"The stock of cars on Europe's roads is getting older and older and pollutant emissions are rising."
"I say to you, in the clearest possible way, that if all the parties involved - Parliament, the Council and the Commission - do not pay very close attention to making cars affordable for consumers in the next few years, this situation will be exacerbated further."
"We can, of course, already offer zero-emission cars."
"It is just that no one can afford them."
"We therefore have to create a reasonable relationship between these points."
"As you know, we do have the Cars 21 process."
"Since we recognised the seriousness of the situation at a very early stage, I arranged a 'motor summit' as part of this process a few weeks ago in Brussels with car manufacturers, the Member States in which cars are manufactured, the unions, the environmental associations and all stakeholders."
"Through this, a couple of things that we need to do became very clear."
"The first of these is that we really must keep the statutory conditions for business stable and predictable."
"The industry must know where it stands and what we expect of it."
"We must keep an eye on the cumulative effects of the measures we take."
"I think it right that I should remind you that CO2 is not the only thing that we are discussing when it comes to the motor industry."
"We have already approved Euro 5 and Euro 6."
"The measures have not yet been implemented, however, and they, too, require high levels of investment and will make vehicles more expensive."
"We have already adopted additional requirements relating to protecting pedestrians."
"This again means a need for heavy investment, and that makes cars more expensive."
"We already currently have making their way through the legislative process further strict regulations relating to safety improvements in European cars."
"The effect is the same."
"When we take all this together, we can already see that European vehicles are going to experience a clear jump in prices over the next few years, and we must take account of this too."
"The second thing was that we agreed that demand must be boosted."
"This can take place in various ways."
"In my opinion, tax incentives are a good tool, but only when the tax incentives in question are CO2-based."
"Tax incentives that quite simply lead to any old cars being bought are really of little use."
"They must be about strengthening the demand for low consumption and environmentally friendly cars."
"The same applies to public procurement."
"Then there is the question of the ability to invest."
"In this regard, there has been a line of credit at the European Investment Bank for years whereby car makers are offered favourable-rate credit in order to develop new environmentally friendly vehicles."
"These lines of credit were also utilised in recent years, so this is nothing new."
"We now need to increase these lines of credit to be able to meet demand and the European Investment Bank is ready to do that."
"I am working on the basis that the relevant decisions will have been taken before December is out."
"Finally, I would like to point out once again that we must ensure in our trade policy, too, that we maintain the future readiness of the European motor industry."
"The competition will be increasingly relocated to regions of the world with expectations of high growth."
"We will be competing in these regions with manufacturers from other parts of the world who manufacture under significantly cheaper conditions than European manufacturers."
"Let me be quite clear here: the great advantage that the European manufacturers have in terms of global competition is the fact that Europe will soon already be offering the cleanest and safest cars in the world and it is my hope, when it comes to quality, that the same will apply and that we will also be offering the best cars in the world."
"Let me add something about the problem at hand, the one that really led to this debate here today in the first place."
"One European car maker, Adam Opel GmbH in Germany, a 100% subsidiary of General Motors, is currently in very worrying financial waters."
"Negotiations are under way between Opel and the German government as to whether there may be a state guarantee to solve Opel's financial problems."
"Very serious arguments of political policy structure are being put forward to oppose this and I can well understand these arguments since we have an industrial policy that is not based on subsidies and that will continue to operate that way."
"Our European industrial policy aims, by hook or by crook, to prevent a return to the old subsidising mindset and instead to help industry to grow through predictable, stable conditions for business and to hold its own in competition."
"The problem at Opel is, however, not one caused by management error, poor production or bad quality cars."
"This company has, in recent years, made particular efforts to meet the requirements of the future, with high levels of investment in modern technology."
"The problem arose solely on the back of the crisis situation at Opel's US parent company."
"I really do believe that what we have here are extraordinary circumstances, circumstances that do not apply to other manufacturers in Europe and which justify the consideration of extraordinary measures."
"I would like to reiterate that we are not talking about subsidies here but about a possible guarantee."
"This is a competitive company we are talking about."
"From the European point of view, we have no interest in seeing Opel disappear from the marketplace, and this is not just a German problem either."
"Opel manufactures in several European countries and has a supply chain stretching across Europe."
"That supply chain is closely connected with all the other car makers, which means that, if a large European manufacturer were to vanish from the marketplace, that would also have consequences for all other manufacturers."
"As I say, that would not be in our interests while, from the social and political viewpoints, it would clearly not be justified to say that Opel employees have to foot the bill - and I want to make this point clearly - for serious and irresponsible errors that were made at the parent company in the United States."
"(Applause)"
"We will see, then, what decision the governments affected reach, and I say the word governments expressly, something that has not been on sufficient public display hitherto."
"In Sweden, too, there is a problem with another General Motors subsidiary, Saab, where the problems are structural and considerably worse."
"In addition, there is a problem in Spain, where the planned production of a new environmentally friendly vehicle is in doubt."
"From the European perspective, I would say that we will do everything in our power to help European manufacturers get through this difficult time so that they will be able to play their role as a real engine for future growth and sound jobs in the future, too."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking about the manufacturing sector in the European Union that produces a third of the cars produced in the world."
"In Europe, the sector employs three million people in addition to all the indirect employment, and it is one of the key industries for the world as a whole in terms of direct sales, indirect sales and total number of people employed."
"Let us also consider that today, while we are having this debate, the most recent estimates say that over the coming year, the numbers of unemployed people throughout the European Union will double."
"Personally, I believe that even this estimate is optimistic."
"I agree with the Commissioner that the car industry should receive assistance, in the attempts that we have requested to produce cars with low emissions and low fuel consumption."
"We need to aid change, not penalise those who are left behind, and we need to link funding to innovation."
"If helping car firms to recover may seem burdensome, the bankruptcy of some of them would cost the EU much, much more."
"The sector is in crisis, throughout the world, and we can find a way out of this situation by making a technological advance - here we are in agreement - and therefore we need to decide between producing 21st century cars in Europe or losing this manufacturing activity to countries which are coming close to producing low-technology, low-cost cars in large quantities, such as India or China."
"It is true that banks are now no longer lending money, that the large automobile firms are using up the liquidity that they had previously built up, and which had existed up until halfway through this year, and that the market has shrunk significantly and will end 2008 with negative figures and, I believe, Mr Jouyet, with a percentage figure closer to two digits, while my forecasts for 2009 are pessimistic."
"Europe has a great opportunity: to support, without discrimination, structural changes to the sector with long-term, low-interest loans and assistance for research."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, faced with the recession, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament advocates a united and European policy."
"This is true not only for financial confidentiality, it also applies to the other economic sectors, including the industrial sector."
"We have often regretted the lack of a strong industrial policy in the European Union."
"Countries such as the United States and Great Britain have allowed their industries to decline while mainly backing services."
"The outcome is not convincing."
"Europe must fight to maintain the extensive industrial fabric on which SMEs and services to businesses are dependent."
"The automotive industry in Europe is by no means a dinosaur, it is not a species doomed to extinction."
"I agree fully with Vice-President Verheugen in this respect."
"We account for one third of all automobile production in the world, despite the fact that car production has declined recently."
"Cars produced in Europe must become cleaner and less energy-guzzling and, for the foreseeable future, we will not be able to do without this essential, individual means of transport."
"The best possible organisation of collective transport will never succeed in appeasing the human need for mobility."
"The European Union must therefore develop a common response to the sector's problems and the response cannot be, as Mr Verheugen has just stated, the strangulation of the European automotive industry."
"I do not want a Europe in which the only cars on the road are Japanese - or, in the future, Chinese."
"I am aware that the politically correct argument insists on promoting so-called 'green' jobs."
"A recent United Nations report estimates the potential for green jobs in the world to be 3% of global jobs."
"This would be very welcome."
"However, simple arithmetic leads us to conclude that 97% of jobs are not green, but fall under the realm of traditional sectors."
"This is another reason for us to fight to maintain a European automotive industry which employs 2 million people directly and 10 million indirectly, equating to 7% of all European jobs."
"When the United States, China and Japan are investing massively in economic programmes, Europe cannot afford to sit back and watch passively as whole swathes of its industry disappear."
"Those who tell us that we must leave the market alone are naïve ideologists."
"Without intervention by the public hand, the hidden hand, dear to Adam Smith, will prefer the short term and will destroy structures that are essential in shaping our common future."
"Lastly, we expect the Commission, Madam President, to provide a proactive framework to maintain the competitiveness and the very existence of the European automotive industry."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, Commissioner Verheugen has very impressively illustrated how the crisis spilled over from the financial market to the market in car sales."
"What is more, the reality of the situation is that confidence has evaporated and uncertainty prevails in respect of future regulation on CO2."
"For this reason, I am only able to call on my fellow Members and the Council to come to a clear and reliable regulation in this area of CO2 regulation for cars very quickly - on the basis of what has been put forward by the French Presidency, for which I can only congratulate you, Mr Jouyet."
"Yet the absolutely most climate-friendly car we could possibly want in Europe is worth nothing if it is in the shop window and not on the road."
"People do not just need to drive such a car, they have to be able to pay for it too."
"That is why we are calling for the following three-pronged approach."
"First of all, get new models on the streets."
"This requires lots of investment in research now, for which reason we welcome the European Investment Bank's programme."
"Ecofin meets on 2 December - we hope that a decision will be made there that will bring about flexible, favourable credit flows in the motor industry."
"Secondly, the motor industry financial institutions must be safeguarded."
"We cannot do that here, at the European level - it must be included within the national rescue packages, which must remain open."
"Thirdly, we must have scrapping premiums in Europe."
"Italy has taken a lead in this area, as has Sweden, though perhaps not quite as impressively as Italy."
"This is how tax incentives can be used to get new models onto the streets."
"It would be good if no European barriers were put in the way on the basis of competition law."
"For that reason, it would also have been good if Mrs Cruz had been present."
"This is the route to a new way forward!"
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, just like yesterday, I feel I have to say that I have great doubt about the honesty with which the Commission is conducting this debate."
"It is my opinion, Commissioner, that as the founder of the CARS 21 strategy group, you must, for starters, accept the responsibility for the fact that it has failed to achieve its aim of putting the European motor industry on a proper future-ready footing."
"What have you actually done over recent years that there is now a need to use this financial crisis to balance the books?"
"The fact that the motor industry in Europe has a strategic problem is one thing."
"However, the fact that you do not include your strategic weaknesses, as it were, over recent years - your inability to get behind environmental innovations - on the balance sheet, that I find dishonest."
"If thousands and tens of thousands of European families are now to fear for the future of their jobs in the motor industry, the Commission, too, the Commissioner and CARS 21 must all bear some responsibility for this."
"How can we actually tell that the Commission, and you in particular, Commissioner, did not do anything to bring about the situation whereby the strategic goals resulting from the volatile oil prices caused by the finite nature of the oil supply and from the exigencies of protecting the climate were not ultimately implemented?"
"Commissioner, you personally blocked your fellow Commissioner Mr Dimas's proposals on CO2 regulation for cars for years."
"You are the one with your foot on the brakes in relation to bringing about a binding target for efficient cars - the conversion to a binding agreement by the middle of the coming decade of something which was voluntarily agreed back in the mid-1990s."
"You want there to be less environmental innovation than was already taken for granted in the mid-1990s."
"Yesterday, we learnt that the Council, under German pressure, is still not prepared to sign up to binding targets for 2020 that are, in any case, still close to those of the mid-1990s."
"For me, these double standards, this dishonesty in the debate about environmental innovation is a scandal."
"I call on you, in this trilogue, to finally live up to a promise you make in this debate about innovation in the motor industry."
"Anything else would mean that you really would assume even greater responsibility for the failure of this industry and its suppliers to be future-ready."
"The crisis in the car industry has various causes, but clearly one of the most important is the fall in purchasing power of most of the population as a result of their low incomes, particularly due to low pay, precarious work and unemployment."
"As a result, one of the most effective measures would be to increase pay through a fair distribution of income."
"However, naturally, other measures are required now."
"This is because the halt in production by car manufacturers has repercussions on many other sectors, including the various component industries and transport, which may exacerbate the whole economic and social situation."
"Therefore, just as there have been exceptional measures for the financial sector, there should also be exceptional measures for the car sector in order to safeguard employment."
"It cannot be said that defending production and employment is not as important as the financial sector."
"We must ensure the necessary solidarity to support industry in the European Union, particularly in the more fragile economies and sectors."
"In Portugal, this situation is very worrying as the sector is heavily dependent on the strategy of multinationals."
"In recent years, we have seen various relocations, both in the production of cars, as in the case of Opel and Renault, and in the production of components, such as the cases of Yazaki Saltano and Lear in particular, in addition to the threat of reduced employment in other companies, such as Sunviauto and Delphi and in hundreds of micro- and small enterprises affected by this situation."
"In some cases, production has been halted for several days, as at Autoeuropa in Palmela and at Renault's component plant at Cacia, Aveiro, due to a lack of orders."
"With fewer cars and fewer components coming and going, goods transport is also affected."
"Therefore, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, it is vital for the European Union to provide extraordinary support to help industrial production and safeguard employment with rights."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, the harbingers of the crisis in the motor industry, such as the first falls in orders, were probably not taken seriously enough."
"At first we perhaps hoped it would just be gas-guzzling American cars that would be affected."
"Anyone who has spoken a little to car dealers knows diesel vehicles have been hard to shift in the EU, too, for months now."
"Therefore, the European Union should not be surprised by the ever-worsening maelstrom of problems since it has worked industriously to bring about the downfall of this once blooming sector through a flood of regulations, for instance, that have been rained down on the motor industry."
"Companies need a stable, predictable legal basis on which to be able to make plans."
"If the EU constantly changes the rules, it will perhaps eventually drive every industry to ruin."
"Nor should we forget the continuous ratcheting up of the tax load on diesel and, recently, the biofuels adventure."
"To solve the crisis, then, it will not be enough for the EU to release the planned EUR 40 billion in credit."
"The Union must create predictable conditions of trade in future that it is possible to plan around, and it must do so for every industry."
"(DE) Madam President, I would like, once again, to emphasise the importance of the motor industry with its 12 million direct and indirect jobs and its status as a worldwide technology leader in the sector."
"We must recall - Commissioner Verheugen and others have done so - that the motor industry is of course dependent on the state of the economy and the price of oil and that buyer behaviour exhibits a dramatic loss of confidence in times of crisis in the financial markets."
"That is the main problem in the motor industry."
"Competition is very tight, and it simply cannot be possible for an individual company - or even an individual Member State - to put in place measures which distort competition without the European Commission taking care to prevent the distortion in question."
"I say this by way of a preliminary remark."
"In light of this, the proposals to create a Europe-wide economic stimulus package are just as counterproductive as individual proposals to put up a protective shield over the entire motor industry."
"I believe the right course to be to promote research and development into low-pollutant vehicles, either through the research programme or by means of credits, as proposed by the Commission."
"I think it is necessary to ensure that aid at the Member State level, equally, is not allowed to lead to distortions in competition."
"I am also absolutely convinced that we must not alter competition policy overall, as I have read in recent days in proposals, including from prominent sources within this House."
"The Commission is right when it applies the rules on competition strictly."
"I would also say, however, that it is possible that we need to come up with European transitional solutions - but not long-term subsidisation - for management errors of the like that have affected GM in the United States and its subsidiaries, and that such solutions must be subject to competition law."
"Only in this way can the jobs in this industry be secured in the long term, and I would also say that the best incentive would be to postpone a sensible climate-change policy for cars, make cars affordable, as has been said, and not to make any excessive demands."
"I can only describe what Mrs Harms said in this regard as completely removed from the reality of the situation."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the reality is that the motor industry is in crisis and there are many reasons for this."
"The financial crisis, in particular, has further accelerated the crisis in this sector and the Member States are currently working on resolutions."
"The European automotive industry is a key industry."
"For that reason, we need European solutions for this key European industry in order to defeat this crisis."
"Nearly all car makers have European structures."
"In order to be able to implement the necessary investment in environmentally friendly vehicles - as has been mentioned a number of times today - and low-consumption technologies, car makers need public guarantees or low interest credit from the European Investment Bank."
"The supply industry, too - and this is very important - must not be forgotten in all this."
"The supply industry contains small and medium-sized companies in which jobs are created and innovation occurs."
"Yet what can the European Union do to protect this key industry?"
"In the last plenary part-session, the President-in-Office of the Council proposed that key industries should be protected."
"For me, this was a good idea, because if you take the proposal to its logical conclusion it means a 'Volkswagen Law' for the entire European motor industry."
"That would certainly be a sound instrument."
"The European Commission, however, is currently fighting against this protective instrument."
