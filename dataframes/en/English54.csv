"It is not true to say that this directive creates greater legal certainty, because there is no clear and uniform definition."
"If it is to achieve the Lisbon strategy, the EU needs patent legislation that protects financially weak, generally small companies and inventors, and thus encourages innovation."
"What the EU does not need is patent legislation that leads to a monopolisation of patent rights."
"– The Regulation governing the statute and the financing of political parties at European level violates the fundamental principles I referred to during the course of yesterday’s debate. It also violates some of the procedural provisions of the Treaty."
"By way of example, it violates Article 202 of the EC Treaty, which states that executive powers can be given to the Commission but not to the European Parliament."
"It also violates Article 198 of the EC Treaty, according to which, ‘save as otherwise provided in this Treaty, the European Parliament shall act by an absolute majority of the votes cast’."
"Article 5 of the Regulation states that the European Parliament shall verify compliance with the conditions of funding ‘by the majority of its members’, while Article 191 of the Treaty does not give it any authority in this regard."
"All this shows that this is illegal."
"The Dimitrakopoulos report attempts to rectify this irregularity by reintroducing the requirement of the outcome of the vote to be a ‘majority of the votes cast’ vote at the level of the European Parliament regulation."
"This, however, does nothing but increase the confusion and the contradictions."
"We hope that these anomalies will provide sufficient grounds for the Court of Justice to declare that this inopportune and badly-constructed regulation does not conform to the Treaty."
"The European political parties, or rather the manna from heaven that ought to fund them, amount to a rather sorry sight."
"This is how I understand Mrs Voynet’s declaration of her faith in Europe by the creation of a European Green Party. She also expressed her concern that Europe is not sufficiently loved by its citizens."
"I doubt that this self-interested love demonstrated by the Greens, and by all the other political parties developing the necessary structures to be able to emerge, will actually strengthen the democracy of the European Union."
"The report of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has been cobbled together in a makeshift manner. It is a legal monster born of Regulation (EC) No 2004/2003, which, after numerous setbacks, was adopted on 4 November 2003."
"The regulation is currently the subject of an appeal before the Court of Justice, which I filed together with several of my fellow Members, thus showing that the delegation of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities is equally determined to oppose this new resolution."
"Further, we see the new politico-financial responsibilities devolved to the Bureau of the European Parliament as a cause for concern."
"The Bureau will be sitting in judgment upon itself. There is also likely to be extra work, in the very short –term, for the Court of Auditors and for OLAF."
". As we can see, Parliament is assigned ‘a new task, which is different from the “traditional” tasks’, in which ‘Parliament exercises “external” powers’, in other words, monitoring ‘European political parties’."
"This would, for example, establish the procedure of ‘sanctioning’ a ‘European political party’ that no longer observed the ‘principles upon which the EU is founded’."
"While the report tries to have us believe that it is of a technical nature, I feel that this report is, much to the contrary, highly significant politically."
"It puts in place the ‘Statute and financing of European political parties’, which sets out – and this is crucial – a certain model of the European political party, and establishes procedures for access to financing, for which discriminatory conditions must be fulfilled."
"There are many aspects to cover, but it is essential to mention how strange it is that Parliament is in charge of this process, since it will be the judge and the judged, and this according to criteria and procedures that may lead to exclusions on entirely political grounds."
"I should also like to point out that the original aim of this entire process was to bypass the Court of Auditors’ criticism of the financing by certain groups in Parliament of their respective ‘European parties’."
"This solution has been imposed by the dominant players in the EU, without any genuine support, hence our vote against."
"– Parliament seems to be ignoring the three appeals concerning this procedure brought by different political groupings. They contested the legality of the Regulation governing the statute and the funding of political parties at European level."
"Parliament should remember that the existence of these parties is far from being established, and that this regulation violates many principles, among them the principle of equality, the principle of freedom of thought and of conscience, the principle of democracy, and the principles of the separation of powers, political pluralism and subsidiarity."
"Firstly, this new system will allow the funding for such parties to be withheld not on objective criteria but on criteria based on teleology and political purpose."
"In requiring the parties to observe ‘the principles upon which the European Union is founded’, parties which do not subscribe to a particular European doctrine will be barred from receiving any funding."
"Furthermore, this control is initiated and operated by Parliament itself."
"It cannot be a judge and a party at the same time."
"This new system will also lead to many different kinds of discrimination."
"In effect, by imposing very high requirements for the formation of a European political party, the aim is to exclude new groups."
"In this regulation, the usual legal approach has been swept aside for an entirely arbitrary one."
"Does Parliament want to make a stand for democracy?"
"If so, I call on it to counter all threats to political pluralism."
"– The report before us contains the first measures on the application of the Regulation governing the statute and financing of political parties at European level, adopted in June 2003."
"The report determines which Parliamentary bodies are competent to allocate public funds to European parties."
"Although in the past I supported the Regulation, I cannot now endorse the content of this report."
"The report entrusts the allocation and management of Community funds to the Bureau of the European Parliament, on the grounds that the Bureau is already responsible for funding issues concerning the internal organisation of Parliament. This is clearly not a convincing argument."
"The allocation of Community subsidies depends on political loyalty. The interpretation of this does not entail all the necessary guarantees of impartiality – far from it."
"It is therefore totally unacceptable to make the Bureau responsible for deciding on requests for or the suspension of public funding. The Bureau is a bureaucratic body where only certain political tendencies are represented."
"As this is a political issue, the Conference of Presidents should be entrusted with the necessary powers, as it is an openly political body."
". We voted against the Dimitrakopoulos report because it completes the procedures for the promotion of the central idea of the Rules of Procedure for the European parties and their financing, in other words the creation of agencies and mechanisms which will ‘create a European conscience’ and cultivate the perception of the one-way, capitalist, anti-grass roots policy."
"Any opposition voiced will be denied any room for expression."
"Measures are being taken to muzzle the opponents of the system."
"Rights are being abolished, such as the right of free expression and to establish political parties."
"On the basis of Community orders and the choices of big business, the European Parliament is being turned into the judge of the ‘political correctness’ of these parties."
"The majorities will decide on the legality of the existence of the minorities or at least on the terms on which their ideas are projected and on whether or not resources should be granted for such projection."
"The amendments proposed by Mr Dimitrakopoulos move in a more conservative direction."
"While excessive powers are granted to the more easily controlled Bureau of the European Parliament, the sole right reserved for the European Parliament itself is to decide ‘by a majority of the votes cast’ (not even an absolute majority of its members) if a party does or does not observe the principles of the EU; in other words, if it fits into the mould of big business in the ΕU and its system."
"We shall vote against this report because it turns the European Parliament from a forum for the juxtaposition of ideas into the judge of the right of ideas to exist."
". We should like to call into question the contentious point that decisions on establishing political alliances or political parties at European level, which are not internal organs of Parliament, and on allocating grants to these organisations, are the exclusive competence of Parliament."
"This is especially controversial as it is based on vague and elastic criteria, allowing decision-making to take place purely on political grounds, in which the Members will be both judge and judged."
"It is precisely because the Bureau is the body with the competence to take such decisions that I voted against this report."
"Not every political group represented in Parliament sits on the Bureau, yet all political groups must take part in such politically charged decisions as creating political organisations that are eligible for Community funds. Otherwise, the transparency of these decisions is compromised."
"The Union for Europe of the Nations Group consequently tabled an amendment aimed at replacing the Bureau with the Conference of Presidents, the body that reconciles such representation."
"Given that this proposal was rejected, I voted against."
". The report before us is a response to the need to amend Parliament’s Rules of Procedure, in view of the new competences in the fields of financial management and of monitoring the legitimacy of political parties at European level."
"To my mind, this undermines the provisions of the Treaties."
"The Bureau will be responsible for most of the tasks relating to the operation of the funding system, since it is the body responsible for financial and administrative matters concerning Members and the internal organisation of Parliament."
"I must reiterate the need – in accordance with the principles of appropriateness and proportionality – for provisions, especially financial provisions, concerning political parties at European level, to be extended and actually applied to all political parties at European level, without discrimination and regardless of whether or not they are part of European political parties or European alliances of political parties."
"As Mr Berthu stated in his minority opinion, I fear that the new system will bring about all manner of discrimination."
"I also regret the rejection of an amendment tabled by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, conferring competence to the Conference of Presidents, rather than the Bureau, which would be a more solid guarantee of pluralism and participation."
"I voted against."
". I believe that the European parties' statute, which provides for the financing of European political parties, is in breach of the subsidiarity principle."
"It is for the citizens of a Member State to decide whether or not they will choose to fund national political parties or independent representatives."
"The criteria for EU funding only of pan-European political parties exclude and therefore discriminate against smaller national parties and independents."
"It is also extremely worrying that the decision on whether or not a party will share in EU funding will be taken by an institution of the European Union."
"This hardly supports the fundamental principles of democracy and subsidiarity."
"Mr President, I said earlier that this was largely a tidying-up exercise, but drew attention to the fact that Rule 180(8) would now apply to all Rules of Procedure."
"This means that in the new Rules to be published in time for the new Parliament – indeed, presumably in time for the enlarged Parliament in May – the figures in our Rules will automatically be adjusted to suit the expanded size of Parliament."
"Those figures have to be adjusted to be the same proportion for the enlarged Parliament as they are for this Parliament."
"For instance, the figure of 32 Members needed to table a motion or an amendment will rise proportionately."
"Through what we have voted, this will also apply to Rule 29 in its new version, which lays down the minimum size for constituting a political group in Parliament."
"The figure in the new version is '16 Members from at least 5 countries'."
"That will have to be revised upwards to 19 Members – or whatever the number is – from at least 5 countries."
"However, as we realised that this would affect existing groups in the House just for the May part-session, there is a provision that allows existing groups to continue as they are until the elections, irrespective of this rule change."
"This means that none of the existing groups need to fear being dissolved before the election campaign."
"They will subsequently have to look at their situation in the newly elected Parliament after the elections, as will every group, on the basis of the verdict of the electorate."
"Mr President, I believe Mrs Frassoni made a comment about voting on Amendment No 4."
"A number of votes were taken en bloc."
"If I am correct, I think the point she made was that temporary committees would no longer have the same status as they have had in the past: Parliament would not be able to set up temporary committees."
"Mr Corbett, am I right on this point?"
"I do not want to encourage a debate here, but Mr Corbett, please make a brief response."
"Mr President, I can allay the fears of colleagues: Mrs Frassoni was mixing up committees of inquiry and temporary committees."
"I will take the matter up bilaterally with her."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted against the Paulsen report not so much because of its content – with which I was not totally familiar– than as a reaction to the procedure."
"After the vote in committee, we were faced with a result that made implementation of the regulation impossible."
"That was a reflection of the widely varying opinions of the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"At the rapporteur’s request, the Council has now, and somewhat unusually, brought forward a new text in advance of the vote in the House."
"The rapporteur agreed this text with four of the groups in Parliament and presented it to this House in what I see as a very undignified manner, with new versions of the English text being presented day after day over the last week."
"It was not until this morning that all the changes, that is to say changes in the form of the Council text, were presented to Parliament."
"We are now looking at a totally new legislative text that has not been discussed in committee beforehand."
"This House has had no opportunity whatsoever to adopt a position on this text in committee; instead, the text was immediately presented to the House with adoption today by a non-qualified majority vote."
"If we made this system the rule, then we would certainly have a very rapid procedure, and we could deal with all legislative texts within four weeks."
"The Council would just have to present a text, four Members of this House would nod it through, and the whole House would vote for it, because it would not be possible to address its actual content."
"I regard this way of proceeding as extremely dangerous, because the hallmark of a parliament is the way it debates a topic and its diversity of opinion."
"It cannot amount to a dictatorship by a handful of people in the groups, who explain overnight at a group meeting what is in the text, without anyone knowing exactly what is actually being voted on."
"I urge you to think about this and only to permit this procedure in exceptional cases in future."
"I can of course understand that Mrs Paulsen is anxious to put her report to bed, because she is not coming back."
"However, she could also have achieved that by talking to me. But that is not what happened."
"I hope you will take this point on board and reject any such procedure in future."
"Today's vote, which was a first reading, required only a simple majority."
"Whether or not we had a qualified majority was not at issue today."
"That will be an issue at another stage of the procedure."
"As you know – and I heard your point – the House is sovereign."
"I followed the correct procedure, I put the question to the House, I followed the advice of the rapporteur, I invited the committee chair to speak, a majority expressed itself in favour of proceeding and I then did so, as is my duty."
". We have recently seen a series of food and livestock crises, such as ‘mad cow disease’ and foot and mouth, which illustrate the need to raise food safety standards."
"Appropriate legislation must be adopted that encompasses all stages of food production and processing, that ensures that consumers are provided with the information that they need and that sets up official control systems, thereby ensuring compliance with the law and penalties for those who infringe it."
"Food and animal feed must be safe for human and animal health."
"Safety must be the overriding consideration, ahead of any commercial aim, be this for pure profit or for trade facilitation."
"A heady climate of permissiveness has been created in the wake of the abolition of internal borders and the gradual liberalisation of trade, which has, in turn, led to a lack of investment in essential technical resources (such as reference laboratories and research centres) and human resources (such as professional training)."
"This situation must be stopped."
"This regulation forms part of the same approach as other regulations in the White Paper on food safety, which establishes a series of common aims in the field of food safety and common EU-level sanctions."
"In other words, it addresses the consequences without calling into question either the underlying production model or liberalisation."
"The proposals contained in the report fall short of what is required, despite a number of welcome proposals, such as the application of the same ..."
". Since the mid-1990s, the EU has adopted an increasing number of legislative acts on questions of health and safety concerning food and animal feed, with the aim of responding to consumers’ pressing concerns."
"Monitoring and inspection have played a crucial role in this response."
"The battle is far from being won."
"As the rapporteur stresses, what is required is greater stringency and a common legislative system applicable to all official monitoring."
"The objective is increased safety, both for consumers and for producers, and this report is a further step forward in the field of food safety, specifically in food and animal feed."
"I am aware that this is a subject that has long been a priority area for the EU and, as such, I endorse the amendments tabled by the rapporteur."
"These measures will bring significant benefits to consumers."
"Mr President, on my own and Mrs Boogerd-Quaak’s behalf, I would state that we voted against the Fourtou report in the final vote."
"Certainly, it is important that measures be taken to combat piracy, but the regulations as amended go much further."
"In particular, extending the regulations to include patents would be a mistake."
"We can also concur with Mr Schnellhardt’s criticism of the procedure, a criticism that can also apply where this point is concerned."
"For example, the group had extremely few opportunities to discuss this matter before we faced having to make a final decision."
"There is also justification for observing that more than 50 leading experts on intellectual property law in Europe appealed to Parliament to look more carefully at the matter, something we have not, however, done."
"The legal basis can also be questioned, since the procedure is now at issue."
"Pursuant to Article 95 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, the Community has not usually approved such procedures."
"I wish therefore to observe that we have obtained regulations that may damage small enterprises and that are not limited to combating piracy, which is what is important."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I did not vote for the amendments to the European Parliament’s Rules of Procedure on the financing of political parties; not because I am not in agreement with all this, but because it is the logical consequence of the fact that back in June last year my colleagues and I voted against the Leinen report."
"Implementing the regulation in this way amounts to discrimination against the smaller party groupings in this House, which although they are active at European level nevertheless are not represented in any group."
"Financial support is given to large party groupings but not to smaller ones, thus creating a huge gap in terms of democratic deficit between these two kinds of grouping."
"We all know that parties and their organisations are dependent on financial contributions."
"This creates an uneven playing field between the parties at European level, and I cannot vote for that."
"Mr President, I voted against the Fourtou report on intellectual property."
"In my opinion, the European Parliament has made a serious error of ethical judgment when voting on this report today."
"The votes of the conservative, socialist and liberal Members produced a majority for a position on the issue of intellectual property that, in my view, gives too much weight to the interests of large multinationals as against the interests of citizens. Intellectual property tends not to be an easy issue to deal with."
"How are we going to explain to the citizens of Europe that Parliament’s rapporteur, the person with the highest profile in relation to this dossier, is married to Mr Fourtou, who is none other than the chairman of Vivendi Universal?"
"How can Parliament explain its policy to the thousands of European citizens, especially young people who learn about European policy on this issue by email, while the question of the existence of a personal interest overshadows a text such as this?"
"I think Parliament has made a very serious mistake today."
"Thank you, Mr Turmes."
"As you know, Mr MacCormick has already raised this question in a different way."
"For our part, I will put the question of interests, including family interest, to our Bureau."
"I will then be guided by its wisdom."
"This issue has certainly been the subject of much discussion within the House."
"I am not referring to this particular rapporteur nor to today’s report, but to the principle."
"This is a problem that we must address."
"We have voted in favour of Mrs Fourtou’s report (A5-0468/2003) on measures and procedures to ensure the enforcement of intellectual property rights and the negotiated compromise package."
"It has been important to us to ensure protection for citizens and their rights and, at the same time, to combat growing trademark counterfeiting, pirate copying and the infringement of intellectual property rights."
"Moreover, the directive ensures further harmonisation of national legal regulations on the enforcement of intellectual property rights and helps ensure that the legislation is complied with."
"The compromise means that the proposal is limited to circumstances of a major commercial character. It excludes offences by consumers who have acted in good faith and strengthens people’s right to carry out private copying in accordance with the Copyright Directive."
"It means that judges must take account of the intention behind infringements, and it ensures the confidentiality of important information."
"Moreover, adoption is in accordance with the EU’s global obligations in relation to the World Intellectual Property Organization It also means that there is proportionality in the proposal and that obstacles to trade must not be created."
"Finally, we consider it important to have the proposal adopted before enlargement."
"Adoption following enlargement could mean that future legislation would only be adopted in several years’ time, which could lead to increased illegal activity."
"We have chosen to vote against the compromise on the harmonisation of the Member States’ legislation on intellectual property rights, mainly because of the amendments to Article 9 that have been tabled."
"If the proposals for amending Article 9 are adopted, this will lead to conflict with Swedish legal tradition, especially the principle of the free sifting of evidence."
"We believe that, if such large alterations are to be made to legislation and thus to Swedish legal tradition, the changes should be well thought through and well worked out, and not arrived at in a hurry as these have been."
"We are not therefore opposed to altering the legislation, but we do not believe that the changes are satisfactory in their current form."
". The issue addressed in this report is difficult due to its history and its far-reaching ramifications."
"As far as we are concerned, we are vehemently opposed to pirating and counterfeiting, and we advocate rules to promote the use of discoveries and inventions that belong to all humankind in these free and fair times."
"The first consideration is, therefore, the object of the protection of intellectual property."
"Should authors’ rights, trademarks and patents be treated in the same way?"
"While we steadfastly oppose the misappropriation and commercialisation of human knowledge and of what is part of human heritage, we acknowledge the difficulty of striking a balance between legitimate property rights and the social and collective benefits of the item concerned."
"This, however, is the theory."
"Whereas mechanisms to protect these rights are unable to stop trade and abuse, they must not be so lax as to allow, or even encourage, pirating and counterfeiting."
"An example of this is Port wine, and other such designations of origin to be preserved or created, given that it represents heritage that is universal and, therefore, local and national."
"As such, in the name of spurious liberalisation, it can have a devastating economic, social and cultural impact, as well as a detrimental effect on health."
"The rapporteur has shown caution and, on this issue, it is better to be safe than sorry."
"Nonetheless, the rejection of certain amendments, especially those relating to the ‘federalist’ tendency, in which caution was nowhere to be seen, led us to vote against."
".– Economic operators commit serious violations of intellectual property rights on a commercial scale. They deceive consumers or they usurp the identity, reputation or technical procedures other businesses have invested a lot in establishing."
"It is therefore right to establish special legal measures to combat this scourge."
"Under pressure from certain lobbies, however, certain people wanted to ensure that this directive is applied with particular flexibility."
"This is extremely dangerous as it opens the door to the abuse of these anti-counterfeiting measures. They could be used against private individuals, guilty of saving music from the Internet onto a CD, for example."
"Big business could also use these measures to harass weaker competitors such as small- and medium-sized enterprises, for example."
"Lastly, there is the fear that this directive could be used to return in a roundabout fashion to subjects on which Parliament has already reached a decision, like generic medicines and the impossibility of patenting software."
"This is why I voted against this draft directive, which Parliament has not succeeded in amending satisfactorily."
". I voted in favour of this resolution, as I naturally endorse the promotion of new technical requirements and new processes that actively contribute towards adopting measures taken against the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants."
"The purpose of this proposal is to strengthen Community requirements regarding the restriction of new heavy vehicles’ polluting emissions (positive-ignition engines fuelled with natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas)."
"This therefore constitutes a further important means of promoting the sustainable development that the EU champions."
"Given the mishaps and delays that have affected this process and the ‘speed’ with which we are trying to push through amendments to the Commission’s proposals, there is no chance of establishing a framework in which operators and professionals in the sector are forced to comply with rules and to be subject to the relevant inspections."
"The rules have not been clarified and feasibility checks, especially of certain monitoring methods, have not been carried out."
"We must launch an awareness-raising campaign, as soon as possible, in collaboration with these professionals."
"We voted against Amendment No 1, designed to limit the applicability of the Framework Decision so that, where the drugs trade is concerned, it applies only to serious and/or international crime."
"We support the Council decision as a whole and believe that this addition would limit the scope of the Framework Decision and, therefore, clearly entail a deterioration in the Council’s document."
"We also wish to emphasise that the EU should deploy every possible means to combat the use and sale of drugs."
"We interpret the Council decision as saying that drug trafficking is prohibited, and we therefore believe that ‘coffee shops’ should not exist within the EU."
"– There are three reasons for our rejecting the creation of an independent agency with its own legal personality to manage external borders."
"Firstly, management of the land, maritime and air borders is the sovereign prerogative of Member States."
"It is for Member States to guard against the flow of migrants and to combat people trafficking."
"The Council of Ministers is, furthermore, unanimous on this issue."
"Secondly, each Member State should have a representative on the Management Board. Decisions must be unanimous rather than being taken by a majority."
"To our great surprise, France is the only country proposing a 12-member Management Board, so removing the rights of Member States to manage their own borders."
"Lastly, in our opinion, it is out of the question for the Agency to have exclusive powers on issues such as the removal of third country nationals illegally residing in a Member State and the establishment of a European Corps of Border Guards."
"The United Kingdom and Ireland made the right decision in refusing to accept the Schengen on the control of external borders."
"The French Government should have had the courage to do the same."
". We know that drug-trafficking is a threat to the health, safety and quality of life of citizens."
"In 2001, the Commission adopted an EU-level approach to combating trafficking, in view of its transnational nature."
"The final agreement laid down substantial amendments to the Commission’s original proposal, such as the establishment of new sanctions that tally more closely with those set out in the UN Conventions on this issue, in contrast to the limited definition that the Commission had put forward."
"We welcome the fact that consumption is not penalised, although this question is not addressed as thoroughly as we would have liked."
"We are opposed to the European Arrest Warrant, hence our final vote."
"At present, drugs policy is not harmonised within the EU. Instead, each country devises its own policy."
"That does not, however, prevent the drugs issue from appearing high on the political agenda."
"Ever younger people are misusing drugs, and more and more young people see no danger in trying cannabis."
"Even what are termed party drugs, that is to say the most dangerous synthetic drugs of all, are becoming more widespread."
"In a Europe without borders, we are in danger of having ever greater drugs problems as the legalisation of drugs extends beyond the Netherlands."
"Many appear already to have given up the fight for a drugs-free Europe."
"It deserves to be repeated that there is a link between the number of people who try drugs and the number of people who are in danger of getting hooked on their misuse."
"The possession and use of drugs must therefore remain criminal offences."
"The wrong signals are still being sent out to the young people of Europe when anyone can buy five grams of cannabis at a so-called coffee shop."
"We must not be satisfied with this Framework Decision, but must continue to strive for a drugs-free Europe."
"We say no."
"We do not wish to legalise, we do not wish to liberalise and we have not given up the dream of zero tolerance for drugs."
". Under the Italian Presidency, we were finally able to conclude an agreement on the minimum provisions applicable in the field of combating drugs at Community level."
"The main objections, both in the European Parliament and in the Council, came from the Netherlands, where the consumption and sale of small quantities of soft drugs are permitted."
"It is, therefore, understandable that the Oostlander report should have confined itself to proposing that the Council framework decision should be accepted in the version presented, without any amendments, because this text received unanimous approval after a year of negotiations."
"This did not stop me from voting in favour of the measures that have been proposed."
"I wish to highlight two of these: the penalisation of all types of trafficking, production and sale of opium, cocaine and cannabis, and the condemnation of the production of synthetic drug precursors if they are produced with the aim of processing drugs."
"Applying the principle of subsidiarity allows Member States to use the framework decision to sanction personal consumption, but does not force them to do so, thereby respecting the various national legal and criminal systems of the Member States."
". After years of discussion in Council, an agreement was concluded last November on the minimum provisions applicable in the Community-level fight against drugs, and this agreement has been submitted once again for the consideration of the European Parliament."
"All types of trafficking, cultivation and sales of opium, cocaine and cannabis will be penalised and the production of synthetic drug precursors is to be condemned if they are produced with the aim of processing drugs."
"Activities relating to drugs used exclusively for personal consumption as defined by national law are, on the other hand, excluded from the scope of this framework decision."
"This means that, on the basis of the principle of subsidiarity, although Member States use the framework decision to sanction personal consumption, they are under no obligation to do so."
"Illegal drug-related activities will be punished by criminal penalties of at least one to three years’ imprisonment and incentives, aid or attempts to commit one of these infringements will also be punished."
"I regret, however, (and everything suggests that this is the result of pressure by the Netherlands), that judicial cooperation and extradition are not pursued more vigorously."
"I voted in favour."
"We are well disposed towards an agency for better coordination and cooperation in the area of border controls."
"We wish nonetheless to emphasise the importance of national self-determination in the implementation of border controls."
"There must be no restrictions upon the competence of the Member States, and their influence upon the development of border cooperation must be retained in full."
". We are very much in favour of greater cooperation between States for the better control of external borders and of the creation of a technical agency to encourage such cooperation."
"The von Boetticher report on the subject calls for a qualified judgment, however."
"On the one hand, it tries to limit the agency’s tasks to technical cooperation and says that ‘the management of national borders should remain a sovereign Member State responsibility’, which is excellent."
"On the other hand, however, it sets the new system not in an intergovernmental framework but in a Community one, guided by the Commission and under the political control of the European Parliament, thus opening the way to extensions of supranational competences in the future."
"It must in fact be read in parallel with the draft European Constitution, which shows the mentality that prevails in Brussels: Article 3(166) charges the Union with ‘the gradual introduction of an integrated management system for external borders’, that is a supranational system with a European border police."
"Although the von Boetticher report limits the agency’s tasks for the time being, it cannot therefore give us any reassurance."
"It appears to be looking to extend Community powers, which is inappropriate here."
". This report should be seen in the context of ‘gradually developing a genuinely integrated system of external border control management’, as proposed, in fact, in the draft ‘European Constitution’."
"Whilst containing some contradictions, as a result of its supranational perspective – the report endorses the Commission’s role in this agency – at the same time, it rightly states that monitoring national borders should remain a sovereign Member State responsibility."
"One of the report’s more positive aspects is to criticise the idea of giving this agency the task of expelling immigrants."
"What is being proposed is basically to create an agency that will have responsibilities to date held by the Member States, which will prop up what is known as ‘Fortress Europe’ and which will assist in stamping out immigration and in expelling immigrants."
"I accept that there must be cooperation between national bodies, in order to combat networks that exploit immigrants and traffic in human beings and to combat organised crime and money-laundering."
"Mechanisms for this purpose already exist, however, and so there is no need to create new instruments that remove tasks which fall strictly within the competence of the national authorities and which are sovereign Member State responsibilities."
"The crux of the issue is not, therefore, to create new agencies but to change current policies."
"Hence our vote against the report."
". Due to the increase in the external land, sea and air borders that will need to be monitored after enlargement takes place in May 2004, the European Union needs an effective system for managing its external borders, in particular to combat international terrorism and organised crime, illegal immigration, trafficking in arms, drugs and human beings and to combat crime at sea."
"For this reason, I support the establishment of a European Agency for the Management of Operational Co-operation at the External Borders."
"It was, incidentally, in this context, that I suggested – and plenary adopted this suggestion last November – a proposal to the effect that, when the next financial perspective is negotiated, Community programmes should be put in place to support defence re-fitting, in particular, a programme exclusively dedicated to developing equipment to protect the EU’s external borders."
"Nevertheless, given the intergovernmental nature of border control and in light of the experience that each of the Member States has acquired in performing this task, I believe that each Member State should be represented on the Agency’s Management Board to ensure that it can benefit from the skills and knowledge acquired ‘on the ground’ by each country at its own borders."
"Since the report did not see fit to take up this concern, however, I felt obliged to vote against it."
". Establishing the European Agency for the Management of Operational Co-operation at the External Borders, which is expected to take up its responsibilities on 1 January 2005, arose out of the overwhelming need to improve the management of controls at the external borders which, it should be noted, now total 6 000 km in length."
"Account must also be taken of the European Union’s enlargement."
"I disagree with the rapporteur’s view that the Agency should have a ‘more Communitarian’ character, but I did agree with the position expressed by the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, to the effect that the intergovernmental nature of border control should be maintained."
"This is in fact the line adopted in the Commission communication – without prejudice to a system of majority voting in the Agency (for operational reasons)."
"On the one hand, this is a result of the Community legal system itself – and of the current division of powers – but, on the other, today offers better safeguards for the experience acquired by each Member State in performing these tasks (whether at air, sea or land borders or at all three)."
"It therefore appears to make sense that the Management Board should be composed of one Member from each Member State, assisted by two representatives of the Commission."
"Consequently, I voted against the report."
"It must be possible for both women and men to combine family life and working life."
"We therefore welcome a Framework Directive in this area which establishes objectives in terms of, for example, working time, access to child care and minimum periods of parental leave."
"We do not, however, think that issues concerning the ways in which welfare is to be organised should be decided at EU level."
"We have therefore voted against wordings that require special forms of tax relief or the use of what are termed vouchers or that in other ways regulate welfare policy in detail."
"We also wish to emphasise that families can take different forms in terms of how their members live together, and we therefore support the wording that states this."
"Families that do not consist of mother, father and child must also be recognised and be given the same legal status as the traditional family."
"We believe that family policy must be characterised by freedom of choice."
"It must be possible for both parents to combine working life with responsibility for their family."
"The Moderate family policy envisages highly flexible child care."
"We are, in principle, able to support quite a few of the proposals presented in the report."
"We note that, in its explanatory statement, the report emphasises that family policy does not come within the competence of the EU."
"We agree with that and have therefore chosen to vote against the report as a whole."
". As we all know, at the Barcelona European Council, the Member States gave a commitment to eliminate obstacles to the participation of women in the labour market and to set up, by 2010, childcare facilities for at least 90% of children between three years old and the mandatory school age and for at least 33% of children under three years old."
"The need was stressed for a financial contribution for the creation and/or operation of high-quality childcare services at affordable prices."
"How, then, can this be reconciled with social spending cuts or with a large part of the childcare network being dismantled in the enlargement countries?"
"Giving families more subsidies, vouchers or tax benefits is pointless unless the necessary infrastructures are in place."
"Unfortunately, the proposal we tabled to extend childcare to cover, by 2010, all children until they enter compulsory education was also rejected."
"We must also highlight the need for structures to support the elderly and dependent persons, to improve the timetables of urban services, (opening hours for shops, businesses, transport, etc.) and integrated and humane housing and town planning."
"The report also calls for shorter working hours, a change of mindset, for a more equitable division of family responsibilities, and ..."
". Since the 1990s, the Council has launched several actions to reconcile work and family life, making this a highly topical issue, and 2004 has consequently been declared International Year of the Family"
"Mrs Bastos’s report argues that everyone should be able to choose whether to work or to stay at home and, if they decide to work, they must be able to reconcile working life with the needs of the family, whether in terms of children or the elderly, who are increasingly part of the family setup."
"I could not agree more with this principle and I therefore welcome not only Mrs Bastos’s request that the European Commission evaluate the state of policies for reconciling family life, working life and private life, both in the current Member States and in the candidate countries, but also the emphasis she gives to measures to be implemented to support the family."
"These include financial assistance for childcare and education, vouchers for the recruitment of home helps for families with disabled children and vouchers to help low-income families with three children or more."
". In line with the proposal I tabled in the relevant committee, I welcome, in particular, the inclusion of the framework concept of ‘family-friendly policies’, and the guideline to pursue policies governing taxation and other levies and tariffs in public services that take account of the family and the greater size of family units, without discriminating against them."
"Also important is the report’s recognition of the social and economic value of family and domestic work, which is often overlooked and scorned, either through deeply-held prejudice or a simple lack of interest, which results in prejudice against individuals and in real inequalities."
"I also welcome the adoption of the amendment I tabled against revising the concept of the family."
"Revising this concept would be both misguided and also outside the sphere of Parliament’s competence."
"The family, which is a secular sociological and anthropological reality and is unequivocally deep-rooted, must not be confused with individual options that result in different situations and which do not fall within the scope of the family."
"I would also highlight the aptness of the reference to the need to provide specific allowances for situations including large families, for children with disabilities or for multiple births, and also the idea that the Member States must develop forms of cooperation and networks for exchanging good practice."
"Once again, I congratulate Mrs Bastos on her excellent work and on the enormous step forward that this report represents."
"It will serve as a benchmark for family policies in the European Parliament."
"I have actively supported the fact that, in paragraph 3, the European Parliament comes out in favour of the Christian Democratic idea ‘that family policy should create preconditions to enable parents to spend more time with their children’."
"The same paragraph also emphasises the value of the fact that this would also ‘have a positive impact on family formation and family stability’."
"On the basis of this, what paragraph 2 calls ‘tackling the demographic problem faced by the majority of the Member States’ is an urgent matter."
"In accordance with our view of society, Recital K of the report specifies that ‘the rights of children must be at the heart of family policies’."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats succeeded in voting down Recital G (by 321 votes with 169 in favour and 21 abstentions) and, thus, the attempt to create a new and diffuse definition of what constitutes a family, something that is definitely not a task for the EU."
"The PPE-DE Group believes that the concept of the family is based upon children’s right to their mothers and fathers and upon parents’ responsibility for their children."
"Children must always be at the heart of how we construct our society, at the same time as the family is society’s most important and most fundamental building block."
"I therefore voted in favour of the report as a whole (there having been 424 votes in favour, 51 votes against and 37 abstentions)."
". The harsh fact is that women make up only 46% of the working population."
"There are 12 million working women and on average they earn 20% less than men."
"They are in fact victims of inequality, first of all in access to work: their unemployment rate is two points higher than for men and 80% of French adults earning less than the index-linked guaranteed minimum wage (SMIC) are women."
"There are a variety of solutions."
"Obviously, women must be given the means to make a genuine choice between working or not, that is they must be given the means to stay at home and look after their children if they so wish, by increasing family allowances, for example."
"Reconciling work and family life must at last be made possible, however."
"Today, single-parent families account on average for 14% of all families with children and 90% of single parents are women."
"These trends must be taken into account and working hours, childcare systems and childcare allowances, family benefits and parental (maternity or paternity) leave arranged accordingly."
"Equality between men and women certainly requires that."
"But we must be very careful to avoid quota systems such as we already have in the political field."
". This is a positive report, in which the rapporteur divides women from minority groups into: women with disabilities, migrant women and Roma women."
"For women who are disabled, it argues for the Directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation to be transposed and for access to be provided to education, training, employment and occupational training in an ordinary environment."
"The report also calls for these women to be helped to become more independent and for their participation in political life and in decision-making to be promoted."
"As regards migrant women, the report draws attention to incorporating the equality dimension into policies, programmes and actions designed to combat racism, discrimination and social exclusion."
"It calls on the Member States to ensure the effective application of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and specifically states that migrant women should be able to participate in political life and in the decision-making process."
"Where Roma women are concerned, the report draws the attention of the Commission and of the governments involved to the need to ensure the effective application of policies implemented at Community and national level that are likely to improve Roma women’s economic, social and political situation."
"This last aspect is the most important one, due to enlargement."
"The remainder of the report basically consists of rehashing earlier proposals and decisions."
"There is still a need for ..."
". The rapporteur has produced a report on minority women’s groups, specifically women with disabilities, migrant women and Roma women."
"These are interesting perspectives, which warrant everyone’s attention."
"These are problems of which I am aware and to which I would truly like solutions to be found."
"To this end, I must express my particular concern at all types of violence (not only domestic violence) faced by women with disabilities and at the lack of respect for the individual rights of migrant women."
"Since I broadly agree with the content of Mrs Martinez-Orozco’s report, I voted in favour of it."
"Nevertheless, I must point out that the problems I have referred to are not confined to women alone."
"These are situations that occur across the board and affect men too."
"Prior to the Swedish referendum on EU entry in 1994, all the parties working for EU membership stated that cohabitation issues, marriage legislation and abortion issues did not come within the competence of the EU."
"They promised to direct their efforts to ensuring that these issues remained areas in which strictly national legislation applied, without the involvement of the EU."
"We stand firm by that pledge to the Swedish electorate."
"We believe that national legislation is very much better in this area than common EU legislation."
"We observe how other Swedish parties have abandoned that pledge and are ready to transfer these issues to EU level."
"Were that to happen, it would be to the detriment of Swedes and be in danger of conflicting with Swedish custom and tradition."
"There is no obvious need for coordination, and the best adjusted legislation will be achieved if the various national parliaments within the EU are allowed to design the legislation in this area."
"EU aid policy too must respect individual countries’ legislation."
"We share the Swedish view of the right to abortion but, out of respect for third countries, we have voted against those parts of the Junker report that demand free abortion."
"The report also focuses helpfully upon the serious health problems present in the developing countries, where EU aid policy has an important role."
". The official themes of Mrs Junker’s report should have been the major chapters of the United Nations action programme drawn up at the Cairo conference ten years ago."
"We are therefore entirely justified in expecting to find in the report some relevant considerations of economic growth, migration, urbanisation policy or even the environment, all of which were issues raised and highlighted by the Cairo conference."
"It is therefore very surprising to read a text where all these questions are completely passed over in favour of the recurrent obsession with questions of sexual and reproductive health, which occupy no less than 20 of the report’s 27 paragraphs."
"Even a question as central as education is mentioned only for the part it may play in the matter."
"In short, the rapporteur sees the population question in the developing countries as coming down to a woman’s control of her body: it seems to us that a wider reading of the problem and one closer to reality in all its aspects would have been more useful, and also more respectful of the different approaches taken, within the Union, to a sensitive subject like abortion."
". Karin Junker's own-initiative report seeks to tackle one of the world's most difficult challenges, of achieving more of the stated outcomes of the UN International Conference on Population and Development, held in 1994."
"The report starkly highlights some of the statistics which clearly demonstrate that more action is required."
"Globally, one woman dies each minute from pregnancy-related causes, about 200 000 maternal deaths per year result from the lack or the failure of contraceptive services, at least 75 million of the 175 million pregnancies each year are unwanted, and rape and other forms of sexual violence are increasing, including in Europe."
"These, and a whole host of other facts contained in the report, clearly point to a need for increased action and assistance to be given by developed countries to combating poverty and encouraging economic growth, with a corresponding increase in educational opportunities, particularly lacking in some countries, for women and girls."
"On the basis of the latest figures, the indicators for the Cairo conference objectives are still showing shocking inequalities between the world's wealthy and poor countries and regions."
"The EU governments can and should take a lead in improving the situation."
". The Junker report must be viewed in terms both of what it states explicitly, but also in terms of what it implies."
"In other words, in addition to the attention that must be paid to the health of mothers and babies during and after pregnancy, or to basic precautions to prevent the spread of the Aids virus, the text – especially with the amendments tabled in committee – expresses quite a clear vision of women’s freedom and rights, specifically of those who need to receive all the means for ‘self-determination in family planning’."
"The report recommends that a policy should be adopted with the aim of increasing access to contraceptive methods and of making abortions easier to obtain by improving the conditions in which this takes place."
"Two aspects of the text warrant some criticism; firstly, in order to reduce the number of births or to improve the sanitary conditions of these births, it fails to present and does even less to promote any alternative solution to the use of mass contraception, which is seen as a basic right."
"Secondly, the report even includes abortion in a number of measures to be funded, to which the EU is asked to contribute, without bothering to find out what the policies in at least some Member States in this field are."
"These are the reasons that have led me to vote against the report."
". Almost ten years after the Cairo Conference, this own-initiative report providing an assessment proves to be timely, and the rapporteur emphasises this by calling for the debate to be held on 8 March, coinciding with International Women’s Day, particularly because the report is concerned mainly with women’s reproductive health."
"The report is even more timely, we believe, for two reasons."
"The first is that, having just returned from the 7th Joint ACP-EU Parliamentary Assembly, we felt it was particularly significant that the report approved in that forum on poverty-related diseases should have included a recital on terminations of unwanted pregnancies and the need for these to take place in safe conditions."
"Secondly, because as a Portuguese citizen, these reports on this issue, chime with a very lively debate currently taking place in Portugal, in which a right-wing majority is obstructing debate and serious and humane decisions, using arguments and means that are truly disgraceful, not to say criminal."
"Although this is clearly not the only theme of the report, we must use this explanation of vote to highlight the rapporteur’s statement that ‘abortion must not be regarded as a family planning method’, but also her call for ‘legal and medically safe interventions to be possible’."
"Anyone arguing the other side of the case finds themselves increasingly isolated, and sharing a stand with President Bush and his ‘Mexico City policy’."
". As has become the custom in Parliament, this report, like any other report on reproductive health in the developing countries, must be viewed both in terms of what it says outright and of what it implies."
"I am sorry that Parliament has not adopted our proposals, which were intended to clarify the concept of ‘sexual and reproductive health’, our guidelines in this field, or our concerns to prevent sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/Aids and to guarantee the safe conditions that women need for pregnancy, childbirth and postnatal care, in other words, to protect the health of mothers and babies during and after pregnancy."
"Instead, the confusion governing action in this field serves only to arouse suspicion."
"I am also sorry to note the desire to commit the EU to promoting abortion on the international stage, demonstrated by the fact that another of our amendments has not been adopted."
"Lastly, as I also said in the debate, I must distance myself from a biased report that ignores many of the main aims of the Cairo International Conference: economic growth, town planning, the environment, employment, holding fathers jointly responsible for women’s sexual health and education as a whole, in addition to education focusing specifically on sexual and reproductive health."
"I voted against."
"Together with the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I have voted against the report as a whole. The report was, however, adopted (by 287 votes in favour, 196 votes against and 13 abstentions)."
"We want population, aid and development policy to combine the fight for democracy and human rights with respect for each country’s democratically decided legislation, in this case within the area of family and health policy."
"The report does not express any such desire and perception, as exemplified by paragraph 20 with its demand for the ‘facilitation of medically safe abortions’."
"We demanded clarification of this paragraph by means of Amendment No 20, adding the words ‘in the countries where this is legal’."
"Amendments Nos 21 and 30, which I supported, were also designed to promote greater respect for other countries’ legislation."
"These were nonetheless voted down (in the case of Amendment No 20 by 281 votes, with 207 votes in favour and 18 abstentions) on the basis of the majority view in Parliament that, in its aid efforts, the EU and the UN should not respect but, on the contrary, counter and actively undermine national legislation in a developing country that wishes to protect the unborn child’s right to life, including in its first weeks."
"The EU and the UN thus show a lack of respect for other countries’ legislation."
"This undermines confidence in aid work, creates conflicts and clashes of culture, religion and values and leaves a bad taste of self-styled European superiority in the mouth."
".– I should like to take this opportunity to express my agreement with Mrs Junker's original report."
"Unfortunately, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has tabled a list of amendments which are not acceptable to my group."
"In Europe, it goes without saying that women are entitled to good sexual and reproductive health, and it is totally beyond me why the Group of the European People’s Party does not want people in the developing countries to be given the same."
"Moreover, President Bush's conservative administration, by reintroducing the Mexico City policy and continuing to make false accusations that abortion would be the UNFPA’s (The United Nations Population Fund) main objective, does rather complicate the work in the field of sexual and reproductive health care, and this should very definitely be denounced."
"Finally, I very much question the Group of the European People’s Party’s viewpoint that the family deserves all protection."
"What about the young girls and women who have been raped in war situations or otherwise?"
"Or what about the women and girls who are forced, by their environment, and particularly by members of their family, to suffer sexual mutilation?"
"Should we leave them to their own devices?"
"My group does not think so, and has therefore voted against all these amendments."
". I have voted today against the Junker report which calls on the European Union and its Member states to integrate sexual and reproductive health and rights into their development policies."
"The Cairo conference term 'reproductive health' was defined by the World Health Organisation as including the term 'fertility regulation' which includes the term 'interrupting unwanted pregnancy', i.e. abortion."
"Since the provision of abortion is not an EU competence and since the principle of subsidiarity is enshrined in the Treaties I have no choice but to reject this report."
"I believe that true women-oriented development would support women with safe gynaecological and obstetrical care, maternal care and childcare."
"Food, safe water and health care are the prerequisite for education which, alongside sufficient energy supply and fair trade, will foster the long-term sustainable development of the individual and the society."
". Two typical extracts from this resolution are enough to show that the aim of simplification and improvement seems to be out of reach."
"That is what this third report has achieved."
"Recital A says: ‘whereas the quality and comprehensibility of Community legislation have a direct impact on the welfare and prosperity of Community citizens and businesses’, while we read in paragraph 6: ‘stresses Parliament’s right to call on the Commission to submit a draft legislative act in connection with the latter’s consideration of self-regulation practices’."
"It will therefore once again be impossible for us to give our support to such a resolution."
"The Commission’s drafts are still basically bad."
"Parliament has been unwilling or unable to tackle the matter."
"It has remained a prisoner of the system and Community jargon."
". Yes, the quality and comprehensibility of regulations does have a direct impact on the welfare and prosperity of Community businesses."
"Of course, simplification of the regulatory environment means we must scrupulously check whether standardisation on a European scale is really necessary."
"It goes without saying that the institutions must seek to provide greater clarity of definitions and legal concepts."
"That is true, but if, as the rapporteur stresses, the Commission communication is a laudable demonstration of good intentions, just the same can be said of this report."
"The simplification of the law is here only a pretext for Parliament, which is in reality only seeking to assert its usual claims."
"The opposition to any attempt to use the aim of improving the quality of legislation to make changes to legislative procedures and the balance of powers between the institutions is proof of this."
"The same applies to Parliament’s request to monitor the appropriate choice and use of the legal instrument proposed by the Commission."
"Everything is being done as if the intervention of this bulimic and power-hungry Parliament were a guarantee of wisdom or of legislative moderation."
". The main aim of this report is to contribute to improving the quality of regulations, an aim which cannot be overemphasised or taken too far."
"The rapporteur believes that there is a need to go further than the Interinstitutional Agreement ‘European Governance: Better lawmaking’, because the aspirations of the European Parliament have not all been realised."
"We must have clear, precise, simple and effective Community regulations and this is the raison d'être of this agreement."
"Let us not forget, however, that the European Parliament has direct democratic legitimacy, because its Members are directly elected by Europe’s citizens, who are those most affected by Community decisions."
"The fever to legislate that we have seen, especially in the last decade, heightens the desire to increase Parliament’s role in the legislative framework."
"For this reason I support the rapporteur’s idea to increase the EP’s involvement in the spheres of co-regulation and self-regulation."
"Furthermore, this third report was adopted unanimously in committee."
"Nevertheless, this report removes the flexibility and closeness that the interinstitutional agreement seeks to achieve, by assuming the means required to put these measures into practice."
"The a priori and a posteriori controls that it seeks to add do not warrant my support and I consequently abstained."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, I was not recorded as present in yesterday’s Minutes."
"Please excuse me."
"Can the matter be corrected?"
"That will be corrected.(1)"
"The next item is the report (A5-0107/2004) by Mr Andreasen on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on the proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on the Guantanamo detainees' right to a fair trial (2003/2229(INI))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has always given the highest priority to the fight for human rights."
"It means a lot to us that individual persons each be guaranteed both their fundamental freedoms and their basic rights."
"It is therefore a special honour for me to be rapporteur for this report with a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on the Guantánamo detainees’ right to a fair trial."
"Everyone in this House agrees that international terrorism must be fought."
"There is therefore no intention behind this report to place a question mark over the fight against terrorism."
"It has been prepared in order to emphasise that, even in a just cause, there are some quite fundamental rules that have to be obeyed, namely respect for the individual person’s rights, as laid down in the UN Convention on Human Rights and in the Geneva Conventions."
"In this case, it is, as has already been pointed out, particularly a question of the right to a fair trial and to treatment in accordance with international law."
"Since January 2002, approximately 660 people from 38 different countries have been held prisoner at the American naval base in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba."
"We know for certain that 87 of them, and perhaps more, have now been released, but by far the majority of them are still there."
"They do not know of what they have been accused, they have still not been brought before a judge, and no one knows whether or, if occasion should arise, when they are to be so."
"The detainees are in a legal vacuum."
"They are regarded either as ordinary criminals or as war criminals."
"As ordinary criminals, they should be safeguarded by American law but, according to a court of appeal in Washington, the naval base does not fall under American jurisdiction since it is not a proper part of the United States."
"Another court of appeal in San Francisco has rejected this argument, but this court of appeal is also the court in the United States whose decisions are most often overturned in the Supreme Court, so it is doubtful whether its pronouncement will be of any consequence."
"On its own initiative, the American Supreme Court has decided to investigate whether American jurisdiction should also apply to the Guantánamo naval base, and a response is awaited by no later than June of this year."
"Nor, according to the American authorities, are the detainees at the naval base prisoners of war, and they are thus not protected by the Geneva Conventions, either."
"The detainees were not part of a regular army when they were taken prisoner."
"They had no rank or uniforms and did not openly bear arms. Instead, the detainees are regarded by the American authorities as illegal combatants who do not come within known legal systems and who can be detained for an unspecified period without being tried or given access to lawyers."
"That is the situation of the prisoners."
"They do not know what they are charged with, and whether or when they can be given fair trials."
"This is a clear violation of human rights and a breach of international conventions, and the report therefore requests the United States immediately to bring the detainees out of the legal vacuum they are in and guarantee them immediate access to legal assistance, which will clarify the legal status of each individual detainee."
"It is important to emphasise in this connection that the report applies not only to the European prisoners, but to all the prisoners and to their individual rights as human beings."
"The report supports the Council position according to which the Third Geneva Convention of 1949 on the treatment of prisoners of war is to be interpreted in such a way that, in case of doubt, the detainees at the Guantánamo naval base are to be treated as prisoners of war until and unless it is decided that they do not fulfil the conditions."
"Thereafter, they may, if occasion should arise, fall within either the Third Geneva Convention, which applies to legal combatants, thereby affording them status and protection as prisoners of war, or within the Fourth Geneva Convention, which applies to civilians."
"In the report, we also request the American Government to confirm that the temporary military commission, set up in November 2001, is complying with all the international laws, just as we request the American authorities to give representatives of the states concerned and of international institutions, as well as family members and independent observers, access to the detainees as visitors."
"The EU and the United States have always been allies."
"We have always had, have now and shall in the future retain a good relationship with the United States."
"The report states that the transatlantic relationship is invaluable and irreplaceable and could be a formidable force for good in the world, but only if basic human rights – such as the right to fair trial and the prohibition on arbitrary detention – are respected and remain the core values shared by the United States and the EU."
"We therefore call upon the United States fully to comply with the obligations it has itself assumed in relation to international law and international humanitarian law."
"The report recommends to the Council that the issue of the conditions under which the Guantánamo detainees are being held be addressed at the summit that is to take place between the EU and the United States in June 2004."
"We want a common action plan for the fight against terrorism to be devised – an action plan that combines resolve and action against terrorism with full respect for international humanitarian standards."
"I should like to thank my fellow MEPs in this House for the many positive contributions I have received from them in connection with this work and for the almost unanimous adoption by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy of the proposal for a recommendation."
". Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the honourable Member on his report."
"It touches on an issue which is central to our concerns in the European Union, namely the protection of fundamental human rights."
"No-one in this Chamber doubts the vital importance of the fight against international terrorism, nor will or should any of us ever forget the horrible tragedy which we saw on our television screens when those planes crashed into the twin towers in New York on 11 September 2001."
"But we all understand the essential need to combat this evil in a way which strengthens the cause of freedom and human rights."
"The terrorists win if we lose sight of this fact."
"The United States, as the honourable Member pointed out, detained several hundred men during and after the fighting in Afghanistan and some have been detained for as long as two years or slightly more."
"Some of them are nationals of our Member States but wherever they came from they need to be treated fairly and humanely, as the report says."
"We welcomed the release of a number of detainees recently and we look forward to the release of more in the future."
"The European Union has been a staunch and committed member of the international coalition against terrorism."
"However, as the European Union has repeatedly underlined at both the sessions of the UN Commission on Human Rights and the UN General Assembly Third Committee, it is imperative that we and our allies uphold the values of international human rights and humanitarian law when fighting terrorism."
"The forthcoming session of the Commission on Human Rights will provide a further opportunity to tackle the issue of human rights and terrorism, and to build on the endorsement by the Third Committee of the proposal that the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights should examine the protection of human rights when fighting terrorism."
"I need to make it clear – and I do so without in any way suggesting a lack of interest in this problem which rightly is of considerable concern to many Members of the House – that the European Commission does not have competence in a number of the areas which are raised in this report."
"In the absence of a common position on this question, it is for individual Member States to make diplomatic representation on behalf of their nationals."
"Equally, the question of the agenda for the US Summit is a matter for the presidency and for the United States."
"However, I am sure that the Council will take note of this report and of the strong feelings of many honourable Members on this subject."
"The House is very keen to have answers to a number of questions."
"Are these men to be tried and if so for what crimes and under what jurisdiction?"
"Are some of them to be released to the jurisdiction of their own countries, and if so, will guarantees be sought and obtained for their humane treatment?"
"There are many more questions which are raised by this case and are touched on in the report."
"I want to make this clear: to ask these questions is not to question for one moment our strong partnership with our friends and partners in the United States in the fight against terrorism – terrorism which has a global reach."
"But one of our most potent weapons against this evil is our unshakeable commitment to the principle of freedom under the law."
"We as Europeans must avoid the danger of raising these issues in a confrontational way which ignores the trauma which the people of the United States have suffered."
"That is why I welcome the fact that the honourable Member has raised this subject in his report in such a careful and measured way and I am glad to have had the opportunity to respond to him today."
"It is crucial that we always try to keep in mind how the fight against terrorism and the promotion and protection of human rights impact on each other."
"We constantly underline that the fight against terrorism must be conditioned on maintaining respect for human rights, not the other way round."
"I would even go one step further. In my judgment, fostering human rights should become an integral part of the fight against terrorism."
"Only then can we hope to defuse the social tensions on which terrorism feeds."
"Once again I would like to congratulate the honourable Member on his report."
"It raises issues of considerable importance."
"It raises the sort of issues which I have had to tackle before in other circumstances, for example in reorganising the police and security services in Northern Ireland and basing that reorganisation on the fundamental proposition that the forces of law and order are there to protect and maintain human rights and should have no truck with the undermining of human rights."
"We all stand four-square in the fight against the evil of terrorism and the lethal combination of terrorism and technology."
"But we also, I believe, stand four-square in our belief that the best way of fighting terrorism is to retain a proper respect for human rights."
". Mr President, the General Secretary of the American National Council of Churches has recently branded the denial of human rights at Guantanamo Bay as a sin against God."
"I do not take a religious perspective, but it is clear that it is not only Europeans who feel strongly that the situation at Guantanamo Bay offends against our sense of justice."
"One of the senior justices in the United Kingdom, Lord Steyn, branded the proposed military tribunals at Guantanamo Bay as a stain on US justice and the term 'kangaroo court' springs to mind."
"The British Court of Appeal has branded the detention of prisoners there as a legal black hole."
"The Bush administration has argued that the Geneva Conventions are obsolete when it comes to dealing with terrorists and has chosen to apply neither these conventional laws of war nor the criminal law in which human rights norms should apply, that is the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights or the US Constitution."
"It has tried to straddle both by inventing a new, residual category of 'unlawful combatant' in the potentially unlimited war on terror, which is transformed from a metaphorical to a literal term."
"However, that status is unknown in international law."
"Sadly, the denial of the prisoners' right to access to normal civil courts and the protection of the US Constitution has been backed by the US courts on the grounds that Guantanamo Bay – even though the US is in actual control of the base – is not sovereign US territory."
"But it is welcome that the Supreme Court has now said it would decide on whether the US courts have jurisdiction."
"I would end by saying that I regret the absence of the Council in this debate since, as Commissioner Patten has pointed out, the Commission does not have jurisdiction, and the failure of the Council to adopt a common position and a strategy to implement the upholding of the rule of law in Guantanamo Bay is a sad omission."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this is an important report about an important matter, on which I am happy to speak on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"I value the way in which the rapporteur has tackled the topic."
"It is positive that he, in line with my group's approach, has strengthened the foundation of this report."
"I should like to share with him my appreciation for the good working relationship."
"This topic touches the very heart and foundation of our constitutional state."
"More than two years after the United States transported some 660 foreign detainees to Guantanamo Bay in the framework of the fight against the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, there is, unfortunately, still uncertainty: uncertainty about the charge, uncertainty about the duration of the detention, uncertainty about the possible judicial process, uncertainty about legal aid and uncertainty about contacts with the country of origin."
"In short, there is a legal void."
"The American Supreme Court is now looking into the question whether the American courts are competent to assess the legal status of the detainees."
"Although the great effect that terrorism has had on our American ally in the wake of the dreadful attacks of 11 September speaks for itself, we are now a few years further down the line and the prisoners on the Cuban base have still not had access to the courts."
"This situation cannot, and should not, be sustained."
"Precisely because the transatlantic dialogue is so meaningful and irreplaceable, it is important to keep the lines of communication with our American friends open."
"Allies are allowed to make urgent appeals to each other."
"I appreciate that the Convention of Geneva of 1949 is no longer fully adequate to accommodate new threats such as terrorism."
"It is important that international law should develop in such a way that a legal basis is in place for addressing new security issues."
"Even the worst terrorist is entitled to a fair trial."
"That is a basic principle underpinned by international law."
"I would mention by way of example both the principle and the need to properly safeguard the administration of justice, as well as, among others, such important treaties as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the European Convention on Human Rights, the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, and the Convention of Geneva, to which the rapporteur has already made reference."
"All those treaties involve the task of guaranteeing a humane treatment of prisoners and the right to a fair trial."
"In the final analysis, this is about human dignity; every person counts."
"I gladly subscribe to what the rapporteur has raised in this respect."
"Finally, I urge the Council to continue to bring the case of the Guantanamo detainees to the attention of the authorities of the United States."
"This case is deserving of this, and more."
"Mr President, Guantanamo Bay should send a message to all citizens who are concerned about human rights in the world."
"In this American concentration camp on Cuban territory, international law and American law have been outlawed to almost universal indifference."
"The whole world can see this place where there is no law, this legal black hole as Amnesty International calls it, but does nothing."
"Individual liberties won with great difficulty over hundreds of years have met their death on the beach at Guantanamo Bay."
"As the victim of the 11 September attacks, the United States was perfectly within its rights to arrest, charge and try everyone presumed to have been involved in those attacks."
"But there was absolutely no need to act unlawfully, or to lock the 660 detainees in animal cages that are floodlit day and night."
"The days of the lawmen of the Wild West are over."
"Nowadays, no one should be able to set themselves up at one and the same time as accuser, defender, judge and executioner – you might as well say torturer."
"Such, however, is the macabre scenario adopted by President Bush for his ‘offshore’ justice in Guantanamo Bay."
"With the allied governments wallowing in cowardly silence, it was time for the European Parliament to react in a credible and audible manner."
"Mr Andreasen’s report on the Guantanamo detainees’ right to a fair trial therefore comes at just the right moment and I congratulate the rapporteur on behalf of my group."
"The resolution on which we shall be voting tomorrow is addressed to the Council and calls on it to adopt a common position on this serious violation of the fundamental principles of law."
"As Commissioner Patten very rightly pointed out, such a common position is very sorely lacking."
"But that call will doubtless remain a dead letter so long as the absurd method of unanimous voting continues, allowing Europe’s voice on foreign policy and human rights to be silenced by just one dissenting vote."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate Great Britain which will today welcome home five of the British citizens imprisoned at the naval base in Guantánamo Bay."
"According to the Swedish media, they will be arrested and interrogated when they land in Great Britain this evening."
"A further four Britons still in Guantánamo Bay will not be released, at least not yet."
"The Swedish detainee, Mehdi Ghezali, is also still there, with no immediate prospect of being released."
"That is how the situation has looked for more than two years."
"Where the Swedish citizen is concerned, the Swedish Government indicated at the beginning that the issue should be taken up with colleagues in the Council of the European Union."
"Here we are today, more than two years later, and this is as far as we have got."
"Like so many of these detainees, Mehdi Ghezali is young."
"The people concerned are young, and quite a few of them can even be regarded as children."
"Mehdi Ghezali’s family has heard nothing at all from him for 13 months."
"The officials from Sweden’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs who have been able to visit Mehdi Ghezali are not allowed to tell his family how he is."
"His lawyer has not been able to visit him, either."
"Commissioner Patten said that we must have a good relationship with the United States."
"Yes, we must have a good relationship with the United States, but we must also have good relationships with all other nations."
"I think that the old saying, ‘It takes two to tango’ is apposite in this case."
"The United States’s conduct on this issue does not, unfortunately, encourage much in the way of confidence."
"Of course we remember 11 September, but I also remember the pictures that, in spite of everything, have come out of the base at Guantánamo Bay, showing young people sitting handcuffed in cages."
"We are committed to human rights."
"We cannot just have debates at regular intervals about them."
"They must also mean something, and I therefore wish genuinely to thank Mr Andreasen for a very good report."
"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur."
"This is a very important initiative and this is an opportune time for it to be brought forward."
"The existence of internment-without-trial camps in Guantanamo Bay has to unacceptable to anyone in a civilised society."
"Any prisoners captured during the invasion of Afghanistan should have been treated according to international law and, at the very least, should have been classified as prisoners of war."
"They have the right to a fair trial."
"They should also have the right to be considered innocent until proven guilty in a court of law, have access to legal representation and have the right either to be charged or released."
"The Irish presidency should be doing everything in its power to ensure that these people are not denied their basic human rights for a minute longer."
"I agree with what Mrs Ludford said concerning the failure of the Irish presidency to be here today, which is an appalling message to send out to the European Community and indeed to the international community."
"As Commissioner Patten said, it is up to the Council to raise this matter with the United States, and the EU Council has failed abysmally to do so on any occasion."
"I would also question why it is that the Irish presidency is not here today."
"Is it because that presidency is afraid of offending the United States by saying something at that country would take offence?"
"The Irish presidency is also letting down the Irish public, which views this matter as an absolute scandal."
"Mr President, I find it strange that the European Parliament should be so busy with these efforts on behalf of enemies of democracy."
"The detainees are not a bunch of scouts that have got lost on an outing."
"All the evidence suggests that the detainees have been treated humanely."
"Pictures from the naval base show cells considerably better than those in many of the EU countries’ prisons."
"It is only a few of the EU Member States that are actively participating militarily in the fight against the reactionary forces that would use terrorism to change the direction in which the world is moving."
"That is a fight we leave to the United States and its true allies."
"To listen to some of those with a professional hatred of the United States, one would imagine that, in their view, the Taliban and al-Qa’ida are a species of freedom fighter who wish to help poor and oppressed peoples."
"They are the opposite."
"The terrorists must be given the kind of fright that will deter them from continuing with their criminal acts."
"Only by crushing their networks can freedom and democracy be developed in the world."
"The detainees at the Guantánamo naval base are not soldiers in an organised army."
"They are not an underground movement in an occupied country."
"They are terrorists who fanatically oppose the human rights that some in this House now believe they should enjoy."
"Some of the prisoners have acquired citizenship of EU countries."
"When, subsequently, they take part, with or without visible weapons, in an armed struggle in which some of our soldiers are killed, then they are traitors and must be treated as such."
"I am certain that there are EU countries which would not have shown the United States’s forbearance, but would have shot a whole lot of them on the spot."
"It is unfitting that we, who are not waging war in Afghanistan and who have not ourselves been exposed to genuine terrorist attacks in our countries, should think we should tell the United States what to do."
"I wish to thank Commissioner Patten for making it clear that the Commission has no competence in this area and add that the Council has no such competence either. I wish to recommend to Parliament that it vote against the report."
"Mr President, September 11, the attacks on the twin towers in New York, opened up a new chapter in the concept of war – namely, an asymmetric, large-scale attack by a well-organised and well-resourced, fanatic, international, Islamist grouping affiliated to al-Qa'ida, with no respect for the traditional rules and conduct of war as we know them and very difficult to formally classify under the Third and Fourth Geneva Protocols of 1949."
"Therefore, all the demands made by this resolution to treat the detainees either as innocent bystanders caught up in American crossfire in Afghanistan or common-law criminals subject to due process are legally not sound, and not necessarily desirable either – particularly if we are to protect Europe's security and people from further attacks."
"Also, the state's first duty is always to protect its innocent citizens from future attack from any such terrorist groups."
"The US would not waste valuable public resources detaining those who pose no security risk."
"Indeed, after exhaustive enquiries, many have been returned home, including three juveniles – one who in an interview to the British press testified to the humanity of his captors and was grateful for formal English-language instruction on the base."
"The rest – including the EU citizens involved – are undoubtedly dangerous or a source of ongoing useful intelligence and should either be tried for war crimes, if appropriate, at standards compatible with international norms or held in humane conditions as illegal combatants for the duration of the war, with Red Cross and consular access, until Mr Osama bin Laden is captured and formally surrenders his terrorist network and their declared war on the West."
"I do not accept that habeas corpus applies in emergency situations like times of war or national emergencies, so its inclusion is totally inappropriate."
"No prisoners of war during the Second World War were allowed to have a fair trial – everyone knows that they were detained for the duration of war."
"Furthermore, historically, citizens of any country – and the UK in particular – who in times of war went abroad and fought against their own armed forces or their allies were potentially indictable for treason, historically a capital offence and even today a very serious offence."
"Therefore, the Liberal motion before us today will not be supported by me, as its primary purpose is to bash the United States of American in its global war on terrorism."
"Mr President, I shall not respond immediately to Mr Tannock, but will begin by stating dispassionately that the notion of human rights, including the right to a fair trial, is the highest priority for all the parliamentary groups."
"Terrorism and terrorist groups have won when the rule of law is set aside."
"Mr Camre, the rule of law is not an enemy, but the basis of a civilised society."
"When you discard it, you discard your civilised rights."
"One has to look at the charges brought against these individuals."
"If charges had been made, then they would have the right and the opportunity to defend themselves, but no charges have been made."
"Three of my constituents are amongst those about to be released."
"What of their families?"
"What of their concerns?"
"What of their human rights?"
"I start, as I believe everyone in this House starts, from the notion that people are innocent until proven guilty."
"The two previous speakers would seem to accept the opposite."
"The calls made in this House are not anti-American."
"Indeed, we have asked the United States to uphold the rights of the free world which are at the heart of its own constitution."
"Here we come to the crux of the matter: the argument that somehow these people are outside US national jurisdiction."
"They are not, and it was on this basis that the Supreme Court petitioners called for the releases of detainees that we have seen recently."
"They should be subject either to US law or to the rule of international law: legal representation, a fair trial and the right of appeal."
"It is in exceptional circumstances that the unexceptional, normal and rational rule of law is most needed."
"Mr Camre, I cannot agree with you."
"You have denounced these people and even you will not give them a fair trial."
"We must never forget that 11 September altered the American psyche forever. Hence the actions that have been taken."
"This House has therefore chosen a noble route: not to condemn, nor to cast out those who have been detained – perhaps in horrific circumstances – but to ask quite simply that the rule of national or international law be upheld and fully respected."
"I, the PSE Group, the ELDR Group and other Groups will uphold those principles."
"It is a sad day when all the Members of this House cannot do the same."
"– Mr President, Guantanamo is not war, but a return to tyranny by a sovereign ruler, as now symbolised by the logic of a permanent state of emergency championed by the world’s only hegemonic superpower."
"The pressure being put on the principle of the rule of law this way may gradually crush the whole legal tradition we have had so much difficulty achieving."
"This is a historic challenge."
"Fortunately, regarding the cases of Mounir El-Motassadeq and Abdelghani Mzoud, the courts in both the United States of America and just recently in Germany have stood up for the most fundamental human rights principles of all, one of which is the right to a fair trial."
"This illegal confinement is not in America’s interests, but only makes the legitimate fight against terrorism more difficult."
"That can only succeed through cooperation and lawful courses of action, and it is actually giving into terrorism to ignore them."
"It is a dangerous signal in every respect."
"Mr President, it is absolutely unacceptable that more than 600 people, including children, have been held for two years in Guantanamo Bay without charge or trial, in circumstances which no democratic state could legitimately stand over."
"It is a recipe for feeding hatred, not for coming to terms with the awfulness of terrorism."
"This is a debate about defending democracy and the rule of law, and an appeal to the good sense and the democratic instincts of the American people in circumstances where good sense and democratic instincts are all important."
"It is right and proper to condemn and continue to condemn the atrocity of 11 September 2001 and all other atrocities engineered by terrorists, whether in the United States or in Europe, in Spain, Ireland or indeed in Israel or the Palestinian territories."
"Terrorism deliberately sets out to destroy freedom: its purpose is to destroy freedom."
"If we attempt to undermine the terrorists by using means which themselves destroy freedom, we undermine the very foundations of our own society."
"If we go down the route of denying basic human rights and basic democratic rights to those we suspect of terror, then we are giving them a victory and we are shaping a society which in the long run will not be in the best interests of the people of this world who want to live in a sustainable peace."
"I would appeal to the Irish presidency to put this matter on the agenda of the EU-US summit in June this year."
"Mr President, one of the interesting things in the discussion on Guantanamo Bay concerns language, not least the new definitions of war that we begin to hear, which have no legal basis in any international jurisdiction."
"Mention has already been made of the UK releases today, and of course I welcome that development, but I am also interested in who is defending the interests of the remaining detainees, whose governments may not have a special relationship with the United States."
"I welcome this report because I think it is very important to keep the whole issue within the international arena."
"As others have said, we have seen a deliberately created legal limbo here, which has provided a green light for other regimes to act in similar ways now, not least China, Yemen, Uzbekistan, Saudi Arabia and other well-known democracies, with their policy of internment of so-called fundamentalists."
"We have seen the United Kingdom derogate from Articles of the European Convention on Human Rights in order to legitimise the internment in Belmarsh of UK residents."
"It is important to respect the rule of international humanitarian law, even when it is inconvenient for governments."
"Mr President, I was surprised to hear a few minutes ago that Guantanamo Bay was a centre for English language teaching."
"That is quite extraordinary because the holding of the prisoners in Guantanamo Bay runs contrary to human rights."
"The prisoners have no access to an independent lawyer, and we do not know who exactly is being held or what precise charges are being brought against them."
"Under such conditions, there is reason to be concerned about the detainees’ mental health."
"Without the prior assistance of an independent lawyer, we can say that there is an obvious risk of negotiation to reach an agreement and doing so in order to get the charges reduced."
"If that is the case, detainees will be able to choose to plead guilty, even if they are not, in order to escape the death penalty."
"It is clear that President Bush and the US leadership want show trials with confessions because it is presidential election year."
"The European Parliament’s position must therefore be intransigent against terrorism, but also intransigent on respect for international law."
"It is unacceptable to sentence someone before a verdict has been reached."
"That is what is happening here, sometimes even in this Chamber."
"We must all therefore denounce this legal black hole in which the detainees find themselves."
"We can all remember the horror of what happened, but we do not want terrorism to win and we must demand fair treatment for all and show that we defend values that respect the law."
"Ladies and gentlemen, that is the best means we all have of combating barbarity."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0112/2004) by Mr Lagendijk on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on the proposal for a Council regulation on the establishment of European Partnerships in the framework of the Stabilisation and Association Process (COM(2003)684 – C5-0574/2003 – 2003/0267(CNS))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank Mr Lagendijk very sincerely for drafting the European Parliament legislative resolution on the Commission's proposal for a Council regulation on the establishment of European Partnerships in the framework of the Stabilisation and Association Process."
"The amendments proposed address some of the key points in our relations with the Western Balkan countries."
"We have noted all the proposals and carefully considered them."
"The Commission and the Council need Parliament’s full support and commitment in their efforts to assist these countries with their reforms and in bringing them closer to the European Union."
"Let me briefly describe the background to this proposal for a Council regulation on the establishment of European Partnerships, which goes back to the European Council held in Thessaloniki in June 2003, at which the Heads of State and Government reiterated their determination to fully and effectively support the European perspective of the Western Balkan countries."
"The Stabilisation and Association Process has now been strengthened and supplemented by several elements that have been implemented in the course of the ongoing enlargement process."
"The introduction of European Partnerships is one of the most important proposals to this end."
"The Commission was requested to present the first European Partnerships for approval at the end of this month, together with the next Annual Reports on the Stabilisation and Association Process."
"Like the Accession Partnerships for candidate countries, the European Partnerships establish short- and medium-term priorities that those countries are required to comply with in order to move closer to the European Union."
"They will be adapted to the countries’ specific needs and respective stages of preparation, and to the specificities of the Stabilisation and Association process, and will also take account of regional cooperation."
"In accordance with progress achieved, the European Partnerships will increasingly be steered towards adoption of the ."
"Progress will be monitored by the Commission and assessed in the annual reports."
"The texts of the individual European Partnerships will be transmitted to the European Parliament, and, exactly as in the case of the Accession Partnerships, the European Parliament will be kept appropriately informed about the progress made by the countries concerned."
"The Commission has noted the rapporteur's comments about financial assistance for countries in this region."
"I would like to stress once again that the proposal does not have any financial implications."
"The priorities of the European Partnership will continue to form the basis of the programme of assistance, which will be provided under the CARDS programme."
"I should, however, emphasise that the Partnerships have their own priorities, the achievement of which has no financial implications whatsoever, such as the acceptance of legislative provisions."
"I fully understand Parliament’s concerns about the conditionality of Community assistance."
"Respect for the principles of democracy and constitutionality, and for human rights, minority rights and fundamental freedoms are a prerequisite for the granting of Community assistance."
"If these general conditions are not met, the Council can decide to suspend financial assistance."
"The Commission has agreed to make specific reference to this point in draft Council decisions on the individual partnership priorities."
"The priorities of the European Partnerships are just as much EU priorities as the priorities for Accession Partnerships were for the accession countries."
"Of course, the governments of the countries concerned will be informally consulted on the European Partnership."
"Their agreement will not come as a surprise."
"The Commission agrees with Parliament's proposal that a passage on the consultation of the national governments should be added to the regulation."
"In the context of the mechanisms established under the Stabilisation and Association Process for this purpose, we have regular contacts with these countries."
"We assume that these countries are working out plans setting out a time frame for compliance with the requirements for further integration with the European Union."
"This work is intended to give them an increased sense of responsibility and a better understanding of the process."
"Implementing the priorities of the European Partnerships requires commitment, political will and the provision of appropriate funding."
"The partnerships will provide a solid basis for steering the reform efforts in the Western Balkan countries to moving closer to the European Union."
". – Mr President, before I discuss the Commission proposal, I should like to ask whether we ought to attach any political significance to the fact that Mr Patten has left the Chamber and has been replaced by Mr Verheugen, because as far as I know, Mr Verheugen is still responsible for candidate Member States and acceding countries."
"Is this an indication from the Commission that the Western Balkan countries, although, officially, they are not yet among candidate Member States, have now suddenly been included among their number?"
"Let there be no misunderstanding: I would welcome it."
"It is, in any case, striking."
"As far as the proposals themselves are concerned, the Commissioner has already referred to their source, namely last year's Thessaloniki Summit."
"At that summit, the European Council, under considerable pressure from the Greek Presidency, wanted to make a gesture towards the Western Balkan countries, the most important political message being that they have very definitely turned into the road to Europe and that the EU wants to help them on that path by offering them an additional instrument in the form of European Partnerships."
"The reason for this initiative was that there is no doubt, including in this House, that those countries will be members one day."
"The question is only when and under what conditions."
"However, when I read the Commission proposal implementing the fine decision of Thessalonica, I am, quite honestly, very much starting to doubt whether that decision was such a wise one."
"What is – and that is at the same time the central question in my report – the added value of introducing a new instrument, namely the European Partnerships, at this present time?"
"We in the European Union – you know this better than we do – are involved in an extremely complicated process of concluding Stabilisation and Association Agreements with all the countries of the region, or at least, that is the goal towards which we are working."
"We managed to do this with Croatia and Macedonia, and we are still negotiating with the three other countries."
"This process is jerking along."
"It is not easy."
"There are still major problems in three of the five countries, and there is still a great deal of work left to be done."
"Now all of a sudden, in the middle of that process, along comes a new instrument, the European Partnerships."
"These do not follow the Stabilisation and Association Agreements, but cut right across them."
"Commission, I really have to say that I fail to grasp the meaning of this; I think that the Commission, like Parliament, is bound by the Council's brief, although it, like we, cannot say so out loud."
"I fear that the new instrument that has been created is one that nobody needs and for which nobody is waiting."
"It creates uncertainty in the region and I think that we have to be very careful not to hand those countries an empty shell, while we ourselves are unsure as to what we want from this initiative."
"Here, politics is being played with symbols, and we have to tread very carefully indeed."
"If we persevere with this initiative after all, I should like to make two observations."
"First of all the finances which are normally speaking part and parcel of partnerships such as these – suffice to look at the great example of these European Partnerships – namely the partnerships that have preceded the status of candidate Member State."
"If we create a new instrument after all, why do we not set aside some new money at the same time?"
"Your colleague, Commissioner Patten, has repeatedly told this House that, as far as he is concerned, it is no trouble to spend the money that he now has at his disposal, and that he would like to receive more money from Parliament in order to help those countries."
"That is why I can accept the concept of European Partnerships, provided that it is clear how much money we are willing to contribute. If no additional funds are being set aside for this than are already available, then the whole initiative is nothing but an empty shell."
"What is more important is the conditions."
"The new instruments should not impose yet another set of new conditions."
"We have subjected EU assistance to those countries to very strict conditions as it is: the return home of refugees, the fight against corruption and cooperation with the Tribunal in The Hague."
"I urge you to leave it at that."
"Whilst I am pleased that the Commission has stated in this context that the existing conditions will not be changed, this should be made sufficiently clear."
"The new instruments should not involve any new conditions."
"I am, however, very much in favour of the European Union adhering to the existing conditions to the letter, because now and again, I have noticed in the Council a tendency to go over these lightly and not to adhere to the criteria that were established in the past."
"This is, however, necessary."
"The root-and-branch approach has to be adopted, because the problems in that region are extensive and if we create the impression that the countries in question will automatically become members at some point, things will go wrong."
"Let it be clear: I am in favour of carrying on, of giving the reforms and reformers my warm support."
"The European Union has no choice but to back those countries and the pioneers who carry out reforms."
"If we need new instruments to achieve this, so be it, but if we can make a good deal of progress with the present instruments, whilst the new ones only create uncertainty, I will reject the new ones."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our external policy in relation to the Balkans is an inevitable consequence of the enormous mistakes we made at the beginning of the 1990s; at that time we did not have a common policy for this region, but today we do."
"The Stability Pact is the right answer to the region's problems."
"The negotiation of the Stabilisation and Association Process, together with financial assistance such as the CARDS programme and the annual progress review, assists progress towards the frequently mentioned objective of the ultimate accession of these countries to the European Union."
"So this is the right way to go."
"What then is this new cliché about ‘European Partnership’?"
"The Stabilisation and Association Agreements are the launch pad for a partnership and if all the criteria are met, the application for membership is the next step."
"Is there any room for a new catchword without any new financial backing?"
"This proposal from the Council is meaningless, and the Commission knows that, but it cannot say that in so many words."
"We, on the other hand, can say what we think!"
"Commissioner, the Commission and the Council could demonstrate how serious they are about this much-vaunted partnership by taking Croatia as an example."
"Croatia has been on the right path for years."
"Cooperation is good in all areas."
"The extent of cooperation with The Hague is also positive."
"Two more generals have just been sent to The Hague."
"We should not be setting ever-higher standards just because one general with a French passport is still at large and is nowhere to be found."
"We should remember what has been achieved already."
"This positive view of Croatia would give a signal and add impetus to compliance with the European Union's criteria throughout the region for which European Partnerships are envisaged – and I know what I am talking about."
"Our common foreign policy in South Eastern Europe is currently being put to the test, and a rigorous one at that."
"The proposal for a European Partnership without any substantial added value as compared with the Stabilisation and Association Process and without any additional financial assistance will not, I regret to say, enhance our credibility."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, everything that Mr Lagendijk and Mrs Pack have said actually militates against the adoption of the Lagendijk report."
"I personally will not be voting for it; not because I think that Mr Lagendijk's report is a bad one, but what sort of a parliament is it that attacks the Council and the Commission over their proposals and then says, fine, but because we are a parliament we will vote for them?"
"I, for one, will not be voting in favour, and I say that because I believe that, although the arguments put forward by Mrs Pack and Mr Lagendijk are valid, an instrument has been dreamt up here without any real foundations."
"I can well imagine that something could be made of the European Partnerships, but clear objectives and criteria need to be set."
"However, the present proposal at least contains nothing of the kind."
"I hope that Commissioner Verheugen will push for that, as I am assuming that he will play a key role in the new Commission – he certainly deserves to – and I assume that he will also have a corresponding influence in ensuring that the European Partnerships become an instrument based on clear criteria."
"My recommendation, which was not accepted by the committee, was that the Stabilisation and Association Agreements should be successfully implemented over a period of years."
"Successfully, mind you, not just any old how!"
"My visit to Kosovo as part of the delegation led by Mrs Pack made a lasting impression on me."
"That impression is that neither the Albanian side nor the Serbian side have come under enough pressure to do what they ought to do – to work together for the future of Kosovo."
"That impression also applies to several other countries."
"But Croatia, both under the previous administration and under the present government, is an exception to that, because they have grasped what is at stake and also wish to move forward accordingly."
"The Commission and we in this House bear a certain part of the blame for this situation, and we should endeavour to ensure that Europe's voice is heard more clearly and distinctly."
"Our meeting with President Rugova was symbolic of this."
"I have a high regard for him and have known him for a long time, although not so well as Mrs Pack does, but I have a very good relationship with him."
"But when we visited his official residence – and I know that we are only talking about Kosovo and not yet an independent state – Albanian, Kosovan and American flags were flying, but not a European flag, and nobody seemed to think anything of it."
"What does that say about Europe's voice, I wonder?"
"We will be taking him a European flag in the hope that it will find a place at his residence."
"He is not the only one, however, to whom this applies, and this is in no way intended to be a personal criticism."
"I believe that just as Europe is not represented amongst the flags flying at his residence, Europe's views are unrepresented or at least underrepresented in many parts of the Balkans."
"The Council, the Commission and Parliament must work together to make our voice more widely heard."
"Commissioner Verheugen, if we are debating this in a year's time and you can convince me that the European Partnership has achieved this much, or has at least made progress in that direction, then I will support the Lagendijk report retrospectively, but I shall not be voting for it tomorrow."
"I ask the Members of this Parliament not to draw any particular conclusions from the fact that I am representing Commissioner Patten here today, but it has worked out rather well, as I am perhaps in a better position than he is to respond to your comments."
"What, then, is at issue here?"
"The issue is that the Thessaloniki Council asked whether we could not draw a few conclusions from the successful progress of the enlargement process with a view to bringing the countries of the Western Balkans closer to the European Union more effectively."
"The question was a simple one: are there lessons that we have learnt, are there instruments that have been successful in that process, and which we could apply here as well, subject to any necessary adjustments?"
"The answer to it is ‘yes’."
"In the case of the accession countries we had the ‘Europe Agreements’ as a legal basis."
"These correspond to the Stabilisation and Association Agreements with the Western Balkan countries."
"We developed the ‘Accession Partnerships’ as an instrument for implementing those Europe Agreements, and I will tell you in a moment why that was a good thing."
"The corresponding instrument in the Stabilisation and Association Process will be the European Partnerships, because we could not very well talk about ‘Accession Partnerships’."
"The great advantage of this instrument is that it is very flexible, very exact, easy to monitor, and that progress can be assessed very precisely."
"It is the Commission's intention to prepare these partnerships following exactly the same pattern as for the Accession Partnerships."
"That involves describing in precise terms what is to happen in the first year, as a short-term priority in other words, in all areas – political governance, economic governance, adoption of the – and then medium-term priorities, for which we will give ourselves two or three years, and lastly the long-term priorities."
"The big advantage of all this is that it can be checked and fine-tuned at any time, and that the other instruments at our disposal can then be adjusted to meet the objectives of these partnerships, for example the technical assistance instrument that we intend to use in future. But I also have in mind the instruments already at our disposal and all the other instruments available."
"I can tell you from my own experience of the enlargement process that this instrument will be helpful, that it is a very manageable instrument, and one with which we had very good experience during enlargement."
"I therefore urge you to at least give this instrument a chance."
"I would like to ask my friend Mr Swoboda to perhaps give the instrument two chances, and in a year's time we will be very happy to carry out a joint assessment of whether or not it has achieved anything."
"I am quite convinced, though, that it is an instrument that will help the Western Balkan countries, which will be more manageable for them, and which will make the direction in which the whole process should proceed clearer and more credible."
"For that reason I can indeed give this instrument my wholehearted support."
"Thank you, Commissioner Verheugen."
"– Mr President, Commissioner Verheugen has won me over."
"I will be voting in favour."
"I trust him to do the right thing, and hope that he will do so."
"I did suspect this was not going to be a point of order."
"As I know you, it does not matter; today is one of my good days."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, I rejoice that we are now at the start of the final stage of a short but intensive process."
"We are able to complete the programme and thereby guarantee that young people and youth organisations will be able to implement their programmes."
"This has been a very intensive period and we have again been under pressure of time."
"I would like that to be different for new programmes in the future, so that we have a bit more time available for more precise elucidation of the individual positions and more opportunities for discussion."
"What this is primarily about is supporting youth groups, something that must be of particular concern to us if we want to build up confidence in Europe or in the European Union, for then it is young people who best understand Europe and who are least likely to have problems when it comes to abandoning their prejudices."
"Because that has to be encouraged, they also have to be got more involved in the European process."
"There are various ways in which this can be done: one central office is the Youth Forum, which maintains contacts in the various countries and does many difficult, necessary and useful things alongside young people, enabling them to live in democratic association within Europe and beyond it."
"Today we are debating three reports; although this is a joint debate, they cannot all be considered in the same way, as their substance has to do with different responsibilities, which need to be taken into account appropriately."
"It has been proposed that the action programmes be harmonised as regards the long-fought-for share of cofinance, the principle of degressivity, and their duration."
"It will, no doubt, be very difficult in practical terms to have them running until 2008."
"We have had lengthy talks about the 20% equal share in cofinance, which will not quite work, as several organisations, especially in the educational sphere, get such minimal support that further cutbacks would mean that support would effectively lapse."
"For youth organisations, then, the figure 20% is just about acceptable, as finding sponsors is a recurrent problem."
"Businesses are unable to devote themselves to young people on top of the economic situation."
"Organisations in many other areas of activity find it significantly easier to find sponsors than do those dealing with young people, which is why the latter need our particular support."
"I would also like degressivity, according to which two and a half per cent of the previous year’s grant is to be retained from the third year onwards, to benefit the groups and youth organisations that have not been covered by that date."
"This will become particularly important in the aftermath of enlargement."
"After 1 May, there will be more young people for us to reach."
"We have to invest more and we have to give them strong support."
"Those youth organisations whose aim is to advance international dialogue among young people and to present information on relevant topics to as large a young public as possible are also conduits for the European Union’s views."
"What matters is not just promoting young people’s interests, but also communicating material that relates to what they are interested in."
"Whilst we have to take their interests into account, they also themselves have to make their own contribution and thereby further reflect the whole range of European policy to their fullest extent."
"The future of the European Union is in the hands of young people, and we should not forget that."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, today’s debate on these three much-needed programmes finds us seeking a common legal base for the areas of culture, education and youth."
"We have had a concertation procedure – I am grateful for the very fine support we got from the Committee on Budgets in that – and now we have some fairly substantial financial resources at our disposal."
"We could, of course, do with more – these are, after all, areas in which we are dealing with the public, and in particular with young people – but we can be satisfied with what we have."
"As far as my own area is concerned, I can tell you that EUR 77 million for the action programme for educational institutions is not a trifling amount, but, again, we could do with more."
"Within all three of these areas there are institutions and associations that are, putting it in the broadest possible terms, educational and cultural ambassadors for Europe and which promote awareness of Europe’s common cultural heritage."
"For years, often with the help of this House, all these organisations have been doing their work."
"Without them, Europe’s soul would atrophy even more than it is apparently slowly doing now."
"I am especially glad that Mrs Iivari has been able to gain acceptance for the idea that cultural institutions should be able to retain their subsidies, at least for a transitional period of two years."
"Among other things, this is an acknowledgement of these organisations’ work."
"They can then prepare themselves for the applications they will have to make in response to future invitations to tender."
"It is at this point that I would like to stress that we MEPs are of course closer to the public than are those who sit in the Commission in Brussels, and so it is a fact that we are more aware of what the public needs."
"There are three points I would now like to make."
"As for the first, I would like to take this opportunity to shed more light on the Financial Regulation."
"Under no circumstances must the lawyers’ mania for regulation be allowed to obstruct our striving for greater transparency and efficiency in our political work on the ground, and I know that the Commission suffers from it just as much as Parliament."
"The Council, having absolutely no interest in such things, does not, but the problem is that we have the impossible task of defending these things on the ground."
"Let me just say, with reference to this, that this Financial Regulation and the Commission have now – to take just one example – wrecked the network of Europe Houses that has existed for 50 years."
"There is a place for that in this debate."
"I also want to point out that in respect of neither 2003 nor 2004 has the Commission been able to pay to this network the sums of money that this House allocated to it."
"It is refusing to do so."
"It is not Mrs Reding who is to be blamed for this, but others; the point simply has to be made that it is the Commission’s fault."
"It may be that the Financial Regulation that we now have was necessary."
"The only thing is that it cannot stay the way it is."
"We have to recognise that a rigorous, not to say fundamentalist, interpretation of this Financial Regulation gives rise to a bureaucracy that distances the public even further from the EU."
"How are members of the public meant to submit applications if they have to get a consultant to do it for them?"
"It is scarcely credible that all these things should have become so complicated."
"We must not allow ourselves to be taken hostage by a sort of budgetary imperialism."
"We should make a real attempt at changing something, and, in the new parliamentary term, join with the Committee on Budgets in finding a new approach."
"We are neither an assembly of managers nor a board of directors seeking the maximum in bureaucratic efficiency."
"Rather than being either of those things, we are a political assembly, and our principal task is to respond to the European public’s desires and needs."
"It is for that reason that I believe we have to make it our business to ensure that money is spent properly, but we must not allow ourselves to be tied into a corset that nobody will find it easy to get out of."
"My second point is that we expect more from the soul of Europe, and so future budgets need to take more account of education and culture."
"The third, Commissioner, has to do with the new generation of educational and cultural programmes that you want to speak about today."
"My expectation of this new generation of programmes is that they should include manageable instruments, by which I mean action at Community level that is capable of being practically implemented, equipped with operational and financial resources in line with what the public want."
"Everything we do must focus on the public, and let me once again stress that they must not be used as a justification for bureaucratic machinery."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, it comes as a relief that the subject of our debate is the common position with regard to financing European cultural organisations and networks."
"A decision on the issue must really be taken now, so that the organisations that are entitled to funding receive their grants starting this year."
"I wish to sincerely thank all those whose cooperation in conciliation led to our success at the end of last year."
"Terence Wynn, the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, and many others helped enormously."
"My own collaboration with the Commission and the Council has gone well at the various stages of the process."
"The Commission proposal for an action programme to promote bodies active in the field of culture became necessary when we switched to an activity-based budget."
"The cultural organisations, which were formerly financed out of Budget Line A signifying administrative expenditure, need a legal basis for their funding to continue."
"With the compromise arrived at in conciliation, financing will now be based on a period of three years."
"During the first two years there will be compliance with the decision made by the Committee on Budgets last autumn regarding beneficiaries, which is to say earmarking; the third year will see a switch over to open application."
"The legal basis now coming into existence will also permit the financing of the work of the European Bureau of Lesser-Used Languages and the Mercator network, as well as concentration camp sites as historical memorials."
"The programme’s total budget is EUR 19 million."
"When the Commission proposal was being discussed it was evident, for example in the view of all the institutions’ legal services, that the earlier procedure, in which Parliament mentions organisations to receive grants by name, does not accord with the new Financial Regulation."
"I myself am also in favour of the open application method as a matter of principle."
"Parliament is a legislative body and it is not for us to name individual beneficiaries."
"It does not meet the requirements of transparency and good administrative practice."
"Parliament lays down guidelines and evaluates decisions made by the Commission on the basis of reports."
"Having worked closely with European cultural networks for almost five years, I am convinced of the European added value they produce."
"It is immensely important that experts and creative people who work in or for museums, cultural administration, art colleges, schools, the theatre and music have an opportunity for cooperation."
"I believe that cultural networks have an important contribution to make to the success of European enlargement."
"They are not only important heralds of the diversity of our common European cultural heritage and civilisation but also creators of new ideas."
"I believe that now that we are finalising a legal basis for funding for three years we can get off to a good start by making sure of the survival of European-wide cultural networks."
"I am very pleased that the importance of European cultural and educational cooperation is being highlighted in the Commission proposal as a new financial framework in the building of Europe’s future."
"My warmest thanks and congratulations go to Commissioner Reding for that."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, new obligations under the Financial Regulation adopted in 2002 are the reason for our debate today."
"This new Financial Regulation now provides a clear legal framework for the subsidies we give to a large number of leading European organisations in the fields of culture, youth and education."
"There will now have to be a legal base for all funding decisions."
"That is of course a step forward and I am pleased about it, while noting, as Mrs Pack has said, that there are some perverse effects and I very much hope we shall find solutions in talks with the budgetary services of this House."
"The changes that have been made led the Commission to present proposals for a new legal base in spring 2003."
"Those proposals concerned in particular the fields of culture, youth and education."
"They sought to ensure a smooth transition between the old system and the new, and we have tried to ensure the necessary continuity while being irreproachable in terms of the proper use of public funds."
"Today I am grateful to the European Parliament and to Mr Rocard and his committee in particular for recognising the urgency of the matter and allowing the Commission’s proposals to be examined quickly."
"It seems to me that the most important matters have now been settled and I am therefore pleased that we are moving towards a compromise, which shows the European institutions’ determination to find a solution as quickly as possible when that is necessary."
"For want of a legal base, we have in fact been in a legal vacuum since 1 January 2004 with regard to organisations whose know-how and creativeness are well known, organisations which the citizens need if they are really to be able to operate in a European way."
"The part played by those bodies is irreplaceable: they help to make Europe loved and to give Europe a soul, as some Members have so rightly said."
"We have therefore all shown common sense in finding solutions that will enable us to put an end to uncertainty."
"I believe everything is now in place to close this file and I would like to point out that the Presidency has sent three letters to the chairman of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport informing him that the Council is open to reaching an agreement at second reading on the basis of the common positions so amended."
"The Commission’s position on the amendments contained in the various recommendations is as follows: so far as the proposal in the field of education and training is concerned, the Commission is able to agree to the three amendments voted by the Committee on Culture at second reading because they bring major improvements to the way the programme is implemented."
"So far as culture is concerned, the five amendments seeking to make the text compatible with the Financial Regulation and to take account of budget conciliation also meet with the Commission’s agreement."
"So far as youth is concerned, the proposed amendment introducing a transitional clause into the legal base in order to extend the period of eligibility to 1 January 2004 to take account of expenditure made during the period of legal vacuum also has the Commission’s agreement."
"The Commission therefore fully approves Parliament’s amendments, Mr President."
"As you see, there is no more ambiguity and I will therefore end by thanking the rapporteurs, Mrs Iivari, Mrs Pack and Mrs Prets, for the quality of their work and above all for the spirit in which they undertook it."
"Thanks to you, ladies, we will be able to continue our very important work with European organisations that bring the Europe of citizenship to life."
"Mr President, Commissioner, having listened to Commissioner Reding briefly, I am lost for words because it seems to me that this subject is very important."
"One may be a qualified teacher, but what can you do without resources, without money, especially at European level? The Council of Ministers occasionally shows greater generosity towards European projects, but it is difficult for it to do so because, as we know, with subsidiarity education normally remains a national matter."
"However that may be, if I am speaking on my own behalf and not as a Member of the European Parliament, if I am speaking as a former history teacher, I recognise that while money is indeed important for education there is something even more important."
"As Mrs Reding would say, education is also about training and the mind."
"Everyone here today, including those in the public gallery, was once a child and went to school and we can all remember good teachers."
"We forget the bad teachers and remember the good ones."
"What is a good teacher?"
"It is someone who loves his subject, who also loves his pupils and also, of necessity, their families."
"This report by rapporteurs Pack, Prets and Iivari is very important and I pay tribute to their work."
"It is not the end of the story, however."
"The end of the story would be that the generations that come after us should perhaps be able to achieve something that goes beyond what our regional and national systems can give."
"From our point of view as Members of Parliament, members of an EU institution, there is room for culture and education at European level."
"I hope that this report will be well received by the Council of Ministers and that teachers and pupils will thus be able to expand their minds a little."
"Culture and education are neither regional nor national nor European, they are all three at once."
"Mr President, should I now speak in English to further confuse the interpreters?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would like to thank the three rapporteurs most warmly for having done a good job so quickly."
"I see it as giving cultural, educational and youth organisations the important message that this House has powerful advocates to plead their causes."
"If I may now speak on the area in which I have been heavily involved, with the White Paper on Youth, the new youth programme and the old one, I have to say that, as a result of their increasing contacts through the recent consultation processes, youth organisations and the European Youth Forum have had their expectations raised very high."
"I believe that young people are very satisfied with the good legal basis for financially supporting over 80 youth organisations."
"Compared with other policy areas – cultural policy, say, or education – the youth programme is so poorly endowed that we end up allocating less than one per cent of the overall EU Budget to this area, and that, in the long term, ladies and gentlemen, is no longer acceptable."
"The public want to see the European Union reflecting their own interests."
"This is an area into which we must breathe life."
"For this reason, the geographical dimension, which we must always have at the back of our minds when supporting youth organisations, is about more than the enlarged EU."
"It has to be clear to us that the European Youth Forum, as an umbrella organisation for youth, also works with the countries belonging to the Council of Europe, where it performs an important role as a political intermediary."
"Youth associations, let me say, are always a bit ahead of the other organisations."
"Young people think further ahead; they perhaps have a clearer view of their own future than do people like us who are immersed in day-today living and in the business of politics."
"This explains the cooperation with the CIS, and the programme’s importance in terms of peaceful political development in the Mediterranean is not to be underestimated either."
"With regard to the elections on 10-13 June, too, I can only say that we have to persuade young people that Europe is the right place in which to take their political ideas further."
"Today, then, is a good day for us to adopt these three programmes, after which we can have a bit more clout in the Budget negotiations and, where forthcoming youth programmes are concerned, look further into the future."
"– Mr President, the legal package before us aims at creating a legal basis for certain cultural, educational and youth action programmes."
"The purpose of these is to provide institutions and organisations in this area with financial support."
"The European Parliament’s budget has been used, in accordance with the A-30 lines, to support certain institutions, and NGOs that function on a voluntary basis in particular, which have promoted European activity and strengthened European identity."
"Over the years grants for organisations have become established to the extent that their allocation has been something that former recipients of aid have taken for granted."
"Selecting which organisations and institutions should receive financial support seems to have been a remarkably arbitrary process."
"New operators have said that inclusion has been very difficult, as the selection criteria have been vague."
"The choice seems to have been influenced more by the fact that the organisations selected have had strong advocates on the relevant parliamentary committees than by the quality of their operation being superior to that of others."
"This detail received attention when the Financial Regulation was being reviewed, with appropriations earmarked in the budget headings finally being cut or cancelled."
"The legal package now under discussion will create a legal basis for grants to organisations active in the fields of education, culture and youth work."
"The aim must be for the forms of financial assistance from the European Union to be transparent and properly justified."
"This means that grants to organisations that are repeated and taken for granted should be few in number or they should not exist at all."
"Organisations and institutions have to demonstrate clearly that they are centres of excellence and better than others in the field."
"Funding must be based on applications assessed impartially and fairly."
"Financing has to be channelled in a way that clearly defines those targets the achievement of which the EU supports, and any recipient of aid must produce a credible report on the use of funds."
"I wish to thank the rapporteurs, Ulpu Iivari, Doris Pack and Christa Prets for their excellent reports."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking all three rapporteurs for their reports, which I fully support."
"In the ten years I have been in Parliament I have had responsibility either as the budget rapporteur or the shadow budget rapporteur for the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, often working very closely with Mrs Iivari."
"I wish to concentrate mainly on the culture report."
"She and I are broadly in agreement on the principles."
"Perhaps we would differ to a certain extent in that I have always thought the parliamentary procedure for supporting activities is very open and transparent."
"I also attended the conciliation meeting just before Christmas, when we hammered out the new legal base."
"I want to pay tribute both to the Commissioner and to the Commission staff for their support, as also to the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, who was extremely supportive."
"Let me just make three key points."
"Spending on cultural activity is important."
"I totally agree with the Commissioner: Europe has to be, and is, about more than economics and trade."
"The activities of organisations such as the European Youth Orchestra, 'Swinging Europe', the European Forum for the Arts and Heritage – I could carry on – all help people to understand not just culture but also the cultural dimension of Europe and, through that, the European Union itself."
"We all know that the Culture 2000 programme is grossly under-funded."
"It is also restricted by its own terms, and many organisations that need help at a European level and have been turning to Parliament will now be able to use this new legal base."
"We cannot expect the Member States to fund cultural activities of a European dimension – they will concentrate on the national dimension."
"Culture funding is too small – that has been said before."
"Nearly 50% of our money goes on agriculture – I make it less than 0.5% on culture."
"But culture is an important wealth creator: 17% of UK GDP comes from the creative industries."
"Finally, we have to ensure that organisations that receive funding support get the information in good time, so that money is spent efficiently as well as effectively."
"Mr President, I am especially glad that these programmes will guarantee the financial stability of organisations such as Youth Forum, Jeunesse, the European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages and Mercator information and documentation centres amongst many others."
"Youth Forum and Jeunesse fulfil an important role in empowering and engaging young people in civil society, which is so important."
"They also provide young people with an environment to learn democratic decision-making, intercultural understanding and self-motivated learning."
"Likewise the European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages and Mercator have both played, and will continue to play, an important role in safeguarding and promoting minority languages in the European Union."
"Their presence and work is especially needed now that 10 new countries will join the Union and further enhance the number of existing minority languages. There are 40 million minority-language speakers now."
"Six million other people speaking minority languages will join."
"It is crucial that the speakers of these languages enjoy the same rights and possibilities that have been available to everyone else."
"I welcome also the measures to increase transparency in the decisions to allocate grants to organisations and also the user-friendliness of the grant application process which at the moment is far too cumbersome."
"Nevertheless I regret that in the case of youth NGOs the principle of degressivity remains in the common position, which will mean that the reduction of their funds from the third year onwards will make things rather difficult for them."
"Guaranteeing a regular budget for these NGOs would be the best way to support their activities and increase their effectiveness in future."
"I very much hope that these excellent reports will be endorsed by a substantial majority in Parliament."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, rapporteurs, like the previous speakers, I believe it is essential to have a legal basis which provides us with a stable budget for European youth, culture and education programmes."
"These programmes, which naturally the European Commission, Parliament and Council must be involved in, must have, firstly, the relevant legal basis, and that is moving in the right direction and, secondly, an adequate budget."
"And that is what we in the European institutions must do next in relation to European youth, education and culture."
"I have often said in this House, and I will not tire of doing so, and today I am going to say it again, that the future of Europe lies in its youth."
"It cannot be any other way."
"And the future of Europe is going to depend very much on the education received by these young people."
"Although in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity education is not our responsibility, we can make a great and very positive contribution to the creation of a more united, knowledgeable, cohesive, cultured and educated Europe; this is what we all want."
"In the end this will benefit all Europeans."
"I would therefore ask that, when we have finished the battle over the legal basis, amongst all of us we begin the battle to increase the budgets for youth, culture and education until they receive the sums they truly deserve, because that will benefit all of us."
"The next item is the Commission Communication on the new generation of Community education and training programmes 2007 – 2013 and on ‘Active Citizenship’."
". Mr President, I promised that during the first half of 2004 I would outline the future prospects for the European programmes for which I am responsible."
"It is done."
"The Commission has just given the green light for the communication about these new programmes."
"The two communications adopted today affect all Europeans, from their schooling to their lives as citizens."
"That is important because Europe is not only about economics, finance and commerce."
"Europe has a soul."
"Europe is men and women in their cultural diversity, which is our Union’s true wealth."
"The new programmes are trying to listen to them; they are designed to respond to their aspirations and help them to create a genuine European citizenship."
"Questions of education and citizenship will in fact be among the major issues of the coming decade."
"In a Union which is expected to have nearly 500 million people in 2007, strengthening the sense of cultural belonging and of being a citizen of a community of extraordinary diversity will necessarily require mobilising all the tools and programmes at our disposal."
"The programmes concerned by the communications adopted today will therefore form part of a new overall logic: building bridges between cultures and individuals."
"Mr President, these programmes will be our future because their main thrust is to help young people to realise their European aspirations both in the field of education and in the vast field of citizenship."
"I know that these programmes come up to a lot of expectations."
"They have not been plucked out of thin air."
"There have been public consultations with thousands of professionals, with thousands of people involved in culture and education."
"We had the agreement and the express request of Parliament to go ahead."
"I can also tell you in all honesty that the timetable will be tight because we will need 2006 to put these programmes in place and ensure a smooth transition between today’s programmes and tomorrow’s."
"I would also like to tell you that the Commission has taken advantage of this to propose a major simplification."
"That simplification does of course have its limits because the legal bases, the customers, if I may put it that way, and the interventions are different."
"We have, however, managed to reduce the number of legal bases from 13 to six and the number of budget lines from 26 to seven."
"A revision of the Financial Regulation is also planned in 2005 and I very much hope that, in the interests of greater transparency, greater efficiency and less bureaucracy, we shall succeed in particular in making these programmes easier for the citizens to use."
"All these programmes are European programmes which emphasise European added value and were therefore created and conceived at European level."
"However, their implementation will be decentralised to national agencies closer to the citizens."
"Those agencies will be responsible for the practical implementation of the programmes because they will be directly familiar with the citizens concerned."
"I can tell you that there is a tremendous capacity for absorption in this respect because even today our budget execution is virtually 100%."
"The applications we are receiving for projects connected with education and culture in the broad sense are at least 50% more than we are able to grant."
"We really have capacity to fill because there is a very large public demand to be satisfied."
"Why did I wait until today to present these new programmes to you?"
"Quite simply because I had to wait for the financial perspectives in order to be able to move forward."
"As I believe President Prodi said in this Chamber, the Commission thinks that education and citizenship are very strong aspects of future European policy."
"That is why the financial perspectives have offered us a greatly expanded budget."
"However, even if that budget is four times greater than what we have today, it is still far from being enough, ladies and gentlemen, because at the moment our programmes still account for only 0.8% of the Community budget."
"Even if the expenditure in question is appreciably increased in the interests of citizenship and in those of the men and women of whom Europe consists, it will still be only a very tiny percentage of the Union’s overall budget, not to mention the fact that, as I can tell you very clearly, there is still a lot of political work, a lot of persuading, to be done if we are to have that tiny percentage."
"I said there were two programmes."
"The first is about education and is called ‘The New Generation of Community Education and Training Programmes’; its common theme is life-long learning, which must start at a very early age, teaching children how to learn, and must continue until citizens leave working life."
"There will therefore be just one integrated programme, a programme whose aim will be to ensure that languages, new technologies and, very importantly, the dissemination of the results of our work, which are considered transversal elements, cover all aspects of education."
"There will of course be different levels, as there are today: schooling, vocational education and training, higher education, adult education."
"European added value will be introduced at all these levels: mobility, of course, because it is up to us to stress mobility; partnerships between school classes, between organisations concerned with education; transnational projects, in which our educationalists will develop new programmes at the leading edge of progress."
"A few figures will illustrate what we propose."
"We want at least 10% of primary school pupils to benefit from real or virtual mobility projects: today’s figure is only 1.5% a year."
"We want a threefold increase in the number of Erasmus students: the present number is 120 000 students a year."
"We want the number of people benefiting from the Leonardo programme, which is concerned with vocational education and training, to rise from 45 000 a year today to at least 150 000."
"We want genuine mobility in adult education: the present figure is, I am almost ashamed to say, 2 000 people, and we would like to increase that to at least 50 000 people a year."
"I am speaking here of mobility within the European Union, because there is also, of course, the world outside the European Union."
"There are our new neighbours, whom we shall have to bring into our way of making Europe."
"To this end, Mr President, we want to develop Tempus and make it into Tempus Plus, which will no longer concentrate solely on the university level, but will also provide aid tailored to the needs and capacities of each country, aid for all areas of education policy, including schooling and vocational education and training."
"Then there are our Jean Monnet Chairs."
"Today we have them in 50 countries."
"We think development at this level, too, is very important."
"Another aspect which will be of interest to the honourable Members who were speaking of finance only a few minutes ago, Mr President, is the integration of institutions like Bruges, Florence and Maastricht into our programmes so that the legal base is regulated once and for all."
"So much for the big new integrated Education programme."
"Then there will be a second large integrated programme: ‘Making Citizenship Work’, which will combine several current programmes."
"These will continue as at present, under the umbrella of citizenship."
"It will cover three fields: youth, culture and media."
"The first field is the Youth Programme."
"I know that some of you are more particularly interested in this programme, several aspects of which will be developed."
"The first aspect, the first strand, ‘Youth for Europe’, will combine mobility, participation and exchanges."
"Then the second major strand will be ‘European Voluntary Service’."
"By extending this service not only to individuals but also to groups, we would like to make voluntarism among youth a really strong and visible policy with the intention of extending it even beyond Europe."
"We want to make a kind of ‘Youth of the World’ programme, to contribute to the development of mutual understanding through an open-minded approach to the world and active engagement of young people."
"I am thinking of the countries of the enlarged Europe, of strengthening cooperation with the candidate countries, with the Balkan countries and the EFTA countries, and also with other third countries."
"Another aspect which must not be neglected is the action of socio-educational instructors and support systems for training youth workers, and support for political cooperation."
"The second field is culture."
"There will be three objectives with European added value here: professional mobility, the transnational circulation of works of art and intercultural dialogue."
"These will be the three common themes running through all our cultural actions."
"There will be no more rigid sectoral divisions like there are today, but rather the major emphases I have just described, with the three types of action we already know today: multiannual cooperation with private operators and businesses – an opening to the field of cultural businesses; innovative annual projects, no change there; and going back to the problems we have just solved, support for European cultural bodies."
"Here, too, ladies and gentlemen, there will be much simplification."
"There will be just one budget line instead of the five we have today."
"The final field is the audiovisual sector."
"Here, too, there will be three major objectives: the preservation and enhancement of cultural diversity and heritage, the circulation of works inside and outside the Union, and strengthening the competitiveness of the industrial sector."
"You must understand that we are retaining the present scheme of things."
"Even today we say that investment in film production is a national, regional, private investment, or whatever you wish to call it, but not European."
"We are not changing that, but we are going to give the Member States the possibility of continuing that investment and continuing public aid for the cinema."
"To do so, we are going to intervene up and down stream."
"Upstream by acquiring competences."
"Our cinema schools must be networked."
"One might (why not?) imagine an Erasmus for cinema schools."
"That would be a very good thing."
"To have access to credits, it will be necessary to learn the specific work of filmmaking, including business plans."
"We do not want to educate oddballs, we want to educate people capable of making good films which, moreover, will sell."
"Downstream there is the problem of distribution."
"You know that European films do not travel well, despite all our efforts."
"There is always the problem that people will go and see a national film in the country where it is made, but then the difficulties start when it crosses the border."
"We must therefore do all that we can to change the situation, not only to expand the market for films, but also for reasons of cultural diversity which I do not need to explain."
"We are going to strengthen the system of support and of selective automatic distribution and we are going to add support for dubbing and subtitling, support for multilingualism, so that it will not be too expensive for films to travel."
"I am thinking of new technologies in this connection, because 40% of the income from a film is already generated by DVDs."
"DVDs already have the potential to be multilingual."
"We will therefore have to work on that with a lot of commitment."
"Then there is the question of greater promotion, in Europe of course, but also outside Europe."
"I am thinking, for example, of packages of European films translated into different languages, that would be shown at a festival in New York or New Delhi, accompanied by the European stars to really make the most of it and for high visibility."
"In order to prepare for the future, ladies and gentlemen, we are reserving a space for ‘pilot projects’, a space of flexibility, because there are bound to be big developments in new technologies."
"We must therefore be ready to accompany those developments as required."
"Ladies and gentlemen, that in a few words is what has been decided today."
"It is of course a framework."
"It is a structure, but I think that structure shows that the Commission is taking very seriously Europe’s most precious asset, Europe’s greatest wealth: the citizens and their cultural diversity."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I have three questions to put to you."
"Firstly, I would like to know if the extension of the Tempus programme to Tempus Plus is a response to the question raised in Thessaloniki as to whether the educational programmes were being extended to the countries of the Balkans."
"I would see that as not going far enough;"
"I would like to see the whole of the Socrates programme extended, rather than just having Tempus as a new one."
"Secondly, does the reduction of the Budget line not have the result that we, in this House and in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport have even less of a say as regards who gets subsidies? What are the facts of the matter here?"
"Thirdly, are the programmes’ titles being lost?"
"Are the names ‘Erasmus’, ‘Socrates’, and ‘Comenius’ no more, or are they being retained somewhere?"
"It is not clear to me from the text."
"Although I hope I will get an answer to this, I regret that I will not be here to hear it, as I have to go to a briefing before another meeting."
"Please accept my apologies."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, let me start by thanking you for keeping to the timetable."
"It is good to see the new programme already up and running, and I would like to put three short questions to you."
"Since you want to increase and extend everything – Leonardo, for example, from 45 000 participants to 150 000, 10% primary schoolchildren rather than 1.5%, a leap from 2 000 to 50 000 in adult education, and more of the same besides – how much can we expect in the Budget?"
"We used to get 0.8%; if we want improved performance and higher quality, that will have to be paid for somehow."
"Also, in what sort of stages is this objective to be achieved?"
"How is it proposed to achieve it by 2012 or 2010, and who will then bear the additional expenditure if – as I am given to understand – many countries are no longer prepared to contribute more than 1% to the European budget?"
"– First of all, allow me to congratulate you, Commissioner Reding."
"In fact, in this period of gloom after the intergovernmental conference, this House does not often shake with enthusiasm."
"You have given us the opportunity to do so, which is a pleasure to hear."
"I have many questions, but I will put four of them to you."
"Three of them are concerned with what you have just said and one strays slightly from an issue that you dealt with, but it concerns our problems."
"My first question is this: could you be a little more explicit about what you just quickly touched upon as regards quadrupling the budget?"
"Over what period?"
"On what basis?"
"Is this about the whole budget for culture, youth and the media?"
"What news!"
"We are starting with such a small amount."
"All the same, we would like to know a little more."
"My second question concerns languages."
"We know each other well, Commissioner Reding, and I admire the enthusiasm and the spirit with which you defend language initiation programmes and take on the defence of minority languages."
"In this context, it is the Council that is delaying."
"Will the Commissioner, in support of the programmes that she has just described, be prepared to go back to the idea that the Council must manage to put pressure on the Member States to make it compulsory to teach at least two modern languages?"
"Furthermore, according to linguists, it would be preferable for one of these two languages to be outside of the linguistic family of the mother tongue."
"In this way, Europe would become multilingual and not dependent on our jargon that is similar to English."
"My third question concerns the cinema."
"It was a pleasure to listen to you on this point, Commissioner Reding."
"On the issue of promoting cultural diversity and defending it in the area of cinema, however, you did not mention this unsuccessful text that was – it seems to me – drawn up by the Internal Market Directorate General."
"In the name of protecting competition, it claimed to harmonise, but in fact it is to remove or completely change all our structures for helping cinema and that worries us all."
"In our opinion, this reasoning was stupid, but we would like to hear it from your own lips."
"My fourth question is a point of application."
"It concerns what you said on the issue of European high culture."
"You spoke about Bruges and Florence."
"I have just learnt that in Florence, following an international agreement fixing the budget of this institution, the notification sent to it was cut back by the Commission Secretary General by 20% compared with the sum agreed on and adopted by this Parliament, which is sovereign in Europe."
"– Thank you, Mr President, and congratulations to the Commissioner, who has conceived the educational programmes along very ambitious lines."
"I hope that we, working together with the Commission, will be able to budget for them."
"I would remind you that Erasmus aimed to include 10% of students in the programme."
"Let us hope that we succeed in doing that."
"Let me now turn to the new programme."
"Our agenda simply describes this as a debate on the education and cultural programmes."
"My fear is that young people will end up footing the bill if their concerns are thrown into a single package along with everything else."
"We, I think, must ensure – and you, in your proposal, must specify – that the youth programmes must be properly funded, that the informal system of education will continue to be valued as it needs to be in the future, and will be able to be extended in order to prepare people for active citizenship."
"If all these things – youth, culture, audiovisuals, media, and films – end up in a single package, my fear is that young people will end up paying the bill and losing out."
"That must not be allowed to happen."
". Mr President, I will try to be as brief as possible, mainly because I will be in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport next Monday."
"As a result, it will be possible to ask all the questions that I can currently read in the faces of those around me then."
"There seems to be a fear that the various elements in the Socrates programme will be done away with."
"I can tell Mrs Pack that the precise opposite is the case: the fact is that we will be extending the Tempus Plus programme to all types of schooling, that is to say, to schools, vocational training, adult education and universities."
"She asked whether the names are being abandoned, to which the answer is both in the affirmative and the negative."
"We now have an overall designation for the educational programmes, so that Socrates is no more, but Comenius, Erasmus, Leonardo and Grundtvig will remain for schools, universities, vocational training and adult education respectively."
"Mrs Prets asked me about the position as regards the Budget."
"It is simple: when there is nothing left to be shared out, we will get nothing."
"The Commission takes a different view; what it would like is for something to be left to be shared out, and that is why it has no sympathy with those countries that want to pay just 1%."
"We need more if we are to be able to invest in the , in the citizens, in our young people, and the fact that the Commission’s budget for the future is an enlarged one means that it has made more funds available for education and for citizenship."
"I have quite deliberately sought not to get involved in this debate, believing as I do that it is very important – including in political terms – to clarify what we want for Europe, where we want to take it, and what we need in order to achieve that end."
"Only when we have done that should we look to see how much money we need in order to make that a reality."
"Tackling this from the other end is the wrong way to go about it."
"I wanted to say to Mr Rocard that quadrupling the budget is in line with the Financial Perspective that the Commission has presented."
"You will, therefore, experience a lot more pleasure, Mr Rocard, in negotiating and battling with the Council, which will surely want to grant less than the Commission proposes."
"It will then be necessary to clarify the area where reductions will be made."
"Do we want 120 000 or 360 000 Erasmus students every year?"
"We need to be very clear."
"If we do not give ourselves the money to finance the 360 000 Erasmus students or the 10% of schools that could benefit from an education mobility programme, then we cannot do it."
"That is clear."
"Languages, Mr President, are included, as a common theme, in all our education programmes as well as in our programmes for citizenship."
"Clearly, Europe cannot be built without linguistic diversity."
"Despite everything, I am pleased to mention the modest progress achieved in our Member States and I will never fail to take the opportunity to speak to them to persuade them to forge ahead."
"As regards cinema and aid for it, I thought that I said, Mr President, that we have to be logical."
"If, in the name of the European Union, we do not want to invest in the production of films, then we must give Member States the possibility of doing so."
"You will have to wait until next week, Mr Rocard, when, in your capacity as Chairman of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, you will hear an answer that will satisfy you and I am sure not just you, but all European film-makers and all those who love the cinema."
"Mrs Gröner gave voice to the fear that it would be detrimental to young people if youth, culture and media were to be lumped together in one package."
"I can tell her that she can rely on me not to allow that."
"When we present the actual programmes in July, you will see that young people will not have been forgotten."
"We always say that they are the future of this Europe of ours, and that is indeed the case."
"The only thing is our deeds have to back up what we say."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to Question Time (B5-0066/2004)."
"We shall take a series of questions to the Commission."
"Is the Commission aware that there is profound concern in Scotland concerning perceived abuses by the Norwegian state of a dominant position in the fish-farming industry?"
"Will the Commission, in this light, indicate what steps it is taking and has taken to prevent abuse by Norwegian state-controlled and other interests and by the Nutreco Group of the Netherlands (the management policies of whose aquacultural interests are believed to be determined in Stavanger), particularly in respect of feeding materials?"
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will give a very direct answer to that question."
"The Commission is prepared to conduct an in-depth investigation of the alleged abuse of a dominant position in the European Union’s fish production as and when evidence of such abuse is produced."
"As long ago as 1992, we ruled to prohibit a price cartel operated by Norwegian, Scottish and Irish salmon breeders."
"We are liasing on a regular basis with the Norwegian authorities as regards observation of the markets referred to in the question."
"As I have said, I am prepared to examine the available information in depth and, if need be, to set in motion other investigations into this matter."
"I warmly thank Commissioner Fischler for that very direct answer."
"It is extremely important that this allegation of abuse of dominant position should be investigated."
"A particular concern is that the breeders of juvenile fish, or smolt, are mainly based in Scotland and Ireland and are dependent entirely on sales to the ongrowers who are in turn affected by the feed manufacturers."
"The feed manufacturers and the ongrowing concerns are heavily dominated by Norwegian interests and that is where the abuse of dominant position within the market arises."
"One particular risk that it gives rise to is that a particular asset currently in the hands of EU-owned salmon breeders is the genetic data and genotyped brood stock, which is of fundamental importance, as I am sure the Commissioner well realises."
"In conducting his further investigation, with which I will be very happy to cooperate as much as I can, will he take a particularly close and concerned look at that aspect of the situation?"
". Mr President, I can only ask the honourable Member to forward to us whatever information he receives, as we are willing to give all these issues the attention they deserve."
"Apart from that, I cannot do other than agree with what you have said."
"Commissioner, I join Mr MacCormick in thanking you for your direct answer."
"He and I have been passing information week after week to you and your colleagues but have found there to be a rather roundabout relationship between you for aquaculture, Mr Monti for competition policy and Mr Lamy for trade, which makes life very difficult."
"Can I ask the three of you to join forces and work in a joined-up way, in order to prosecute this particular problem with the utmost urgency?"
"The life is being squeezed out of our constituents in Scotland."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to clarify something here."
"There is indeed a difference between agriculture and fisheries in this respect."
"The fact is that I am also responsible for the international side of agricultural matters."
"As well as that, I am authorised to conduct negotiations relating to the agriculture sector, in the WTO for example."
"There is a different situation in fisheries, where my fellow-Commissioner Mr Lamy has responsibility for the international dimension."
"I am quite happy, though, to take up your suggestion and, the next time we have one of our bilateral and trilateral meetings – as I can assure you we do – we will certainly see to it that the information will be made available at an appropriately early stage to all those who may have some responsibility for this."
"As the author is not present, Question No 28 lapses."
"For the EU Arrest Warrant, and the proposed EU Evidence Warrant, to work successfully, there must be a level playing-field in respect of rights of suspects across the Union."
"When will the Commission make a formal proposal for an EU-wide agreement on safeguards for procedures which involve suspects?"
"In other words, to propose equal access to lawyers and interpreters, to combat police immunity, and to ensure similar interpretations on how human rights are interpreted including the right to liberty, the right to a fair trial and the right to silence?"
". Very shortly the Commission is planning to present a proposal for a framework decision on certain procedural rights for suspected persons in criminal proceedings throughout the Union."
"The draft instrument is in its final stages of internal consultation within the Commission."
"When it is finished and has been translated, it will be sent to Parliament and the Council."
"The draft framework decision covers five basic rights: access to legal advice; access to free interpretation and translation, ensuring that persons who are not able to understand or follow the proceedings receive specific attention; the right of foreign detained persons to communicate with their consular authorities; and written notification of their rights."
"As regards the right to silence, the Commission has asked the Law Society of England and Wales to carry out a study on gathering and handling of evidence, including how the right to silence is interpreted in all the Member States and in the acceding countries."
"Once the report of this study has been received, the Commission will evaluate the need for any proposal in this area."
"Police immunity is not within the competence of the European Union, since the maintenance of law and order and the safeguarding of internal security are explicitly excluded from the ambit of the Treaty on European Union."
"Thank you for the reply, Commissioner, which sounds encouraging."
"I am aware of what a terrible minefield this proposal is going to be. Take the example of the arrest warrant, which all the Member States have ratified but only eight have transposed into national law."
"It is going to be very difficult to get this proposal through, but you have the backing of our committee."
"Two big obstacles lie ahead of you."
"There is a problem of mutual recognition versus standardisation."
"Standardisation would be better, but mutual recognition is the easier approach."
"How are you going to achieve that and ensure it works when there is the European Convention on Human Rights, and every smart lawyer will immediately say that he does not recognise somebody else's ability to pass judgement and is going to appeal to Strasbourg?"
"How are you going to make this work in practice?"
"It is going to be very difficult and I look forward to receiving some reassurance from you."
". I confirm that it is extremely difficult, because almost half the Member States do not agree that there is a legal basis to deal with these issues at European Union level."
"That is not the position of the Commission."
"We think that mutual recognition, which is the cornerstone of judicial penal cooperation, requires mutual confidence among Member States."
"To a certain extent, to create that climate of mutual confidence, we need a minimum degree of harmonisation or at least approximation of penal law, including procedural guarantees."
"We are not working in an empty field; the European Convention on Human Rights lays down some standards."
"We think that we should go further at European level and be more specific about how to use the procedural guarantees already laid down in the European Convention on Human Rights."
"We will present our proposal fairly soon and we will try to get it through the Council."
"It will not be easy, but I am determined to follow that path."
"Commissioner, you will forgive me for finding the situation unsatisfactory, as I am sure you do too."
"We were assured, at the time the European arrest warrant was introduced, that effective common minimum standards would follow hot on its heels."
"We now discover that they are not going to."
"Those of us who suggested building a European into the arrest warrant find ourselves reinforced in our belief that this would have been wise."
"Can you concede, Commissioner, as one who has been a doughty fighter in this regard that, if the new Constitution were to come into force, the Member States would in future find themselves subject to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union when executing European arrest warrants, and that this would be binding law because in implementing European arrest warrants they would be implementing European law?"
". Mr MacCormick, I share your view that the situation is unsatisfactory but, nevertheless, there is no empty field, as I said."
"Firstly, there is the European Convention on Human Rights, which deals with fair trial rules, and which has been subscribed to by all Member States and all acceding states."
"Secondly, there are some specific procedural rules in the framework decision on the European arrest warrant as such and, thirdly, I am fully supportive of the idea of the Charter of Fundamental Rights being legally binding, with constitutional status."
"As soon as we resolve the minor matters of the weighting of votes, it will come into force, I am sure."
"As the author is not present, Question No 30 lapses."
"What position will the Commission adopt with regard to the concerns, expressed by the Galician fisheries sector to Commissioner Fischler during his working visit to Vigo, that it would be appropriate for the Agency to take on duties relating to research and the improvement of the scientific principles governing the state of fishery resources and to consider the possible introduction of a system for the exchange of fishing quotas between Community enterprises? According to the Galician proposal, this would make its responsibilities similar to those of other agencies, such as the ones dealing with the internal market or the promotion of social dialogue."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 13 December 2003, the European Council gave the go-ahead for the establishment of a Community Fisheries Control Agency, on which, at the end of this month, the Commission will submit a proposal in which we will define this new authority’s tasks."
"The most important of these will be the coordination of the joint deployment of the control services in the Member States."
"The checks are to be carried out by, among others, multinational teams, with the inspection strategies to be used, such as benchmarking and common priorities, laid down by the Commission."
"We will also be involving experts from the Member States in the setting-up of the agency and consulting the various interest groups."
"We expect a study to be produced in September on the operational aspects of this agency, and its results will be discussed by the Council when making its decision."
"On the occasion of my most recent visit to Vigo, the Galician fisheries sector suggested potential sites for this agency; I will of course examine these suggestions in detail, and they will also be considered in the studies to which I have referred."
"Provided that the Council accepts our proposal, it will then be possible to appoint the board of management and the executive director, and then this enterprise will be, in a sense, up and running."
"Commissioner, I was aware, as you would expect, of your visit to Vigo, my birthplace, and I know that the city’s fishing sector, one of the largest in Galicia, in the Spanish State and in Europe, has just issued a set of suggestions concerning the duties and competences of this Agency, which I believe deserve a concrete answer from you."
"Furthermore, I believe that you should promote an open dialogue with the sector before defining the Agency’s regulations and I believe that this institution could provide the much-needed link between those working in the industry and the scientific institutions."
"In any event, I wish to ask you expressly whether the Commission has already received the proposal from the Spanish State to ensure that the Agency’s headquarters are established in Vigo and when you think it will be definitively established there."
". Mr President, we have not yet had the official proposal for this Agency’s actual base, but, as I have already observed, there is still enough time for this, as we first have to establish its legal base."
"Although we will be making a proposal for this without delay, this proposal must then make its way through the legislative process."
"Mr President, my question is a specific one: as has been said, it is clear that it was the Council that decided that this agency should be created in Spain, that this decision was approved and that the democratically-elected Spanish Prime Minister, Mr Aznar, accepted that it had to be located in the city of Vigo."
"I believe that the Commission has also accepted this, since the Commissioner has been there himself."
"I therefore believe there is no doubt about this."
"What naturally worries the sector now is when this agency will begin to operate."
"I believe that Parliament will have to give its opinion on the Commission’s proposal and that, once the new Parliament is constituted in July – and this is what I want to ask the Commissioner – I believe that in September – as he has said – it may be in the operational stage."
"If in the Autumn – September or October – Parliament gives its opinion and it is in favour, does that mean that in 2005 the agency could be operational or that all the procedures for putting it into operation could be finished, if all the procedures can be carried out on the basis of the new membership of Parliament?"
". Mr President, in order to avoid any misunderstanding, I would like to make it clear that the Agency cannot start its work before the legal basis for it is established."
"I have pointed out that the Commission – which is acting very quickly here – will this month submit the proposal for the legal basis, after which both the Fisheries Council and Parliament will have to state their positions and take a decision."
"As things stand at present, we can expect an opinion from Parliament only after the Parliamentary elections, which means that the Council, too, will be able to come to a decision no earlier than towards the end of this year."
"Only after this decision has been taken will it be possible to start the recruitment procedures and look for staff, which process will take up a certain amount of time next year."
"I regret the fact that it is neither legally nor technically possible to do this more quickly."
"Nor will we be able to draw on any funds until such time as the legal basis is in force."
"In anticipation of the liberalisation of access to the waters of the Azores, which was to come into force on 1 August 2004, dozens of Community vessels not registered in the Azores have entered these waters, alleging that they have been authorised to do so by third Member States."
"The Portuguese authorities have proved incapable of checking the fishing techniques used and the quantities and species of fish being caught by these vessels, and the Azores’ regional authorities fear that the pillaging of resources they foresaw as a consequence of the entry into force of the provisions of Regulation (EC) 1954/2003(1) has already begun, ahead of schedule."
"When does the Commission intend to use the powers conferred upon it by the Treaty and meet its obligations to defend that Treaty, and take the requisite emergency measures to put an immediate stop to this fishing activity?"
"When does the Commission intend to review its position of acceptance the Council’s position, given the growing evidence that the Regulation violates basic principles of the rights of peoples and of the environment, enshrined in the Treaty?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although the Commission is of course aware of the presence of Spanish fishing vessels in the waters off the Azores, there does appear to be a certain misunderstanding here on the part of the Portuguese authorities as regards the applicability of Regulation 1954/2003."
"Article 5 of this Regulation, which governs the conditions under which fish may be caught in the waters around the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands, states that the Member States can reserve to local vessels the catching of fish within 110 miles of the coast."
"That has been the case ever since 14 November 2003, when this legal provision entered into force."
"It is for the Member States to ensure that these regulations are complied with."
"It follows that the presence of Spanish vessels in the waters around the Azores outside the 100 nautical-mile limit does not justify any emergency measures of the kind suggested by Mr Casaca, as these ships are complying with the rules on access."
"I would remind you, in this context, of the Commission’s statement on the occasion of Regulation 1954/2003’s adoption by the Council, when we also announced a ban on trawling off the Azores, with the intention of preventing damage to the vulnerable ecosystems on the sea bed."
"On 3 February this year, we submitted to the Council a proposal for a regulation on this subject."
"The Commission is also engaged in an ongoing dialogue with the Member States concerned with the intention of ensuring that any friction in the implementation of the new rules is minimised as far as possible."
"Mr President, I am sure this is an oversight, Commissioner, but you did not refer to Article 15 of this Regulation, which is very specific as regards revoking the system that currently preserves Azorean waters."
"The date referred to is 1 August or, alternatively, the date of the entry into force of the set of implementing regulations on the fishing effort, which has not yet entered into force."
"This article cannot be revoked on anyone’s whim."
"The Council, the only legal authority to have delivered an opinion on the matter to date, as stated in the Minutes of the Council meeting of 19 February, has stated unequivocally that this date must be respected."
"I wish to ask you, Commissioner, by what right do you think you can revoke an article for which no other interpretation is possible and which protects the territorial waters of the Azores until 31 July?"
". Mr President, for a start, I can assure Mr Casaca that we have consulted our legal services, whose view of these things is precisely that which I have put to you, and no other."
"What we have decided, in principle, is that, on the one hand, a new boundary of 100 nautical miles has been laid down, whilst, on the other, the fisheries protection zone has been extended to cover more species of fish, instead of protecting only tuna fishing as was formerly the case."
"So, even if you rely on Article 15, I cannot help you."
"The Spanish action in the case to which you refer was quite proper."
"The 1998 reform of the COM in the olive sector established a transition period for the provision of reliable data on the olive oil sector, in the wake of the complaints made by Spain regarding the failure to adjust its national quota."
"Since then, the data made available and the evolution of the existing COM have confirmed its inadequacy and its discriminatory impact by comparison with the productive circumstances of other Member States."
"The olive growers of Spain, and especially Andalusia, receive less aid on average than all others, with an average penalisation of 33% over the entire period."
"This unfair state of affairs needs to be corrected for the future."
"The new COM in olive oil offers the Commission the opportunity to bring the national quota for Spain into line with the real productive circumstances of its olive sector, thus averting the consolidation of a discriminatory situation which would lead to major losses in budget terms for the oil-growing regions and areas for whose economy the sector is vital."
"Will the Commission undertake the necessary review and bring the financial arrangements for Spain into line with the real productive circumstances?"
". Mr President, let me point out, by way of introduction, that we will be discussing the issues raised in the last questions in the course of this evening’s debate on the reform of the olive oil, tobacco, cotton and hops sectors."
"Turning to the question itself, the general principle underlying last June’s reform of the common agricultural policy was that the funds per country would have to relate to the average aid granted in the course of the reference period."
"There is no reason why olive oil should be treated any differently."
"The Council of Ministers has already decided to deal with it in parallel to the June reform."
"Reviewing the national quotas at the present time would also be contrary to the thinking that prompted us to introduce them in 1998 and it therefore follows that the Member States are responsible for keeping increases in production under control."
"At that time, the national quotas were fixed at a level that subsequent studies have confirmed as corresponding to the sector’s structural dimension in the individual producer Member States at the time."
"As you are no doubt aware, Spain has a 43% share of the overall maximum, between its share of the number of olive trees cultivated – 39% – and its share in the area under olive groves, which was 44% in 1998."
"Looked at from that angle, what we are debating is very definitely a fair offer."
"Mr President, Commissioner, you know that the basis used for this reform contains out-of-date quotas with regard to Spain."
"You know that, in this regard, Spain is a specific case and that the studies carried out and all the surveys demonstrate that in reality Spanish production is greater than has traditionally been recognised."
"Spain has been penalised in terms of its production quotas, and this is clear."
"This situation must therefore be recognised because Spain is not the only Member State in it."
"Bearing in mind that, in reality, the new reform of the CAP represents a settlement of the previous stage – and when it is settled, it is done in accordance with the calculation of the ‘real realities’, and not the out-of-date realities – and bearing in mind that throughout this stage we are now settling, Spain has been penalised in comparative terms – and this can clearly be demonstrated – with a disparity with its real production and, Commissioner, reminding you also that the Spanish olive growers received you always in the great hope that you would appreciate their reality and potential in terms of health and environmental defence, I would ask you: will you not consider the possibility of our real production being reflected in the national budget?"
"We call for transparency and an adjusted quota."
". Mr President, I have to be quite frank in saying that I do not share Mrs Izquierdo Rojo’s view that Spain has been penalised, as there was a reform in 1998, in which absolute upper limits were agreed on, including by Spain."
"It cannot therefore be said after the event that Spain was penalised."
"Further to that, Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I also have to tell you that what you seek will ultimately add up to over a hundred million euros, no more and no less, being spent additionally on support for the Spanish sector to the exclusion of all others."
"The problem here is that I cannot, at one and the same time, do as I am required to do and keep this neutral in its effects on the budget while also acceding to your demand and getting another hundred million euros from somewhere."
"The fact is that they simply are not there."
"Mr President, the 1998 review created serious problems in both Spain and Greece, especially with the 419 000 tonne quota, when it was a known fact, on the basis of the data from the directorates of agriculture, that production in Greece totalled 600 000 tonnes and more. The quota of 419 000 tonnes created serious problems for small olive producers."
"As the Ministry of Agriculture, in an effort to manage this issue, reduced production, we had these results; as you know, we had continual demonstrations in Greece because this tiny quota did olive producers an injustice."
"So as far as the demand by my honourable friend from Spain is concerned, I think that the injustice is the same in Greece."
"That is why, Commissioner, these quotas need to be changed."
". I regret, Mr Patakis, that I have to correct you on this."
"This is very far from being the same situation as in Spain, nor is it very astute of you, as a Greek MEP, to argue along these lines, as, in 1998, when these things were laid down, Greece’s national guaranteed quota was – as you quite rightly said – 419.5 thousand tonnes, corresponding to 23.6% of the total for the EU."
"If you compare that with the number of trees that you have, which make up only 20% of the overall total, and with the surface in hectares, which amounts to only 18.8% of that in the EU, there would actually be justification for transferring part of your guaranteed amount to Spain, rather than in the direction in which you have called for it to go."
"Tonight, as the Commissioner has pointed out and as you know, there is an important debate on agriculture and you will have the opportunity to exchange points of view."
"As the author is not present, Question No 34 lapses."
"On 23 February 2004, the Commission adopted a package of amendments to Regulation (EC) 753/2002(2) which is allowing the use of specific traditional appellations by third countries."
"These include tawny, ruby, vintage and late bottled which are exclusive to port wine, and others traditionally used for Madeira wine and various regional varieties produced in Portugal."
"The amendments adopted by the Commission will most definitely have a negative impact on the production and marketing of all the wines in question, but the effects will be particularly bad in the case of port wine, both because of what it means to the economy of a huge part of the country the Douro region, where there are 33 000 wine-growers and, because of its significance in terms of revenue: it accounts for over two-thirds of wine exports, and some one-fifth of agro-food production."
"Furthermore, the trivialisation of appellations referring only to port wine, its standing and quality, could actually damage the wine’s very image at international level."
"Given that the Commission has perpetrated this error, does it not think it should now make good the harm it has done, and rescind its decision?"
"What guarantees can the Commission offer that the world image of port wine will not be affected, specifically in terms of its genuineness, reputation and the ease with which it can be identified by the consumer?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you are probably familiar with the traditional English appellations ‘ruby’, ‘vintage’, ‘tawny’ and ‘late bottled’, which, at Community level, are protected terms when applied to fortified quality wines produced in Portugal."
"To put it another way, these traditional appellations may be freely used with reference to other quality wines."
"In order, though, to be allowed to use these appellations, which are traditional in Portugal, a third country must comply with certain requirements and meet the following conditions:"
"Firstly, the appellation must be specific, in other words, it must be recognised as a label of quality."
"Secondly, the appellation must be characteristic or enjoy a certain reputation, that is to say, the average consumer must be able to recognise it as distinguishing between one wine and another."
"Thirdly, the appellation must be traditionally used within the territory of the third country in question."
"Fourthly, the rules laid down by the third country must not mislead the European consumer in the event of the wine from the third country appearing on a market within the European Community."
"The fifth condition is that the official language of the third country must be English, which it is in the case of South Africa, Australia and the USA."
"Where English is not the official language of the country in question, its use must be provided for in legislation and English must have been used for this traditional appellation for at least 25 years without interruption."
"As English is not the official language in such third countries as Argentina, Chile or Brazil, and the laws of these countries contain no such provision, these countries cannot use the traditional appellations on the EC market."
"In order to be allowed to use a traditional appellation in the EC, a third country must submit a dossier to the Commission, which will permit its use only if the various conditions I have enumerated are complied with."
"Consultation of the Member States is guaranteed by the involvement of the Management Committee in this procedure."
"Amending the Labelling Regulation will have no adverse effects on trade, as the traditional appellations for fortified wines are limited, whereas third countries generally export ordinary or unfortified wines."
"Commissioner, thank you for your explanations."
"You appear to believe, Commissioner, that designations of prestige are not simply arbitrary labels placed on bottles, but appellations of prestige matured by art, science and weather."
"You have just said, however, that these appellations can now be used by third countries provided that they fulfil a raft of criteria, a set of requirements that you have just listed for us."
"You even appear to believe that these requirements will protect us from adulteration, counterfeit and fraud."
"I, however, do not believe this, Commissioner!"
"This will open the floodgates for serious damage in future to a very large demarcated region, the first in the world, the Port Wines region, which alone accounts for one-fifth of Portugal’s agricultural exports."
"I am sorry that I cannot agree with you, Commissioner, but I am not sure that the requirements and guarantees that you have given us by means of this regulation will really protect the quality of these traditional appellations."
". Mr President, if I may again clarify this point, I fully agree with Mr Lage that these appellations are indicators of prestige and are of corresponding economic value in the marketing of these wines."
"That much is abundantly clear."
"On the other hand, though, we have to comply with certain rules; if we do not, we run the risk of being taken to the WTO and, if we lose the case, then this system of protection is in ruins."
"I do believe that the rules we have put in place are in any event sufficient to guarantee adequate protection."
"The risk of misuse or of counterfeits, to which you referred, is another issue."
"The new provisions do nothing to alter the risk of counterfeiting; it is always there, as the use of these prestigious names is always an attractive option."
"In order to address this risk, we have to ensure that appropriate controls are in place, and also that names such as these are not used by those not entitled to them, as happened frequently in the past."
"The main thing here is that cooperation with the import authorities should run smoothly, as these imports cannot just find their way across the border, but have to be declared."
"Given the Commission's recent statement concerning the mid-term review for the sugar regime, what is the Commission's response to the proposal from the ACP least-developed countries that a quota for their sugar exports to Europe be maintained at or near current prices?"
". Mr President, Mr Howitt, ladies and gentlemen, in the Commission Communication of 29 September last year, we put forward three possible options, one of which is based on a quota system."
"As a thorough impact analysis has shown that implementing the ‘Everything But Arms’ agreement with the help of an ordered system of rights to supply the market would have a similar effect to what is being done already, we decided instead to consider the ‘fixed quotas’ option as a variant of the status quo, so all the options continue to be open to discussion."
"I would also remind you, though, that the ‘Everything But Arms’ initiative is the part of the EC’s general preference system that envisages the complete liberalisation of sugar imports from the least developed countries by 2009."
"Until then, the sugar trade would normally continue on the same basis as trade in other agricultural produce."
"The least developed countries’reference to flexibility in terms of quantity and negotiated quantitative restrictions could raise questions about compatibility with WTO rules if they were to be seen as a sort of voluntary limitation of exports."
"As you will be able to gather from what I have said, we really will not, in our deliberations, lose sight of the situation of the least developed countries, and will be taking it very seriously."
"On 3 March, representatives and ministers from the least developed countries presented a new initiative in relation to our rules on the duty-free preferential access of their sugar to the Community market, and I discussed it with them."
"We will examine this proposal with great care, as we do all contributions to our preparations for the reform of the common market organisation for sugar."
"The initiative aims, over an extended period, to broaden the access that is at present limited."
"As we work on these proposals in preparation for their presentation this summer, we will take due account of all contributions received."
"I am grateful for that answer, Commissioner."
"In particular, I am glad that you have been listening to the representations of the least-developed countries and that all options remain on the table."
"I should like you to comment more specifically on their argument that the fall in price that is integral to two of the Commission's three options would 'make the EBA initiative meaningless for sugar."
"The Commission seems to prefer maintaining free access for the LDCs into a market with a price that is too low for them to compete, over that of negotiating with the LDCs an orderly market that achieves a price that allows them to compete and create development'."
"Commissioner, do you not see a parallel with that in the arguments from sugar beet growers in Europe, not least in the UK, who also call for an orderly market with, as they say, European price levels that would allow both domestic and developing country industries to invest for a sustainable future?"
"Given that the arguments are coming from both developing countries and developed countries within Europe, surely a higher sustained price with a managed reduction is the better course of action."
"Could you comment on that specific point, Commissioner?"
". Mr Howitt, you are, in theory, right to say that higher prices in Europe help to make exporting to Europe a more attractive prospect for poorer states."
"You must surely also be aware, though, that there are numerous reasons why the current price level is quite simply unsustainable."
"We really should not be deluding ourselves where our own sugar beet farmers or the developing world’s exporters are concerned."
"The current price on our internal market is something like three times higher than that on the international market and, whatever happens, we will, in the current WTO round, be obliged to reduce our external protection for sugar."
"That alone will be enough to bring the price down on the internal market; there is no other way of doing it."
"That is the problem facing us."
"To that we have to add other issues, such as how we can compensate for additional imports from the least developed countries merely by cutting back our own production, for sugar consumption in Europe is not going to increase."
"Nor must it be forgotten that sugar faces ever-tougher direct competition from other sweetening agents."
"No longer is there any sugar in Coca-Cola today – it contains isoglucose and nothing else."
"These sweeteners are also in direct competition with sugar."
"If, as the USA did a long time ago, we create a free market for them, quantities will increase accordingly."
"The result of all that is that, in the European Union, production will not decrease in the same way in every Member State; on the contrary, the simple fact of the matter will be that, in some of them, sugar production will quite simply no longer pay and so they will stop growing sugar beet."
"That is what we have to reckon with. I do not think it makes sense to arouse expectations that we can never satisfy."
"There is also the problem of having to consider how we help those developing countries that have traditionally been our sugar suppliers – Mauritius is one example – if they begin to see exporting sugar to Europe as a less attractive prospect than it was in the past."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, the poorest countries in the world – or so the media tell us – have asked to be allocated their own sugar import quotas."
"Will the Commission be prepared to include considerations such as these in the legislative proposals that it is due to present in the summer?"
"Secondly, when, in the course of this summer, can the Members of this House expect to see the actual Commission proposals?"
". Mr President, Mrs Schierhuber asked when the proposals may be expected."
"We have said all along that we intend to present them before the summer and that is still our intention."
"The only thing that could create problems is something I have not previously mentioned, namely that the EU is facing a panel in Geneva over the so-called C-quotas issue, and we need to know what can be expected from it."
"It follows that another factor we have to take into account is the timetable of the authorities in Geneva."
"Turning to Mrs Schierhuber’s other question, Europe is of course an attractive market and it follows that many states would be happy to export to it, but our view is that we need to have clear priorities in this area, and what these boil down to is that only the least developed states should have free access to the European market."
"As you will be aware, we have also devised special rules for the Balkan states."
"The ACP states are to have limited priority access with a clear preferential tariff, as will the other countries in so far as we have treaties with them."
"If we were to allow everyone to export sugar to Europe, we would not need an organised sugar market, but its wholesale liberalisation, which would, however, mean that at least two-thirds of European sugar production would have to be abandoned."
"As the time allotted to questions to Commissioner Fischler has elapsed, Questions Nos 37 and 38 will be replied to in writing(3)."
"A WHO study published in September 2000 established that, in France alone, atmospheric pollution is the cause each year of 31 700 deaths, 500 000 asthma attacks and 25 000 cases of bronchitis, and has an economic impact equal to 1.7% of GDP."
"Has the increasing threat posed to living conditions by pollution in an EU of 27 Member States, in terms of health and life expectancy, spurred the Commission to have an epidemiological study conducted to quantify in full the mortal impact (diseases and longevity) of the different types of pollution and their economic costs, notably in combination with the effects of global warming?"
"Do such vital threats to societies in an enlarged EU not make it an utmost and priority duty to conduct epidemiological research, disseminate the results of this on a scale commensurate with the issues at stake, raise awareness with regard to these issues and incorporate them as a background theme in all Community policies?"
". I would like to thank Mrs Isler Béguin for this question on a very important subject."
"The link between human health and the quality of our environment is indeed a top priority and we need to understand this link better in order to assess the effectiveness of existing policies and ensure that we address the problem adequately."
"In a global sense the links between environment and health are addressed in the communication on a European environmental and health strategy adopted by the Commission last year."
"In this communication we announced the establishment of a European environment and health monitoring and response system to link information on health effects, exposure to environmental contamination and the emissions responsible for contamination."
"Different parts of Europe are facing different problems."
"The environment and health strategy is therefore being developed for an enlarged Union, fully involving the new Member States from the outset."
"The Commission will now work on presenting an action plan setting out the programme for a first phase, focusing on selected priority diseases and pollutants at the Ministerial Conference on Environment and Health in Budapest on 23-25 June."
"We are also following the epidemiological work being carried out in the scientific community, and in particular working with the World Health Organisation and other experts to understand the results of research and promote further action."
"For example, under the quality of life and management of living resources programme, which is part of the Fifth Framework Programme for Research, a specific key action on environment and health provided support for 16 multidisciplinary multinational research projects devoted to air pollution."
"Such studies foster the development of protective measures and feed into the process of regulating pollutant emissions by revealing the causal links between pollutants and health effects and providing tools for measuring exposure and effects."
"The Commission's Joint Research Centre is also contributing to increasing our understanding of the link between environment and health in various ways."
"As far as air pollution is concerned, the framework for doing this will be the thematic strategy on air pollution, due to be adopted next year, which is currently in preparation through the Commission's Clean Air for Europe programme – 'CAFE'."
"This programme includes a very broad survey on the health effects of air pollution, the expected evolution of air quality between now and 2020, the effectiveness of existing policy and the potential for taking further cost-effective measures to reduce emissions."
"I wanted to thank Commissioner Wallström for her reply."
"I have no doubt that she is using all the means available to her to try to combat this scourge."
"Even so, it must be stated that the situation is very serious both in the European Union – the future enlarged Europe – and at world level."
"Let us also remember that it was difficult to accept this link between health and environment, and that has often been an excuse for doing nothing."
"Today, it seems to me – and this concerns me a great deal – that Members and the politicians responsible are still looking for excuses not to act and give the excessive cost of investing in the environment as an excuse."
"I am concerned, Commissioner, because it seems to me that we do not really have our finger on the pulse as regards the health situation in the enlarged Europe."
"Have you succeeded in integrating the health situation in Eastern countries and our health situation into EU policies?"
"Today, in fact, we no longer need to prove that there are links between health and the environment and similarly between poor health and a poor environment."
"Mr President, I am very pleased about this question, which gives me the opportunity to talk in a little more depth about our communication on the environment and health."
"This is one of the issues to which I give highest priority as Commissioner."
"I have to admit that it is also one of the most difficult issues of all, because it cuts through the divisions we normally see, in both the Commission and the Member States, into different subject areas and spheres of responsibility."
"It is necessary to work across all frontiers in order to link cause with effect, and that is not easy."
"Nor is it easy to put a price on the health problems consequent upon environmental pollution."
"I think that the World Health Organisation has nonetheless embarked upon a very important piece of work with a view to doing precisely that and to showing that society pays a very high price both for pollution and for health problems."
"Clearly, we must also tackle this issue together with the new Member States."
"Several of the conferences we have had in order to prepare our action plan have taken place in the new Member States."
"We are mobilising their experts so that there shall be no doubt that this is a pan-European way of working on these issues."
"We take these matters extremely seriously."
"We shall continue to maintain that the cost advantages are so great that it is, in actual fact, profitable for both companies and society to invest in environmental measures that also lead to our having fewer health problems."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I share Mrs Isler Béguin’s concern."
"Air contamination is indeed a crucial issue as far as people’s health is concerned, and an epidemiological investigation such as this is definitely needed."
"This would also lend much support to giving priority to science’s Sixth Framework Programme and improving the standard, quality and coverage of environmental research."
"In your reply you mentioned the Clean Air for Europe programme: CAFE."
"Will this programme concentrate just on the quality of the air outdoors and pollution, or could the investigation at the same time include a survey of the quality of the air indoors and especially passive smoking?"
"I am very worried that the investigation will restrict itself to the quality of the air outdoors and rather narrowly to the contamination of this type of air."
"Might one consider it applying to clean air in all its forms, including that to be found indoors?"
"Could passive smoking in particular come within the scope of the survey in this programme?"
". This is definitely part of our approach."
"There has to be a sound scientific base for any of the actions or measures we propose."
"We are working with the World Health Organisation to ensure that we have all the knowledge necessary and that we work on a scientific base."
"I should also explain that our environment and health strategy is called 'Scale', which stands for Science, Children, Awareness-raising, Legislation and Evaluation."
"This means that the action proposed will be based on scientific results. It will focus on children."
"We will also use legal instruments, etc. We include, where necessary, new epidemiological work, and we are trying to do everything we can to ensure that we have a sound basis and all the facts necessary to do it in a proper way."
"The Commission considers that the project for the Lada-Velilla power line, to cross the Redes national park and biosphere reserve, will not be carried out in its current form."
"Will the Commission ensure compulsory examination of a complete route for this power line which would go round the protected nature reserves forming part of the Natura 2000 network, safeguard the areas where bears live and hence respect Community legislation?"
"Has the Commission already received the environmental impact study which the Spanish authorities, at the meeting of 4 December, promised to forward before the end of January?"
"If not, does not the Commission consider that the matter should be referred to the Court of Justice (a reasoned opinion was issued in April 2003) so that central government and the Community of Castille and Leon, who are already confronting each other about this project in the Spanish courts, may finally reach agreement on finding a route for the power line which ensures respect for the environment?"
". The Lada-Velilla power line project mentioned by the honourable Member would cross protected areas in the autonomous communities of Asturias and Castille and Leon."
"In 2001, following a complaint filed in August 2000, the Commission initiated an infringement procedure pursuant to Article 226 of the EC Treaty."
"This procedure, based upon obligations under Directive 79/409/EEC on the protection of wild birds and Directive 92/43/EEC on the protection of natural habitats and wild fauna and flora, reached the stage of reasoned opinion – the last step before bringing the case before the European Court of Justice – in April 2003."
"Currently, the procedure is aimed at modifying the non-implemented part of the project in the autonomous community of Castille and Leon."
"In their answer to the above-mentioned reasoned opinion issued by the Commission, the Spanish authorities undertook to examine alternatives for the remaining part of the project – Puerto de Tarna to Velilla – and confirmed in February 2004 that the necessary studies to comply with the requirements of Article 6(3) of Directive 92/43/EEC will start soon."
"These include a full environmental assessment in order properly to identify the effects of the projects on the conservation values of the affected site; if these are considered significant, alternatives will have to be examined."
"If no alternative can be identified that is not damaging to the site, the project can only proceed if it can be justified on the grounds of overriding public interest and if provision is made for adequate compensation measures."
"In the event of significant effects on priority species identified under the directive, such as the brown bear, an opinion from the Commission may be needed pursuant to Article 6(4) of the directive."
"The Spanish authorities explain that the necessary nature assessments will not be ready for ten months and that the resulting modified project will be subject to a full impact assessment procedure, in compliance with the provisions of Directive 85/337/EEC on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment."
"The authorities submitted to the Commission, as supplementary information, a complete set of documents and studies concerning the original project and its likely effects on natural values."
"An examination of the details of the above-mentioned Spanish answers is currently underway, which will permit the Commission to decide what course of action it should take in regard to this case."
"With regard to the last part of your question, the Commission would welcome and encourage a fruitful dialogue between the interested parties in order to reach an agreed solution, but it cannot interfere in the constitutional competences of the various administrations."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the population is concerned about the Spanish Government’s lack of transparency and also about the lack of reliable information from this Commission, which says one thing and then reforms and does another."
"I am just going to focus on three questions: will the Commission continue the infringement procedure rather than closing the case, as the Spanish authorities hope with its promise to modify just 30 km of the 90 km route planned, arguing that it is a new project?"
"Will the Commission consult the Court of Justice of the European Communities at the next infringement meeting without further delay, if there are no new elements a year after the notification of the reasoned opinion and after four years of investigation of this infringement case?"
"If the regions of Asturias and Castilla y León present it with a new project which respects all natural areas and which conform to Community legislation, would the Commission be prepared to cofinance such a project, in order to prevent the economic losses which the region of Asturias could face by dismantling the existing pylons?"
". The case in question concerns the part of the project that will not now be implemented."
"That part of the project will be replaced by a new one once the full procedure of identifying impacts and exploring alternatives has been completed."
"That means that it would, in any case, be a new project and that the old procedure may have to be discontinued."
"In that case, should the Commission consider that the new project does not comply with European Community law, a new procedure would be initiated afresh."
"The Spanish authorities provided information on these developments in February 2004."
"The infringement covers only the non-implemented part of the project."
"We cannot take that case to court as it stands."
"As the author is not present, Question No 41 lapses."
"Is the Commission aware of any Member State other than Ireland which has decided to discontinue the release of letters of formal notice or reasoned opinions from the European Commission?"
"Given this decision, will the Commission itself release these documents on request?"
"If not, why not?"
"And if only under certain circumstances, what might these be?"
"Of particular concern to environmental groups in Ireland are the many cases where the Commission has determined in its reasoned opinion that directives have been infringed but has not taken any subsequent legal action."
"The details of the infringements are in these cases no longer part of a potential judicial process, wherefore they are not in need of confidential treatment."
"By releasing reasoned opinions, in particular when no subsequent legal action is taken, the Commission would ensure that citizens know that European law has been infringed, which in turn would help to reduce infringements in the future."
". It appears that a number of Member States refuse to give the public access to the Commission's letters of formal notice and reasoned opinions."
"In the recent past the Irish authorities were willing to provide the public with copies of reasoned opinions on request, but the Commission understands that they are no longer willing to do so."
"I would like to mention that, as far as possible, the Commission strives to be transparent with regard to its infringement procedures."
"That is why it issues regular press releases on them in order to provide citizens with information on the main issues involved."
"When it comes to public access to the actual texts of letters of formal notice and reasoned opinions, certain rules agreed by the Council and Parliament need to be respected."
"These are set out in Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents."
"One of these rules provides that the institutions shall refuse access to documents where disclosure would undermine the protection of the purpose of inspections, investigations and audits, unless there is an overriding public interest in disclosure."
"Indeed, the Court has held in the Petrie judgment that, in the investigation of infringements, sincere cooperation and a climate of mutual confidence between the Commission and the Member State concerned are required in order to allow both parties to engage in a process of negotiation in the search for a settlement of a dispute."
"The safeguarding of this objective justifies refusing access to detailed arguments and representations."
"That is why the Commission itself usually cannot give public access to its letters of formal notice and reasoned opinions when the infringement procedure is ongoing."
"However, when none of the exceptions to the regulation apply, the Commission may provide copies of letters of formal notice and reasoned opinions. This can be the case in particular where the infringement has been resolved, the infringement procedure has been closed and there is no longer any likelihood that an investigation would be undermined."
"I take it from the Commissioner's response that basically, if letters of formal notice have been sent out and no subsequent legal action has been taken, citizens in Ireland who want copies of letters sent to the Irish Government can in fact get them."
"That is my interpretation of what you have said, Commissioner."
"In relation to ongoing legal action, I cannot understand who the Commission is trying to protect."
"If the Commission is taking legal action against Member States it would seem that the interests or the protection of Member States are given priority by the Commission and that we basically end up with a situation where citizens throughout the European Union are going to be accusing the Commission of being extremely secretive and protecting the interests of the Member States."
"If you have taken legal action against a Member State, surely the only thing you should be concerned about is any kind of information that would prejudice your case against the Member State?"
"In relation to access to documents, you are making an extremely restrictive interpretation of the regulation."
"In relation to the public interest, surely in many of these cases the public interest should take priority?"
"I do not understand why the Commission is playing into the hands of the Member States. By doing this, the Commission is encouraging a culture of secrecy where Member States are not providing the information."
"This is going to have a knock-on effect, even in countries such as Sweden which have a tradition of much more openness."
". I want to make it absolutely clear that the Commission, along with Parliament and the Council, ought to send a signal to citizens all over an enlarged Europe that openness and transparency are what we are actively fighting for and that we want to implement them in such a way that citizens are provided with full information."
"The rules in question have also been agreed so that we have decision-making processes through which we can solve problems, and which allow us to deal with cases in a dignified way for both parties."
"The Commission may disclose copies of the letters of formal notice and recent opinions when none of the exceptions to the regulations I mentioned apply – i.e. when the infringement procedure has been closed and there is no longer any likelihood that the investigation could be undermined."
"Many of the details are exchanged between the Commission and the Member State, but there is a fear that if these were in the public domain they could be used or misused in such a way that would undermine the whole procedure."
"In general, I agree that we should strive for maximum transparency in these processes."
"It helps when Member States and the Commission are able to agree."
"The Commission also tries, when opening an infringement case, to disclose or give the reasons why it has opened that case against a Member State."
"We do not want to disclose all the details of a case, but rather to give the public an idea of what it is about."
"I must admit I still fail to see how disclosure can really undermine the cases here, but my supplementary is about which Member States actually continue to give out the information on such letters of formal notice and which do not."
"Ireland used to have a more open policy than it has now."
"Could you please clarify, Commissioner, what the situation is at the moment as far as the other Member States are concerned?"
". I wish I could give you the full list immediately, but we think that the Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands would do it, and most of the others would not."
"That is the situation right now, although I may have missed out one or two Member States."
"A report issued by the UN on 11 December last on Climate Change and Human Health says that climate change is affecting human health, that it is responsible for 2.4% of the world's cases of diarrhoea, 2% of all malaria cases in 2000 and that it caused 150 000 deaths world-wide in 2000."
"The UN study adds that it is influencing weather patterns and air pollution and is causing water and food contamination."
"How does the Commission propose to react to the guidelines issued by the UN in response to these serious problems?"
". I appreciate that the World Health Organization is now raising awareness as regards climate-change impacts on human health, in a cooperative effort with the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Meteorological Organization."
"The Commission can support the general recommendations and conclusions of this World Health Organization report on climate change and human health because, for instance, it focuses on the precautionary principle and the principle of sustainable development."
"Within the Commission we are taking this carefully into consideration in the formulation of our policies."
"The largest benefits of climate policies for human health can be expected from the reduction in the concentrations of ozone and particles."
"As climate policies in general reduce fossil fuel use, they also reduce related particulate emissions."
"Additional health benefits can be gained by reducing urban concentrations of NO2 and SO2."
"Thus, emissions-control strategies that simultaneously address air pollutants and greenhouse gases lead to a more efficient use of resources at all scales, also addressing human health concerns."
"The World Health Organization report confirms earlier statements that there are still many knowledge gaps involving likely future patterns of exposure to climatic environmental changes and the vulnerability and adaptability of physical, ecological and social systems as regards such climate change."
"Therefore, we need better information to establish further the links between the pollutants and health effects, with a view to improving our climate change and health policies."
"The action plan on which we are presently working as a follow-up to the environment and health strategy is designed to integrate this information."
"While the action plan focuses on a set of defined exposures and diseases in its first phase, broader issues, including those related to the health impacts of climate change, can be taken up in future phases."
"Moreover, the forthcoming thematic strategic on the urban environment, to be adopted by June 2005, and for which an interim communication is presently under discussion within the Commission, should also help local authorities and Member States to improve the environmental performance of cities."
"This in turn would also contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and make cities healthier places to live."
"We are also considering some projects under the Sixth Research Framework Programme."
"Within the activities of scientific support to policies of the Sixth Framework Programme, research is also funded on the physical and chemical processes of air pollutants, in particular on particulate matter at the urban to regional scales, in view of their impact on human health."
"Under the last Research Framework Programme, the cCASHh project – Climate Change and Adaptation Strategies for Human Health in Europe – was funded to assess the health impacts of climate change."
"I wish to thank Commissioner Wallström for her detailed, informative reply and to assure her that I am aware of the serious concern with which she has always treated this matter."
"Indeed, in her reply, she referred to the action plan, the climate strategy and the Sixth Framework Programme."
"I should like to compliment her on her interest in pursuing the whole matter."
"I hope that the situation will continue to be monitored and will continue to improve."
"This issue is one of major international concern, but I know that it could not be in better hands that those of the Commissioner."
"I would remind the honourable Members that we must ask questions as Members of Parliament."
"There is no need to support the work of the Commissioners so much."
"This is Question Time."
"I understand that tens of thousands of endangered animals have been shot by European hunters and imported into the EU in the past five years."
"Is the Commission proposing legislation to ban the import of any CITES- listed species into the EU?"
". The European Community regulates hunting trophy imports through Council Regulation (EC) No 338/97 on the protection of species of wild fauna and flora by regulating trade therein, and the associated Commission Regulation (EC) No 1808/2001, which sets out more detailed rules."
"The objective of these regulations is to protect species of wild fauna and flora and to guarantee their conservation by regulating trade therein."
"In line with this objective, they have strict criteria for accepting hunting trophy imports."
"To begin with, import permits are required for any species listed in Annex A of the Council regulation and these include all species listed on Appendix 1 of CITES - (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), such as leopard, cheetah and elephant, and a number of other popular trophy species such as brown bear, lynx and wolf."
"Before granting these permits the authorities in the relevant Member State must obtain scientific advice that the management of the trophy hunt in the country concerned is based on sound biological data, that harvest levels are sustainable and that illegal activities are under control."
"There is one further requirement to which I shall especially draw your attention."
"Trophy hunting of these species must generate significant and tangible conservation benefits for the species and for the local people who share the area with or suffer as a result of the species concerned."
"Trophy hunting programmes that meet this criterion can play a vital role in conserving rare species, especially in developing countries and in encouraging local communities to value them as a resource that needs protection from other more damaging uses."
"I am aware that in a number of countries, including Namibia, South Africa, Botswana and Tanzania, carefully managed trophy hunting provides a major contribution to their relatively successful conservation efforts."
"While many people find the concept of hunting trophies distasteful under any circumstances, the Commission considers that a general ban on the import on any CITES-listed species would not be in the best interest of species conservation and the sustainable use of resources."
"However, in cases where the criteria for accepting hunting trophies are not met, the Commission has always taken, and will continue to take, the appropriate measures to suspend such trade."
"I am alarmed to hear the Commissioner's conclusions because it certainly does not seem that the trophy hunting to which I referred is being done with the aim of conservation at all."
"I logged on to a website this afternoon, which would have given me the opportunity to go to Tanzania."
"It offers the 'discerning sportsman' the ultimate hunting experience: large buffalo, lion, water buck, very rare East African sitatunga, leopards, antelopes, etc."
"My information is that in the last six years British people have been abroad and shot at least 40 African elephants, 32 leopards, 18 polar bears, six hippos – I could go on."
"Worldwide, this is something like over 3 800 African elephants, over 2 600 rare leopards and 9 000 bears."
"These are not being slaughtered in the interests of conservation, or with any reference to conversation in the areas."
"It is trophy hunting: people who go out and shoot big game and come home proudly but sickeningly with a trophy of the head of a rare animal."
"Would the Commissioner think again, and would she agree to meet me to go through some of these statistics, to see some of the evidence and to put in place a ban on the import of CITES-listed animals into the European Union?"
". How could I refuse a meeting with a Member of the European Parliament?"
"I would be happy to meet with you; we could go through my reply, the Commission's position on this matter and the criteria that I explained to you."
"We do not accept all types of trophy hunting. We certainly do not accept the subsequent selling of such 'trophies'."
"We have every reason to meet and go through the current situation."
"It is also true that, done in the proper way, this can be a very important area of conservation in some of the countries concerned."
"Those countries may get something out of this that means they will be better able to manage these resources and wild animals – we also have some good examples of that."
"I am fully aware of the reports we have received and also of some very worrying trends, so I am more than happy to meet."
"I also welcome nice comments from Members of Parliament!"
"It beggars belief that, in a so-called civilised society in the 21st century, there is still trophy hunting."
"It is horrific!"
"It goes back to colonial times when the British came back from the colonised countries and hung their trophies on the wall."
"We should have got past this stage."
"It is ridiculous."
"I agree with Mr Evans about CITES-listed species."
"There should be a ban on them."
"It is not acceptable."
"Apart from that, it is clear that there are illegal imports of trophies into the European Union; surely there must be some way of ensuring that this does not happen."
"The European Union puts huge resources and effort into keeping out so-called illegal immigrants, yet it cannot stop the illegal import of trophies."
"We should get our priorities right."
"Let people in, not these trophies."
". I am the first to agree that this is all about how it is being done and that we should not allow something that is illegal."
"We have to pursue the culprits in this area."
"We must implement the rules that are in place."
"As I said, import permits are required for any of the species listed in our annexes to the Council regulation."
"These correspond to the CITES listing as well."
"We need to make sure that we have a judicial procedure and that we counteract illegal imports."
"– Commissioner Wallström knows full well that hunting raises a lot of passion in France, but I do not want to catch her off guard."
"I would like to ask an additional question about hunting as it is currently practised in the future Member States, the Eastern countries."
"Are you aware that hunters from the West, from the Fifteen, go in great numbers to hunt in these countries, because the fauna is still very interesting and there are still major trophies – bears and wolves – to bring back?"
"In terms of the Community and the implementation of Natura 2000, do you not think that Western hunters are damaging the wild fauna there, before its time, in search of trophies?"
"The rules are such that the new Member States must already have implemented the nature protection directivesbeforethey join the EU."
"It is therefore incredibly important to follow matters up and ensure that this happens, so that no hunting takes place that infringes the existing directives designed to protect wild birds, animals and various other creatures."
"As the time allocated to Question Time is at an end, Questions Nos 45 to 66 will be answered in writing (4)."
"That concludes Question Time to the Commission."
"In reality, limit values would have to be accompanied either by exemptions for certain areas or by provisions allowing Member States to apply for derogations in cases where the limit values cannot be met. The proposed amendments envisaged the latter solution, but either way we can be sure that derogations will be granted in precisely the areas where the problems occur."
"On the other hand, the Commission could accept the reintroduction of the concept of upper and lower assessment thresholds foreseen in the framework directive, which is the subject of six of the amendments tabled. Although this concept is usually linked with the limit values, the concept has some advantages, even in the absence of limit values, since it provides a flexible regime where the degree of monitoring requirements depends on the level of observed concentrations."
"As I said earlier, I am glad that the decision has been taken to postpone the vote to allow time to explore further alternative possibilities. I very much hope that, as a result, we will be able to move quickly towards an agreement on this important subject."
"Thank you, Mrs Wallström."
"As you know, the vote has been deferred to a later sitting."
"The debate is closed."
"Mr President, I will not repeat myself over tobacco, but I find it difficult to believe that Commissioner Fischler thinks that the Commission’s proposal on tobacco is dictated by health reasons."
"It is difficult to think this, and not to think instead that 500 000 jobs are being put in jeopardy in Europe."
"If there really were a link between the prevalence of smoking and the reduction or elimination of tobacco production, I would be the first in this Chamber to support the Commission’s proposal."
"There is no link, though."
"By adopting the proposal we would only be harming the citizens of the Union and the tobacco producers without making a real contribution to the fight against smoking."
"I would therefore call on the Commission to take into account this position, put forward by many quarters in this Chamber, both by political parties and by individual MEPs."
"I am obviously expressing my personal opinion, but I believe that it is widely shared in Parliament, something which we will be able to verify tomorrow in the vote."
"With regard to the proposal on olive oil, however, I can say that the approach of the Commission’s proposal is fairly acceptable."
"The need for transparency, attention to the quality, environmental and social value of this product are considered in the Commission’s proposal and have been re-examined further in the opinion issued by Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"The choice to make the decoupling percentage flexible, the possibility that the national States will have, I hope, to modify these percentages, is a positive process of osmosis between the rigid rules of the Commission and the choices of the Member States, an intelligent decision which will allow the national governments to adopt the most appropriate options for the regions."
"The question of combating the mixing of oils remains unchanged and well-founded, in order to guarantee transparency and consumer protection, the fight against fraud, the scaling down of inward processing and the attainment of labelling which states and really enhances the place of production and not of processing."
"I would just call on Commissioner Fischler to see that, following the vote in the Council, with Parliament’s opinion, the regulations which are adopted are consistent with the decisions, something which unfortunately we have not seen in the past."
"Mr President, in line with the basic principles for reforming the CAP, which was approved last June, common rules have been established for systems of direct aid for farmers."
"This proposal for a regulation consequently enshrines these principles for the olive oil, tobacco and cotton sectors and the proposal is examined by our fellow Member, Joseph Daul, whom I wish to congratulate on his work."
"I shall focus, however, on the consequences of this proposal for Portugal."
"As regards olive oil, the Commission appears to be unaware of the planting of 30 000 hectares of new olive groves with the right to production aid that the Council authorised in 1998."
"In fact, Portugal has drawn up a programme for planting these 30 000 hectares, which will take place from 2000 to 2006, and its implementation will run as set out in the programme."
"This proposal for a revision that the Commission has submitted, however, has destroyed this programme along with the expectations created for producers."
"As regards tobacco, the Commission proposal to totally decouple aid will cause farmers to swiftly abandon this crop in Portugal."
"This abandoning of production will have extremely damaging effects not only on employment in farming but also on the processing industry."
"With regard to cotton, a sector which has expanded substantially in recent years, the Commission proposal penalises production by around 30% which, when taken together with the inadequacy of production-related aid, makes this crop rather unattractive and provides few opportunities to reconvert it."
"Mr President, we are once again faced with a Commission proposal that fails to take account either of the specific characteristics of Portuguese farming and indeed of other regional forms of farming, or of the risks that farmers will desert farming altogether or of the unemployment-related social problems that go hand in hand with this process."
"This is once again unfairly penalising the income of our farmers and we cannot ..."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to cotton and tobacco, I am bound to begin with a reference to these proposals by the Commission. A quick reaction to them would be that their objective is simply to ensure cultivation of both these crops is discontinued."
"The implication seems to be that the whole sector is expendable, along with the thousands of agricultural workers involved who reside in the most disadvantaged areas of southern Europe. In addition, the fact that in the Acts of Accession of Spain and Greece the Member States undertook to protect cotton production in those two countries has been completely disregarded."
"Due to the penalties imposed pursuant to the 2001 cotton reform, the area under cotton in Spain has already suffered a 20% reduction."
"Further, it does not make sense to use cotton as a bargaining counter in WTO negotiations with third countries, as the Commission would like to do."
"After all, the European Union only accounts for 2.5% of world production."
"In addition, at global level exports are dominated by the United States, whereas the Union accounts for a mere 1.5%. This is not therefore a valid argument for reducing aid to cotton."
"The proposals for both cotton and tobacco will also cause serious large-scale damage to the entire socio-economic structure based on these crops. I can provide some specific instances drawn from Spain."
"Five thousand of its 10 000 inhabitants are employed in the tobacco industry. The livelihoods of over 20 000 families depend on tobacco in Extremadura alone."
"It has to be said that the report adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development does substantially reduce the level of decoupling of aid proposed by the European Commission. It goes some way towards lifting the threat to the survival of the crops."
"It is vitally important for the House to support this report. That will send a clear message to the Council of Ministers, namely that Parliament is in favour of retaining these particular sectors that generate so many jobs in disadvantaged areas."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the preparation of the European Council in Brussels, 25 and 26 March 2004 – follow up to the IGC."
". – Mr President, I am very happy to address you today in relation to the preparations for the Spring European Council and the IGC follow-up."
"As you will be aware from our detailed discussions on the Lisbon strategy at the last part-session, the Irish presidency is determined that the primary focus of the Spring European Council should be, as set out at Lisbon and Gothenburg, the follow-up to the Lisbon strategy with a strong emphasis on implementation and the need to target specific areas for concerted action by the Union."
"The future financial perspectives and current issues on the international agenda will also be addressed."
"The presidency has consistently reiterated the need for the Spring European Council to give a strong signal as to the continued importance of the Lisbon strategy in providing a framework for simultaneous progress on economic, social and environmental renewal throughout the Union."
"When I addressed Parliament last month, I outlined the issues on which we intend to focus at the Spring European Council on 25 and 26 March."
"I am pleased that Member States share our conviction that the agenda for the European Council should remain focused, and have given broad support for our approach of concentrating on a limited number of key issues."
"Similarly, Member States have also agreed that the overreaching priorities for the Council should be those of sustainable growth and employment as identified by us in the first draft of the annotated agenda issued on 17 February."
"The Commission communication on the future financial perspectives – 'Building our Common Future' – was launched here on 10 February by Commission President Prodi."
"The presidency’s approach, which has been agreed by Member States, is that while no discussion is expected, the Spring European Council should agree conclusions on the procedure to be followed in considering the dossier over the coming months."
"The Taoiseach will present the Irish presidency’s report on where matters stand in the Intergovernmental Conference."
"It is intended that this will be discussed over dinner on the first evening by the Heads of State and Government."
"It is the presidency’s intention to invite representatives of observers at the IGC, including the President of the European Parliament, to be present."
"On the basis of our report and following discussions at the dinner, it will then be for the European Council to decide how best to proceed, and in particular whether the time is ripe for the IGC to be re-convened."
"I hope you will understand that it is not appropriate for me at this time to go into any detail on what that report will contain."
"We have still not definitively concluded our analysis of the situation."
"Consultations and contacts are ongoing. The Taoiseach owes it to his colleagues to present matters to them in a very direct manner."
"However, I would offer the following observations."
"In keeping with our mandate from Brussels in December, the Irish presidency has consulted widely among participants in the IGC, including the European Parliament. The Taoiseach has spoken with all other members of the European Council."
"Intensive and detailed discussions have also taken place at ministerial and official levels."
"Partners have agreed with us in good faith and in a positive and constructive way."
"As a result, we have a deeper appreciation of the concerns of all involved."
"We also have a greater understanding of where scope for compromise and possible agreements might lie."
"We have had very useful and detailed discussions with Parliament’s representatives Mr Hänsch and Mr Brok."
"They have made clear to us Parliament’s general approach to the IGC, and its priorities in the negotiations."
"We very much appreciated the constructive and frank way they have dealt with us."
"More generally, Parliament’s strong support for our efforts is greatly appreciated."
"In particular, you have tried to keep us and partners focused on the big picture, on the immense prize which adoption of the Constitution would represent, and on the very significant and considerable dangers for our Union which would flow from a continued stalemate."
"In our consultations, we have confirmed that there is a range of outstanding institutional and non-institutional issues, of varying complexity and sensitivity, which have been raised with us."
"Most of these were identified by the Italian presidency in the paper published ahead of the meeting of the European Council in December, though others are also on the table."
"We have gone through all of these questions carefully and in some significant detail."
"While there has been particular public focus on the institutional side of things, I can assure Parliament that our discussions with partners are not limited to those aspects of the draft Constitutional Treaty."
"Our broad sense is that, while there are a reasonable number of outstanding issues, on the great majority it will be relatively easy to find consensus in the context of a process leading to an overall conclusion."
"Moreover, we have ascertained that there are many other issues, including some of considerable importance, on which there is effectively already agreement – although formally nothing is agreed until everything is agreed."
"Of course, the great bulk of the Convention’s text has not been called into question at any stage of the IGC, and I am glad to say that very much remains the case."
"I cannot say today whether it will be possible for the IGC to conclude its work during the Irish presidency."
"I can say this, however. If it were a matter for the Irish presidency we would resolve it."
"We have made it clear to this Parliament and we have made it clear in many statements that we are anxious and ambitious to achieve a resolution."
"It is also, however, very important to put it on the record that 25 Member States and 25 governments have a responsibility in this matter: it does not come down to the presidency."
"Whether it is decided to convene a further meeting of the IGC in the near future is very much a matter of judgment for the European Council."
"However, I can say, and I have said it several times, that if political will is present, it will be easy to find a solution to the outstanding issues."
"The key to early agreement is political willingness to agree."
"It is now over two years since the European Convention began its work."
"The issues have been debated intensively and extensively."
"At this point, I do not believe that outstanding differences will become easier to resolve over time."
"I have said this on several occasions in the last week or two: the difficulties that exist today will be more difficult in the future."
"In the second half of this year it will not be any easier to resolve the issues."
"There is a whole series of other issues that will make it more complex."
"Parliament will change, the Commission will change, the political players will change and it would be unwise to take the view that we have time on our side."
"There are important issues to be considered in the second half of this year."
"It is my strong belief that these are all better considered independently of each other and that is another reason why we should go for the earliest possible solution, because if the issues come together it will make resolution more difficult."
"I continue to believe that the new Constitution is profoundly in the interests of the Union and its citizens."
"It is a quantum leap forward in terms of clarity and accessibility."
"It will provide the Union with a solid foundation for its future growth and its future development."
"It will enable the Union to respond more effectively to the concerns of citizens and to play a more dynamic role in the wider world."
"In a sense it is a prize well worth striving for."
"If there is a will to compromise – and let there be no doubt that without some compromise on all sides there will be no agreement – then I believe it should be possible to move things forward rapidly."
"As we have said before, if there is a serious possibility of progress, the Irish presidency will immediately move to seize that possibility."
". – Mr President, I regret the unavoidable absence of President Prodi but, as you know, he has official obligations elsewhere."
"The Commission welcomes the opportunity provided by the discussion this morning to draw attention to the importance of a satisfactory agreement on the proposed constitution."
"Obviously, the analysis made at Laeken still holds good and the enlarged Union still needs reform in order to ensure that it can work in the public interest with higher standards of efficiency and with greater democracy and transparency."
"This is plainly unfinished business, and, equally plainly, it must be tackled with determination."
"In the unique association of democracies that makes up the European Union careful deliberation is always necessary but no constructive interests are really served by prolonged stalemate."
"That is why the Commission fully supports the approach taken by the Irish presidency."
"Minister Roche's report is clear."
"The Commission is convinced that the presidency has done, and is still doing, exactly what is necessary."
"After the breakdown of the Brussels European Council, the only realistic course was to proceed in the way followed by the Irish presidency and to sound out the prospect for progress through bilateral consultations."
"It is an arduous course and no doubt Mr Roche and his colleagues have the air miles to prove it."
"However, our Irish colleagues have a true talent for promoting understanding – except, of course, where English rugby is concerned – and we hope that their diligent efforts will bear fruit and that the presidency report to the European Council will be able to conclude that all delegations are disposed to sign the constitutional treaty before the European elections."
"Such progress will require some willingness to revise original negotiating positions, but the Commission continues to believe that such developments are feasible and that the conclusion of a constitutional treaty can be achieved under the present presidency."
"As Mr Roche said on this issue – it is not always true in politics but it is in this case – time will not change the basics or make a resolution easier."
"One of the factors which propels such a view is recognition of the reality that, if the IGC was not satisfactorily concluded this year, the prospects for establishing a constitution for the Union will begin to appear remote."
"The momentum provided by the Convention will then manifestly continue to diminish and, in the very nature of politics, debate about the Treaty will become entangled with other controversies, such as those which naturally and inevitably will, for instance, be associated with the financial perspectives."
"No democrat could, or would, fear the prospect of multiple debates, but clarity and rigour in all discussions would obviously be served best by ensuring that each salient issue is tackled on its own terms and merits."
"Meanwhile, the rational desire to conclude the IGC successfully and with reasonable dispatch should not deflect us from the course which Parliament and the Commission have followed on the content of the constitution."
"I am sure that the Commission reflects the majority opinion in this House by emphasising that the text drafted by the Convention should not be diluted."
"We have all heard the maxim 'better no constitution than a bad constitution' and no sensible person could possibly disagree with that."
"But those can hardly be considered to be the sole true alternatives."
"The risk is surely not a bad constitution, since it is highly unlikely that the IGC would agree to something that was noxious or ineffectual."
"The real risk is rather that the Convention draft becomes amended to the point where, cumulatively, almost accidentally, the ambition and the attractiveness of the constitution dwindles and the singular opportunity of clarifying and developing the Union provided by drafting a constitution slips away."
"The representatives and, more importantly, the people of the European Union would then inherit problems rather than answers."
"That is why the basis for the constitution should continue to be the text presented by the Convention."
"Obviously, on some points, improvement is possible."
"For instance, debates in the months before the Brussels European Council showed that the fact that a proposed change attracts widespread support from Member States does not necessarily make it a move in the wrong direction, as some seemed to contend at the time."
"Meanwhile, in the Commission – and, I emphasise, explicitly in the interests of the Union – we were glad to note that most, if not all, delegations realised that making a distinction between voting and non-voting Commissioners would simply not work."
"We trust, therefore, that no variations on that impractical and divisive theme will reappear."
"Naturally, Parliament, the Council, the Commission and everyone else has to continue to exercise care."
"For instance, the Italian presidency has helpfully made it clear that some of the texts circulating in the final hours of the December European Council – which some regarded as presidency compromises – have no formal status."
"Most of those suggestions would, as it happens, have been unacceptable to either the Commission or Parliament or, indeed, both."
"We are certain that the Irish presidency will, characteristically, show its own constructive sensitivity, regardless of the hour of the day or of the night."
"The House is fully aware of the controversial issues that remain."
"The Commission has made it clear on many occasions that it holds the view that the compromise reached in the Convention on the 'double-hatted' status of an EU foreign affairs representative should not be changed, that the enhanced budget powers of the European Parliament should not be altered, that the scope of qualified majority voting should not be reduced."
"The Commission has also made clear its opinion, particularly when we are only weeks away from a European Union with 25 Member States, the practical case for an extension of qualified majority voting is stronger than ever."
"On that particular point, the House will know that the Commission considers that the double-majority proposal of the Convention is the best approach for the definition of QMV."
"That also reflects practicality and proportionality."
"It is clear that full and necessary articulation of arguments will ensure that decision-making in the enlarged Union is never easy."
"To make effective agreement on necessary decisions even harder by fixing a QMV threshold which is so high that the focus is on forming blocking minorities rather than on reaching consensus would, however, be a formula for and the Union as a whole could not benefit from that."
"The Commission's view continues to be that a double majority of 50% of the Member States representing 50% of the population would be both clear and balanced."
"However, the Commission accepted the Convention's compromise of 50% of Member States and 60% of population, although, I have to say, the Commission still believes that a 50% and 55% formulation would fit the purpose of effective decision-making still better."
"Whatever compromise is eventually reached, it is obvious that no one should forget that the draft constitution will need approval and ratification through the democratic processes of 25 Member States."
"An arrangement that increases complexity and intensifies the difficulties of making the enlarged European Union work well would hardly be likely to attract understanding or support in either parliaments or plebiscites."
"We are certain that the Presidency, the majority in this Parliament, and a wide spectrum of governmental and public opinion understands that."
"We wish the Irish presidency well in its sustained efforts in the interests of a modern Union and its citizens."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin with a few words to the President-in-Office on behalf of my group to express our sincere appreciation and admiration of the way in which the Irish Government is conducting its presidency of the Council."
"It is working with goodwill, a strong sense of purpose, discretion and efficiency."
"I believe this is a good example of the way in which even our less populous countries can achieve major political progress."
"Mr President-in-Office, I emphatically welcome your statement that, if it were a matter for the Irish presidency, you would bring the Intergovernmental Conference to a successful conclusion during your tenure."
"This confirms our impression that your presidency is giving of its best."
"Let me say on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats that we warmly welcome the fact that things have started to move and that this movement extends to unresolved issues, particularly that of the double majority."
"For my own part, I have always urged the Government of Germany to be flexible and move forward."
"Since this is now happening, I must clearly acknowledge it."
"But these efforts by the German Government must be accompanied by similar efforts on the part of other governments."
"This is not the time or place to be apportioning blame for mistakes or for obstructive rigidity; the time has come for all governments to make compromises, and we call on them to do so."
"The stakes are high; the President of the Council spoke of dangers – that is how his words were translated into my language – and so it is important that we remind ourselves again of what we seek to achieve through this constitution."
"Our European values are described in the preamble, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The functions and responsibilities of the European Parliament are described in the draft constitution."
"Its provisions represent a huge leap forward for the European Parliament, democracy and parliamentarianism in Europe."
"The legislative activity of the Council of Ministers is to become more transparent, even though we will not get the legislative council we have asked for."
"Under the Convention’s proposals, the Commission will be appointed in such a way, with the President of the Commission being proposed by the Heads of State or Government, that its composition will reflect the results of the European elections."
"This is truly great progress, because it would enable the people of the European Union to influence the nature of the Commission through the ballot box."
"While we are well aware that this is not yet applicable law, we advocate the introduction of such an arrangement in time for this year’s European elections."
"This would mean that, in proposing a President of the Commission, the Heads of State or Government would take account of the result of the European elections."
"This accords with democratic principles; it is a fair solution; it is not motivated by party-political considerations but is a matter of principle."
"Mr President-in-Office, when the nomination of a President of the Commission is discussed under your presidency, we urge you to take the outcome of the European elections into account in your deliberations."
"We do need to call to mind the strenuous efforts that were made before the Convention’s proposal materialised."
"I should like to reiterate my thanks to the two representatives of Parliament, Klaus Hänsch and Elmar Brok, for their great work and, of course, to Valéry Giscard d’Estaing for his chairmanship of the Convention as well as to all those from our Parliament and from the national parliaments and governments who contributed to the final draft."
"This whole effort must not be allowed to end in failure now."
"I remember very well how the President of the French Republic, as President of the European Council, explained the Treaty of Nice to us in December 2000 and how, in his response to our criticism of the outcome of the Nice Summit, he made a declaration of intent."
"The first step towards the creation of the Convention on the Future of Europe was taken when the French President agreed that there was a need to think about introducing a new method of reforming the EU, and the next was the Laeken decision and the work with which we are all familiar."
"That work must not be in vain."
"From the first of May, we shall be a Community of 455 million people."
"We need clear and sound legal foundations for the European Union of the future, so that this whole structure can be held together."
"At the heart of the constitution are the means by which we can agree on common methods and peacefully resolve conflicts of interest and disputes."
"In short, the constitution is all about a peaceful future for our continent, and it is a project that must not be allowed to fail."
"Mr President-in-Office, I wish you every success and hope that you will harvest the fruits of these efforts before the end of your presidency."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the time has come to genuinely apply the principles of fraternity, solidarity and equality and to bring forward the European Constitution."
"The has taken up that task and I would suggest that the Irish Presidency – a country of poetry and literature – remember a phrase by a great European, a French citizen, who proposed a United States of Europe in the nineteenth century, Victor Hugo, who said: the future has many names."
"For the meek, unknown. But for the brave, opportunity."
"I believe that moment has come, because we must remember that, according to the Eurobarometer, enthusiasm for Europe is decreasing in almost all of our countries."
"Nevertheless, 78% of citizens are in favour of having a Constitution, including the British – 51%– which is interesting."
"I would therefore appeal to the Spring European Council to renew the Intergovernmental Conference or, better still, to take the bull by the horns and for the Heads of State or Government to sit down to resolve the outstanding issues."
"That is what they should do if they really understand what an historic moment we are at."
"With regard to the issues that are still contentious, we should work on the premiss that our Union’s power must not lie in blocking decisions but in reaching decisions by majority."
"In this regard, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to express the support of my group – and specifically my Party – in order to unblock the situation in my country, in order to replace the cat-fighting method with constructive debate."
"It is truly an important step; to use the double majority and a weighting which allows us to move forward and to function."
"Another important issue – above all fundamental to Parliament – is the scope of qualified majority voting and the balanced distribution of legislative power between Parliament and the Council, including budgetary power."
"There have been significant backward steps in the recent drafts of the Italian Presidency."
"And it is an issue of serious concern to us."
"I believe that Parliament should express its opinion clearly."
"We are not prepared for there to be a clear backward step because the Constitution is approved."
"Another important point dealt with in the informal meeting, as well as many others, which was held in Berlin amongst three countries is the creation of a person in charge of the economy in the Commission, a minister for coordination."
"Parliament had repeatedly argued that we needed responsible economic governance."
"We have a draft Constitution in which there is a Minister for Foreign Affairs but there is none for the economy."
"If we seriously want the Lisbon strategy to make progress, a strategy which creates employment and which also creates technological conditions for the future, we must give it a face."
"There is no reason why this cannot be subject to consideration and an amendment to the Constitution by the Intergovernmental Conference."
"With regard to the financial perspectives – which also continue to be a contentious issue – we support the Commission’s presentation of the proposal for the financial perspectives in accordance with its responsibilities and we cannot accept being haggled down, above all at a time of enlargement."
"Parliament could have said that it is in favour of 1.4% of GDP."
"We have accepted the Commission’s position, but we do not believe that haggling is a good sign for the future."
"Finally, Mr President, my group is clearly in agreement with taking account of the result of the European elections, on the basis that we all want to win them."
"In any event, however, there is a fundamental point: given the European political landscape, no party is going to have a hegemony and, if we apply parliamentary thinking when it comes to proposing the President of the Commission, we must be consistent."
"In a parliamentary system, the important thing is the capacity to create majorities, and that is done according to a programme."
"Therefore, Mr Poettering, it makes no sense to issue vetoes prematurely."
"We are also prepared to win the elections and we are then prepared to create a progressive and Europeanist coalition."
"We will now have to see how prepared you are to do the same."
"Mr President, this Spring Council will be dominated by the economic reform agenda and rightly so."
"Yet there is something a little strange in talking about the future of Europe when the draft constitution fashioned to facilitate that future languishes in Council."
"Liberal Democrats and Reformers in this House welcome the intensive consultations undertaken by the presidency."
"Signs from most national capitals suggest that it should not be beyond the wit of our Member States to deliver a deal."
"President-in-Office, we urge you not to give up on your efforts to break the deadlock at the IGC and secure a constitution for Europe before the elections to this House in June."
"I should also like to thank you, President-in-Office, for going off-script in your remarks."
"Your line that it is 'possible to find a consensus in the context of a process leading to a conclusion' is one of Sir Humphrey's finest."
"I am pleased to see that he is alive and well in Justus Lipsius."
"However, your line that the key to it all is political will is exactly right."
"The potential problems of an EU of 25 are painfully clear."
"Without institutional reform this Union cannot function effectively."
"It is time to stop pretending that life will somehow go on if the IGC fails."
"Forget the infamous Polish slogan 'Nice or death'."
"For an enlarged Europe, Nice death."
"I share the Commission's concern about tinkering with the draft constitution."
"Some of Europe's leaders are playing poker with the Union's future in the last chance saloon."
"It is time to show our cards: governments, people, parliamentarians alike."
"Do we demand a stronger, more credible Europe at home and abroad?"
"Do we insist on integration where it is needed?"
"Do we want the President of the Commission to be Europe's best and brightest, able to command support across party lines?"
"Liberal Democrats and Reformers are in no doubt about our answers to these questions: yes, yes and yes!"
"I regret that the European left, which gave us the inspirational leadership of Jacques Delors, now seems to lack conviction about the future of our continent."
"Mr Poettering's platoon seems more concerned about making the next President of the Commission their political plaything than about the content of his or her programme."
"It is alright, Mr Poettering, for Wilfred Martens to claim that the PPE-DE is 'uncompromisingly pro-European': you look more like pro-European to me!"
"Do you speak in the name of all of your Group, or just one part of it?"
"The European Council also has to debate Europe's external relations."
"It should be recognised that without exception, Europe speaks more strongly in the world when it speaks with a single voice."
"That is why, President-in-Office, I make this appeal to you: last night, five of the nine British detainees at Guantanamo Bay were repatriated to the United Kingdom."
"Even as a British citizen, I see this less as a gain for Britain than as a loss for Europe."
"Because if the Council had pushed Europe's case over bilateral bargains, we might have had a more united and principled stand."
"We should have insisted on securing the release of all Europe's detainees from Guantanamo Bay."
"I challenge your presidency to stand up for our Union's values by speaking for Europe as a whole at the EU-US summit on the issue of the remaining Guantanamo Bay detainees."
"We have to pull together now as a continent or we will fall apart."
"The pro-European forces in government and this House have to make their case with conviction, because we need a new constitution, a new credibility and a new self-confidence, and we need them now."
"– Mr President, one of the European Council’s tasks will be to conduct an impact assessment on the Lisbon strategy, and, in this, it would do well to ponder the lesson contained – or so I see it – in the document addressed to it by the Commission, which shows how the free-market approach that characterises the EU’s current policies is incompatible with an advanced social model based on the non-elitist and inclusive encouragement of people’s abilities."
"I will of course reassure Commissioner Kinnock that the Commission’s document refrains from drawing such conclusions from the four years of the Lisbon strategy, but its circumlocutions and other understatements are eloquent testimony to its authors’ embarrassment at having to draw up this particular balance sheet."
"One of the objectives that the EU set itself at Lisbon was full employment by 2010."
"How far have we got?"
"Employment has proved pretty resistant, or so it appears from the report, which goes as far as to invent the piquant neologism of ‘delayed improvements in employment levels’, before admitting the bitter truth that, ‘in its first decline in ten years, the euro zone recorded a loss of some 200 000 jobs (in net terms) in 2003, and the unemployment rate should continue to rise slightly in 2004’."
"At Lisbon, the EU also set itself the goal of becoming, by the same date, the most competitive and most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world."
"What view does the Commission’s interim report take of that?"
"Let me quote: ‘following the implementation of the Lisbon strategy, this has given rise to undeniable progress, instituting the transition needed towards a competitive economy characterized by growth, etc.’."
"After four years of the Lisbon strategy, let me quote the Commission, ‘the percentage of young people dropping out of the school system without any qualifications was over 18% in 2003, 17.2% of young Europeans aged 15 do not have the minimum necessary skills (reading, writing, arithmetic)’."
"Those are the words of the Commission."
"This unsparing judgment is followed up by reference to ‘the decline in overall investment, in both the public and private sectors, to the detriment of the priority areas identified by the Lisbon strategy, such as research, innovation, education, and training’."
"Finally, the Commission’s report offers a new and bold definition of another of the Lisbon strategy’s key concepts: ‘the sustainable development approach is beginning to be taken into account in the definition of policies [...] it is thus that several Member States have embarked on reforms to their pension systems in order to face up to the problems of an ageing population’."
"If that is what sustainable development is, then the Council must surely be full of ecologists."
"Having laboured and brought forth this diagnosis, the Commission offers its solutions: the free-market model is getting nowhere, long live the free-market model – or so its watchword appears to be."
"It thus sees it as ‘vital to maintain a strong-competition policy in the internal market’, going on to add that the Stability Pact must be adhered to, that it is necessary to press on with reforms to pensions and healthcare systems, that environmental policy must be made to pay, and even that the most profitable areas of education and training must be identified."
"How bad, though, must the social and political crises brought about by this free-market ideology be before a glimmer of critical intelligence has the chance to make its presence felt in the EU’s corridors of power?"
"All the evidence indicates that the only way of saving the European ideal is to make a clean break with this machinery for churning out human mess and despair."
"After the Spring Summit, it will be time to work towards a new spring for Europe."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, somewhere in Paris, in the care of the Chairman of the Convention, Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, is a huge display board which, on the day of the Convention’s last meeting, stood at the front of the conference Chamber."
"All the members of the Convention affixed their signatures to it, thereby declaring their consent to the Convention’s great draft Constitutional Treaty."
"Yesterday I asked President Giscard d’Estaing to release this board."
"My proposal is that it should be displayed in front of the next summit of Heads of State or Government, some of whom have completely forgotten that they sent their own personal representatives to take part in that constitutive process and that the signatures of those representatives attest to their having endorsed the result of the Convention’s deliberations."
"In addition, this might also make the Heads of State or Government remember what the Convention was and what it achieved."
"At the present time we have two main problems."
"The first of these is that the Convention cannot defend its own draft and, with the Convention having completed its work, the European parliaments have lost the only place where they could coordinate their efforts and join forces to defend the parliamentary and democratic dimension of the constitutional provisions."
"Our second main problem, Mr President-in-Office, is that the Convention was public. The Intergovernmental Conference marks a reversion to those clandestine, discreet and conspiratorial gatherings of our imperial potentates, who presume to develop the European constitution in this feudal manner – a constitution which, by its very nature, is a parliamentary matter."
"It would therefore be good and seemly if governments were to show due respect to parliaments and to the authors of the draft constitution by ensuring that their deliberations are not governed entirely by one single motive."
"The Convention had aims."
"Those aims related, quite simply, to democracy, effectiveness and Europe’s place in the world."
"What has driven the governments to formulate the 320 proposals of which we here have become aware?"
"Only one motive: more power for the national governments."
"That is their one and only goal."
"All 320 proposals have but one common denominator: no more social Europe, no more democracy, no more fundamental civil and other rights, no more parliamentarianism, no more efforts to build an effective EU, but only more power for themselves."
"Whether that upsets the democratic balance, whether it is an affront to republican principles or disenfranchises parliaments, is of no consequence to them."
"Anyone who is seriously concerned about this trend might recognise a second motive, namely nationalism."
"The entire Intergovernmental Conference is imbued with a spirit of nationalism that we no longer want to see in Europe, and this mixture of more power for governments and nationalism represents the greatest danger to our continent."
"I marvel at the gentle patience of the honourable Members of this House."
"Every four weeks, we submit a petition in the form of a resolution: ‘Most gracious Intergovernmental Conference, we humbly beg that democracy might exist alongside the power of governments; we plead for fundamental rights, including civil rights; we beseech you to let parliamentarianism exist alongside the power of governments’."
"But we are not even successful supplicants, for they do not listen to us, and nothing changes."
"Five months!"
"It took 105 people 16 months to develop a constitution for Europe, but it has taken 25 governments only five months to tear it to shreds."
"Mr President, thank you for your patience."
"Perhaps you can help in some way to ensure that this board, which will have historic importance one day, is displayed on the wall in front of the Council."
"Let it serve as a reminder that the future of Europe is at stake."
"Mr President, firstly, my sincere thanks and appreciation to the President-in-Office for the very open, sincere and straightforward presentation he made this morning; it clearly shows his respect for Parliament, for which I thank him."
"I also thank Commission Vice-President Kinnock for his congratulations and good wishes for Ireland winning the Triple Crown, particularly after their tremendous win at Twickenham last weekend."
"The spring summit will focus on two primary issues: first, to move forward a raft of new EU legislative provisions to ensure that the European Union becomes more competitive; second, to assess the state of negotiations with regard to enacting a new European Union treaty."
"A strong competitive and stable economy is essential in order to deliver sustainable growth and a better quality of life to the citizens of Europe."
"We must do more to advance the Lisbon strategy so as to ensure the Union becomes the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010."
"In creating more and better quality jobs in Europe, we must implement a broad-ranging set of policies at EU level."
"We know that the internal market is said to have created over 2.5 million jobs within the last ten years alone."
"We must fully implement the Action for Growth initiative, which will bring about an increased level of investment in the European energy and transport networks."
"The Action for Growth initiative must also ensure that the research and development investment target of 3 % of GDP within the Union will be met by 2010."
"All new EU legislation must be subjected to strict tests for its impact on enterprise and competitiveness."
"The financial services action plan must be implemented so that there will be an integrated financial services market in the Union by 2005."
"A Community and patenting system must also be enacted within the Union."
"The Union cannot become the most knowledge-based economy in the world unless it takes full advantage of the new and evolving information technologies."
"The e-Europe 2005 programme will seek to introduce a greater level of broadband to schools to guarantee access to high-speed Internet services and increase skills development for our young people."
"I firmly believe that the benefits of the information society must be spread to both urban and rural areas and to all regions within the Union."
"The President-in-Office of the Council, Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, will present to this meeting an assessment as to the state of the negotiations with regard to the new EU treaty."
"Mr Ahern has accelerated the process of negotiation with other EU governments, in an effort to move quickly forward the discussions concerning the key bottom-line issues."
"We all know that we must put in place a new European Union treaty, if the European Union is to modernise and become more effective in a Community of 25 Member States."
"Enshrined within this process must be recognition of the role of smaller states, which must be protected within any new future institutional framework."
"It is never easy to broker an agreement and that is why it is taking time to enact a new European treaty."
"These negotiations should not detract from one particular fact, namely that the enlargement of the Union will take place on 1 May 2004."
"Mr President, my Irish friends, congratulations on your victory over England in the rugby, but remember: EU citizens must not be vanquished; they must decide."
"Instead of arranging re-matches in Ireland and Denmark when we vote against a new treaty, it would be better if the Presidency were to use the Brussels Summit to say: we shall not sign any new EU Constitution if it has not been voted on in referendums in all the countries."
"The Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities will recommend the voters politely to reject a Constitution that would give the EU legislative power in 15 new areas instead of limiting the EU to cross-border issues; that would abolish the right of veto in approximately 40 areas instead of giving the last word to voters and their elected representatives; and that would demand recognition of the EU Constitution’s priority over the national constitutions instead of respecting the Member States’ constitutions."
"We would especially warn against the prime ministers being able to alter the constitution without asking the voters."
"Use the Brussels Summit to decide that the Constitution must be debated and voted on in referendums in all the EU countries before it can come into force."
"Why not have the draft Constitution subjected to advisory referendums at the same time as the elections to the European Parliament in June?"
"We could then debate our possible common future jointly and choose representatives according to our view of the Constitution."
"We could then ourselves decide whether we wish to transfer more power from the voters and elected representatives in the Member States to EU officials and ministers."
"Now, a question: will the Presidency say what is happening regarding the secret negotiations concerning the Constitution?"
"Who is involved; who is being excluded; and who, for example, was present in Berlin?"
"Is the Presidency fully informed?"
"Is there agreement as to a compromise draft that can be presented when Chirac thinks the time is ripe?"
"Finally, a brief question to Mr Watson: if the Treaty of Nice is death for enlargement, why, then, did the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party recommend it?"
"– Mr President, on the eve of the Spring European Council, opinion polls indicate that a majority of those questioned are indeed – as Mr Barón Crespo said – in favour of a European constitution, but it has to be added that they say so without having the least conception of what the legal definition of a constitution is, nor of the precise content of the one that has been drawn up."
"We can therefore draw the conclusion that these people are in favour of the idea of clarifying relations between the EU and its Member States, but there is certainly nothing more that we can learn from this."
"On this basis, and following the statements just made by the Council and the Commission, as well as those made by Mr Giscard d'Estaing to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs yesterday, we can perceive the outlines of a federalist strategy, which I would regard as repugnant, and which can be described in the following terms."
"A principled compromise is announced just before the European elections; this makes a favourable impression on the electorate, who will go to the polls without having had any real debate on a written draft; finally, if the outcome of the elections appears to be sufficiently favourable to the advocates of a constitution, it is announced that these elections would be seen as equivalent to a consultation, and that such consultation made a referendum unnecessary."
"Paradoxically enough, this strategy would end up distorting democratic debate at the same time as it was declared that the old Monnet method had become obsolete for lack of transparency."
"The European elections cannot function as a substitute for a referendum; they combine far too many different issues and their results would be far too confusing to allow any message to be validly discerned from them."
"If the Heads of States really had, immediately prior to the European elections, agreed on a draft derived from the Convention’s version – which would be too rigid a model for an enlarged Europe, and something that I would not welcome – then the only way forward, in France at any rate, would be to call a referendum on it."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, I believe that the President-in-Office identified one of the main issues here when he rightly pointed out in his address that it will be very difficult to finalise the adoption of the constitution at a later date if the process is delayed now, because our collective awareness will diminish as new players take the stage and because the political agenda develops in such a way that it is well-nigh impossible to resurrect a project after a year and a half."
"For this reason, I believe that the Irish presidency has been pursuing the right approach by probing for potential compromises in a host of bilateral talks."
"With Mr Hänsch, Mr Duff and others, we have visited a great many other capitals over the past few months and have been given the impression that everyone wants the treaty to be concluded."
"Only on one particular point did it prove impossible to reach an agreement."
"It seems to me, however, that views have begun to converge and that those who stand in the way of the agreement are now fewer in number. For this reason, and because it will become more difficult as time goes on, the Irish presidency should be encouraged to propose at the summit on 25 March that an extraordinary summit be convened even before the first of May so that an agreement can be reached."
"What we stand to lose if we cannot reach that agreement on the Constitutional Treaty is the chance to link enlargement with a more efficient European Union and to anchor the European Union to a bedrock of common values and transfer more power to the people, who would elect the President of the Commission through their vote in the European elections and, by virtue of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, enjoy a wide range of legal entitlements and safeguards."
"I also believe that we must not jeopardise the achievement of this aim by perpetuating the myth that there is a crucial difference between the large Member States and the small ones."
"In all my 24 years as a Member of this House, I have never once experienced a vote in the Council or the European Parliament in which the representatives of the large Member States lined up against those of the small Member States."
"Voting is based on interests – whether countries produce wine or not, and so on. That is how things are, and this myth must not stand in the way of decisions."
"The Heads of Government must clearly acknowledge their responsibility for ensuring that this myth does not obstruct progress and must not use it as a pretext for stalling."
"That is why I wish to make this one point: with this draft constitution, we have a truly unique opportunity to bring the whole of our united Europe together on the basis of the equality of nations and governments."
"If this endeavour should fail, Europe will relapse into groups advancing at different speeds with all sorts of barriers between them – not overnight, but at a steady pace."
"Responsibility for taking this opportunity lies with the 25 Heads of State or Government, and they must accept it."
"Let me conclude by drawing a comparison with the present situation."
"In my country, the parliamentary assembly that met in St Paul’s Church in Frankfurt in 1848 adopted a democratic constitution that would have paved the way for a united democratic Germany, and that the King of Prussia declined to accept."
"We are all well aware of the consequences of his decision for my country and for Europe."
"Today’s monarchs are the Heads of State or Government."
"I hope that they will not make the same fateful error that the King of Prussia committed in 1848."
"Mr President, there is a need that we have to pursue with determination: the need for the matters concerning the Intergovernmental Conference, or rather the draft constitution, to be addressed in a transparent way, with an approach which can be understood by public opinion, the citizens and by Parliament itself."
"You see, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we all appreciate – I think I speak for the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which has discussed this a great deal in recent weeks – the determination and delicacy with which the Irish Presidency is acting."
"It is a fact, though, that we have been in darkness for three months."
"Following the strong element of transparency provided by the Convention for 16 months, we are now in the dark."
"You talked of a range of important issues, both institutional and non-institutional, which have been raised with the Irish Presidency."
"What issues?"
"Raised by whom?"
"By how many and which governments?"
"We do not know."
"You used – and I also acknowledge this – a confident tone, and said that it will be relatively easy to find consensus over the vast majority of outstanding issues."
"We can only try to guess at these."
"With regard to the most well-known issues, the only ones which have been openly discussed, we set great store by what Mr Giscard d'Estaing said yesterday to our committee: on no account may the double majority criterion be called into question for the calculation of qualified majorities."
"Furthermore, Mr Giscard d'Estaing called for us not to ‘torture’, on the one hand, the double majority figures, and on the other, the range of subjects for which decisions can be made by qualified majority."
"In this regard, I would like to reaffirm, since you spoke of papers presented by the Italian Presidency ahead of the December Council, that those documents, in our opinion, contain serious reversals precisely in this respect, and are therefore not acceptable to the European Parliament."
"Lastly, you were absolutely right when you claimed that the key to early agreement is political will."
"We hope that an awareness of the importance and gravity of this time for the Union will prevail among the Heads of State or Government at the forthcoming summit: not adopting the Constitution would amount to a real leap in the dark for the European Union."
"Nevertheless, if the path to the Constitution should still appear blocked during the occasion of the forthcoming summit, with all the consequences that we can easily imagine, the positions and responsibilities of the individual governments must in that case be clear to Parliament and to the citizens."
"Mr President, I would like to make four proposals to help the IGC reach a successful conclusion."
"Firstly, as regards the qualified majority formula, we need to raise the number of states needed to form a majority, while at the same time raising the population threshold needed to form a blocking minority."
"That should please the smaller states and not frighten those larger states which are genuinely committed to making it simpler for the Council to reach a decision."
"The sensible equation which seems to be commanding greater support is 55-55."
"Secondly, the IGC needs to drop from the constitution a specific number for the size of the Commission, a college which needs to grow and shrink according to supply and demand like any national administration."
"We should also drop the principle of equal rotation."
"Frankly, having a Commission without a representative from France would be fairly implausible."
"Mr Giscard d'Estaing himself concedes that the Convention's formula for the Commission was not the most glorious of our many achievements, and Commissioner Kinnock agrees."
"Thirdly, the IGC should be convened at summit level, preferably before 1 May, to enable a genuine political debate with a European dimension to be held."
"So far, unfortunately, this has simply not taken place."
"Fourthly and finally, our leaders need to find the moral courage to shape Europe politically."
"If they fail to do so they will be consigned to history as foolish cowards."
"Mr President, we are all familiar with the socio-economic problems facing the European Union, which are creating misgivings amongst the citizens of most Member States, and this is particularly true for my country, Portugal, where unemployment continues to grow, where we are in the midst of economic recession and where the gulf that separates us from the EU average is still increasing and the Commission is providing no investment to solve the problem of the deficit."
"This is why it is crucial to revise the policies responsible for this situation, and consequently the Commission and the Council need to clarify three issues that I believe are fundamental and require immediate resolution."
"First of all, are these institutions willing straightaway to set about making the necessary adjustments to the economic and monetary policy guidelines, with the aim of replacing the Stability Pact with a Social Progress and Employment Pact, in line with the aims of full employment, economic development and economic and social cohesion, in order to guarantee further public investment, more and better employment and greater social inclusion?"
"Secondly, are they going to ask the European Central Bank to reduce interest rates in order to support economic growth and exports, a key issue for countries with weaker economies such as Portugal?"
"Thirdly: are they going to approve a moratorium on liberalisations, review the Lisbon Strategy and undertake an in-depth study of the consequences of what has already been implemented in the various economic and social sectors, specifically in terms of employment, the quality and universality of service provided, the degree of user satisfaction and in terms of extending the democratisation of the operation and management of services, without overlooking the problems and shortcomings in most enlargement countries?"
"Unless these measures are adopted, it will be impossible to implement a policy to boost the economy and to sustain demand in the short- and medium-term. What is needed, therefore, is a re-evaluation of production and labour with a view to promoting economic development, employment and social cohesion, based on a steady increase in national and Community public investment, particularly in basic infrastructures, in education, in qualifications and vocational training, in research and innovation, in the environment and in support for small- and medium-sized enterprises."
"These are the real priorities, which the men and women in our countries hope to see addressed before the European elections of 13 June."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, today, those in favour of Europe's enlargement and deepening have, or at least should have, one concern in common: how can the enlarged Europe be prevented from getting stuck; how can we prevent it from becoming a quagmire of indecision?"
"Europe has always been a source of hope for its citizens; even the governments, regularly failing to solve problems, point to Europe as the place where solutions can be found."
"Today, however, Europe instils fear in people."
"Unemployment is rising and people fear that this will get worse after the enlargement."
"The Member States, whether they are large or small, cannot handle this problem on their own."
"Decisions need to be taken at European level in order to promote real economic recovery and a real increase in the level of employment."
"At the same time, the Member States must in that way provide an efficient answer to globalisation."
"That is why it is their plain and simple duty to ensure that a constitution is adopted."
"It is not difficult to explain to 14-year olds or 70-year-old pensioners that we need a constitution, so why is it so difficult for our Heads of Government to brace themselves to put this constitution into practice?"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I can agree with Mr Poettering’s initial statements praising the Irish Presidency and praising the achievements of one of the EU’s smaller countries."
"This shows us clearly that it would be a mistake to end the system of rotating the Presidency."
"I also appreciate Mr Barón Crespo’s quotation from Victor Hugo, saying ‘the future belongs to the brave’."
"I often compare the process of European integration with the epic poem on the discoveries, in which the great sixteenth century Portuguese poet, Camões, said that we were sailing ‘on hitherto uncharted waters’."
"We must indeed maintain this openness of spirit, this daring and this capacity for adventure."
"We also need to take care to ensure that the ship does not run aground; we must ensure that the crew is informed and motivated and does not start a mutiny."
"I am therefore concerned to see that, following a period of some secrecy, it should be announced that the IGC might be concluded hastily."
"This could be a life-saver for those who wish to base their campaign in the European elections on euro-scepticism, because public opinion is barely interested at the moment and we still do not know precisely what was put forward in the first phase of the IGC under the Italian Presidency."
"Many people have spoken about the issue of qualified majority voting, but I would remind you that this was not the only matter discussed."
"Also on the table were the composition of the Commission, the issue of the Union’s Presidency, defining certain competences, in the field of fisheries and marine resources, for example, the fundamental principle of the equality of States, clarifying the precise scope of the principle of the primacy of Community law, transparency and openness in the Council’s legislative workings and deliberations, the preamble and the express reference to the legacy of Christianity and the limitation on the flexibility or clauses."
"In other words, the agenda is enormous and I therefore support and understand the words of the President of the Portuguese Republic, whose pro-European feelings are well known, calling a week ago for more time to allow the negotiations on the European Constitution to take place."
"He criticised the fact that things are being done under pressure, called for more time and asked us to concentrate on the immediate problems such as the Lisbon Strategy, enlargement and negotiations on the new Community support framework."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am fully aware of the importance of this debate on the future of Europe."
"I would, however, like to take this opportunity to refer to an emergency very close to our hearts as Radical Members, and for which my colleague, Mr Dupuis, has been on hunger strike for over 30 days."
"We consider it to be an emergency for Europe’s present, one which unfortunately, was not an emergency for Europe’s recent past."
"I would like to turn once more, Mr President—in—Office of the Council, Commissioners, to the Chechen question."
"This debate is certainly important for the future and for the institutions, but if we let the present go by, the horrors of the present, we will lose credibility when we want to construct a different future."
"Well, Mr President, Mr President—in—Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, as everyone knows – but no one reacted – over the course of recent weeks, the Russian authorities organised, using the puppet government in Chechnya as a cover, a series of about 30 arrests of relatives of Umar Khambiev, Chechen Minister for Health and emissary of President-elect, Aslan Maskhadov."
"His brother Magomed Minister for Defence, gave himself up to avoid further bloodshed."
"Starting on 29 February, in dramatic raids, dozens of masked armed men from Russian forces and Chechen militia surrounded villages, entered houses, hit, insulted and threatened to kill members of the Khambiev family to the last; they abducted and took away those members of the Khambiev family that they managed to find there."
"There has been no further news of them."
"Seven hundred men arrived in armoured vehicles in Benoi, the village of birth of the Khambievs, and having beaten the inhabitants and destroyed everything they could destroy, they kidnapped seven people and demanded that Umar and Magomed surrender."
"Mr President of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what is happening in Europe – and Parliament has repeatedly spoken out in this regard, from a humanitarian and at times even political point of view – must form part of our political present."
"Concern has already been expressed even by the US administration."
"In accordance with the Geneva Conventions, we are calling for the Red Cross to be authorised to visit the Khambiev family and the Minister for Defence, Mr Khambiev."
"These Geneva Conventions should be observed, Mr President."
"We are going to put a question to the Council straightaway, but I think it is our duty to at least react to these methods."
"Not just with radical non-violence but also by means of European political presence and compliance with the Geneva Conventions."
"We achieved this even for Saddam Hussein, who received a visit from the Red Cross; it is inconceivable that we cannot even achieve this in this case."
"Mr President, I am glad to see Commissioner Kinnock here, but where is Commissioner Prodi?"
"What official business could be more important than this debate this morning?"
"Perhaps we could have an answer before the end of the debate."
"Let me begin by welcoming the moves made by the Irish presidency so far towards garnering consensus for the draft Constitutional Treaty."
"In recent weeks a number of positive indicators have suggested an increased willingness on the part of Member States to agree a workable compromise."
"Outstanding differences of opinion need to be ironed out in a committed and systematic way to break the remaining deadlock."
"Minister Roche and, indeed, the Taoiseach, have my wholehearted support in rising to the difficult task ahead of them in the months leading up to enlargement and the European elections."
"A simplified single Treaty will make the EU of 25 more intelligible to the citizens of Europe by defining the EU and Member States' competences clearly."
"It will introduce reforms that streamline the workings of the EU and will facilitate decision-making in an enlarged Union."
"Finally and very importantly, it will also help to dispel the many myths that have grown up."
"Primary among these myths is the one about the draft Treaty leading to the creation of a so-called super-state."
"An entity that cannot raise taxes autonomously, is not authorised to run budget deficits, has no right to raise a military force and, most importantly, cannot act outside the competences given to it by the Member States is not a recipe for a super-state by any stretch of the imagination."
"The EU can only spend a maximum of 1.2% of the combined GDP of all its Member States."
"Compare this to the only super-state in the world today – the United States – the federal government of which spends 20% of GDP, and you can see what a nonsense this accusation is."
"The Constitutional Treaty is a voluntary agreement made between consenting governments whose national parliaments would, under its terms, in fact be given stronger roles with regard to scrutiny of the Commission's legislative proposals."
"The foremost achievement of the European project to date has been to put an end to the rivalry and antagonism of the last century that pushed this continent into two world wars, which cost 56 million lives."
"The recent conflagration in the Balkans highlights the latent potential for destruction."
"We should have the courage to use our experience and our position in the world to promote peace and stability in the global arena and to treat the problems of displacement and terrorism at source, for example by helping to ensure an economic future for the millions of young people living in the Middle East."
"I should like to ask the President-in-Office what stage has been reached in meeting the Lisbon commitments."
"This is on the IGC agenda as well, but so far all we have heard about is a European Commission action plan for enterprise – which received a very lukewarm reception indeed and was accused of lacking focus and tangible recommendations."
"I would end by saying to the President-in-Office that the jury is out, the ball is in his court and that he has all our support."
"Mr President, this month, for the second time in a short space of time, after the failure of the Italian Presidency in December, and under Irish leadership, the Heads of Government are facing a choice that is crucial to the European Union's future."
"The European Council in Italy looked foolish when it failed to dispose of the narrow-minded national interest and to opt for a more democratic, efficient and transparent Europe."
"Many wonder whether the Council will make the same mistake again."
"Fortunately, the Irish Presidency has already done a great deal of work over the past couple of months."
"There is willingness to reach agreement; very tentatively, things are moving in Europe."
"I would urge the Irish Presidency to tread carefully, for another failure would be disastrous for the confidence among the European electorate as it heads for the ballot boxes in June."
"If the Heads of Government drop another clanger this time, it will be impossible to convince the European electorate of Europe's power."
"In this light, it is preferable to wait a little longer than not to have a constitution at all."
"I would stress here once again that the text should actually benefit Europe."
"Let us not produce another insignificant document, as happened at the meeting of Heads of Government in Nice in 2000."
"The European Convention's draft Constitution was good news for Europe and its citizens."
"It provides for a more democratic, understandable and, above all, decisive Europe."
"That is why we should adhere to those proposals as closely as possible, without detracting from the rights of the European Parliament, without resorting to back-room politics and without any loss of transparency."
"The idea of one Commissioner per country should be accepted, the defence agreement of Naples must be utilised, and social Europe must be reinforced."
"I would therefore urge the Heads of Government, this time round, to produce a meaningful document, rather than an insignificant one."
"I take the view that if a constitution is not forthcoming, the Heads of Government will throw Europe into crisis, further enlargement will be made impossible and the financial problems will become insoluble."
"For them and for Europe, this is a decisive moment."
"The Irish Presidency is working in a way that instils much confidence in this House, and I wish it every success."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this morning’s preparatory debate gives me the opportunity to make a final contribution on the current and future direction of Europe’s policies."
"To me, one who has always been a European, it gives the opportunity to bring the point home that Europeans have now had enough of a Europe that is essentially economic and financial, one that all too often, for the sake of the free market and of competitiveness, sacrifices jobs and ignores the day-to-day problems faced by the public; so I join with them, the people, this morning, in recalling the dream of Europe’s founding fathers, the dream of building a Europe of peace, culture, diversity, social security and citizenship in freedom and democracy."
"Fifty years on, the Europe in which we live is certainly economically strong – for some – but it has neither heart nor breath of life, believes in nothing and is too full of injustice."
"We are having what we call a spring summit, we are on the threshold of enlargement, a new Intergovernmental Conference is about to be held, and there is very little in the budget, yet I still want to believe that there is still time to set a new course."
"Having been at first a rather euphoric European, and having now become, after fifteen years in the European Parliament, a more realistic, more critical, not to say more uneasy one, I wanted to use my two minutes to shout, ‘Look out! Danger ahead!’"
"If it took fifty years to build the European Union that we have now, there is no small risk that we will one day see the structure implode for lack of sufficient popular support or of any ambitious vision of society, through failure to give priority to jobs, to respect for national and regional differences, and in the absence of any real solidarity."
"It is the richest, rather than the poorest, who must pay for the most disadvantaged."
"A European constitution is not an objective in itself; it is meaningless unless it meets the public’s expectations, and this morning, I have reminded you of what – in my view – their essential expectations are."
"Your words, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, and those of the Vice-President of the Commission lead me to believe that Ireland feels able to conclude an agreement on the Constitution put forward by the Convention."
"We will be delighted if Ireland is able to achieve this, not only because Ireland is a Celtic country like my own, Galicia, but also because this would show, once again, that it is one of the Union’s great pro-European countries."
"As a Member for one of Europe’s stateless nations, and one that is not even recognised as such, I have reservations about this draft Constitution arising from the shortcomings in cohesion policy and from the weakness of the positions we have adopted on our role in preserving peace in the world."
"I have confidence, however, in the direction the European Union has taken historically, which is unequivocally in favour of diversity with solidarity, in contrast with the uniform approach of the Jacobin States that today prevails in the State of which I am a citizen."
"It would be most opportune, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, if this Parliament issued a formal statement under the Irish Presidency, approving the Constitution."
"Mr President, whereas peace, democracy, freedom and social justice should be the cornerstones of the European edifice, what does the Council believe in?"
"What does the Commission stand for?"
"What have we achieved here in Parliament?"
"Not very much; we still have peace – if we disregard the latest outbreaks of civil war."
"We have made little progress on democracy."
"I believe there is a huge problem with the legitimacy of this Union, and what has happened in recent months seems symptomatic of further disintegration processes rather than of integration."
"This is dangerous, but I need hardly say that it is also dangerous for us to hide behind the illusion that we in Parliament are the free voices in the institutional structure. We should know better, for we saw, when Nice was being discussed, how the party leaders coaxed and cajoled the supposedly free Members of Parliament."
"Here in the House we also suffer time and again from the way in which Stalinist instincts in the Socialist Group, which frequently takes the unwarranted liberty of calling itself Social Democratic, lead to repeated logjams."
"This will have to change, not only here in Parliament but elsewhere too, and particularly in the Council."
"There can be no democracy without transparency."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the current situation, following the failure of the summit in Brussels, is rather laughable."
"In the constitutional debate, France and Germany hold forth about the need to move Europe forward, but they are the very ones who have persistently ignored the common ground rules."
"The effects of such behaviour are, in my opinion, fatal."
"When Jacques Chirac speaks of an advance guard and outlines the notion of a two-speed Europe, that in itself is not the end of the world."
"The Schengen Agreement and the euro have already established the principle of differing speeds."
"The real tragedy is that friction has been generated."
"This will not help Europe to move forward."
"The prospects for the draft Constitutional Treaty have not become any brighter."
"The negotiations on the EU budget may well pose the threat of some sort of linkage between the constitution and the financial framework."
"I can only recommend vigilance."
"The substance of the draft Constitutional Treaty is a mixture of good ideas that would bring progress and, alas, questionable features such as pre-programmed conflicts of authority, which are destined to occur, for example, in the field of foreign policy between the future EU Foreign Minister and the President of the Council."
"It is high time that the EU prepared itself for a larger Community."
"It smacks of absolutism, in my view, to proscribe the discussion of constitutional matters by the Heads of State or Government."
"I refuse to treat these Heads of Government as if they were the insurgent rebels of Europe."
"At the same time, these leaders must not be allowed to forget that they sent representatives to the Convention."
"I appeal for political pragmatism; what has been achieved must be safeguarded."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what do our fellow-citizens say to us when we go out among them to talk to them about Europe?"
"What do they ask us about?"
"Most of all, they ask us about the role of the European Union."
"What does it do?"
"How is it run and by whom?"
"What they ask of us is clarity in decision-making, precision and comprehensibility in the division of its competences."
"Seeking closer identification with the European Union and with its actors, they would also like Europe to be closer to them and to care more about their future."
"The Convention has done even more than to outline the face of the new Europe; by specifying its competences and putting faces to decisions, it has fashioned the European Union’s body."
"It has created essential linkages that will enable our political design to progress."
"I believe it needs to be said, and repeated, that the draft constitution produced by the Convention under the former French President, Mr Giscard d'Estaing, is a good one."
"What makes it the best of compromises is the fact that, rather than aiming to combine national institutions, it proposes a wholly new structure, one that makes for greater effectiveness and clarity and is in line with modern thinking."
"I find it regrettable that last December saw a triumph for introversion, for individual interests, for the self-centredness of the nation states."
"What place is there for the European public in this masquerade?"
"Above all, as this House had said, the Intergovernmental Conference is a thing of the past."
"The Convention, a novel form of institution, was a gamble that paid off, even demonstrating that the intergovernmental method is no longer suited to the modern-day needs of the EU."
"The way the IGC works reflects a former ambition that left no room for the real European designs, the one that gives us a glimpse of the future."
"The EU is changing its nature before our very eyes."
"The debates between those, on the one hand, who favour an intergovernmental approach, and on the other, the proponents of federalism, bear no relation to the realities of the EU."
"The draft constitution embodies realism and modernity precisely because it bridges the divisions of the past that prevent us, today, from driving the European project forward."
"It gives Europe’s citizens more power."
"Let me conclude by saying that our House will respond to this blockage by standing firm, by seeing to it that we get a modern constitution, one that enables Europe to act, that makes it visible and gives it credibility."
"I wish the Irish presidency every success."
"Mr President, the unified Europe, of 25, 27 or 30 States will not be capable of functioning with an institutional system created for a Union of six or 15 Member States."
"By failing to adopt the Constitutional Treaty, at best we run the risk of a restrained, weak Europe, unable to act in political terms and to be a protagonist on the international stage, and at worst, the political collapse of the Union, that is, a dangerous step backwards with regard to the significant progress made in recent years."
"This is why I am convinced that the Irish Government’s action, unobtrusive but effective, should be supported."
"We certainly need to be quick, and sign the Treaty before the European Parliament elections, but we absolutely must do things properly too, as Mr Giscard d'Estaing said yesterday to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"In short, we cannot accept watered-down compromises which thwart the precious work of the Convention."
"It is right to resume the process on the basis of the achievements of the Italian Presidency, which in any case managed to obtain the consensus of all the countries involved on 90% of the proposed text."
"Now we need to make an additional effort to rise above the obstacles which concern, above all, qualified majority voting."
"The question is, however, not just formal or technical: the real problem we need to overcome is selfishness in some quarters, which in any case must be addressed."
"We need to discuss this, but if we want Europe to be strong politically and to be a leader in the peace initiative, this selfishness must be overcome."
"One final remark, Mr President—in-Office of the Council: we should not forget to include a clear reference to Europe’s Judeo-Christian roots in the preamble."
"We cannot conceive of constructing a large house for 500 million citizens by forgetting the foundations on which our common home must rest."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to follow on from Mr Tajani’s closing remarks."
"Yesterday, Mr President-in-Office, I handed over to you more than 10 000 signatures of people in my constituency who are petitioning for the inclusion of a reference to the Christian heritage of Europe in the preamble to the Treaty."
"Quite frankly, any building that is not constructed on firm foundations will ultimately be doomed to collapse."
"We must not build Europe on weak foundations but on the common basis that incorporates the heritage of our continent."
"The people of my constituency have great faith in the Irish presidency and are confident that you will yet be able to present proposals for the inclusion of such a reference in the preamble."
"I also wish to say a few words about the competitiveness of the European Union, because it is a subject that will receive special treatment at the spring summit, and I should like to address my appeal to the Commission in particular."
"It is not sufficient to organise a summit on competitiveness once a year, and then consider the matter closed, when, throughout the year, we are inundated with proposals that would make Europe less competitive, of which the legislative and policy proposal on chemicals is but one example."
"This proposal is designed to de-industrialise the European Union."
"The Commission must be in no doubt about that."
"Withdraw it, and you will be contributing to a more competitive Europe."
"The same applies to advertising restrictions."
"I could name many other directives too."
"What I would suggest is that the Commission should declare its willingness to withdraw the ten worst proposals for directives."
"That would greatly enhance the competitiveness of the European Union."
"There is a second point I should like to raise, namely that the Member States must honour the commitments they make."
"I myself come from a country whose government, even though it has been told for years what it needs to do, has done nothing in years to free up the labour market and create a more competitive economy."
"This is where there is also a need to reflect on ways of exercising stricter control to ensure that the Member States actually fulfil their obligations."
"Then we shall achieve growth and employment throughout Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to the constitution, let me say that I support every sentence of the speeches made by Mr Voggenhuber and Mr Brok."
"Those who seek to retreat from the draft produced by the Convention are snubbing their own representatives and showing contempt for the members of the national parliaments and hence the people of their own countries."
"A total of 84 out of the 105 members of the Convention were representatives of the national parliaments and of the Heads of Government: this demonstrates anew how closely the Member States are involved in the consultation and decision-making processes of the European Union."
"We want this constitution, we need it, and we demand that an agreement be reached before the first of May."
"Let me move on to the second point, Lisbon, and say that the Lisbon strategy is the programme for the implementation of the European model of an environmentally and socially responsible market economy."
"It is not the sole purpose of the spring summit to emphasise vigorously every year that the Lisbon Declaration is still valid, despite the lack of commitment and political will to implement its provisions."
"This commitment and will are lacking among the national governments, which are equipped with the necessary instruments, but they are also lacking within the Commission, whose preparation and monitoring of the spring summit ranges from sloppy to unsatisfactory."
"The summit must not degenerate into a talking shop."
"It must supply straight answers to people’s questions about growth and employment as well as social cohesion."
"For this reason, I demand a concrete innovation and investment pact for the promotion of competitiveness, growth and social cohesion."
"This pact should prescribe exactly who should take what action and achieve which targets by when."
"I expect the Commission to make this pact, along with the adopted projects, the basis of the policy that underlies its financial planning."
"We need a public discussion, a public debate, on the level of compliance with this innovation and investment pact, analogous to the discussion on observance of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Failure to comply with the Stability and Growth Pact obstructs the effort to achieve the Lisbon objectives, and the non-compliant countries – France and Germany, along with Belgium – are also trailing furthest behind in the transposition of the directives on the single market."
"So let us not play off the one against the other, but rather let us do what we have to do."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to congratulate the Irish presidency on the work it has done in picking up the thread of an IGC that was cut short in December for the lack of any real political will to complete the institutional reform of the EU, even though this is crucial to the proper functioning of Europe in the years to come."
"Speaking on behalf of the French delegation within the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and joining with the great majority of my fellow MEPs, from whom you have already heard, what I ask of the forthcoming Brussels European Council is that it should demonstrate its determination, in political terms, to overcome difficulties which, whilst important, are still secondary to what is really at stake: making the unification of our continent a political, economic and social triumph."
"It is absolutely vital that the draft constitution put before us by the Convention, the exceptional success of which we can see today in the light of the difficulties the IGC had with it, should be adopted with the minimum possible delay."
"That is our message to the Irish presidency."
"Moreover, the Lisbon objectives, which are ambitious but realistic, necessarily involve putting in place proactive policies enabling us to compete with our trading partners, first among them the United States and Japan, in the strategic areas of research and development, education, and lifelong training."
"Let us therefore implement these necessary reforms and overcome our fruitless divisions in order to make Europe a success on every front."
"Europe’s citizens will be summoned to the polls in June to elect their MEPs, and they expect more of the European Union than is often articulated."
"They are relying on us to make it possible for them to live harmoniously beyond their own borders, to work freely and as much as they want, and to save them from being swamped by forms and pointless taxes."
"Although the Spring European Council is certainly not the culmination of European history, it could well be a key staging post on the way to the speedy adoption of a Constitution and as we progress towards putting in place the economic and trading frameworks that are indispensable if Europe is, at last, to enjoy growth."
"– Mr President, in seeking solutions to the EU’s institutional reforms and the problems that have resulted from the failure of the Intergovernmental Conference, we must keep our minds on the internal market and maintaining and improving the competitiveness of our economy."
"The implementation of internal market legislation at national level is an absolute precondition for achieving the Lisbon objectives."
"An increase in the implementation deficit will cause EU markets to splinter and erode the benefits of the internal market."
"An accusing finger cannot just be pointed at the inertia of the Member States in the implementation of the Lisbon objectives."
"The work of the Competitiveness Council has to be made more effective and it must return to a fundamental question: what impact will each drafted law have on the EU’s competitiveness?"
"It is also time for some spring-cleaning in the Commission."
"At present the Commissioners are very torn on their directives."
"The drafting of the chemicals package was a good example of this."
"EU competitiveness will not improve with laws like these."
"On the contrary, it will become seriously endangered."
"Next autumn a Competitiveness Council Commissioners’ portfolio is to be established in the Commission."
"Its task will specifically be to finalise the Lisbon objectives and coordinate and harmonise the work of the Commissioners for Industry, the Environment and Employment."
"Competitiveness and a healthy Europe are not a Utopian dream."
"New magic remedies are not required."
"The medication exists: it was discovered in the spring of 2000 in Lisbon."
"Countries just have to do what they said they would."
"Mr President, I want to express my admiration for what I thought was a stylish and rather teasing address from Mr Roche on whether there has really been considerable movement on the IGC issues."
"We have been reading about the Spanish and Polish Governments possibly shifting their positions, with similar reports about the German Government."
"The UK press is now saying that Mr Blair and Mr Berlusconi are writing joint letters together – there's friendship for you! – and now we understand that Mr Blair is travelling to Dublin tomorrow for talks with the Taoiseach."
"As Mr Napoletano said earlier in the debate, it is all very frustrating and unclear for those of us who are outside."
"All this underlines the importance of restating the demand for democratic legitimacy, something which was conceded by Vice-President Kinnock in the course of his address."
"I see that as coming through the process of a referendum."
"Mr Barón Crespo told us that 51% of UK citizens want this Constitution."
"I might doubt that but, unlike his Labour allies, I am very happy to have the matter tested in a referendum."
"I can tell you, Mr President, that more than 80% of people in my country agree."
"Mr President, among the topics on the agenda for the forthcoming Council is the Lisbon Strategy, the Union’s Financial Perspective and the resumption of the constitutional process."
"I will restrict my remarks to the latter issue, as I consider it to be crucial."
"Parliament has been the mainstay of federalist policy, as acknowledged by the President-in-Office, whose prudence and perseverance we welcomed also today."
"We also agree with his concerns: time is against the Constitutional Treaty."
"In fact, we are at an historic turning point and not just because the reunification of Europe makes a constitutional charter both more difficult and more necessary, but also because the next Parliament will see a significant generational replacement of the parliamentary groups which created the European Community."
"Europe’s future would be threatened by deadlock in the Intergovernmental Conference, and another failure, instead of ending the democratic deficit, would increase the danger of there being a democracy with no voters, threatened by populism."
"A failure would also be a negative signal for the objective of making Europe’s economy more competitive, since this objective calls for greater economic integration, greater social cohesion and greater democratic transparency."
"Nevertheless, we agree with Mr Kinnock: better no Constitution than a Treaty which does not live up to the Convention proposal."
"We would therefore call on the Council, through its decisions, to rekindle enthusiasm for a more democratic Europe, united in its diversity and capable of having a common foreign and defence policy."
". – Mr President, I wish to thank all the Members who have contributed to the debate."
"I shall begin with the Lisbon Strategy."
"The bulk of the debate was on the IGC, and I shall return to that."
"Mr Watson made a very interesting link between the future prospects for Europe and the new Constitution."
"He suggested that we should move in tandem in both cases."
"He is right."
"Mr Watson and Mr Collins also made a very clear point about the importance of the Lisbon Strategy and the need to keep Lisbon to the fore."
"Again, they are right."
"Mrs Sudre has just made a very interesting point about the significance of the strategy in terms of the future."
"The Spring European Council and the Lisbon Strategy are key priorities of the Irish presidency, and we look forward to a successful and focussed debate on the vital questions regarding the future economic, social and environmental development of the Union."
"It is interesting that many of the key issues raised during the debate are ones we have indicated in our preparation and on which we have decided to focus."
"Our strategy approaching the Lisbon discussion has been to limit the number of areas, and to focus on these in order to make progress."
"I was intrigued by all the comments made on the Intergovernmental Conference and the Constitutional Treaty."
"The views of the clear and overwhelming majority of this House confirm to me the urgency of the task at hand."
"Mr Duff kindly drew my attention to a motion that is being prepared for adoption by the House."
"As Mr Barón Crespo reminded us, the recent Eurobarometer poll shows that the people of Europe want a Constitutional Treaty."
"That is a very significant poll."
"I note that there are variations in the level of support for the Constitutional Treaty, but the fact that the people want a Constitutional Treaty is something that should weigh heavily in all our considerations."
"My good friend and fellow member of the Convention, Mr Voggenhuber, can rest assured that I well remember the day at the Convention when we chinked glasses, listened to the Ode to Joy and all signed a very large postcard."
"I must say that I do not recognise the rather negative characterisation of the Constitution by another good friend – Mr Bonde."
"I agree with Mrs Doyle, who was much closer to the mark, that this Constitution certainly does not pave the way for some super-state."
"As I have already mentioned, I am not in a position today to go into greater depth on the issues."
"I fully understand Members' frustration."
"However, Members understand equally fully that negotiations are at a stage at which it is impossible to be more detailed than we have been."
"We have entered into discussions in confidence with Member States."
"We understand fully that people belong to different States and have different views."
"The presidency's job is to try and create a space in which people can come together to negotiate and align those views."
"I therefore understand the frustration at there not having been more detail, and would also confirm that the presidency is anxious to seize any opportunity that exists."
"We note that there have been changes in attitudes in recent times."
"Mr Poettering's analysis, for example, was very interesting and he is quite correct that it is critically important to keep the momentum going."
"It would be a disaster for that momentum to be lost."
"Mr Brok was also correct."
"Everybody now says that they want a Constitution, but one of the frustrations of being in the presidency is that everyone says they want to achieve success but this is always qualified with a 'but'."
"Mr van den Berg also made a very interesting point."
"He said that the presidency must bear in mind that a second unsuccessful rendezvous would be a disaster."
"He is quite correct and we must balance all these issues as we move forward."
"A number of Members – particularly Mr Napoletano – have made the point about detail."
"He has spoken with me on more than one occasion about the outstanding issues."
"On the institutional side, there are obvious issues to be resolved, including the questions of representation in Parliament, voting in the Council and the composition of the Commission, while detailed suggestions have been made in relation to the EU Foreign Minister and the presidency of the Council ministries."
"On the non-institutional side, there are different approaches to the question of the extent of qualified majority voting in the Council."
"This is not stating anything new, but these are the issues."
"We will need to strike an overall balance in order to reach agreement."
"Let me turn specifically to some of the matters."
"In response to a number of enquiries regarding the issue of voting rights, the presidency's view on this has been made absolutely clear."
"The Taoiseach has said that a solution based on dual majority is the one most likely to achieve an overall consensus."
"In fact, it is clear that is how the decision will be made on voting rights."
"There continue to be different views as to how the dual majority will be calculated."
"However, it is interesting and intriguing – and a number of Members have made reference to this – that we are indeed now talking about a dual majority system."
"As regards the Commission, there is a shared view that we need a strong and effective Commission."
"There is also a need to find an appropriate balance between equality, the equally valid requirements for the Commission to be effective and for it to have some form of representational view."
"Any agreement will have to take all these considerations into account and it will not be difficult to bridge all the different requirements."
"Mr Barón Crespo and a number of other speakers also mentioned the issue of the budget."
"On the question of the budget, I believe the balanced approach is the one most likely to secure agreement."
"The Italian presidency made a proposal in December which built on that brought forward by the Convention and on the discussions it had with partners in the IGC."
"We have further explored the matter in recent consultations, including with Parliament, and there is a consensus that budgetary procedures must respect the overall institutional balance."
"In conclusion, I very much enjoyed today's debate."
"I have to say that I was heartened by it and I am very grateful to Members for their positive words and encouragement."
"Members who have spoken with me on a one-to-one basis know my particular anxieties in this regard, and they know the ambition of the Irish presidency to achieve progress, if progress can be achieved."
"I have very carefully noted the points that have been made."
"I very much look forward to a successful outcome to the European Council on 25 and 26 March."
"Commissioner Kinnock made the point that the IGC is stage one."
"This was also touched on by a number of other contributors."
"That is true."
"Stage one is agreement at Member State government level and the next stage will be to go on to the various and multifarious ratification processes."
"This leads me back to the point I made in my introduction: delay will not help the ratification process."
"I would reiterate that point."
"Time is not on our side, we need to reach agreement on this matter, as early as it is possible to do so, and the Irish presidency is ambitious that should be the case."
". – Mr President. I want to add to the remarks made by Mr Roche in what has been a very interesting debate."
"Perhaps it is most appropriate for me to begin by thanking Mr Brok for reminding the House about the basic reality that the healthy divisions in modern Europe are on issues and – contrary to what is represented in some parts of politics and the press – not between big and small."
"This is a fundamental point, and understanding it means understanding that it is the equitable inclusion and representative rights of countries of large, medium and small size which makes this a Union and makes the Union a stable, developing, 50-year success, in place of centuries of grand diplomacy by grand governments, which ended repeatedly in terrible grief and war."
"On an occasion like this it is as well to remind ourselves of those basics, as Mr Brok did."
"Secondly, there were interesting references to the Lisbon strategy which, we must recall, was unanimously agreed by Member States to secure the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010."
"There can never have been a more devout aspiration."
"It is interesting to heed what Mr Wurtz, Mr Collins, Mr Ferber, Mr Karas and Mrs Doyle had to say on the issue."
"Since we are all engaged in supporting the Lisbon strategy – maybe with differing degrees of enthusiasm – success in achieving such a knowledge-based, dynamic and competitive economy is not going to be propelled by hesitancy in the further development of the single market, by false economies with reduced public and private sector investment, or by a ceiling on the financial perspectives which disables European Union engagement in research and development, regional development and efforts to combat poverty and under-development throughout the world."
"I should like to offer a quick comment on the points made by Mr Poettering and Mr Barón Crespo, with a degree of elegant nuance from both gentlemen, on the fact that it would be wise to take account of the results of the European Parliament elections in the nomination of the President of the Commission in future."
"No-one seriously democratic could turn their back on such an idea, but nevertheless it is necessary to be careful because, if the impression was ever given that partisan reasons determined the appointment, that would reverberate over five years in Parliament, in the Commission, in the Council and more widely."
"The consequences would be divisive, destabilising and disadvantageous for the Union."
"Neither real democratic accountability nor legitimacy would be served by such a prospect and I am certain that nobody advocates taking proper account of the result of the elections is in any sense advocating partisan predetermination of the political alignment of the President of the Commission."
"I would like to mention what I consider to be the curiosity of the debate."
"It was a remark from Mr Bonde, who called on the presidency to use the Brussels European Council to require a process for national decision-making on the constitution."
"That was somewhat paradoxical from an honourable Member, whom I think of as an evangelist for European fragmentation, especially since, if the advice he offered was followed, it would constitute the most massive act of superordinate centralisation in the history of the Union."
"I am certain he will forgive me if I say, as a great enthusiast for subsidiarity, that not for the first time I have to disagree with him on his proposal."
"A final point, which I cannot resist making – Mr Evans will not be surprised by this."
"I did not in any sense concede the case for democratic legitimacy."
"Indeed, as I am sure Mr Evans will acknowledge, it is a fundamental belief of mine."
"Taking a completely detached view of internal United Kingdom affairs, which befits a Commissioner, I have got a certain divergence from him on the issue of a referendum on the constitution for a basic and simple reason."
"As I understand it, in the United Kingdom referenda take place when a proposal is made for a change in the system of government, whether it involves devolution or the decision to have elected mayors, or in relation to a number of comparable issues."
"The proposed constitution does not change the system of government in the United Kingdom."
"I also recall that the only precedent for the party of which Mr Evans is a distinguished representative providing a referendum was on the acute question of Sunday opening of public houses in Wales."
"For Mr Evans and me that is a fundamental issue of democratic rights and good governance but it does not bear comparison with the European constitution."
"I thank the Commissioner for that completely detached view, which I am sure he also had on the issue of opening pubs in Wales on Sundays!"
"– Mr President, while welcoming Commissioner Kinnock to the House I respectfully request a full explanation for Commissioner Prodi's absence from the House this morning."
". – Mr President, with no discourtesy to the House, I said to the House earlier that work obligations prevented Mr Prodi from being here this morning."
"He is an avid attender at the important business of this House, as I am sure everyone here would recognise, and I consider it sufficient for the President of the Commission to be able to say legitimately and honestly that he has work preoccupations which, owing to timetabling, had to take precedence even over the proceedings of this House today."
"I hope the House will accept this explanation without my having to read out the President's diary."
"I have received four motions for resolution(1) tabled in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday."
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"- Report (A5-0111/2004) by Elmar Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the comprehensive monitoring report of the European Commission on the state of preparedness for EU membership of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia"
"- Report (A5-0105/2004) by Geoffrey Van Orden, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on Bulgaria's progress towards accession"
"and"
"- Report (A5-0103/2004) by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on Romania's progress towards accession."
". Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I believe it is fair to say at this point, only a few weeks before the first of May, the date that has been set for the enlargement of the European Union, that all ten acceding countries have made massive efforts over the past decade to prepare themselves for that day."
"They have taken far greater pains – with profound consequences for their peoples – than we in the European Union have done in preparation for enlargement, as the foregoing debate has demonstrated."
"I hope that the Cyprus question will also be resolved in time for us to welcome a united Cyprus into the fold on the first of May."
"At the same time, since this is the last report of this type, I have to say that the authors of the country reports from the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights and Common Security and Defence Policy have shown great responsibility and commitment in the performance of their task over these past years, and, as chairman of the committee, I should like to take this opportunity to record my thanks to them."
"On the first of May the , the body of established Community law and practice, as defined in the Treaty of Accession, will enter into force in the new Member States along with the associated transitional provisions."
"This means that there must be no more discrimination in either direction and that we shall continue to set great store by compliance with this . We are sure that the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, will take a similar view."
"In respect of compliance, however, there are still weaknesses."
"We do not say this by way of criticism but as a means of helping, of raising awareness, of creating scope for political action to eliminate these weaknesses."
"We must appreciate that these countries have had to undertake a complete transformation of their political, economic and social systems, that they have had to make the transition from Communist centralism to a more regionalised form of government."
"It is obvious that all of this cannot be achieved overnight."
"The same sort of situation obtains with regard to the judicial system, but these weaknesses have implications: if the administrative machinery does not function properly, it will not be able to formulate the regional strategies that are required for access to EU structural funds."
"The situation is similar with regard to the government departments responsible for agriculture and several other areas of activity."
"It is therefore in the interests of the acceding countries to do better in these areas."
"There is therefore a need to keep pursuing the efforts for which the Commission called in its own report last autumn."
"We must also realise that a non-functioning judicial system implies legal uncertainty in some areas of regional activity, for example."
"Legal uncertainty invariably acts as a barrier to investment."
"It is essential to create legal certainty in those areas too."
"This is not simply a matter of enabling individuals to exercise their rights; it also affects economic development in particular regions."
"This point is appreciated too, and both factors together are relevant to the fight against corruption."
"As we have heard today, there is corruption in my country, Germany, and indeed there is corruption in football too."
"But we must ensure that this cancer, which exists everywhere in varying degrees, does not take a grip of the European Union and jeopardise our general development prospects"
"Another point that needs to be discussed is the fact that the issue of minority rights is not regulated in the same way everywhere."
"The position of gypsies in some countries, for example, needs to be addressed, and here we hope to see practical improvements."
"At the same time, we should also recognise that the Baltic States have made strenuous efforts in this historic context with regard to their minorities, and that the situation of these minorities is no reason for not signing or ratifying the boundary treaties with them."
"We therefore call on Russia to move forward swiftly so that clarity can be established on this issue too."
"We would like to be sure that the cooperation and partnership agreements will apply to the whole European Union."
"The principle of no renegotiation must apply to all of them."
"Nor can compensation be claimed on account of the enlargement of the European Union. On the contrary, we must build bridges at the new borders of the European Union, and we must pave the way for the earliest possible application of the Schengen standards there in order to guarantee internal security and hence be able to open the internal borders."
"This configuration surely constitutes one of the toughest problems we shall have to solve."
"Mr President, may I say in conclusion – and I believe I can speak for the entire House here – that we are looking forward to the first of May and to the accession of our new partners."
"On behalf of Parliament, Mr Brok, I should like to thank you and the other rapporteurs for the work that has been done by your committee in leading this issue so consistently through the entire mandate and now bringing it towards a successful conclusion."
". Mr President, over the past decade we have seen a massive transformation of Bulgaria, hauling itself out of a Communist past and now on track for accession to the European Union by 2007."
"The turnaround is truly remarkable."
"My report is therefore very optimistic."
"I see no reason why accession negotiations should not be closed during the summer before the conclusion of the Irish presidency and before the mandate of the present Commission ends."
"This would be a very important signal to the people of Bulgaria and a reminder that they are not forgotten at a time when ten other countries will have just acceded to the European Union."
"This means that the Commission and Council must rapidly finalise the EU position on the four remaining chapters: competition, regional policy, agriculture and budget."
"The draft financial package proposed by the Commission on 10 February – some EUR 4.2 billion over three years – provides an excellent basis for the final phase of negotiations."
"Indeed, measured as a percentage of per capita GDP, this package can be seen as among the most generous that has been offered to an accession country, although this needs to be kept in perspective as Bulgarian per capita GDP is low."
"The financial package may require adaptation in the light of changes to the overall financial perspective and I am reassured by the Commission's recognition that cooperation with Parliament, as one arm of the Union's budgetary authority, will therefore need to be intensified over the next three years."
"Bulgaria's accession process has so far been characterised by commitment and good faith on all sides and a shared determination to meet the many deadlines involved."
"The macro-economic indicators have been very positive in Bulgaria."
"We have seen GDP growing by almost 5%, the rate of inflation dropping significantly, a surge in foreign investment and a major cut in unemployment levels."
"It will take time for the effects of these improvements to be felt by large sections of the population, particularly in the regions outside of Sofia, but we can expect the upswing to gather pace as accession approaches and confidence in Bulgaria's political and economic transformation grows."
"Confidence is a key factor."
"It is most important, therefore, that Bulgaria's progress and accession should not in any way be linked to or held back by any other candidate country."
"As my report clearly states, Bulgaria is part of the current inclusive and irreversible enlargement process that is based on the own merits principle."
"I was pleased to hear Mr Verheugen state in Parliament last November, and I quote: 'The one country, Bulgaria, should not wait for the other, Romania."
"And we have also guaranteed this'."
"I would be grateful for the Commissioner's confirmation of this position."
"The accession process for other candidate countries, or indeed the addition of new countries to the accession process, should not impact on the timetable for Bulgaria and the assessment of its progress."
"But in spite of this progress, many specific problems still have to be overcome in Bulgaria."
"These are very much in the hands of the Bulgarian authorities, although we can help."
"To put this in context, we know that many of the countries acceding to the EU in May also still have many problems to overcome."
"But in Bulgaria's case, I have highlighted in particular the Roma question."
"I do not want to get this out of perspective."
"Many other sections of Bulgarian society face difficulties, but the Roma question is important, not just for the stability and prosperity of Bulgaria, but also because of its potential impact on other countries in the European Union, not least my own, when Bulgaria achieves full membership."
"The full and proper integration of the Roma into mainstream society in Bulgaria requires changes on both sides."
"The Roma need understanding and massive resources deployed in order to provide them with the essentials of life, education and job opportunities, but equally they have to change their lifestyle."
"There has to be a willingness to integrate and to adopt family practices and other social attitudes that give confidence to the wider Bulgarian population."
"It is troubling that a large proportion of children in care or in institutions in Bulgaria come from the Roma community."
"There is something fundamentally wrong with this and it needs to be addressed with real determination."
"Many of the care homes and schools are in a bad state and my own constituents in Chelmsford provide admirable support for one particular school at Berkovitsa."
"As far as amendments to my report are concerned, I do not support either of the two amendments that have been tabled."
"The assertion that Bulgaria is the only accession country that lacks implementation mechanisms in the field of gender equality is frankly not correct."
"The second amendment, regarding energy policy, has been adequately covered in the compromise language already in the text of my report."
"I do not think the amendments are necessary."
"In conclusion, I congratulate Bulgaria and thank the Commission and the Council for all the support they have given to Bulgaria's accession process."
"Let us make sure that it remains on track for accession in 2007."
". Mr President, this report represents a wide-ranging analysis of the problems facing Romania in its development to meet the high standards we demand for joining the European Union."
"The resolution clearly points out that much remains to be done in Romania for political criteria to be adhered to in full."
"The functioning of Parliament, the relationship with the executive and the judicial system and the overall functioning of the rule of law: all are questioned."
"This point involves many issues such as corruption, which is widespread in Romania, involving administrative officials, judges, politicians and in its sum undermines the functioning application of the rule of law."
"This must be the reason why corruption in the area of international adoptions has continually been circumvented by special adoption commissions."
"The moratorium has been ignored and set aside, meaning that many children, even babies, identified as suitable for adoption by the government, signed off by the prime minister, have in reality been taken from suitable family settings by the authorities, against their will and disregarding the wishes of their foster families whose interest in adopting those same children was denied."
"I have written evidence of many of these cases and stand happy to show them to anyone who wishes to see them."
"In contrast, my resolution also deals with the achievements of Romania in the economic field, where many structural reforms have been undertaken that we praise."
"But these must also and will need to be pursued most vigorously in the coming months and years. But we hope too that the Romanian Government will give greater prominence to the needs to the lower strata of society in Romania."
"In many areas simple, civilisational assets such as running water and sewage disposal systems are missing."
"Surely the preaccession process must also benefit the many millions of poverty stricken citizens."
"We in the European Parliament want to help them not just to survive, but to thrive."
"Only if the Romanian Government and its administration are willing to forego corruption in all its insidious forms can poverty ever be conquered in Romania."
"Honesty has not only a commercial value."
"Honesty provides the essential bond of trust between the state and citizen upon which democracy relies."
"The report also points out the developments in the area of developing and implementing the , where much still needs to be done to build up the administrative and judicial capacity not only to have laws on paper and in Parliament, but to ensure that they are implemented in such a way that they can play a real and positive role in the lives of citizens."
"This report as it stands was passed with unanimity in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy with no abstentions."
"This exceptional consensus across all parties regarding the main thrust of the report has already had a positive impact in Romania."
"The situation has changed, however."
"Already there has been root and branch reform of government with many new ministerial positions and responsibilities."
"Tomorrow I understand there will be a new children's law."
"I understand there is some hesitation and a little confusion among our Socialist colleagues – due to the swiftness of the changes in the situation in Romania – on how to vote."
"As the vote is now likely to be held tomorrow, I urge the PSE Group to have a new exchange of views on this so that I can fulfil my task as rapporteur and ensure that they have the fullest and most up-to-date information."
"After the vote, I will be calling upon the Commission to report back to Parliament on how the Commissioner's team will now proceed."
"I believe that such a report must come back to this Parliament before we rise for the European elections in May."
"I will also call upon the Council to accept the reality of Parliament's clear and unequivocal position."
"Council cannot simply continue along the old line that all is well in Romania and that entry in 2007 is the done deal that we have been told it is since Rome last year."
"This is not so."
"In the United Kingdom, the Parliament of which I also had the honour to be a member, is omnipotent and omnicompetent."
"I have no doubt that other national parliaments of EU Member States hold the same responsibilities."
"The European people have the final say."
"We all want Romania to join the European Union, but not at a price that is too high for the European citizens to pay."
"In conclusion, the European Parliament is a true friend of Romania."
"This strongly worded report has been compiled by Members of the European Parliament across the political divide, from all Member States and with Romania's best interests in our hearts."
"Bucharest must act on the report's recommendations if Romania is to succeed in membership of the European Union."
"I hope and I believe that it will do just that."
"With regard to the rapporteur's question regarding voting, ten co-rapporteurs will speak in today's debate; the spokesmen for the groups will speak; there will contributions from the Council and the Commission; 37 colleagues will also contribute."
"This is not surprising, given the nature of the issue at hand."
"However, when we break for the vote at midday, we shall not have concluded the speaking list and so the votes on these reports will be held over until tomorrow."
". – Mr President, at the outset I would like to thank Mr Brok for his very frank and interesting report on the accession states."
"I would also like to thank Mr Van Orden for his insightful report on Bulgaria, and Baroness Nicholson for her thorough and honest report on Romania."
"It is a great honour for me to participate, on behalf of the Council, in your debate on enlargement today."
"For many years, I lectured students in University College, Dublin, on the European Union and sought to impress upon them how remarkable our Union is."
"We are now on the eve of another remarkable breakthrough."
"Enlargement represents one of the most exciting and positive developments, not just in the history of the European Union but in European history as a whole."
"The ideal of a united, peaceful Europe is behind every effort at European integration over the past fifty years and this enlargement plays a significant part in making that peace a reality."
"In less than two months, the Union will welcome ten new Member States."
"For many years enlargement has been a mere aspiration; soon it will be realised."
"The European Union is rectifying a past wrong: the artificial division of Europe, which lasted for far too long after two appallingly disastrous world wars."
"As presidency, Ireland will be privileged to welcome the new Member States on behalf of the Union on 1 May."
"We look forward greatly to this day, which will be celebrated around Europe and which we in Ireland will celebrate throughout the country as a special 'Day of Welcomes' for our new partners."
"The new Member States have come through a long and difficult process to get where they are today."
"It is an exciting moment for them and for us."
"They have spent many years and made great efforts preparing for membership; the reform of their economic and political systems has been – to put it mildly – highly impressive."
"The countries of Central and Eastern Europe have very rapidly established stable democracies and functioning market systems."
"The deep reforms carried out were monitored and reviewed closely by the Commission in its regular reports throughout the period of negotiations and most recently in its monitoring reports."
"The Commission’s comprehensive monitoring reports, published last November, illustrate clearly the huge amount of work done in the new Member States."
"I wish to congratulate the Commission."
"In particular I want to congratulate Commissioner Verheugen for his excellent work, extraordinary dedication and excellent management of the whole process."
"More importantly, I want to compliment the new Member States for their efforts."
"However, while recognising that there have been many achievements to date, it is important not to become complacent."
"We encourage newly acceding states to continue their efforts for the final two months until accession: now is not a time to rest on their oars."
"We ask them to concentrate particularly on the areas identified by the Commission as requiring urgent attention and on the effective implementation and enforcement of measures already adopted."
"It goes without saying that the more work done now, the quicker the newly acceding Member States can benefit fully from membership."
"We are confident that any difficulties can and will be overcome."
"The Treaty of Accession contains a number of safeguard clauses designed to protect the Union from unforeseen disturbances arising as a result of accession."
"In addition, other measures are available to the Commission to protect the internal market, if necessary."
"The smooth and effective integration of the new Member States is one of the highest priorities of the Irish presidency."
"The hard work of the new Member States has been recognised, not only by the Commission in its regular and monitoring reports, but also by the excellent report drawn up by Mr Brok."
"The enlargement has been described as the best-prepared enlargement ever and I think that is a fair description of what has been done."
"Already the newly acceding Member States are sitting around the Council table and in Parliament."
"They participated fully, actively and very constructively in the work of the European Convention and in the ensuing Intergovernmental Conference on the Constitutional Treaty."
"The new Member States are already making valuable input to all aspects of the Union’s business and from 1 May, they will have full voting rights as well and will contribute fully to the formation of the Union’s policies."
"I believe they will make a remarkable impact on the way we do our business."
"Support among the new Member States for accession was demonstrated by the referenda which were held in nine of the ten countries throughout 2003."
"In addition, the process of ratification of the Treaty of Accession has seen the parliaments of many current Member States express strong support for enlargement."
"It is important to underline that enlargement is good not only for the newly acceding Member States but – as Mr Brok reminded us – it is also good for the present Member States."
"The Union as a whole stands to benefit."
"Of course, the process of enlargement does not end on 1 May."
"As we have been reminded, Bulgaria and Romania are both advanced in negotiations."
"I listened carefully to Mr Van Orden's report on Bulgaria, having met with Meglena Kuneva last week to discuss the position."
"I was also very interested to hear Baroness Nicholson's very frank and honest report."
"Last December, the European Council set out a very clear timeframe for the conclusion of negotiations in 2004 with both countries, subject of course to their individual state of readiness, with a view to their accession in January 2007."
"One of the key issues remaining to be agreed among Member States is the financial framework for accession of the two states."
"Since the Commission published its draft financial package in February, intensive negotiations have been underway to secure agreement among Member States, which the presidency is endeavouring to obtain by the March session of the General Affairs and External Relations Council."
"Reaching agreement on the financial package will permit the Union to carry forward the negotiations in the remaining finance-related chapters with both countries."
"The Irish presidency is striving to advance progress in accession negotiations to the greatest degree possible."
"The presidency will ensure that negotiations with both countries are governed by the same principles that guided negotiations with the ten new Member States, notably that of their own individual merits."
"It is worth recalling that Bulgaria and Romania are part of an irreversible inclusive enlargement process."
"The pace of negotiations will continue to be determined by progress on the ground and we urge Bulgaria and Romania to ensure full implementation of commitments undertaken to date."
"The Union will continue to monitor very closely the performance of both countries and has noted carefully the views of Parliament, as expressed in particular in the resolutions under consideration today."
"In conclusion, this enlargement is one of the most remarkable achievements of the Union to date."
"On behalf of the presidency of the Council, I wish to thank Parliament, and you the Members of Parliament, for the very positive and constructive approach taken since the very beginning of the process."
"We believe that the Union and its citizens stand to benefit greatly from this exciting endeavour."
"This is a remarkable moment, a defining moment in the history of Europe, and one in which we can all take considerable satisfaction."
". – Mr President, honourable Members, this is probably the last big debate of this Parliament on what is a really great and historic project, and for my part I would like to take the opportunity to thank your House most sincerely for its cooperation on this project, in particular the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, its chairman Mr Brok and the rapporteurs."
"We have seen what we can achieve – even with so great and difficult a task – when the institutions of the European Union have a clear common objective and when they are determined to work together to achieve it."
"I will not hide my great satisfaction at the fact that ten new Members will be acceding on 1 May and that we have completed this difficult process, but I cannot deny either that my satisfaction is mixed with a measure of concern."
"I cannot overlook the fact that a very broad debate on this enlargement is only now getting under way in the Member States – far too late, I think."
"For many years, I have repeatedly said in this House that this debate must be conducted in the Member States in order to inform people and take them along this road with us."
"Only now, when it is about to happen, has it made the European media headlines and become a number one issue for the European public."
"No one in this House will be surprised – I am not – that all the fears, the concerns and the feelings of uncertainty that we have known about for years and have tried to deal with by providing people with information are now surfacing again."
"Let me be very clear about this: the political elites in the Member States ought to have done more to make public opinion in the Member States understand this great historic task."
"I am saying this now quite deliberately and also with some bitterness because we really have pointed out often enough how necessary it is."
"There is still time."
"The message we have to get across to people is quite clear. Yes, this enlargement will create problems."
"This enlargement will force us to make adjustments."
"A lot of things will change completely from what we were used to."
"There was no sensible alternative, however."
"We had to do it."
"We had to accept our historic responsibility of shaping the great change in Europe in such a way politically that it will lead to greater peace, security and prosperity for the people."
"The message must be that this enlargement will not create problems but that it is the only way to solve the problems caused by the great changes that took place in Europe 14 or 15 years ago."
"Let me say this once again at the beginning of this debate because I really am convinced that the democratic quality of this process depends on Europe’s citizens understanding it and sharing the objective."
"So far as the state of preparedness of the ten countries that will be acceding on 1 May is concerned, ladies and gentlemen, we have kept you informed of the results of our monitoring."
"I informed the Heads of Government of the ten countries of the results of that monitoring last November and since then we have been working closely with those countries to solve these problems."
"There have now been further consultations with all ten countries in which we took stock."
"We found that progress has been made in all areas, in some cases remarkable progress."
"We are now receiving further information on further progress every day, and I therefore find a very positive trend over all as regards completion of the outstanding tasks."
"I do not want to hide the fact, however, that there are still problems in a few areas."
"That is true in particular for the creation of the necessary conditions for the payment of agricultural subsidies."
"Our system is obviously very complicated."
"Perhaps we could give some thought to whether the problem really is that the ten new Member States are not intelligent enough or not energetic enough to solve the problem, or whether it is perhaps rather that the system has now become so complicated that a country that has not grown up with it is unable to satisfy our requirements."
"I have come to have great doubts as to where the problem really lies, whether it is only with the future Member States or whether it is not also for a large part on our side."
"Another problematic issue remaining in most countries is food safety, the modernisation of food-processing establishments and their supervision for the protection of public health."
"My fellow-Commissioner Mr Byrne is in constant close contact with the relevant ministers."
"Here again I want to make it absolutely clear that the Commission guarantees there will be no compromises on food safety."
"Only products that meet our standards will come on to the internal market."
"The Commission will use the instruments it has available to solve outstanding problems realistically and responsibly."
"We are making preparations."
"I cannot yet tell you whether safeguards will have to be applied or not."
"The time for such a decision has not yet come."
"As I said, if it should be necessary we will do it realistically and responsibly and keep you informed."
"Let me now say a word about something that is particularly on the minds of all of us these days, namely Cyprus."
"If this question could still be solved before 1 May, then we would be fully justified in saying that enlargement not only prevents crises but that it also resolves crises and conflicts."
"That would be an incredibly important signal for the whole region."
"We can say that it was the European Union that got the peace process moving again and enabled the UN Secretary-General to call renewed talks."
"I was in Cyprus for the start of the talks on 19 February and had good discussions with the UN and the leaders of the two communities."
"Since then, there have been intensive political and technical contacts."
"The Commission has said from the outset that it now considers the Cyprus talks a top priority and we have therefore done all in our power to support the peace process."
"Commission experts are assisting the United Nations team in Cyprus."
"I have done everything the UN has asked."
"Whenever extra help was asked for, we always gave it right away."
"The technical level talks in Cyprus are going very well as a result, and we have also at long last begun to organise content-wise preparations for possible accession with the Turkish community."
"Late, I have to say, but the responsibility for that rests with Mr Denktash."
"We are now preparing the necessary legal instruments for the accession of a united Cyprus."
"We will need regulations for the gradual introduction of the in the north of the island."
"The use of Turkish as a new official language will require preparations, and we will not be able to get everything done by 1 May."
"We will therefore have to provide transitional periods in a number of areas."
"Let me say once again that we are in a position to transfer the results of the Cyprus talks into Community law provided those results do not run counter to the principles on which the European Union is founded, namely democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights."
"We are of course also setting conditions, and I will reiterate them: We need a new Cyprus that speaks with one voice."
"We need a new Cyprus that is capable of acting in international fora at all times and does not carry the risk of blocking them."
"We also need a new Cyprus whose central structures are strong enough to implement and enforce all its international obligations, including Community law."
"For us, these conditions are absolutely essential."
"We are willing to convene an international donors’ conference to help pay the costs of unification, and I urgently call on the two communities, the Turkish Cypriots and the Greek Cypriots, to take advantage of this unique opportunity and to give a signal of willingness for peace and reconciliation in this part of the world."
"I would now like to say something about Romania and Bulgaria."
"We will do all we can to assist the Presidency in continuing negotiations with the same tempo and the same quality and in bringing them to a conclusion within the proposed timetable."
"We have put the proposal for the common financial package for Bulgaria and Romania on the table."
"Discussions so far show that the Commission proposal has been well received over all."
"In the light of the financial package for the ten, the financial package for Bulgaria and Romania is fair, balanced and realistic."
"We shall present the concrete proposals for the negotiating positions in April."
"So far as Bulgaria is concerned, I agree with the assessment made by the rapporteur, Mr Van Orden, and would like to say for my part, too, that remarkable progress has been made."
"The country still has further efforts to make, especially in strengthening administrative and judicial capacities."
"We are concentrating on these areas in our cooperation with Bulgaria."
"Romania can also count on our assistance and solidarity."
"I have followed your debate very attentively and I admire the seriousness with which Parliament is working on the problems in Romania. I believe you have now struck a balance, which means that the report neither paints too rosy a picture nor calls into doubt the European Union’s political commitment to Romanian accession."
"That is good, because Romania needs encouragement, but it also needs a very clear answer to the question of what is still to be done."
"The Commission agrees with the rapporteur about the areas in which further efforts are required."
"These are administrative reform, reform of the legal system and preventing corruption, and I want to make it very clear that when it comes to fighting corruption the political system must be included."
"It is not enough to put petty officials on trial; their superiors must be in the dock as well."
"Romania also needs to be more convincing in its handling of European money and, before that, to prepare its negotiating positions better."
"Baroness Nicholson raised the subject of adoption."
"I want to make the Commission’s position on this clear again."
"Our policy is geared clearly and unequivocally to the welfare of the child."
"That is the opposite of a policy that serves the interests of families in all possible countries that are looking for children to adopt."
"This difference is crucial."
"Anyone whose focus is not the welfare of the child but the interests of families that are seeking to adopt and the non-governmental organisations that represent their interests is creating a market, and anyone creating a market can expect problems in Romania."
"That is why the Commission insists that there must be a moratorium on international adoptions until legislation is in force that is fully up to international standards on child protection and until administrative structures are in place to ensure that such legislation is enforced."
"The Commission, Parliament and the Member States still share the common objective of concluding negotiations in 2004, with accession in 2007."
"I am sure we will all do everything we can to help Romania and Bulgaria in this."
"The key to success, however, lies in Sofia and even more in Bucharest."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Verheugen has spoken of his concern that people in today’s European Union countries are not well enough informed."
"I share that concern, but I would like to ask what the alternative would be."
"The alternative – and we must tell people that – would be continuing lack of freedom, the continuation of a totalitarian regime."
"That is why we should be glad and grateful that the nations of Central Europe – and of course Cyprus and Malta – are joining our union of values under different circumstances, on the basis of human rights, democracy, the rule of law and the market economy."
"We wish the nations of Central Europe, Malta and Cyprus a warm welcome."
"It is an occasion for joy."
"Our group and the entire Parliament have always supported it."
"We will be having the first free elections in Europe."
"In the accession countries, our political friends and the people there refer to these European elections as Europe’s first free elections."
"That is why we must reject the call, from the prime minister of one of the accession countries, for there to be a single list."
"No, ladies and gentlemen; elections are a political competition and we should be glad that such competition is now possible in the countries of Central Europe, too."
"The enlargement of the European Union is, however, not just a material question."
"In essence, it is a question of values, a spiritual question."
"We should also be saying to our new partners in Central Europe, Malta and Cyprus: do not ask what you can get out of the European Union, but let us all in the present and future European Union ask ourselves what we can do for Europe together to make this Europe strong, to make this Europe democratic and to make this Europe carry weight in the world."
"I have great admiration for what the accession countries have already achieved."
"After more than 50 years of communism, these nations have had to make a tremendous effort."
"There is still a lot to be done, however."
"Commissioner Verheugen, Mr Brok and the other rapporteurs have already drawn our attention to that."
"I believe we will do it, however."
"We should put across to the people of the European Union that our experience with enlargement when Spain and Portugal joined shows that in the end everyone will gain, materially and economically too."
"Tremendous challenges remain in the area of internal security."
"I have just been talking to an expert on internal security from Europol."
"Of course we must secure the external borders."
"But that expert explained to me that the drugs mafia, which is already making trouble in the European Union, will also expand its activities to the accession countries."
"That means we must strengthen Europol and police cooperation as a whole."
"One final remark."
"Commissioner, you and this Commission still have to give an assessment of Turkey."
"Opinions in our Group differ over whether Turkey should become a member or not."
"I will not go into that now."
"However, we expect the Commission, we expect you, to make your assessment on the basis of the Copenhagen criteria and not to make a politically opportunistic recommendation, but to comply with the law."
"The Commission is bound to do so as guardian of the Treaties, and we will judge you by that yardstick."
"We will meet and discuss this matter again."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by fully associating the Socialist Group with the remarks of Commissioner Verheugen in relation to Cyprus; no doubt my colleague Mr Poos will say more about that later."
"I have always argued that this enlargement is going to make or break the European Union."
"If we handle it well, it will greatly strengthen the Union."
"A recent report by the economists Ernst [amp] Young in the United Kingdom showed the benefits the United Kingdom would receive from enlargement."
"However, if it is handled badly, it will seriously damage the Union."
"Thus there is still a lot at stake in making sure that we get it right."
"That is why it is so crucial for the applicant countries to fully meet the standards required because, if they do not, we run the risk of having a backlash in public opinion not only in the 15 but also in the 10."
"We still need greater emphasis – as Mr Brok stated in the report – on implementation and enforcement."
"We must have proper transparency on state aid, competition policy and public procurement because, if enlargement is to work, the business community and trade unions have to be convinced that there will be fair play."
"We must not relax our drive against corruption."
"Corruption undermines economic progress."
"The EU country defined by Transparency International as being the least corrupt is Finland."
"The EU country with the most successful economy is Finland."
"The two things are closely related."
"The culture of the brown envelope passing between ministers and senior officials has no part to play in a modern, dynamic economy."
"However, the candidate countries also have to realise that by joining the European Union they are committing themselves to the standards of the European Union, such as democracy and human rights."
"That is why I was so horrified to see in Lithuania that the leading daily newspaper has been publishing crude anti-Semitic and homophobic articles, the first of which, on 20 February, contained a cartoon on the front page which is straight out of the Nazi propaganda of the 1930s."
"Such sentiments have no place in the European Union: racism and xenophobia are cancers that destroy our society."
"They have done so in the past and will do so again if we drop our guard."
"We completely condemn these articles."
"I regret the time it took for the Lithuanian media and authorities to take action and to respond."
"I hope the Council and the Commission also condemn those articles."
"We must recognise the difficulties that some applicant countries have faced and that they have made enormous progress in a very short period of time."
"That is why we have always had a very balanced approach and recognised the efforts that the candidate countries have made."
"That is why I regret the tone of the original Nicholson report on Romania."
"We have always said that each country should be judged on its merits and has to meet the standards or we will vote not to admit them."
"We have never said the negotiations should be suspended in the middle of a process."
"We know that there are serious problems Romania has to address."
"We know that past governments did not treat these negotiations seriously, but the current government does and it is making major efforts to catch up, as Baroness Nicholson herself has admitted."
"Thus our message should be to encourage Romania to intensify its efforts, not to try to pull the rug from underneath its feet at this crucial moment."
"I fear, given some of the misleading information in the original report, that party politics have more of a role to play than objectivity."
"The new countries have a right to criticise the European Union."
"We have been very niggardly in relation to the free movement of labour."
"I am appalled at the dreadful populist campaign – which has often been racist – run by sections of the European press."
"I am even more appalled at certain politicians who have jumped on the bandwagon, including, I am ashamed to say, the British Conservative Party, which said it supported enlargement, has never raised this issue in the past and then started to dance to the tune of its tabloid masters."
"I hope that when reality – rather than mythology – rears it head after 1 May, Member States can start to ease these restrictions."
"I hope that on 1 May we will enter into a brave new world of solidarity and cooperation, not of recriminations and national tensions. We need these countries to work together on economic reform to boost jobs."
"We need these countries to work together with us to stop multinational crime. We need these countries to work with us to deal with the problem of people trafficking – the 21st century version of slavery."
"Together we can strengthen Europe."
"If we can do that, we will have a lot to celebrate."
"That is what we should be aiming for on 1 May."
"– Mr President, there are now only fifty days remaining of the long journey that began with the scenes of joy on 9 November 1989 under the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin."
"In fifty days, Europe will become a united continent, and almost half a billion people will join together to work towards a better and fairer world and to defend European values and together solve common problems: pollution, cross-border crime and, in particular, trafficking in human beings, which everyone has mentioned."
"EU enlargement is a fantastic example of what we can achieve when we have a clear goal and a clear strategy in the EU."
"With EU membership as a tempting goal, and hard work on their part, the former communist dictatorships have now become fully functioning democracies and market economies."
"Potential membership has also contributed to the work of reform in Turkey and to the possibility of perhaps finally solving the Cyprus problem."
"Naturally, there remain a great many problems, which Elmar Brok also pointed out in his excellent report."
"The EU will change dramatically in the next few years, and the main task during the next term of office will be to make this enlarged Europe work."
"It is therefore extremely important that the Convention’s proposal is actually carried out so that the EU can take decisions and function democratically."
"The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is always particularly concerned about minority rights, which is why we are greatly worried by the unrest within the Roma group in Slovakia."
"The cuts in social benefits hit this group particularly hard, and we hope that the Commission can continue to monitor the Roma situation in both the old and the new Member States."
"Finally, I too regret that we are building walls between ourselves and the new Member States in the shape of various types of transitional rules."
"One country after another is now introducing more or less discriminatory regulations based on fears that seem completely unfounded and are eagerly encouraged by the press in certain countries."
"Instead of hindering freedom of movement, we should welcome the fact that it embraces more and more people."
"Mr President, Mr Verheugen and I are not, presumably, in much agreement, politically, about a lot of things, but I have to say that I have seldom heard so good and precise a description of the problems we are now to face. Nor have I heard so good and precise a description of our need to find a solution to our problems."
"I believe that the lack of popular involvement and the lack of commitment on the part of the political elite is one of the reasons why we now see more and more Member States choosing to introduce restrictions in relation to workers from the new Member States."
"That is something I deeply regret."
"I think it is the wrong signal to send to our new friends and colleagues from Eastern and Central Europe."
"I am tired of people typically proceeding on the basis of populism and of unreliable figures and information about the way things really are."
"I am also pleased that, in the course of enlargement, many forces have been deployed in monitoring the human rights situations in the candidate countries, and I think that this is one of those areas in which we cannot allow ourselves to relax, either now or after 1 May."
"We need constantly to monitor the situation."
"We know that there are problems for the Russian minority in Latvia."
"We know that the Roma have problems in many of the candidate countries, and we also know that they have problems too in the present Member States."
"My recommendation is that we do what we once did in the Council of Europe when that institution admitted quite a lot of new Member States, namely introduce permanent monitoring of democracy, human rights and minority rights, and not only in the new countries but in all the EU Member States."
"That is what we need to do, Mr President."
"It will be an important task to persist in monitoring these areas."
"Mr President, in my contribution, I should like to focus on Romania, and I have three reasons for doing so."
"The first is that the present discussion on Romania is, in my view, the best possible barometer of the current enlargement round."
"Indeed, what is evident from this discussion is that the main problems in the new Member States are not related to the fisheries chapter or the transport chapter, important and interesting though these may be."
"The most persistent problems in the new Member States have to do with the functioning of the constitutional state, the independence of the judiciary and freedom of expression of opinion."
"This brings me to my second reason, provided that other Members allow me to carry on, Mr President, for noise levels are rather high at the moment."
"The discussion on Romania is also of major importance for future enlargement rounds including Turkey and the Balkans, and for the reason that we cannot very well insist in Ankara and Zagreb on an improvement of human rights or the rights of minorities if, at the same time, we allow the situation in Bucharest to remain at a standstill and, in fact, to change for the worse in a number of respects."
"So to my third point, which is that the situation in Romania itself remains problematic."
"To this day, the reform of the constitutional state is in its infancy."
"To this day, it is impossible for critical journalists to do their jobs."
"To this day, corruption is an enormous problem right up to the highest political level."
"In her report, Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne is right to take a critical view of this."
"To the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I would say that advocates of enlargement, even more than its opponents, have a duty to be critical, and they must also remain so."
"It is encouraging to see, Mr President, that precisely this critical stance is bearing fruit."
"Over the past few days, the Romanian Government has announced new reforms and accelerated the old ones."
"The Justice Minister has had to step down because he is held responsible for the stagnation."
"I would urge the Romanian Government to carry on with the reforms, for if it does not, it may as well forget about joining in 2007."
"My appeal to NGOs and journalists is to carry on with their critical work and keep us informed."
"Mr President, the European Union is good at influencing countries by dangling a carrot in front of them, but sometimes an educational rap on the knuckles does wonders too."
"Mr President, who longs for a Europe that is divided into two opposing camps?"
"Who begrudges the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe their personal and national freedom?"
"Their liberation was late in coming; it took until 1989, and our continent will acclaim it on 1 May, the day of the EU's eastward enlargement, of which all those involved are firm advocates, whilst, at the same time, bearing a heavy responsibility."
"Now that the usefulness of a greatly expanding European Union is the subject of a public debate, politicians in the East and the West need, first of all, to work towards the consolidation and creation of solid constitutional states."
"This creates a national sense of public responsibility, the very foundation for Europe-wide cooperation."
"Only a few decades ago, a major authority on Central and Eastern Europe, Mr Hugh Seton-Watson, referred to that region as the sick heart of Europe, for which may the enlarged EU soon show itself to be an effective medicine."
"This requires a considerable mutual effort, a sincere attending to each other's needs."
"It is precisely this involvement that I have noticed among grassroots support."
"My group and I wish to continue on that entirely Christian course."
"Mr President, nobody can deny the fact that the ten future Member States have done an impressive amount of work as the day of their accession draws near, but any euphoria would be misplaced."
"There are still many problems left unsolved."
"For example, in its recommendation with regard to this report, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has expressed its disquiet at the large-scale corruption in the agricultural sector and at the way in which subsidies will be paid."
"Another problem is Cyprus."
"We are facing the unique situation that part of a future Member State is under the military occupation of a candidate Member State, Turkey."
"To date, we are uncertain as to whether the entire island will be joining the EU."
"Another big question mark is the immigration that may originate in the new Member States."
"Although most of the present Member States have announced a transitional measure, the question remains of to what extent this will be adhered to."
"I hope that I am wrong, but the figures used by the Commission lead me to believe that the problem is being grossly underrated, just like the other problems that enlargement will trigger."
"Most of the new Member States are not yet ready for accession."
"Everyone knows that, but hardly anyone dares say so out loud."
"Jacques Delors is one of the few who has said it, and for that he deserves all credit."
"The debate is suspended. It will continue at 3 p.m."
"We shall now proceed to the signing of the amending budgets for the financial year 2004, which we voted yesterday."
"The first amending budget, No 1, is a supplementary and amending budget that relates to enlargement."
"It is the first enlargement budget of the European Union."
"It commits EUR 11.7 billion by way of commitment appropriations and EUR 5.1 billion in 2004 by way of payment appropriations."
"The second amending budget voted yesterday was a supplementary and amending budget on the European Data Protection Supervisor."
"I invite the rapporteurs, Mr Mulder and Mrs Gill, Mr Wynn, the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Commissioner Verheugen and Minister Roche to join me in the signing ceremony of those two budgets, not least to mark – as we debate enlargement – the fact that we are now providing for it financially for the first time in the European budgetary process."
"The next item is the vote."
"Mr President, regardless of whether there is an error in the text of Amendment No 1 presented by my Group, I would like to make it perfectly clear that the objective of this amendment is to establish a delegation within the EU-Chile Mixed Parliamentary Committee independent of the Delegation for Relations with Mercosur."
"We shall make sure that the text is corrected."
"Mr President, I should like to propose that we replace the words, ‘USA’s invasion of Afghanistan’ by the words, ‘the conflict in Afghanistan’."
"That concludes the vote."
". This proposal is extremely important in two fundamental areas: it both enhances safety in the management and the use of the sea and also contributes to reducing pollution."
"Because of the type of vessel it targets, the proposal for a regulation is also crucial, since its scope is extended to cover vessels operating in domestic, as well as international waters within the Community."
"The Commission has done a good job and on this I offer it my congratulations."
"Incidentally, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has used this report to propose that its proposal for a regulation should also be adopted."
"What we have here are measures that might at first glance appear to be highly technical, but once carefully analysed, prove to be crucial to achieving the stated aim."
"It should be remembered that security in transport, not only in maritime transport but also in air and road transport has always been one of the European Union’s top priorities and this is reflected in the legislation that has been adopted, particularly in the last decade."
"For this reason and because I am quite happy with the thrust of the proposal, I voted in favour"
". The report concerns an issue that is very close to my heart."
"I have called for a long time for a serious approach to developing rail transport, mainly because I believe that this is a perfectly viable alternative to the road transport sector, which has already reached saturation point."
"This is precisely the aim of the agreement that the rapporteur is asking us to approve."
"The Community’s accession to the Convention concerning International Carriage by Rail (COTIF), is thus crucial to promoting, improving and facilitating international rail transport."
"This agreement is also important for the benefits it provides from the technical and legal points of view."
"Another positive aspect of signing up to COTIF is the fact that the European Community does not have to contribute to the budget of this organisation, despite the fact that it does not have a say in its decisions."
"Because I believe that concluding the agreement in question will result in considerable progress in developing the rail sector and because this is something for which I have been fighting for many years, I am voting in favour of this report."
"I agree, albeit in the long term, and in light of the criteria set by the European Council and of the progress made on implementing the Stabilisation and Association Process, with the idea of fully integrating the countries of the Western Balkans, namely Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Serbia and Montenegro, including Kosovo, into the European Union. This report also seeks to establish European Partnerships in order to be able to set about preparing these countries for this full integration into the European Union, and so I voted in favour of it."
"I did so with all the more conviction because the report makes two key observations: one, concerning the requirement to consult the countries in question; the other, on the financial resources available for helping these countries to implement the priorities and objectives that have been identified, an observation based on the financial perspective currently in force."
"It should be added that the report calls for the underlying legal basis to be adjusted to ensure that the priorities and conditions of European Partnerships are appropriately funded, and that the European Parliament is kept duly informed of any adjustments to the European Partnerships, enabling it closely to monitor their implementation and their achievements."
". The aims of this Commission proposal could not be clearer: to remove the cross-border tax obstacles that not only hamper company cross-border mobility within the European Union, particularly that of multinationals, but also to allow a policy of company restructuring and relocation that favours tax relief or, viewed from another angle, that provides the greatest tax benefits."
"This is something that clearly underlies the creation of common tax rules under the European Company Statute, ensuring that its activities are not hampered by discriminatory tax rules or by restrictions or distortions arising from the tax provisions of Member States."
"In other words, at a time when so much is said about reducing the tax burden on labour, Member States are being allowed to provide tax relief for capital, as they see fit."
"The key issue concerns Member States’ tax sovereignty and the risks inherent in eroding the tax burden."
"Nevertheless, account must also be taken of the use of taxation as a tool for scrutinising and monitoring business activities, specifically in the field of mergers, in this case cross-border mergers, and of the company restructuring of major financial groups in the European Union."
"The main aim of this directive is to extend the scope of this issue, which undermines the protection of the financial interests of the Member States, and this is clearly something that we must reject."
".In line with the objectives of the Lisbon process, which provide for greater cross-border mobility for EU companies, the Commission has submitted a proposal intended to remove the obstacles relating to the methods of taxing companies in the internal market (cross-border tax obstacles)."
"Directive 90/434/EEC (known as the ‘Merger Directive’) already provides for a solution regarding a common system of taxation applicable to mergers, divisions, transfers of assets and exchanges of shares in cases where these involve different Member States, but the Directive needs improvement, and its scope needs to be enlarged."
"This new proposal tries to amend the Merger Directive to reduce instances of international double taxation when industries enter business restructurings in which companies of different Member States are involved."
"These specific measures seek to solve the most urgent practical tax problems faced by companies operating internationally, until a common tax base is achieved."
"I therefore voted in favour."

"These specific measures seek to solve the most urgent practical tax problems faced by companies operating internationally, until a common tax base is achieved."
"I therefore voted in favour."
"We are very keen that the directive on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States come into force as soon as possible."
"We therefore support the decision reached in the Council."
"The Council proposal rejected the Commission and EP proposal in some areas. To be specific:"
"- it reduced from six to three months the period in which a citizen of one Member State can reside in another Member State without any conditions applying, thus upholding the current situation;"
"- it extends the required duration of marriages or registered partnerships to a minimum of three years in order for individuals not to lose their residency permit in the event of separation or divorce, with a few exceptions;"
"- the definition of ‘family’ gives no consideration to unmarried couples, only to registered partnerships if the provisions of the host State treat unmarried couples in the same way as married couples."
"The issue of unmarried couples is left to the discretion of the host Member State and, consequently, the descendents and direct ascendants of citizens who do not hold citizenship of a European Union country are excluded from the directive;"
"- a new criterion is introduced for repatriation, relating to the excessive burden on the social security system of the host country."
"Hence the four proposals that we presented in an attempt to solve these problems. I am sorry to say that they were all rejected."
"– We fully support individuals’ right to freedom of movement as one of the fundamental freedoms in the internal market."
"We are concerned that country after country is introducing transitional rules for the new Member States."
"There is now a risk that we shall have to live with these transitional rules, which discriminate against the new Member States, for 10-20 years to come."
"The transitional rules are being introduced on the grounds that there is a risk that the present Member States’ benefit systems will be misused when the borders are opened to the new EU citizens this spring."
"At the present time, it is sufficient for people to be employed for ten hours a week in order to gain access to their new country’s welfare system."
"The requirement should instead be that people can support themselves by working."
"We have therefore pushed for a number of general measures, covering all EU citizens, amending the definition of ‘work’ to the effect that it must be sufficient to support the person concerned."
"This already applies to pensioners and students."
"The EU would then be open to the free movement of labour, but not to benefit abuse."
"We are also doubtful about the definition of ‘family member’, which should be broadened to include spouse, registered partner or unmarried cohabiting partner, regardless of gender."
"If we do not get support for this, we choose to vote against the report."
"At the first reading of the proposal for a common position, I felt obliged to vote against it, because I was unhappy that the report was undermined by the heavy-handedness of the proposals, which mainly received the votes of the left-leaning Members of the parliamentary committee. The proposals detract from the rapporteur’s much more balanced approach."
"The European Parliament opted, then, for an approach that was frankly excessive, which far exceeded what is necessary in this area."
"At this second reading, the Commission has seen fit to adopt most of the European Parliament’s proposals for amendments although it has not done the same for family policies, which have clearly been excluded from Community sphere of competence, and this is to be welcomed."
"I still hold to other observations and reservations that I expressed at first reading."
"As regards the amendments tabled by the Communist left, I voted against."
". Whilst I welcome the fact that that there is a programme in this area, it is appalling that significant increases in support for youth organisations are regularly turned down."
"I understand the position of the rapporteur, who, faced with the Council’s intransigence, did not wish to jeopardise the programme’s entering into force on the date set. I am appalled, however, by the Council’s unacceptable position, which undermines the role of youth organisations."
"Support for youth associations must not be allowed to dwindle; such bodies have a vital role to play in the education of young people, in the way that they encourage participation and extend democracy."
"If we do not increase support, we are giving out the signal that we have no intention to broaden the field of youth participation, and this is a deplorable state of affairs."
". This report is of special importance to the area of youth."
"Its purpose is to establish a Community action programme to promote bodies active at European level in the field of youth and, more specifically, by approving an action programme, to provide an appropriate legal base for Community grants already awarded in the sector."
"I should like to highlight the 13% increase in the programme budget agreed between Parliament and the Council on 24 November."
"While the Council has always appeared decidedly reticent on the issue, it should be noted that it adopted in full, in part or in essence, 13 of the 16 Parliament amendments tabled at first reading and subsequently adopted by the Commission."
"I voted in favour of the proposed package, as I welcome the unanimous vote achieved in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport."
". The report before us dovetails with the Prets report."
"It is a further draft resolution in the field of youth, education and training, which, in common with the previous report, enjoyed the support of all committee members."
"In this case, education and training – also questions that are worthy of attention – are brought to the fore."
"The Council reached a unanimous agreement, after acting on Parliament’s opinion."
"The amendments to the Commission’s proposal tabled by the Council resulted in a clearer, more consistent text. The budget available to the programme has been increased."
"I welcome the rapporteur’s remarks, and I therefore voted in favour."
"I voted in favour of the package of amendments, which have given substance to the common position."
".– This proposal strikes us as being worthy of condemnation in various respects, not only the damage it does to subsidiarity and its failure to respect the Member States’ competence in the educational sphere."
"Firstly, it is not desirable that an exception should be made to the Budget rules by delaying the signature of conventions; thought needs to be given to prompt compliance with them."
"Secondly, it is not healthy for the Community budget to fund, year in year out, a European clone of the political science faculties to help supply a bureaucracy that harms democracy and political debate, whilst claiming, sometimes perhaps in good faith, to stimulate them."
"Finally, the colleges and institutes that benefit have, ever since they were set up, been closely linked with the small world of the Community institutions whose cause they enthusiastically promote and which they systematically supply with ideas on European affairs to such an extent that one cannot exclude the risk of clientelism, exclusive dependence and confusion of roles."
"The MEPs belonging to the CPNT delegation within the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities therefore voted against this resolution, which defends an elitist project for a uniform Europe, out of touch with its citizens’ aspirations but oppressing them with its decisions as they go about their daily lives."
".I congratulate the rapporteurs, Ms Pack and Ms Prets, for their thorough work on the important issues of European policy in the areas of youth, education and training."
"These reports dovetail nicely with yesterday’s Commission communication on 'The new generation of education and training programmes' setting out future programmes intended to replace the current Socrates, Leonardo da Vinci, Tempus, Youth, Culture 2000 and Media Plus from 2007."
"I fully agree with Commissioner Reding on the need to reinforce and restructure programmes which are clearer to the citizens of an enlarged European Union."
"These new programmes will also enable institutions in the fields of education, training and culture to improve cooperation."
"They also coincide with the Irish presidency plans as outlined in the Culture Committee in January."
"They will contribute to achieving the Lisbon objective, namely of making Europe the most competitive knowledge-based economy by 2010."
"In a Union which will have nearly 500 million inhabitants in 2007, the new programmes will form part of a new approach, building bridges between cultures and individuals."
". I welcome this report, which is intended to establish a Community action programme to promote bodies active at European level in the field of culture and, more specifically, by approving an action programme, to provide an appropriate legal base for Community grants already awarded in the sector."
"The rapporteur’s recommendations – that Parliament should accept the common position with some amendments – are merely technical, and are essentially the result of the fact that the political agreement reached at the ‘Culture’ Council was superseded by the concessions granted by the finance ministers at the budgetary conciliation process that was concluded later."
"Given that the Council’s official position is, however, that the agreement reached by the ministers of culture should form the basis of the common position, Parliament must amend the Council’s common position, in order that the agreement obtained by the ministers of culture corresponds to the agreement reached between Parliament and the Council at the budgetary conciliation process."
"In view of both the general consensus regarding the common position and the technical nature of the amendments proposed by the rapporteur at second reading, I voted in favour."
"We have chosen to abstain in the vote on the Prets/Pack/Iivari reports."
"The reason for this is that we consider that issues of culture and education should be dealt with at national level where the decisions are taken as close to the citizens as possible."
"We object on principle to the Pack report’s choosing a small number of schools to receive a large proportion of the total education grant from the EU."
"We think there are many other good schools that should be taken into consideration."
"For the EU to become more effective and efficient in relation to the big cross-border issues, the politics of everyday issues such as schools, the arts and youth issues must be left to the Member States."
"These issues must be considered at a level that is closer to the citizens."
"– Mr President, deriving its inspiration from the Greens and from the health fanatics, a majority has voted not only against the growing of tobacco but also – it is not clear why – against the cultivation of olive groves."
"All this is prompted by the simple logic according to which tobacco causes lung cancer, so all that needs to be done to do away with lung cancer is to stop growing the stuff."
"It is an unfortunate fact that 75% of the tobacco smoked in Europe, amounting to 540 000 tonnes, is imported, in particular from Brazil, and so banning our 350 000 tonnes of European tobacco, 25 000 tonnes of which come from France, will have no effect on cancer whatever."
"On the contrary, it will put a question mark over 50 000 French jobs, at Sarlat, Tonneins, Lille and elsewhere."
"In Europe, a total of 500 000 jobs are at risk, many of them being done by women – who, in any case have fewer resources and are hence less able to fight against cancer."
"What is the reasoning behind this hastily cobbled-together policy?"
"It is that the European Commission has no love for tobacco-growers, winegrowers, olive farmers and the people who work the land."
"Brussels is all in favour of preferential treatment for foreign agriculture, and so it even prefers lung cancer to be imported."
"Mr President, I am very pleased that today we have managed to vote on the new rules for the organisation of the market in tobacco."
"The proposal that Parliament has made with partial decoupling is the right road because the decisions of the 2003 Luxembourg Council provided for partial decoupling for all market organisations."
"As Mr Maaten said, far more than 400 000 jobs are affected."
"I would like to make one more thing quite clear here."
"If anyone thinks that everyone would stop smoking if no more tobacco were grown in Europe, he is dreaming."
"Tobacco would then be imported and we would only damage the European economy, in other words, farmers and workers."
"Mr President, I disagree with the last two speakers."
"Backing this report is a very sad day for this House."
"I would like to focus my remarks on tobacco."
"I believe the Commission's reform package is fair."
"The proposed schemes remove direct support for a product that is the biggest cause of preventable illness and disease across the EU."
"Half a million EU citizens die each year because of tobacco-related illness and disease – that is a million throughout Europe."
"EU citizens find it deeply offensive that nearly EUR 1000 million a year go to funding a crop that nobody would buy if it were not subsidised; a crop that does nothing but harm its consumers."
"Today's approval of the Daul report does nothing for European citizens' health."
"It is a disappointing day for this Parliament and I am glad that 215 Members voted against this report and against tobacco subsidies."
"We chose to vote against all proposed amendments to the Commission proposal and against the report as a whole."
"We would like to see modern European agriculture in line with the common agricultural policy reforms."
"We consider the Commission proposal to be a step toward reaching the goals relating to the Union’s agricultural policy."
"We support a radical reform of agricultural policy with the decoupling of agricultural aid as the main goal."
"We therefore support the Commission proposal."
"To support the wording of the report would be to take a large step backwards in the work to reform European agriculture since Parliament’s wording promotes continued direct aid and production-linked aid to far too great an extent."
"The aim of the EU’s agricultural policy is to grant farmers greater freedom to produce what the market demands, which would lead to production being adapted to the consumer."
"This is particularly important from an international perspective in order not to render competition on the European market more difficult for the developing countries with their agricultural products."
"For us, these are important principles that must be taken into consideration in the Union’s agricultural policy, particularly in relation to cotton and tobacco."
"We Moderates are of the opinion that direct support for the production of tobacco, olives, cotton and hops should be phased out."
"European support for tobacco production is neither morally nor economically defensible."
"We are also of the opinion that protective import duties on olives should be removed."
". On behalf of the seven Radical Members, we intend to declare our support for the amendments tabled by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development with regard to the support system for the tobacco-growing sector."
"We consider it necessary and urgent to replace the current common policy, which is needlessly costly for European taxpayers and consumers, harmful to the environment and for the very competitiveness and innovation of the agricultural sector and detrimental to the economies of the poorest countries."
"In this context, the CAP reform proposed by the Commission based on the decoupling of subsidies and production, although totally inadequate, is a step in the right direction."
"Nevertheless, we do not support harsh discriminatory treatment to the detriment of tobacco growing expressly based on a ‘prohibitionist’ approach to the smoking phenomenon."
"Furthermore, we support the rapporteur’s position according to which eliminating aid for tobacco producers in no way amounts to combating smoking."
". Production aid in the olive oil, tobacco and cotton sector must be maintained if we are to prevent many producers from abandoning the sector, and if the specific characteristics of Mediterranean products are not to fall by the wayside."
"The Commission’s proposal for decoupling production aid, which has now also been approved by Parliament, is unacceptable and does not augur well for the discussions at the Council of Agriculture Ministers."
"This proposal will have a devastating socio-economic impact and will lead to desertification, particularly in the poorest regions of EU Member States, such as in Portugal."
"In the case of cotton, the threshold for aid is set at a preposterous 360 hectares, in spite of the potential benefits of the Alqueva project and of the conversion of barren areas into irrigated land. In the case of olive oil, the financial package and methodology that have been established undermine both the modernisation of Portuguese olive groves and the new plantation rights set at 30 000 hectares, which were agreed in 1998; this despite the intended savings of EUR 113 million."
"The proposal would entail increasing the financial envelope for Portugal by some EUR 20 million."
"Yet the most worrying consequence of this proposal would be the number of producers leaving the sector in Portugal, which would happen, according to various studies."
"Hence our vote against."
". The Daul report has received the consensus of Alleanza Nazionale, as an acceptable compromise has been reached between the various political groups of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, thanks to the work carried out by Mr Berlato to modify the Commission’s original proposal."
"Our objective, with regard to a proposal which would also have endangered the Italian position of oil in certain disadvantaged areas, was an agreement which provides for a flexible 60% partial decoupling of aid, with the States having the opportunity to increase this percentage if necessary."
"Together with other groups, the AN supported and obtained the introduction, in addition to landscape and social criteria, of a quality criterion, along with measures such as Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) and organic production, hand-harvesting and other measures which do not relate to quantity."
"The quality of the product is a guarantee for consumers and protects the specific types of agriculture of certain European States."
"We are therefore satisfied that the specific Italian characteristics with respect to the production of high quality olive oil are tangibly recognised, and we welcome the support mechanisms for olive growers, which safeguard employment levels in rural areas that are being depopulated and introduce important measures to guarantee quality European oil."
"This is why I voted for the Daul report."
"I have voted against all the amendments and, in the final vote, against the report since we are of the opinion that the EU is wrong to continue with, and give more aid to, tobacco plantations, olive groves and cotton production than was indicated in the Commission’s original proposal."
"We think that these subsidies should be phased out and the taxpayers’ money used more appropriately."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats sees increased subsidies as a problem of principle and, where tobacco is concerned, there are strong ethical arguments against the aid."
"Since many developing countries are entirely reliant on cotton production, EU aid distorts the competition."
"These countries are even less well placed than regions within the EU to solve the transitional problems that arise if part of the production is stopped."
". – The reform of the common market organisations for Mediterranean products follows on logically from the reform of the common agricultural policy inaugurated in Luxembourg in June 2003, being similarly based on the decoupling of aid and the transfer of funds to the second pillar."
"The CPNT delegation has always opposed this reform and continues to make its opposition to it extremely clear."
"Particularly in the tobacco sector, the decoupling of aid will bring about the end of this activity, which has, up until now, provided many jobs."
"What will become of these agricultural workers when their strength is no longer required?"
"Rural development is not about killing off a sector, but rather about maintaining jobs in order to keep our countryside alive."
"Given the choice between the total and partial decoupling of aid, we would prefer aid to be partially decoupled; were we to be asked to choose between this reform being implemented at once or deferring it, we would prefer a further short respite."
"This is why, faced with the Commission’s proposals, we are resigned to having to vote in favour of the rapporteur’s text."
"It is in this state of mind, fearful and yet still no less combative, that we see the forthcoming reform of the common market organisation for sugar looming ahead of us."
". – By declaring itself to be in favour of an upper limit for the decoupling of public aid to European tobacco growers, the European Parliament has done belated homage to those who fought against the inception of this perverse mechanism dreamt up by the Commission in order to obtain – successfully, as we know – the WTO’s blessing on income support payments."
"In fact, by opting for decoupling, the European Union has chosen a system that is bound to hinder young people at the start of their working life, to throw the markets into chaos and to deprive public aid of its legitimacy."
"In the case of tobacco, the Commission has in any case anticipated the disappearance of aids that decoupling will bring about, by openly proposing total decoupling in preparation for the complete banning of public aid."
"Brussels was thus establishing real ‘foreign preference’ and benefiting non-European tobacco producers."
"The counter-proposal from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which the plenary has just adopted, limits environmental degradation while recoupling most of the aid and acknowledging the real subsidiarity of the Member States."
"The ball is now back in the Council’s court; from now on, it can rely on the work Parliament has done towards preserving tobacco-growing in Europe, and especially in France."
"We chose to vote against Amendments Nos 1-28, 30-39 and 40-43 to the Commission proposals and against the report as a whole."
"We would like to see modern European agriculture in line with the common agricultural policy reforms."
"We consider the Commission proposal to be a step toward reaching the goals relating to the Union’s agricultural policy."
"We support a radical reform of agricultural policy with the decoupling of agricultural aid as the main goal."
"We therefore support the Commission proposal."
"To support the wording of Parliament’s report would be to take a large step backwards in the work to reform European agriculture since Parliament’s wording promotes continued direct aid and production-linked aid to far too great an extent."
"The aim of the EU’s agricultural policy is to grant farmers greater freedom to produce what the market demands, which would lead to production being adapted to the consumer."
"This is particularly important from an international perspective in order not to render competition on the European market more difficult for the developing countries with their agricultural products."
"For us, these are important principles that must be taken into consideration in the Union’s agricultural policy."
". Parliament has approved a number of amendments to the regulation before us, which have made substantial improvements to the Commission’s original proposal."
"I naturally welcome these amendments."
"The most important of these are the Community-level prohibition of the production and marketing of blends of olive oil with other oils or fats, essential to ensuring the quality of olive oil; the prohibition of the term ‘olive oil’ – or any other image or symbol suggesting olive oil, on the label or in information to the consumer – from being used to describe any blend of fats or oils, in order to combat unfair competition; the compulsory indication of the origin of olives, based on the country of harvest; and the retention of production refunds for canned fish and canned vegetables."
"It was essential for the Council to act on Parliament’s opinion in this area, but Parliament has not proposed effective mechanisms for regulating the market and has accepted the end of production aid."
"We deplore the rejection of our group’s proposal, which would, at least, have protected some production-based aid – linked to the quantity of olive oil actually produced, and not to the hectare."
"I am pleased that our proposal to retain the current monitoring bodies was approved, but regret the fact that all of the others were rejected."
". The proposals in the Lavarra report make no reference whatsoever to the negative changes being promoted with the mid-term review or to olive oil because, as it says, it considers it a , in which case all that remains is to regulate certain aspects of the olive oil market."
"That is why all his amendments, which are positive in almost their entirety (such as the abolition of the practice of mixing olive oil with other fatty substances) are limited to that."
"We radically disagree with the logic of considering the mid-term review for olive oil as a foregone conclusion and with the substance of the review, in other words with the uncoupling of a significant proportion of subsidies from production, freezing olive production at the levels of 1 May 1998, reducing Community appropriations for olive oil and so on."
"The Commission proposal should hardly even constitute the basis for debate in the European Parliament and should be rejected in its entirety, because it creates a situation which is far worse than the current situation and does not under any circumstances satisfy olive producers."
"We voted against the report, despite its individual positive points, because it accepts the mid-term review for olive oil as a foregoing conclusion."
"The Communist Party of Greece calls on olive producers to fight so that the review is not implemented in practice, so that ceilings on olive production are abolished and so that subsidies are paid on actual production and to put a stop to the mockery and derision of olive producers."
"In the report before us, I welcome the proposed amendments calling for a more satisfactory oil classification system; for the prohibition of blends of olive oil with other oils or fats; for compulsory indication on labels of the origin of the olives, with origin being determined on the basis of the tree and the place of harvesting, and not the place of pressing and processing (which gives rise to misrepresentation and trademark piracy); for greater transparency in the TPA in order to ensure that this mechanism cannot be used to brand and sell olives and oils imported from non-Community countries as Community oils; and for an increase in the threshold price which automatically triggers the private storage procedure. I therefore voted in favour."
".– I am voting for this report."
"We have here a proposal for a regulation to replace Regulation (EEC) No 827/68, which will cease being in force in November 2004."
"It seeks a better classification of the various kinds of olive oil, the prohibition of blends of olive oil and other oils or fats, compulsory indication on labels of the origin of olives, with oil origin consequently being determined on the basis of the tree and the place of harvesting and not the place of pressing and processing, and greater transparency in the TPA."
"It is also proposed that the term ‘operators’ should be replaced with the more correct name ‘olive producers’, and that producers’ organisations should not be assigned market supervision and monitoring duties, which should remain the responsibility of the existing national supervisory bodies in the olive and agricultural sectors."
"Furthermore, all producers in the sector have for some time been calling for clearer and more transparent legislation."
"We hope the results will meet their expectations."
"I have voted against all the amendments and, in the final vote, against this report since we are of the opinion that the EU is wrong to continue with and give more aid to olive groves than was indicated in the Commission’s original proposal."
"We think that these subsidies should be phased out and the taxpayers’ money used more appropriately."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats sees increased subsidies as a problem of principle."
"Since many developing countries are entirely reliant on cotton production, EU aid distorts the competition."
"These countries are even less well placed than regions within the EU to solve the transitional problems that arise if part of the production is stopped."
"Parliament’s proposal means not only greater subsidies than those proposed by the Commission but also places even more specific demands on products and necessitates classification systems."
"This may be commendable, but is often a way to protect against outside competition, in other words it is a hidden trade barrier that renders free trade difficult."
". – An insult to and mockery of women is the only way to describe the European Parliament resolution on International Women’s Day."
"Any encouraging of equality of women and search for responsibility for the trivial results are wiped out by praises for ΕU policy and positive criticism of the decisions by the Lisbon and Barcelona Summits."
"The harsh reality experienced by women in the EU (high unemployment rate, few, poorly paid, scarce jobs, terrorism in the workplace, lack of measures giving social support to the family, increase in the retirement age, wage discrimination and so on) is the outcome of the strategic choices of the ΕU, to which the Lisbon and Barcelona Summits gave significant momentum."
"The proposals to promote women as Commissioners, to create a special portfolio for women’s rights in the Commission, to give women equal representation on European Parliament ballot forms, to set up a European institute for gender issues etc. illustrate how far the temporary residents of Brussels are from the real problems and concerns of working class women."
"How can a partially employed, partially paid, partially retired woman, which is the model being promoted or at least accepted by those who inspire such texts, become fully involved in social and political life?"
"That is why we MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece abstained from the vote."
"Mr President, the report by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on the Guantanamo detainees quite rightly identifies the infringement of international law and human rights."
"Indeed, these people, victims of the imperialist expansionism which took the form of the ‘war against terrorism’, not only are not being treated as prisoners of war, but are also being subjected to torture and every form of humiliation."
"So much for the civilisation of those who present themselves as the champions of civilisation and want to give the rest of the world lessons in democracy."
"Nonetheless, the report accepts the core of imperialist policy and the American perception of terrorism, justifies the attack on Afghanistan, fails to condemn the arrests and illegal detentions and confines itself to calling for a fair trial for the detainees."
"That is why we MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece abstained from the vote and are calling for all detainees to be freed at once and compensated for what they have been through."
"We Swedish Moderates agree with the demand that the Guantánamo prisoners be accorded a fair trial, and we have therefore voted in favour of the tabled report."
"We are not, however, of the opinion that the prisoners necessarily fulfil the conditions of the Geneva Convention that would allow them to be considered as prisoners of war. It is therefore incorrect for the report to invoke the Geneva Convention’s rules governing the treatment of prisoners of war as being synonymous with the rights of the Guantánamo prisoners."
".– This recommendation, which had its origin in an initiative in which my Parliamentary Group took part, was pressing and necessary, although I do not agree with the way all its points have been formulated."
"Unfortunately, however, it is overdue, given that hundreds of people, including children, from some 40 countries, particularly countries of the European Union, have been held at the United States military base in Guantanamo Bay since January 2002 in unacceptable circumstances and conditions and without any rights or guarantees."
"It is pressing and necessary that the United States authorities should put an immediate end to this flagrant violation of the most basic human rights and of human dignity, in breach of all international standards and law, particularly regarding access to a fair trial and the prohibition of arbitrary detention."
"It is pressing and necessary that the governments of the countries of the European Union should stop acquiescing in this situation and adopt a firm, clear position, denouncing and condemning this unacceptable situation and demanding that the United States authorities should guarantee these detainees immediate access to justice in accordance with international standards and law."
"– Hardly anyone but this House is showing such passionate interest in the conditions under which prisoners are being kept at Guantanamo, or showing such compassion for them."
"I do not share the predominant opinion in this House, in that not only do I not regard this as a priority issue, but also, to be blunt, the condition of these people inspires me with little sympathy for them."
"I would remind the enlightened elite, the virtuous defenders of fundamental rights, who, at Guantanamo, see only wretched prisoners and victims of American despotism, that we are talking here about persons suspected of belonging to the most dangerous criminal organisation ever identified, active participants, to varying degrees, in one of the most bloody crimes in history, Islamic terrorists who have declared total war on the West and its values."
"An exceptional situation, such as the war on international terrorism, can justify exceptional measures."
"The situation of those detained at Guantanamo – an issue that, it should be added, is strictly a matter for the United States – strikes me as less deserving of interest than that of the families of the victims, about whom there is less concern."
".– The question of the ‘detention, treatment and trial of certain non-citizens in the war against terrorism’ that is occurring in Guantanamo Bay has clearly been taken up by certain European sectors as a political issue, more to hinder the smoothing of transatlantic relations than to uphold the fundamental values of the rule of law and full respect for international humanitarian standards."
"The tone of the report seeks to fuel not only the rifts that occurred in Europe at the time of the Iraq war but also animosity against the US."
"For my part, I too believe ‘that the transatlantic relationship is invaluable and could be a formidable force for good in the world as stated by the European Council only if basic human rights – such as the right to fair trial and the prohibition on arbitrary detention – are clearly respected as universal and non-negotiable and remain the core of values and common interest that the EU and the US maintain.’"
"What underlies the report, however, is the fact that the demands made of the US in this report are being made because the presumed terrorists are being held in Guantanamo, comfortably far away from Europe."
"I therefore voted against this report, more because of the anti-American intent that can be seen in it than because of the basic principles it evokes, which I have always upheld."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"(1)"
"– The next item is the continuation of the joint debate on enlargement and the candidate countries."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank Commissioner Verheugen for his constructive and very close cooperation over the years."
"The Czech Republic’s successes over the last few years are beyond dispute."
"There are still deficits in some areas, however, on standards in food-processing establishments, for example."
"Our consumers need have no fear, however; nothing that fails to meet our standards will be allowed in the EU internal market."
"Another problem that has increasingly been brought to my attention recently is the suspected trafficking in human beings and in particular children at the German-Czech border."
"The Czech Government should be encouraging victim support programmes here."
"There is also a need for training programmes for the police and border guards to increase awareness of the issue of people trafficking and there should be greater cross-border cooperation on the basis of INTERREG."
"So far as the plans for barrages on the upper reaches of the Elbe are concerned, I have managed to persuade the EU Commission that an environmental impact assessment for this project is absolutely essential and that intermodal alternatives must be worked out."
"I live in the Elbe valley in Saxony, which was flooded in summer 2002, and I know what I am talking about."
"Finally, I want to talk about the Czech parliament’s intention of honouring the former Czechoslovak President Edvard Beneš."
"When we have spent years dealing with the matter of the Beneš decrees here in Parliament and I found a compromise formula that was adopted by an overwhelming majority of the plenum in April last year, I find it insensitive and provocative of the Czechs now, just before the country is to join the EU, to be passing a law that not only evokes the past but actually honours it."
"I do not want anyone who supports this law joining my Group in the future."
". Mr President, this legislative period is drawing to a close, as is the process for the accession of ten states to the European Union."
"I was very interested in Estonia even before I became this Parliament’s rapporteur for its accession, and I have visited it regularly for 11 years."
"I am therefore firmly convinced that we are not just being polite when we say in the report that ‘the European Parliament stresses the determination and continuity in efforts made by the Estonian authorities in carrying out the preparations for accession throughout the whole period of transition’."
"I can see – now he has just gone out – I could see former foreign minister Toomas Hendrik Ilves in the House and I would like to thank him on behalf of all our other Estonian colleagues, for that determination, which was shown by all political camps in Estonia."
"Impressive personalities, like – among others – the former President Lennart Meri, or Mart Laar, who was twice Prime Minister, have done much in the past to point the country towards Europe."
"I am convinced that with the EU’s support the country’s dynamism, which is seen especially in Tallinn, will also accelerate economic and social development in other, more remote parts."
"In relation to Russia, Mr Brok has already said something about the border treaties, and I would like to add that it must also be clear that the EU’s Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Russia applies equally to all the new Members."
"I am looking for clear answers from the Council of Ministers when on 5 March Russian minister Sergei Ivanov repeats the USSR’s – and sadly also today’s Russia’s – propaganda lie in ‘’ – that is, that the USSR did not invade the Baltic countries, but was summoned to their aid."
"Such propaganda and fairy tales should no longer be spread here, and the European Union must make that clear to Russia."
"– Mr President, I am glad to be able to say, in my capacity as rapporteur on Cyprus, that the Commission’s follow-up report confirms that the country has, to a large extent, aligned itself with the in most areas."
"Satisfying though this is, it is overshadowed by the fact that, at the present time, the application of the is still in abeyance in the occupied sector of the island and that talks between the communities seem at present to have become deadlocked."
"The fundamental cause underlying this deadlock is the fact that the principal negotiator for the Turkish part of Cyprus, Mr Denktash, is as yet unwilling to concede, or unable to grasp, despite the Annan plan, that Cyprus is an independent and indivisible country."
"It can join the European Union only subject to the condition that it should adopt a constitution conferring upon it a single international personality and functioning federal institutions."
"As is, unfortunately, confirmed by his recent statements rejecting the Annan plan, Mr Denktash’s strategy cannot be intended to do other than lead to a breakdown of bilateral negotiations."
"It is fortunate that the UN plan includes two compensatory mechanisms."
"The first is the plan for Greece and Turkey to intervene in the bilateral negotiations on 22 March."
"This will give Turkey the opportunity to remove what is, according to the Commission, a serious obstacle to its own prospective accession, namely the absence of a solution to the Cyprus problem."
"The referendum on 22 April could provide a second safety net in that, if the majority of Turkish Cypriots vote in favour of the Annan plan and of accession, the ghosts of the past can be banished to the archives of history."
"The days ahead will be crucial to Cyprus’ future."
"The European Parliament agrees with Commissioner Verheugen, and can do no other than hope that the people of Cyprus, both Greek and Turkish, will seize this historic opportunity."
". Mr President, on my latest visit to the country on which I am reporting – Latvia – I gained the impression that membership of the European Union has still not found its way into the minds of the political elite."
"They expected the monitoring report to praise the successes of the alignment process."
"That is not its purpose, however."
"Its purpose is to analyse the problems of direct and indirect relevance for coexistence within the European Union, so that integration into the European Union can be a success for all concerned."
"I was pleased that the Latvian Government’s representative in Brussels and the country’s former chief negotiator considers my work thorough and sound and has confirmed to me that the report correctly identifies the country’s problems."
"I would at this point like to express my thanks for the intensive discussions with the embassy and other ministries and state bodies."
"The information they provided helped me to gain a realistic picture of the situation in the country."
"I would also like to thank my colleagues for their close cooperation."
"Unlike the Commission, I found that the work of the new Corruption Prevention Bureau can be described as effective and promising."
"I am convinced that it will enable Latvia to overcome its negative image."
"When I visited the country, I also met a committed minister of justice, and I am convinced that with her the reforms are in good hands and will bring success quicker than assumed in the Commission report."
"I can say the same about agricultural policy."
"I was also pleased to find that my report triggered a political debate about what is probably the country’s greatest social problem, how to better integrate the Russian-speaking population."
"The debate surrounding my report included a discussion of how citizenship can be achieved for what amounts to one fifth of the population and how the process can be speeded up."
"I have borne patiently the accusations, condemnations and insults that have been hurled at me recently in the hope that the debate on my proposals, which after all were backed by the Council of Europe, would have a successful outcome, that is result in higher figures for naturalisation."
"Contrary to what some Latvian politicians are claiming, the content of my report and the things that it calls for are identical to those of other European organisations."
"We cannot accuse the Council of Europe and the OSCE High Commissioner of belonging to a particular political family."
"It is of course true that in my report I did not satisfy the heroic national pretensions of part of the country’s political elite that considers itself infallible."
"That was not my aim."
"I wrote this report with a sense of responsibility to the common values of our European Union."
"These include the indivisibility of human dignity and I stand by that."
". Mr President, my thanks first of all to the Commissioner and my congratulations on his excellent work."
"When we arrived in the summer of 1999 at the start of our term of office, we arrived together with the Helsinki decision marking the unification of the procedure for integrating the new countries, the single wave."
"Today, as our term of office nears its end, this circle is being successfully closed and this is something which is very, very serious and important for the whole of Europe."
"The two months left are little time."
"Today we are exercising our criticism of the new countries as colleagues, not as observers and advisers."
"In this sense, I, as the official rapporteur for Lithuania, wish to confirm the important positive job which has been done in this country and helped it progress, so that in two months it will be in a position to become a fully fledged member of the European Union."
"There are problems, as in all the new countries."
"However, serious problems have been resolved, such as, for example, the issue of Kaliningrad, relations with the Russian Federation, the problem of the nuclear power station in Ιgnalina and the problem of regional cooperation."
"What do we need to do?"
"We need to support this effort. To support environmental issues, to support the strengthening of the trans-European networks in the field of energy and in the field of transport, so that these countries are integrated more fully into the European structures."
"As I have another identity (I am from an island in the Mediterranean, Crete), it would be an oversight on my part if I failed to mention the integration of the European Union in the Mediterranean with Cyprus and Malta."
"This circle is closing and it is closing in an exceptional manner."
"I hope, on the basis of what the Commissioner said to us earlier, that the relevant position of the European Union is constant, so that when Cyprus becomes a member of the European Union and the Cypriot question has been resolved, which we hope it will, the can be applied 100% to all policies in the whole of reunited Cyprus."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, we look at Hungary with the respect and esteem due to a people that hopes to find within our Union not only respect for its national independence and identity but also the collective security and economic prosperity that it was denied by the communist dictatorship, which subjugated it together with so many others for almost 40 years."
"We must, however, recognise that the historical step of enlargement raises legitimate questions and fears on both sides in view of the challenge of reuniting two worlds which have, unfortunately, in recent decades reached very different stages of development."
"These will inevitably accentuate the differences between wealthier and less prosperous regions and will lead to an increase in the population living in the less disadvantaged regions."
"It is true that we have to accept that. It is also true, however, that the step to be taken in May 2004 is of the greatest political significance, in that it powerfully demonstrates the vitality of all the countries of Europe involved in enlargement when they are faced with the challenge that history has set for them."
"My hope is, Mr President, that from that moment onwards we shall all – current and new Member States alike – have the opportunity to work together and exercise our joint responsibility in the development of the European Union."
"This joint responsibility implies maintaining and even strengthening the principle of economic and social cohesion."
"From this viewpoint, we see enlargement as a contract providing mutual benefits for both the new countries of the Union and the current ones whose income levels still justify the assignment of Community development aid."
"In this respect, we thoroughly welcome the draft financial perspective for 2007-2013 that the Commission has just put before this Parliament."
"It also implies strengthening the quality of democracy in the European institutions, where it is essential to achieve greater democratic transparency and supervision, along with greater and more effective participation by the national parliaments in the building of Europe."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Hungary is one of those countries whose performance in preparing to join the European Union has been outstanding."
"It has been my duty to accompany this development closely."
"It is true that there are still a few problems that Hungary will have to overcome, but we are aware of its government’s determination to fulfil the commitments it has made in good time."
"Rather than highlighting them now, I think it would be more appropriate to underline this country’s success in recent years in meeting the challenges that it has faced and resolved to overcome."
"Hungary, like all the other acceding countries, will at last be taking its well-deserved place as a European Union Member State."
"As rapporteur for that country, I therefore call on you all to support the Brok report, which embodies years of effort and hard work and ushers in a new era in the life of the European Union."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, as this is Parliament’s last report before the historic date on which the EU is to be enlarged, I would like to make a statement in my capacities as co-chairman of the EU-Czech Republic Joint Parliamentary Committee and as rapporteur for Malta."
"As the date draws nearer, expectations become all the more realistic; enlargement will not do away with every problem at one fell swoop."
"Over and over again, I get letters from members of the public pointing out ways in which, contrary to the official line, Beneš decrees are to this day being applied in cases in which compensation is outstanding."
"The only comment I can make on this is that I would see a more sensitive handling of history and of such historical figures as Edvard Beneš as being desirable."
"Nevertheless, Austria is one of the countries that stand to gain most from enlargement and it is profiting, above all from strengthened trading relations with, and investments in, the Czech Republic."
"As its neighbours, we were strongly supportive of its accession, in the expectation that enlargement in Central Europe would bring peaceful development and economic growth."
"Turning to Malta, I cannot do other than congratulate this important small Mediterranean state, situated where Europe and North Africa meet, on its decision to join the European Union, a decision now supported by all its political forces, and also on the efforts the country has made to prepare itself for the EU."
"When one considers the structural weaknesses of its shipyards and, in general terms, the need to convert a protected and insular economy into an open market economy, the adoption of the EU’s was a great challenge and a major achievement for this small island state."
"All I can say to the Maltese people, though, is that they must have no fear that they, as a small country, will be swamped in something as large as the European Union."
"The appointment of Mr Borg, Malta’s foreign minister, as its Commissioner, shows the value that Malta attaches to its accession to the EU."
"Mr President, allow me for once not to talk about the large or small problems which Poland still needs to resolve in order to again take its rightful place in Europe."
"For someone like me who lived through – albeit in the privileged position of foreign correspondent – the hard years of the communist dictatorship and who then went back to cover Poland as rapporteur, this is an important, and I would even go so far as to say, an emotional moment."
"I would never have imagined in those years that Poland and the other former communist countries would have been restored to democracy and free and effective economic development in such a short space of time."
"I believe that this is the last time that I will talk about Poland in this Chamber and I would like to send my thanks to all those who, both here and there, in Brussels and in Warsaw – I can see Commissioner Verheugen here – have contributed to healing this wound in our continent."
"In addition, I hope that the Poles will fully appreciate the grandeur of the European dream."
"Nevertheless, I would also like to briefly mention another country: Romania."
"Romania still has a long way to go, but it is doing all it can to come into line with Europe and prepare itself."
"We criticised Romania for its delays; it reacted by trying to put its house in order."
"Now of course it needs to be watched, spurred on and monitored, but it should also be encouraged, and this is why the reprobative tone which Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne used in her report was excessive."
"We therefore support the amendments tabled by Mr Podestà which move precisely in this direction, that is, constructive criticism."
"Mr President, as we know, of the ten candidate countries, Slovenia best meets the entry criteria: it had only one point that was not in its favour."
"That concerned the recognition of foreign certificates of study, and the situation was resolved with the recent law."
"Today, foreign certificates are officially recognised in the same was as Slovenian certificates."
"There will, of course, be problems, but there is no alternative, as was rightly stated this morning by Commissioner Verheugen, the man to whom great credit is due for this enormous political and diplomatic operation."
"Slovenia’s positive situation stems both from the strong consensus among the governing and opposition parties and from the scale on which the has been faced up to and the care and skill with which it has been tackled."
"Already the next objective is to enter the eurozone, an objective that, some years ago, seemed difficult when inflation was rather high, but that now seems attainable within a reasonable time, given that, at the end of 2003, inflation fell, settling at between 4% and 5%."
"Slovenia has, therefore, been able to reconvert some large plants – the legacy of socialism – into small businesses that have subsequently become relatively dynamic."
"In foreign policy, the issue of relations with Croatia remains open: there has recently been news of the Croatian parliament’s ratification of the agreement on the distribution of the assets of the succession countries of the former Yugoslavia, an agreement signed in Vienna in 2001, but until now only signed by the Croatians."
"Within this legally defined framework, it will therefore be easier to resolve other problems, not least that of the Croatian unilateral declaration on the exclusive Adriatic maritime environmental zone, criticised by the European Union too for being unilateral and not achieved through an agreement between all those concerned."
"The general climate between Zagreb and Ljubljana has, however, recently improved and the values of security, stability and prosperity to which Slovenia aspires are those of the European Union."
"Entry into the EU is recognition of the road taken towards modernising the country while respecting Community values and principles."
"Congratulations and welcome, therefore, to Slovenia."
". Mr President, I too am very tempted to say a great deal about Romania, but today, I shall confine myself to the country for which I have been responsible over the past few years, namely Slovakia."
"I realise that this report is not the most important one, and may be the least important of all the reports we have produced about that country over the past six or seven years."
"What is certain is that Slovakia will be joining the European Union on 1 May."
"I have monitored that country for years and there is no mistaking the progress it has made in many areas."
"Let this be a compliment to a small country, the last to gain its independence and whose political problems before the election of 1998 meant that it was also included late in the countries with which negotiations were taking place."
"Today, we are talking about the issues that have not yet been resolved and about what is yet to happen in the acceding countries before 1 May."
"In that respect, I share the Commission's view as far as Slovakia is concerned."
"It is up to the government in Bratislava to do what is necessary; if not that country will have a problem after 1 May, with all the implications that this entails."
"I could not agree more with what Commissioner Verheugen stated this morning: if a problem of that kind occurs, we, in the European Union, cannot resort to any compromises, but need to have the nerve to act firmly."
"However, I join him in hoping that the problems will have been resolved by 1 May."
"A few general remarks should not be missing from this report."
"I would reiterate my concern about corruption and would encourage the government to attach high priority to continuing the fight against it."
"Slovakia is continuing to improve as regards its economic performance."
"Economic growth is respectable; unemployment is falling, but I doubt whether all Slovaks are reaping the benefits of that."
"Although the reforms in social security, particularly to get people on benefit back to work, are recent, they appear to impact negatively on certain groups in practice."
"This particularly applies to Roma in some parts of the country, particularly eastern Slovakia, where there are hardly any jobs for them."
"Needless to say, such a regulation will then be ineffective."
"This could have been one of the reasons behind the various unpleasant incidents that took place recently, such as the looting of shops."
"There is, in itself, no excuse for such actions; they are illegal, but I should nevertheless advise the Slovaks to study their social legislation again carefully."
"As Slovakia has promised to do more, and not less, for the Roma, I do not object to amendments which aim to underline this once again."
"I do, however, object to amendments which accept the link between the looting of shops and the problems surrounding social security."
"In my view, the former is unacceptable and something should be done about the latter."
". Mr President, the integration of ten new countries into the European Union means mutual recognition, as the rapporteur, Mr Brok, points out, of the fact that, over and above traditional national interests, there are general European interests which every country should see as part of its national interests."
"Consequently, old and new countries should stop thinking in a purely ethno-centric manner."
"Besides, the whole integration procedure, as the report makes clear, speeds up progress by these countries with reforms in their economic, administrative and political environment and this is the biggest gain for their people."
"In particular, I should like to express the satisfaction of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market at the fact that these countries are aligning with the in the fields of company law, accounting rules, customs law and movements of capital and, more generally, at the noteworthy results achieved as a whole in the field of transposing legislation into their national law."
"At the same time, however, I would express the Committee’s regret at the delay appearing in certain countries in the fields of trade, cross-border transactions and recognition of professional qualifications."
"Here it would point out that a clear message must be sent that the huge prospects opening up for their peoples are tied in with the obligations which they have with regard to the application of Community legislation."
"."
"Mr President, as rapporteur of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I should first of all like to congratulate Bulgaria on the progress made: 26 chapters have been completed, six others are still open, but much more remains to be done about the prospects for investment; this will involve establishing a transparent and unambiguous business climate, so that businesses know that their investments are safe and cannot be lost as a result of corruption."
"As regards the nuclear power station at Kozloduy, I should like to say the following. If it transpires from the inspection carried out in November 2003, that all the recommendations of the Atomic Question Group have been carried out, the Commission can consider postponing the closure of Kozloduy 3 and 4 for a little while longer."
"If, however, this is not the case, the Commission needs to adhere to the agreed time schedule for the closure of units 3 and 4."
"There is far more concern within the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy with regard to Romania."
"Despite all the Romanian Government's efforts, we have to conclude that, to this day, that country has no functioning market economy."
"In practice, much more is yet to be done in order to eradicate corruption and implement structural reforms in a tangible and consistent manner."
"Romania's route to the European Union is difficult on account of the late start to privatisation, the late reform of state-owned businesses and the fact that its investment climate still leaves a great deal to be desired."
"Romania’s lack of appeal to foreign investors is another reason why the rule of law should, as a matter of urgency, be further developed in the area of Romania's economy."
"It is necessary to create a culture in which responsibility is accepted and laws applied."
"We therefore very much welcome the proposal in the Brok committee's report for a re-orientation exercise and, at the same time, for more attention to be given to problems relating to the rule of law."
"There is also a need for core sectors such as energy, mining and transport to be restructured."
"All in all, Romania still has a huge effort to make."
". Mr President, this is the last time that I, as rapporteur of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment, together with Mr Ettl, can pass judgment on the preparations of the candidate Member States in the social field."
"I have to say that all those countries have made unbelievable efforts to make progress in the social sphere on various fronts."
"They have a number of trump cards which they can play and about which far too little is known, certainly in our countries, where people often think that the new Member States are still at an early stage of development."
"Needless to say, that is not the case."
"For example, the population is very well educated: 88% of 20 to 24-year-olds have at least attended higher education."
"That is more than in the 15 current Member States, where this figure is 74%."
"Moreover, the population in the ten new countries is younger than in the 15 current Member States."
"The phenomenon of an ageing population will therefore take a little longer to make its presence felt."
"In short, those countries have great potential in terms of human resources."
"Utilising this potential to the full should be high on the agenda."
"At present, human resources are still deployed insufficiently."
"Unemployment in the acceding countries is high and opportunities for employment low."
"Of the population of working age, 14.3% are unemployed, as against 8% in the European Union."
"Unemployment among young people under the age of 25 has taken on tragic proportions: at 32%, it is twice that of the European Union."
"An extreme case is Poland, where youth unemployment is 41%."
"Moreover, in seven of the ten candidate Member States, youth unemployment in 2003 rose compared to the year before."
"It is therefore obvious that those countries, in accordance with the European employment strategy, should develop active and sustainable employment policy."
"Lifelong learning should keep workers deployable within the changing labour market."
"The number of people between 25 and 65 who attended courses in 2002 is 5% compared to 8% in the European Union and there is also the risk of a brain drain of highly-qualified staff."
"Another point is health and safety at work."
"Some countries prefer to provide higher wages at the expense of health and safety provisions on the shop floor."
"Purchasing power and pre-tax income are far below the EU average, but they have increased – even considerably – while they fell in our countries."
"This amounts to a simply outstanding achievement."
"A big problem, however, is that wages remain too low to enable people to escape poverty."
"Poverty in the ten countries concerned affects 40% of the working population."
"Social security should be developed more effectively."
"Social partners should be organised more effectively because at the moment, they still have insufficient organisational power to be able to really organise social negotiations in the countries concerned."
". – Mr President, although I can do no other than underline what Mrs Smet has said, the great progress made in the new Member States must not blind us to the continuing problems they have in the social sphere, or to their mounting difficulties with employment."
"Economic adjustments, combined with processes of industrial restructuring under which mainly workers have suffered, is making for ever-greater problems in the new Member States’ labour markets."
"Now, when they are on the threshold of accession, it cannot be too strongly emphasised that the overall goals and ambitions of a Social Europe will remain and cannot be lowered."
"The successful implementation of the Lisbon strategy in an enlarged Europe is dependent on social standards and on social legislation, both of which are means to that end."
"Going beyond that, the Social Affairs Committee urges the new Member States, in their political agendas, to give more attention to human capital."
"In a European Union of 25 states, there is no place for retrograde developments or social inertia, which would pave the way for new conflict."
"Generally speaking, and by way of conclusion, let me say that the tendency to treat both social affairs and employment matters as ‘soft law’ is a problem in terms of the overall future development of the European Union."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, fifteen years after the countries of Eastern Europe threw off the straitjacket of communism, what we are seeing is a completely new life and, in reality, new countries."
"This is a fantastic achievement by these people."
"As members of the EU they will, just like the rest of us, gain full freedom of movement to promote increased solidarity and strength throughout the whole Union."
"In different ways during my work with enlargement, I have met many ambitious, hard-working people."
"I therefore regret that, in the existing Member States, we seem to be so afraid of the workforce coming here."
"I am ashamed that, in my own country, there is talk of social tourism."
"This freedom of movement would mean a necessary injection into our slightly stagnated labour markets."
"Agriculture is more important in these countries than in the existing Member States."
"The areas are larger; three times as many people are involved in agriculture as in the present EU; and agriculture represents a larger proportion of the gross national income, that is to say, agricultural policy is more important for these countries than it really is for us."
"We need a policy for all the countries."
"We need, of course, to ensure that the new Member States have organisations that provide support and control and that they can tighten up food standards and the monitoring of animal and plant health."
"Much has happened and, if we compare the current situation with the Commission’s report, we can be pleased about the information that we are receiving to the effect that much of what had not been achieved by 30 September 2003 has now been achieved."
"We hope that the rest can be done by 1 May 2004."
"As far as the other two countries that we are dealing with, Bulgaria and Romania, are concerned, it is important to report that Bulgaria has made substantial progress in recent years and that the country deserves great praise for this."
"Romania has been in a more difficult situation and has further to go in order to catch up but, even this morning, we have received reports that things are happening, and of course we must recognise this and approve of it."
"Romania is the most typical agricultural country of the candidate countries, having many small farms."
"Forty per cent of the population still works in agriculture, and many farms rely on subsistence farming."
"A huge economic and social change is necessary in order for development to be made possible, but we must remember that we have a shared responsibility."
"The candidate countries have their responsibility, but the existing Member States must also take responsibility."
"The Commission must participate rather than just making demands."
"It must also stimulate and make resources available."
"More effective use must be made of the SAPARD resources."
"Having tried to follow the developments in Central and Eastern Europe for almost 40 years, I feel sincere joy at being able to welcome these countries both on 1 May 2004 and during 2007."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what I would like to say, as draftsperson of my Committee’s opinion, is that, where regional policy and the Structural Funds are concerned, most of the countries should, by the time they accede, already be in a position to transpose core areas of the ."
"It is to be regretted, though, that all of them need to make greater efforts in such important areas as financial management and financial control."
"In the transport sector, it is the failure of the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary to make progress in road transport that is most disappointing of all."
"Further decisive action has to be taken to raise safety and environmental standards and to ensure conformity with the ."
"As the trans-European transport networks are of great importance to the whole of Europe, not only the accession states, but also the Fifteen in the EU, need to be urged to regard the TENs not merely as a means of realising national priorities, but as making a contribution to European cohesion and to the integration of a reunited Europe."
". Mr President, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism is pleased with the report on Romania."
"There are a few aspects that I, as draftsman of its opinion, would like to highlight."
"In the field of transport, Romania is making considerable progress."
"Nevertheless, privatisation and restructuring in this sector deserve special attention."
"In terms of safety, particularly at sea, it is known that the situation of the ships sailing under the Romanian flag is often dubious."
"This House is taking this problem seriously."
"Romania must resolve this issue prior to accession."
"Due to the general absence of administrative capacity for regional policy, the incentives from the European funds are at risk of missing their intended purpose, while this is very much needed in the socio-economic framework."
"We would ask Romania to make a major effort to upgrade the Civil Service in such a way as to guarantee good use of funds and control over them."
"My amendments aim to make a few changes to that effect."
"While it cannot be denied that Romania is making progress, there is still a long way to go on the road to accession."
"I should like to encourage that country to walk that road with determination."
". Mr President, I shall refer to the main points in my report, as approved."
"Our committee expresses satisfaction at the progress made by Bulgaria in most of the individual sectors of transport and calls for enforcement of the to the road, railway and aviation sectors."
"It calls for the removal of its flag from the Paris list to continue to be a priority for it."
"It expresses its regret at the fact that chapter 21 on regional policy and coordination of structural instruments remains to be concluded."
"It calls for Bulgaria to ensure that effective structures exist to prevent, detect and punish instances of fraud and corruption, especially for Phare and ISPA programmes."
"It calls further for the strengthening of coordination and cooperation between ministries, as well as with relevant agencies and other stakeholders."
"It considers that direct efforts are needed in effective cooperation and communication, mainly between central and regional level, where we consider that there are problems, as well as in the consolidation and completion of institutional structures at both central and regional level."
"Finally, it is clear that, as far as our committee is concerned, it believes that Bulgaria has the capacity to join our Union on schedule."
". – Mr President, it is clear that International Women’s Day has already been forgotten, as the rapporteur for the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities is, of course, the last to speak."
"In this capacity, though, I do think that we should not be any less strict with the accession countries than we are with ourselves in matters relating to the complete transposition of the European Union’s Community acquis in the field of gender equality."
"Rather than focusing on what is missing,then, we should show appreciation for the progress and the reforms that a country such as Bulgaria has managed to make, under difficult conditions, since its liberation from Communist dictatorship."
"After all, many countries that have been Member States for years are still having problems with properly transposing the directives on equal rights and opportunities for women and men, something that is, let me add, apparent from the Commission’s latest report on the Lisbon strategy for the Spring Summit."
"At this stage, then, in my humble opinion, we should be wary of delivering too many homilies to countries such as Bulgaria."
"Instead, we should be doing everything possible to help it, and countries like it, and to encourage it and them to proceed further along the right path, on which they have encountered these difficulties, so that – as we hope – this wonderful European country can accede to our European Union in 2007."
"The same applies to child protection, where there is certainly still much to be done."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I take the floor to speak about the report on Romania."
"When having talks in recent weeks with the rapporteur and other Members, I tried to improve this report, but I must say that this attempt did not succeed, and this is why I have tabled some amendments on which we will vote in the House tomorrow."
"It seems to me that this report is not very balanced, that it is inaccurate and inconsistent with what our Parliament has maintained to date."
"Given the shortage of time, I will just concentrate on two aspects."
"Firstly: the issue of children in institutions and the issue of adoption."
"The serious nature of this issue should lead us to make serious and balanced assessments of the efforts made, of the improvements achieved and of what remains to be done."
"Above all, claims that have not been proven should be excluded, if we do not want to offend a friendly country and if we do not want our Parliament’s credibility to be lost."
"Rigour is of course needed, but not prejudice."
"Secondly, I do not agree with those who – in the name of totally understandable demand to reorientate the Romanian Government’s policy on some sensitive issues linked to European integration – fundamentally reject the results achieved to date."
"I should not like to think that these hurried and ungenerous judgments were influenced by the cost of enlargement to include countries of the Carpathia and the Balkans."
"If this were the case and if there were political short-sightedness of this kind, then I would like to mention – as Mr Daul did this morning in the House – the 50 million who died during the world wars of the last century."
"I believe that the only way to avoid the future risks that the recent war in Yugoslavia too has shown to be potential and real is to make progress in terms of integration."
"Rigour is of course needed, but so too is understanding of the efforts made and the results achieved."
"It will be much easier for a state to become fully legitimate within the EU than outside it."
"I believe that 2007 must remain the target for Romania and Bulgaria."
"This is not a certainty but an objective, even if – as Commissioner Verheugen said – the keys to this success lie above all with Sofia and Bucharest."
"– Mr President, the Union is now making its biggest political decision ever, because the difference between the new and the current Member States is greater than in previous rounds of enlargement."
"Hopefully the new countries understand that the Union is not about national objectives, but making progress on the basis of cooperation."
"It is to be hoped that there will be no attempt to use the Union as a forum for punishing the past injustices of the East or supporting the unilateralism of the West."
"The European Union will not resolve conflicts through war or by using force, but through negotiation."
"That we have learnt from our history."
"The European model differs from Eastern and Western practices in that democracy also embraces civil rights at work, in education and even in the information society."
"It is also connected with the rights of employees, and consequently, the tripartite model in labour relations should also become standard practice in the new Member States as quickly as possible."
"The main partners in the enlarged Europe will be the United States of America and Russia."
"There are political and commercial problems regarding both."
"Internally we are divided to an unusual degree."
"When enlargement has taken place, the Constitution will not yet be in effect, decisions will not have been taken on future financial frameworks, and the outgoing Commission will have taken the Council to court."
"Two thirds of the Members of Parliament will have left even before the Commissioners."
"Nationalism seems to be on the rise, and the largest Member States are pushing for privileges."
"If the agreement on the Constitution is not adopted this year, that will become more and more difficult in the years to come."
"Hopefully, it will not have turned out to be just a self-seeking exercise."
"Enlargement will nevertheless show that peaceful and equal cooperation is what is most enduring in all circumstances."
"Mr President, progress in Europe over a generation shapes the response to the political challenge since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989."
"Now, the Europe that, since the Second World War, has been divided by an Iron Curtain, both physical and ideological, is to be united."
"The objective is both a political and a formal unification, as well as a real levelling out of the major economic and political differences that have divided Europe."
"We must therefore be delighted about enlargement, even at those times when it proves to be problematic."
"We must also remember, however, to tell the people of Europe about our common European success."
"In spite of the success of enlargement and of the ever greater importance of the EU in people’s everyday lives, it is still a fact that we politicians are not good enough at delivering the message to the people."
"Once more, therefore: in our political work, higher priority must continue to be given to informing and communicating with the people."
"It may be that, in the forthcoming election, we shall already be given a lesson in the form of a disappointingly low turn-out."
"It cannot, therefore, be repeated often enough: a successful EU of 25 Member States requires the politicians and the institutions to be in dialogue with the people."
"– Mr President, progress has indeed been made, but it is nevertheless an open secret that, in various accession countries, public enthusiasm for the EU has waned, and the European elections will demonstrate this."
"Unemployment in Central and Eastern Europe is at a lamentably high level, never before has the gulf between rich and poor been so wide, social tensions are increasing and corruption is rampant."
"The one-sided pressure exerted by the EU towards privatisation with the minimum possible delay has positively laid waste centres of industry in Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia that were once vigorous."
"Social instability endangers democracy, and so the Copenhagen criteria are no longer the right instrument to deal with it."
"Such tendencies should be firmly brought under control and nipped in the bud."
"Although individual countries have been given warnings about their treatment of the Roma, it is clear that the EU must take a Community approach, or else the problem will prove unsolvable."
"It will not be achieved by states acting on their own."
"The issue with the Russian minorities in the Baltic states is a political one, one in which Moscow may well appear to be exerting influence, but which is in fact a conflict centring on education and citizens’ rights, and it demands a political solution."
"It is, in my view, more than a political scandal that someone like Mr Telička, who has competently guided the Czech Republic towards accession, should have public doubt cast upon his appointment as its Commissioner for having, as a young man, belonged to the Communist Party for two years or so."
"This is the work of the evil genius of stagnant anti-Communism, which is capable of poisoning the atmosphere not only in this House but also in the acceding states."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the remarks by our rapporteurs illustrate that the acceding countries have made major efforts, but that they still have a great deal to do in terms of the fight against corruption, fraud and human trafficking, and particularly in terms of the application of legislation."
"The most painful paragraphs in various reports pertain to the Roma, who are being discriminated against, disadvantaged and treated as second-class citizens everywhere, including in the current Member States."
"In Slovakia, this has already culminated in riots and even a fatality, mainly on account of the reforms implemented in Slovakia, which, among other things, mean that social security benefit has been capped and is no longer dependent on the number of family members. This directly affecting the Roma, with their huge families, who believe that the measure is directed against them."
"That is why I should like to call for more effective measures not only in Slovakia but also elsewhere in order to improve the plight of the Roma."
"Moreover, the measures should not only be put in place for the Roma, but above all, they must be implemented by them, for they do not participate enough in the improvement of their own fate and their own emancipation."
"Mr President, I agree with what the rapporteur, Mr Brok, says regarding the catastrophic lack of preparation of the ten accession countries."
"I will focus my speech on the agricultural aspects of enlargement."
"Like the rapporteur, I am concerned about the possibility of social problems such as a rural exodus and increased unemployment, and stress the importance of semi-subsistence farming in the accession countries."
"Like him I note that considerable problems remain, such as the fact that the administrations of several countries are still not capable of correctly implementing Community law, including the payment of agricultural subsidies."
"This situation is particularly worrying given the level of corruption in some candidate countries."
"Like my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I am particularly concerned about a series of problems in the area of food safety and public health."
"On 4 March, for example, barely two months before accession, Poland asked for a transition period of six to 12 additional months in order to bring some 300 agricultural and food companies in line with European rules, when they should have been ready on 1 May 2004, thereby acknowledging its lack of preparation."
"It should be added that, since 2001, the ten accession countries have received around EUR 500 million per year through the SAPARD funds, for the sole purpose of adapting their agriculture to their rural areas."
"They are far from achieving this."
"I regret the fact that this whole undertaking was conducted so hastily."
"It strikes me at the moment that enlargement is like a runaway train that no one knows how to, or wants to stop."
"I cannot see, therefore, how I can share in the rapporteur’s conclusions; rather, I am concerned about them."
"This is why I will vote against the report."
"Mr President, in the minute I have available, I would like to talk about Romania and the Nicholson report."
"This report began in committee with an approach that was appropriate right to the end and with which I and the rest of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy were satisfied. We must send out a message that is resolute but, at the same time, full of hope to the people and the government of Romania."
"Romania must proceed with greater earnestness and with greater rigour on the road of reforms, but it must get on the accession train, the European Union train."
"We cannot send out a message of gloom that excludes Romania from this prospect."
"It is important that our family extends to Romania, a country that needs the European Union and that needs and, in certain sectors, also wants democracy despite the existing problems."
"Let us, therefore, adopt this new version of the Nicholson report with conviction, hoping that it encourages the structural reforms that are necessary for Romania’s entry into the European Union in 2007."
"Mr President, I too would like to focus on the progress Romania has made in terms of compliance with the Copenhagen criteria."
"I would like to highlight two issues."
"Firstly, I believe we should acknowledge that Romania is taking steps and making efforts to comply fully with these criteria."
"I regret that Commissioner Verheugen did not acknowledge this."
"As we all know, this does not mean that there are no more obstacles to overcome, but it is encouraging that those obstacles have been identified and that the Romanian authorities have taken measures to remove them."
"The fight against corruption, as the Commissioner mentioned, to guarantee the independence of the justice system – and fundamental legislative reforms, contained in the new Constitution, are underway in this regard – press freedom, the reform of public administration, etc."
"In this regard, I would like to say that some of the recommendations contained in the report by Mrs Nicholson, such as the publication of the report by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture, have been accepted favourably by the Romanian authorities and, therefore, I believe that paragraphs 17 and 18 have become obsolete."
"And, of course, of the remaining obstacles I must mention the protection of children in international adoptions."
"Secondly and finally, I would like to say that, while the adoption of concrete measures within the specific time limits is important, it is also important that all of these measures move unequivocally in the direction of full compliance with these criteria."
"This has been the approach taken by the ten States joining us on 1 May and the same approach must be taken in this case as well."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as the date of accession approaches ever nearer, all the more often am I – as probably are also my fellow MEPs – asked whether we were not too hasty, and whether this accession, this enlargement, is not perhaps premature."
"Of course, the date is premature if you believe that every problem has to be sorted out before accession to the European Union, but then probably none of us would be able to belong to it."
"I think the date is the right one, though, if you believe that now, and from now on, is the right time to join with these countries in a common union in order to resolve these difficulties."
"Whatever justified criticism may have been levelled at them, the fact is that these countries have, over recent years, worked very hard at their own modernisation and at the evolution of their societies."
"All the same, I do believe that there are certain problems to which we have to pay particular attention: corruption has already been mentioned, as has crime."
"One problem that I would like to stress here is the social problem, and social issues."
"I do believe that what matters is not just price stability, zero deficits, and tax cuts, but that what matters most of all is that growth is achieved and new jobs created – more stable ones, too – and the need for social stability in these countries to be supported and encouraged."
"Recent weeks and months have shown us the problems that there are in this area – with the Roma and Sinti in Slovakia, for example."
"You can trace something of a logical progression linking these disturbances with cuts in taxes, cuts in expenditure, and cuts in social spending."
"I do not want to say that this single problem is the only example, and the same is true, of course, in other countries."
"Bearing in mind that the total number of Roma and Sinti in Europe adds up to some 6 or 8 million, I believe that fact very much justifies the widespread desire – which I share – for a Commissioner whose area of competence would include the integration of Europe’s minorities, especially of the Roma and Sinti."
"In any case, I would ask the Commission, both before and after 1 May, to give a great deal of attention to issues of social integration, especially that of the Roma and Sinti."
"I know that Commissioner Verheugen is very well aware of how important this issue is, and I believe that the whole Commission, in the coming weeks, months and indeed years, should address it together."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union is concluding its process of enlargement and I believe it is no coincidence that today’s debate has been held in parallel with the follow-up debate of the Intergovernmental Conference which should lead to a European Constitution, because I believe that the two should be inseparable."
"In the one minute available to me I will refer to the report presented by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne on Romania."
"I believe it is a very well executed and exhaustive report on the problems existing in that country."
"It highlights the need for that country to make progress in compliance with the law and to combat corruption, as well as the need to strengthen the rule of law and respect for minorities."
"I am referring in particular to the Hungarian minority of more than one million inhabitants in Romania and also, naturally, to the Roma minority."
"With regard to the problem of abandoned children and adoptions, I believe the Commissioner’s response has been clear: the well-being of children must govern this process."
"I believe that the report can be a positive stimulus so that Romania will continue along the path it has taken."
"Mr President, as regards Slovenia, some serious issues remain unresolved."
"These pertain firstly to the material and non-material compensation for the victims of the exodus caused by the terrible ethic cleansing which was still in its final phase in 1975 with the forced migration from some areas, such as Piran, Koper and Pristina (the former zone B) and, secondly, to the historic memory of the and to the unresolved issue of protecting cultural minorities from Italy and the Veneto."
"In Europe, protecting minorities is not optional."
"Slovenia is finally taking practical note of this and knows that those who are defending and proclaiming their own culture in that country, as is their right, are motivated by legitimate intentions and aims and are, so to speak, under the moral and political protection of the European Union."
"I also express my solidarity with the just demands that, at the same time, have been made of the Czech Republic by those that protect the rights of the Sudeten refugees, victims of another horrendous ethic cleansing which is stillastainuponEuropean communism."
"Mr President, today, we are holding the concluding debate on the accession of ten candidates to the European Union."
"For none of those ten countries has a date been set, and so they are encouraged to consider themselves wholly responsible for the success of the accession process."
"There are still two candidates, Romania and Bulgaria, that having further to row to the finishing line, and Romania is lagging behind the most."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats wholeheartedly endorses the report by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne, which we see as an important contribution to highlighting any problems Romania is left with, particularly in a bid to meet the political criteria of Copenhagen."
"This is Romania's own responsibility: the key to success lies in Bucharest, as the Commissioner has already stated."
"This list of problems has prompted the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy to send a unanimous warning to Bucharest."
"The tone was clear enough to wake up the Romanian Government."
"A reorientation of the process is what is now called for."
"Initially, there was a large-scale lobby campaign on the part of the Romanian Government, with the message that reorientation was unnecessary."
"Much more constructive was the more recent list by Romania's Prime Minister stating tasks yet to be done, as well as the recent Cabinet reforms, in order to give the negotiations with the EU more chance of success."
"In this way, a foundation has been laid for observing the obligations of Copenhagen."
"We are very pleased that the Council and Commission share Parliament's concern."
"As the prospect of enlargement on 1 May instils fear of the unknown among the European citizens – as the Commissioner has already pointed out – we should apply the greatest possible care in dealing with the later accessions."
"The public must be really convinced that the candidate Member States offer them the same certainties as the 15 current Member States."
"Corruption, about which humanitarian organisations in our countries receive many complaints, the freedom of press, also the subject of many complaints, problems with the judiciary and child care: these are the major points that need to be discussed and resolved as a matter of priority."
"The many letters they have sent indicate that this approach has sparked a great deal of enthusiasm among the citizens in Romania."
"It is important to show them that we are concerned about their fate."
"In this light, the contribution by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne is crucial."
"– Mr President, this House has always welcomed the accession of the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe; we always spoke up for the people in these states who wanted their ticket to enter the European Union."
"This fact would make it illogical to call for the suspension of Romania’s accession negotiations; it would send completely the wrong message."
"The opposite is true: what is needed is not for the negotiations to be broken off, but for them to be stepped up."
"We have to make it clear that we will now work even harder with all our Romanian partners to conclude the outstanding chapters and to resolve the country’s problems."
"That is the message that we must send to Romania today and when we vote on the report tomorrow: we will help you, but you must do the work in your own country yourselves; it is you who must fulfil the Copenhagen criteria."
"It is indeed the case that Romania has a lot of time to make up; for almost ten years in the 1990s, the reform process made no headway at all."
"It has to be acknowledged, though, that some chapters have been driven forward at a faster pace in recent years, and that is something that has to be supported."
"We think it wrong that the report should state, in item 1, that Romania’s ‘becoming a member in 2007 is impossible’."
"This has to be expressed in more positive terms: it is still possible that Romania will become a Member State in 2007, provided that the problems with which we are familiar can be dealt with, provided that there is an independent justice system, that corruption is combated, that the administration is efficient and that minorities are integrated."
"We have to be careful not to set the country up as too much of a scapegoat."
"I see that, in items, 17, 18 and 19, we call for teaching to be provided in minority languages;"
"I would be a happy man if people in other countries, including Member States of the EU, were able to use their own languages in schools, libraries and theatres in the way in which Germans and Hungarians can in Romania."
"The reference to child marriages in item 19 has to be qualified."
"The practice of children being forced into marriage is not universal in Romania, but it does occur in some Roma families."
"It will be important for my group to see whether our amendments will be adopted tomorrow; if they are, we will be able to vote in favour of the report."
"If they are not, we will have problems with it."
"Mr President, I would like to express my support for the excellent report by Mr Van Orden on the situation in Bulgaria, which is perhaps unfortunate in Europe to be the geographical neighbour of Romania and therefore to be associated with it, when its situation is entirely different."
"Today, the situation of Bulgaria is basically quite close to that of Portugal just prior to accession, with the same merits and the same potential for development, particularly in terms of tourism."
"I think that we will very quickly see Bulgaria swap exporting prostitutes for importing tourists, which will be extremely beneficial for the country’s development."
"Of course, the rule of law, if it is to be effective, needs to be established through legal methods."
"Without the rule of law, which is vital to development, Bulgaria will be incapable of constituting, particularly from our European perspective, the frontier region that has come inside the shifting front of EU progress."
"That is where our Wild West is, our very own America!"
"Mr President, as our friend Mr Oostlander said: by adopting the report by Baroness Nicholson a fortnight ago, we chose to express Parliament’s concern at the attitude of the Romanian authorities in the previous and current phases of the negotiations."
"The concern was such that we doubted whether the negotiations could be concluded by the end of the year and therefore whether Romania could join us by 2007."
"This strong message has today been taken on board at the highest level by Romania and we warmly welcome the personal commitments from the Prime Minister, Adrian Nastase, especially as they were accompanied by very concrete initial measures, which will certainly speed up the reforms that are still needed in order for the country to conform to the Copenhagen criteria."
"We should not forget that, to date, the Commission has been able to close twenty-two of the thirty-one chapters that it had to examine and that considerable progress in the fundamental areas of reform of the judicial system and in combating corruption should follow very quickly after the major cabinet reshuffle under way."
"The repeal announced of the current provisions of the criminal code, which is capable of limiting the freedom of the press, and, most importantly, the swift adoption of legislative provisions aimed at better protection of children, will be further tangible proof to us of the will of the Romanian authorities."
"To conclude, we welcome these encouraging signs and hope that they will enable the Commission to guarantee, in good time, that the accession of Romania will take place on the planned date, in circumstances that will ensure the good functioning of a further enlarged Union."
"Mr President, I will have no difficulty in voting in favour of Mr Brok’s report and the ten reports that make up this general report."
"By doing this, I will be happy to contribute, in a modest but heartfelt way, to the arrival of the ten new members of the European Union."
"The same applies to Mr Van Orden’s report on Bulgaria."
"It is true that the rapporteur’s comments may sometimes appear very favourable, or even too much so given the situation in Bulgaria."
"On the whole, however, the conclusion of this report seems to me to be the right one."
"The impression given by Baroness Nicholson’s report on Romania is different; in fact the contrast is striking."
"There is a feeling of unease when you see the indulgence of the report on Bulgaria and the severity of the one on Romania, when the two countries have a great deal in common."
"Baroness Nicholson did a significant amount of work over several months to monitor the case of Romania, and I welcome her efforts."
"However, the close attention that she pays to particularly painful problems, such as adoptions, led her to make very harsh judgments, so harsh, in fact, that the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy has already significantly amended the original text, which I welcome."
"Other amendments that we have tabled will, I hope, be adopted in plenary."
"Finally, the resolution before us contains blatant contradictions."
"Several of the provisions come from different points of view and I fear that as a whole, it lacks the coherence needed for the European Parliament’s message to Romania to be clear, precise and firm."
"I regret this, because Romania, which faces huge problems and massive underdevelopment, needs to be understood, criticised when it deserves to be, but also advised and encouraged as to the path that we wish to see it follow and which will lead it towards becoming one of us."
"– Mr President, the European Parliament agrees totally with the political assessment of the Commission and of the Commissioner with responsibility for enlargement, Günter Verheugen, that a failure to reach agreement on Cyprus could pose a serious obstacle to Turkey’s ambitions to become a member of the European Union."
"Parliament maintains that the Cyprus question thus amounts to a major stumbling block in Turkey’s path to accession and a political test of its European resolve."
"Parliament hopes that the Turkish political authorities fully understand its significance."
"I should like to cite a very important sentence in paragraph 63. ‘[It is] hard to imagine that Turkey could join the Union when it refuses to recognise a Union Member State, has military forces occupying part of that state’s territory, is boycotting that state’s ships, and is barring that state from its airspace.’"
"I will now speak in English because the Irish presidency is not paying attention to what has been said."
"What I was saying concerning paragraph 63 is that we find it very peculiar that Turkey could be a member of the European Union in a situation where it is partly occupying an EU Member State."
"This is a question about the EU's credibility in the quest for peace."
"We cannot tolerate the European Parliament accepting a country that is occupying a Member State of the European Union."
"Mr President, I join with others in warning that substantial change still needs to occur in Romania but that we reject the language of rejection."
"We should recognise the progress Romania has made in strengthening the Court of Audit, in judicial reform and in the introduction of the new Constitution, and we should not rule out a successful close to the negotiations this year."
"Every effort must be made, in particular by the Romanians, to maintain this momentum."
"However, we should signal our intent to them, and we do so by seeking to amend the resolution to replace the wording calling accession in 2007 'impossible' in paragraph 1."
"But problems remain."
"Despite efforts to reduce the number of children in institutions, Save the Children Romania says that no attention is paid to combating trafficking for sexual exploitation."
"The recent reported death of 17 psychiatric patients from malnutrition and hypothermia in a hospital in southern Romania shows the severe problems faced by disabled people. Our Amendment No 3 shows that discrimination against these and other groups is magnified amongst Roma communities."
"I fully support the rapporteur's view that the challenge is not simply one of closing chapters in negotiations but still one of dealing with endemic problems of corruption and political reform in order to meet the Copenhagen criteria for democracy and human rights."
"Finally, I am delighted that people from my own region in the east of England are linked through a network called Praxis with the Arad County Council in Romania."
"We must not lose sight of our aspiration, which is not simply about completing a political process of European enlargement but about bringing the people of Romania together with all those we represent."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, throughout the years in which we in this House busied ourselves with resolutions on the enlargement process, I sometimes found it disconcerting when we made quite detailed and precise demands of the countries concerned, imposing on them requirements with which we ourselves did not comply and telling them that this, this and that had to be utterly changed."
"So I found Commissioner Verheugen’s comment on agricultural policy this morning very helpful."
"Perhaps we ought really to be considering whether, if the accession countries’ administrations cannot implement these things quite that fast, the problem might not lie with us rather than with the countries of which we demand these things."
"After they have joined us, I would like to see a lot of our dead weight subjected to scrutiny, as we in Germany had to do after reunification, in order to take a look at all the red tape that had accumulated over the years and to consider whether the new Member States might not perhaps be able to provide us with more flexible and quicker solutions."
"All this is by way of general comment."
"I am the shadow rapporteur for Hungary, which has, of course, always been the model country, the country that, as long ago as August 1989, helped to cut through the Iron Curtain, to break down the Wall."
"With the pan-European picnic in August 1989, when everything was hanging in the balance, Hungary sent Europe a vital signal, and they have always done very well in fulfilling the criteria, so that they could actually be an example to the others."
"I am therefore particularly amazed that the Hungarian prime minister has come up with this curious proposal that candidates should stand on a sort of Unity List, with seats shared out between the government and the opposition, and that this would be the way to enter the new Europe."
"That really is an old way of thinking."
"Not a few Heads of State or Government would like to have things split half and half between government and opposition; perhaps the German Chancellor would in his present situation."
"The only thing is that democracy is about competition; it is about grappling with problems in order to find the right solutions, and so I wish that Péter Medgyessy, the Hungarian prime minister, would drop this idea and get back to our way of conducting parliamentary debate and, in his internal affairs policies, to competition between parties."
"– Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, today is the last time that this House will be able to discuss the process by which the ten new Member States are acceding to the European Union."
"There remain only 51 days before the historic date of 1 May 2004, on which the European Union will grow to become a Union of 25 Member States."
"This particular enlargement of the European Union will be accomplished on Workers’ Day, a date symbolising our need to face up to the challenge of giving the Union of 25 states economic and social cohesion."
"It is no less significant that, the internal policy of the enlarged Europe being a work of peace, we are developing it into a real, outward-looking common European peace policy."
"I have made Cyprus my concern ever since I entered this House in 1984, a time when few thought its accession a realistic prospect."
"Then, a few years later, Parliament forcefully urged that a solution to the Cyprus problem should not be made a precondition for its accession."
"I well remember such former Members of this House as Mrs Pauline Green, Mr Jan Willem Bertens, and Mr Yannos Kranindiotis; we believed that the accession process would be the catalyst that would bring about unification."
"There is now a substantial chance of the 30-year-long division of Cyprus being brought to an end even before 1 May."
"Not merely is it to be hoped, it is also to be expected, that the negotiating parties will indeed seize this opportunity, which may well be the last for a long time, and I hope and trust that Turkey will stand by its recent indications of willingness to work towards a solution."
"We must bring about a united Cyprus, in which all Cypriots can live together in peace, and which can play a full part as a Member State of the EU."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are analysing and describing the final steps on the road to the peaceful and comprehensive reordering of our continent."
"Never before in the course of history has a new order been achieved without war or the use of force."
"This development is thrown into particularly stark relief when we consider the road taken by those states that have been able to overcome what was called ‘actually-existing socialism’ and to find their way to freedom and democracy."
"Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania deserve particular credit for having been able, along the road to freedom, to regain their independence as states."
"Speaking personally, I am grateful to the people, parliament and government of Latvia, who, with the European Union’s support, have created the conditions for solving an extremely complex problem, that being the progressive integration of a large Russian-speaking minority."
"When one bears in mind that the country’s ethnic makeup is the result, more than anything else, of decades of occupation, it was not self-evident that this would happen, nor was it so in view of constant misunderstandings and suppositions on the part of, among others, the Russian Duma."
"At this point, I want to extend thanks to Mr Brok, who, this morning, gave voice to clear expectation of a change in the Russian position."
"Like Estonia, Latvia has set itself a task with, in future, a European dimension."
"I am convinced that the Russian-speaking minority will be successfully integrated into Latvian society, but that will depend on these citizens giving unmistakeable demonstrations of their loyalty to the Latvian state."
"It is also dependent upon their unconditional acceptance of the values and principles of the European Union."
"Future stronger and more extensive cooperation with Russia will depend, above all, on Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania putting down deep roots in the European Union."
"This cooperation is a strategic challenge for the European Union as a whole and the new Member States will have an indispensable contribution to make to it."
"– Mr President, when speaking on Estonia earlier, I praised, in their absence, its former Prime Minister Mart Laar and its Foreign Minister Ilves for their consistent policy of reform at home and, in foreign affairs, their aligning of their country with Europe."
"Now the two of them are sitting here beside me, so once again, I will express my thanks and appreciation for what they have done."
"As shadow rapporteur for Lithuania, I was particularly pleased by the high degree of approval – over 91% – in the referendum on accession to the EU, but also by the country’s high level of economic growth in recent years, which alone has made it possible to raise the funding that is needed if the social problems of transformation are to be solved."
"Lithuania, though, is also a very pertinent example of the continuing tensions between democratic institutions and the Mafia elements that are attempting to exert influence at the very highest levels of the state."
"Where this is concerned, I have confidence in the independence of Lithuania’s constitutional court;"
"I am also optimistic that the Lithuanian parliament’s investigations with a view to removing the present President from office will produce results commensurate with the requirements of the rule of law."
"It is perhaps this very point, among others, that I find lacking in Romania, and many speakers, including those who spoke this morning have already addressed this."
"Perhaps not only the small-time players should be punished, but also the Mister Bigs."
"In Romania, too, corruption and nepotism go right up to the very top; that is one reason why the country has fallen so far behind, while another is that too few changes of personnel were made after the political change."
"The revolution was not a complete success."
"The simple fact is that many of the old structures are still in place – not only at the highest level, but also at others."
"If the criticism is justified, then it is equally right that we should express our support and our willingness to help, but the main thing is that the work has to be done in the country itself, and sometimes the clearing-out has to start right at the top."
"Mr President, 1 May 2004 will finally signify the end of the cold war and seal the reuniting of a continent that we failed to protect from Communist tyranny."
"The EU, a body of 25 states, will soon have a population of 455 million and be the biggest economic zone in the world, even bigger than the United States of America."
"Slovakia, on which I am shadow rapporteur for my Group, has undergone huge changes over the last ten years, with the current government determined to deregulate."
"For instance, it has just cut business tax, along with income tax, to a competitive flat rate of 19%; this is most worrying to its neighbour Austria, which fears that businesses will relocate over the border."
"There have been similarly huge, visible changes in terms of prosperity, security, democracy, the rule of law and the fight against corruption in public life."
"In particular, we observed huge improvements in human rights, including minority rights, such as for the Roma communities and the gay community."
"Other matters as diverse as safety in nuclear power stations and food hygiene laws have also been implemented to the high EU standards."
"Security is also improving for all our continent, as all acceding countries bar Malta and Cyprus, which I particularly welcome as British Commonwealth states, will shortly be joining Nato."
"We can safely say that previous enlargements of the EU have historically been a success story."
"Conservatives, on balance, welcome the process and expect a similar outcome this time."
"However, we in the United Kingdom are right to bring in measures to prevent benefit tourism, whilst at the same time welcoming those seeking to work in our country."
"Over the horizon, we look forward to Romanian and Bulgarian accession in 2007."
"I am confident that the strong warning in the report on Romania will provide the incentive for its government to drive through the necessary reforms to satisfy all the Copenhagen criteria in time for Romania to join in due course, as scheduled."
"Today's sacking of the Romanian Justice Minister is a clear demonstration of the necessary political will for that process to occur."
". – Mr President, I would like to thank the Members who took part in this debate."
"I myself have witnessed at first hand on my visits to the accession states the quite extraordinary progress that has been made and Members have rightly drawn attention to that progress."
"There is still work to be done, but a huge amount of work has already been achieved."
"Parliament has addressed this issue in a most effective manner."
"I wish to express my gratitude to Members for the role they have played in the very important task of communicating to the citizens of their countries the unique and extraordinarily important moment we have reached in terms of enlargement."
"I agree also with what Commissioner Verheugen said this morning on the need to send out a positive message – and it is a remarkably positive message."
"I cannot understand how democrats cannot see just how remarkable the moment will be on 1 May when Europe will be reunited and when the most extraordinary event will come about without the firing of a single shot, as one or two Members have said."
"The presidency has full confidence in the Commission's ability to manage a smooth transition to membership of the accession states."
"I have already paid a personal tribute in this regard to Commissioner Verheugen."
"The Commission has the sole competence among the institutions to carry out the task of ensuring the proper functioning across all policies."
"I think that is happening."
"The presidency at the same time urges the newly-acceding states to complete their preparations and in particular to complete preparation in areas where problems have been identified by the Commission."
"This is worth doing for the new accession states themselves and for the Union."
"I would encourage full attention in that regard."
"With regard to Bulgaria and Romania, we had two fine reports before us today from Mr Van Orden and Baroness Nicholson."
"The presidency intends, in partnership with these countries and with the Commission, to ensure the application of the fundamental principle of this enlargement process and in particular the principle that each negotiation will be based on the merits of the individual case."
"The European Union will continue to monitor very closely the commitments made and the effective implementation of the in order to guide both countries in their preparation for membership."
"The presidency urges both countries to continue carrying out these preparations energetically."
"We are determined to do as much as possible to carry out the mandate of the European Council of December and to finish the negotiations this year."
"Welcoming both countries into the Union in January 2007 remains the European Union's objective."
"A number of Members specifically mentioned issues relating to Cyprus and Turkey."
"Mr Poos, in particular, touched on this."
"At last month's General Affairs and External Relations Council ministers again expressed the clear preference of the Council for the accession of a united Cyprus."
"We welcome the agreement of the parties to resume the negotiation process for a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem within the framework of the Secretary-General's mission of good offices."
"The Council fully supports Secretary-General Annan's efforts for the conclusion of an agreement, and we remain ready to accommodate the terms of a settlement, in line with the principles on which the Union is founded."
"I hope that the parties will redouble their efforts to reach agreement in the talks that are under way, and this clearly is in the interests of all the people of Cyprus."
"As we prepare for the European Union decision in relation to Turkey in December, we must also welcome the progress that Turkey has made to date in legislation for reform."
"Minister Cowen highlighted the crucial importance of moving ahead with the practical implementation of reforms at all levels of the administration and throughout the country when he led the EU Troika meeting with Foreign Minister Gül in Ankara on Monday last."
"Minister Cowen reiterated the assurance to Minister Gül that, if the European Council decides in December that Turkey fulfils the Copenhagen political criteria, the EU is committed to opening negotiations."
"A number of other issues were dealt with, but I want to return to one issue – the question of free movement and migration."
"A number of Members made the point that there is no evidence whatsoever to support some of the more scaremongering stories that have been spread in this regard."
"I welcome those particular contributions."
"Certainly at this point there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that the floodgates will open as and from 1 May next."
"At best, this is tabloid hysteria."
"The study by the European Commission and the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions shows that, even under conditions of full freedom of movement, migration from all the new Member States to all current Member States is likely to be about 1% of the working-age population of the new Member States over the next five years."
"That is hardly a flood!"
"The study shows that typical potential migrants are young and extremely well educated – the very type of people we need in the Union."
"It also shows that they are single, with no dependants, and that there is a high propensity for them to return to their native homes."
"The study confirms the view of the European Commission that fears of a huge wave of migration from the new Member States after 1 May are unfounded."
"I mention this point in particular because I know from the domestic debates on referenda in Ireland how easy it is for people of ill intent to misrepresent what in fact is the position."
"The reality is that Europe should be a Europe that welcomes the ten accession states and that we should fully meet all our obligations to the ten states."
"In conclusion, I wish to thank the Members."
"It has been a very thought-provoking and thorough debate."
"I know Members have put a huge amount of time and effort into what were necessarily truncated contributions."
"But points made have been well noted by the presidency."
". – Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank all the rapporteurs and all the speakers for a debate which has demonstrated, firstly, that we really are giving our new Members a new welcome, and secondly, that we agree on where praise and criticism are due."
"I think we also agree that people in the new Member States have shown a willingness to change, a willingness to go along with far-reaching reforms that some of us might like to see in our own countries."
"I am a member of the European Commission, and I have not spoken in relation to any particular country; there is a need for reform in a whole array of European countries, irrespective of who governs them."
"I wish to thank the Presidency, which, in close cooperation with the Commission, is driving this process forward, and, where there are things still to be done, is doing them together with us."
"Let me make just a few more comments on the discussions this morning."
"I would like to say to Mr Titley, on the subject of anti-Semitism in Lithuania, that we picked up on the Lithuanian newspaper’s anti-Semitic outbursts at once."
"It was in fact the Commission that raised this issue in the first place, and the Lithuanian Government has since responded by taking appropriate action."
"To those Members of this House who have spoken on the subject of the Roma, I would like to say that this is indeed one of the great unresolved issues in Europe, but that we cannot expect the accessions to produce a solution to it."
"It will take us at least a generation, if not several, before we can do away with social discrimination against the Roma, but what we did insist on as a precondition for accession was a detailed strategy that would help to overcome such discrimination in all areas."
"I would like to respond to Mr Sacrédeus’ interesting comment on Turkey and Cyprus by pointing out that it was the Commission that made the explicit political connection between the Cyprus issue and Turkey’s political aspirations towards Europe and declared that it was hard to imagine us being able to initiate accession negotiations with a country that did not recognise an EU Member State or had stationed troops in it in such numbers as to contravene United Nations resolutions."
"It follows that Mr Sacrédeus’ appeal ought not to have been necessary, and that was the line we took; that was what led to the Cyprus talks happening now."
"Let me conclude by returning to the subject of Romania."
"It was the Romanian Government itself that attached the greatest importance to the Council recommending a date on which the accession negotiations were to be concluded this year, something on which the Commission took a different view."
"Our line was that we needed more flexibility here, that this would be in Romania’s interests, and that it would be sufficient for us to conclude negotiations by the end of 2005 in order for accession to take place in 2007."
"The Romanian Government, however – for political reasons that I can well understand – insisted on 2004 as the date, and so we are entitled to expect it to make special efforts to fulfil all the conditions by then."
"I am happy to confirm what has been said by a number of speakers, that the warning shot fired by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy produced very rapid and credible responses; I have gained the impression that Romania has pulled itself together and that the process is now on the right track."
"I cannot do other than encourage the Romanians to continue acting in such a decisive way, and then, I think, we may yet reach our destination."
"That concludes the joint debate."
"The vote will be tomorrow at noon."
"In this joint debate on enlargement, it has once again been said that the constitutional treaty prepared by the Convention would provide a ‘framework to enable the enlarged Union to work effectively’, and that it should be adopted as quickly as possible, even before 1 May 2004."
"This is not correct."
"The reality is in fact the opposite."
"The draft Constitution is entirely unsuitable for an enlarged Europe for two reasons:"
"First of all, it maps out a State structure that is much too heavy and too rigid for a diversity of countries with very differing concerns."
"In an enlarged Europe, we in fact need a streamlined and flexible cooperation structure, which allows for a variety of forms much more easily than the current draft Constitution."
"Secondly, the draft Constitution provides for European institutions mainly functioning by majority, which is difficult to conceive in an enlarged Europe with no national safeguard clause."
"As the accession of Turkey appears to be under serious consideration by our governments – a possibility that I personally object to – have they thought about the far-reaching consequences of the reforms that they are proposing, which risk giving Turkey a central decision-making role in a Europe with uniform rules?"
". This report on the detailed preparation for EU membership by the 10 new Member States who will join on 1 May has once again deservedly attracted widespread support in principle in this House."
"It is interesting to note that the UK Unionist Parties are so enthusiastic about EU enlargement and keen to welcome on board these new Member States, many of whom are small, like Scotland, and in many cases have recently regained their independence."
"A contradictory approach is taken by these Unionist Parties at home, where Scotland is deemed, by them, to be too small, too poor and too weak to be able to exercise the normal rights and powers of independence."
"It is clear that Ireland, for example, has prospered as an independent EU Member State and it is fitting that in its role as EU presidency, Ireland will preside over this, the largest ever single enlargement of the EU."
"I have no doubt that Scotland too would be better off independent rather than being misrepresented and betrayed on a regular basis by UK ministers in the Council."
"The next item is the report (A5-0110/2004), by Philip Charles Bradbourn on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision amending the amended proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Decision No 1692/96/EC on Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network (renewed referral)."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, please remember that back in October 2001, on the basis of the White Paper, the Commission presented to the Council and Parliament an initial proposed amendment of the Decision on the guidelines and updating of the 14 priority projects approved in 1994 by the Essen European Council."
"At first reading, Parliament approved the main points of this proposed revision of the guidelines for the trans-European networks, in accordance with the compromise which had been reached."
"The Commission's proposal of 1 October – which is now on the table in Parliament – for this type of ‘first second reading’, completes that."
"Meanwhile, the Council has reached a political agreement on the text which combines both proposals, which, let us remember, represent the design of the trans-European networks in an enlarged Europe, a Europe of 27 Member States."
"I must say that the Commission's proposal today includes the updating of the priority projects, but also – and I would like to stress this point – of the organisational resources aimed at improving their planning, monitoring, coordination, funding and, therefore, their realisation, at European level."
"Our intention in this case is that the maps showing routes should become reality within our European geography."
"So what are the principal objectives of this proposal?"
"Firstly, I would like to point out that, on the basis of some 100 proposals presented by the States, the high-level group recommended reviewing the projects which conform to the following criteria: they are located on important European routes, they are subject to firm commitment on the part of the States in question, with a closed timetable for completion, they offer advantages in terms of aspects such as environmental protection, modal balance and territorial cohesion."
"We must remember that in that high-level group, chaired by former Commissioner Karel van Miert, not only were all the States of the Union + 10 + 2 represented, but also the European Investment Bank, whose opinions in relation to the economic aspects of the projects have been very useful."
"It should be noted that one of these priority projects concerns the so-called ‘motorways of the sea’, which are alternatives to the saturated land corridors and which must improve accessibility of regions which are disadvantaged by their geography, that is to say, the peripheral regions."
"The main innovation is that, within the framework of the trans-European networks, it will be possible to grant subsidies for implementation under specific conditions, which represents an interesting alternative for the European transport system, but furthermore emphasise port equipment in interconnection ports and the interconnections of ports with their surrounding areas."
"I must say that the aid for launching the new lines which would constitute the motorways of the sea would be restricted to what is absolutely necessary in order to guarantee the viability of economic relations between two States which jointly decide to establish one of these regular interconnections as an alternative to other modes of transport."
"The complete list of priority projects – three of which have been completed – represents an investment of EUR 224 000 million between now and 2020."
"But that is nothing more than the really essential part, the tip of the iceberg, because we must remember that the total cost of the projects for the trans-European networks for the Union of 27 States is more than 600 000 million."
"In other words, if we were really to carry out all the projects which we consider to be of trans-European interest in order to structure European Union transport, we would be talking about an investment of more than EUR 600 000 million, and what we are indicating is that of that 600 000, the most urgent sum represents at least EUR 225 000 million."
"I am pleased to note that the rapporteur’s report stresses the need to focus support and funding on priority projects within the project of European interest."
"This initial selection effort is essential in order to clarify what is of European interest in relation to great networks and what, for example, is included in regional development."
"In order to enhance the coordination between the States of the Union, the Commission proposes appointing – and now we are getting into new contributions beyond the drawing up of big routes – a European coordinator for one or several specific projects with a trans-European component."
"The job of this coordinator will be to advise the promoters of the project with regard to funding and assessment and also to promote synchronised development on each side of the border in the case of trans-European projects, as well as to carry out the different administrative procedures accompanying this type of project."
"It must be pointed out that, from the point of view of evaluation, we know that this will require consultations, work, not only with the States – firstly – but also, in many cases, with the regions affected and the neighbouring populations."
"The Commission also proposes a procedure for declaration of European interest which will mean encouraging the States to respect the timetable for the works listed in the proposal, and to integrate the assessment procedures divided between different States."
"In other words, the ultimate objective is to establish single and coordinated evaluation procedures between two States, which will enable border areas to make simultaneous progress and, where necessary, the border regions to be better coordinated."
"According to the Commission's proposal, this declaration could be withdrawn if the requirements are not fulfilled, in particular with regard to the timetable for work and the progress of the process."
"All the objectives I have just described are clear and achievable and we believe essential."
"I would like to conclude by saying that it is still possible to adopt this proposal during this legislature – although it is true that we have very little time – and it is therefore necessary that the approach of the three institutions is based on cooperation and the will to make progress and to demonstrate a degree of flexibility."
"As far as I am aware, the current differences are not really so great and I believe it is possible to reach an agreement – I would insist – before the end of this legislature."
"The approval of this proposal before 1 May would be extremely important, essentially for the new States, which could thereby benefit from that date and be genuinely included in this great project we are establishing amongst all of us."
". Mr President, a key collective goal of the European Union has always been and will always be that of a single market."
"The trans-European networks are a potent symbol of that single market, creating transport links that spread evenly the length and breadth of the EU and providing calculable benefits for business and people alike."
"As Parliament's rapporteur, this is the core consideration I have used in developing this proposal."
"The Community is set for enlargement in May, bringing under its umbrella another 75 million citizens, while at the same time huge growth is predicted in our major transport networks over the next decade."
"This more than ever is the right time to concentrate our efforts and bring this programme to a timely conclusion."
"We have a great opportunity to tie up this decision quickly, a mere three months after Parliament first debated this revised document."
"Whilst I firmly believe that Parliament can achieve most of what it wants within the body of this proposal, there clearly remain a number of issues on which we must all exercise good judgment and flexibility."
"I would urge all Members to come together to successfully conclude this legislation by moving forward as quickly as possible."
"Europe needs improved transport links now."
"We have to remember that this piece of legislation is Member State driven, and the fact that the Member States have met and managed to agree a comprehensive list of projects has to be recognised positively, whilst not denying Parliament its rights under the codecision procedure."
"There are certain areas that still need to be addressed."
"In our opinion the Council's position does not go far enough in placing restrictions on state aid for some key elements."
"Following the Commission's decision on Charleroi, we feel this principle should be upheld in respect of the TENs and in particular the motorways of the sea element of the programme."
"You cannot pick and choose when to enforce state aid rules and cannot add state aid ."
"We have also discussed the time limit for funding and I am pleased that the Commissioner referred to that in her address."
"I hope that both the Council and Commission will agree with Parliament on this, because in order to secure the long-term viability of the trans-European networks, it is imperative that we first ensure a commitment to act, as well as the sound management and financial probity of suitable projects."
"In conclusion, the TENs programme deserves implementation."
"It has at its core the achievement of a single market."
"I sincerely hope we can move forward to a sensible and above all balanced approach to Europe's infrastructure needs, which after all will help determine the future shape of transport across our continent for decades to come."
"I commend this report to the House."
"– Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, it would have been nice if the President-in-Office of the Council could still be here to hear us discuss this but, never mind, we are used to this sort of thing."
"I would like to start, Madam Vice-President, by reiterating that you have taken a very great deal of trouble in submitting a very well thought-out proposal."
"Setting up the van Miert Group was a very good idea, and the Commission proposal is influenced by what it produced and you revised."
"For that, many thanks; especial thanks, too, to my colleague Mr Bradbourn, whose report is the result of very careful work."
"As it stands, the report is not entirely what he would have liked to see, as a fortuitous majority in the Committee pushed through very substantial amendments to Annex III, but perhaps we can sort that out tomorrow."
"There are just three major points that I want to discuss."
"My group is in agreement with the list of priority projects being extended to 30."
"I now hear that the Council has suddenly decided that it no longer wants the 30th."
"It has to decide, then, what it actually wants."
"Although we are prepared to extend the list by adding, for example, the project for a fixed link across the Fehmarnbelt, we want a more precise definition of the projects in some areas covered by Annex III."
"This is the subject of a number of amendments, and I hope that the Council will accept them."
"My group is, at present, prepared to keep the list to 30 projects, as we know that, according to Article 156(2), decisions on trans-European networks cannot be taken in opposition to the Member States, so it makes no sense to make major additions to the list in the short time available."
"This means that we are taking the same line as Commissioner de Palacio, and I hope that the other groups will do likewise."
"Madam Vice-President, we very much welcome the idea of motorways of the sea;"
"I see the advancement of short-distance transport by sea, especially ferries, as very important."
"As a mode of transport, it saves a great deal of energy, is highly environmentally friendly, and will tend to take the load off road and rail corridors."
"However, Madam Vice-President, we are behind the rapporteur. Motorways of the sea must not be used as an excuse to inject state funds in the form of subsidies, with the state even buying ships in order to compete with private enterprise."
"That goes against the whole idea of trans-European networks, the object of which was always to improve infrastructure so that business can use it."
"Using them to extend it is not acceptable."
"I think we will sort things out with the Council in a sensible way, but there is very little time in which to reach an agreement."
"If, by Monday evening, the Council has not precisely defined what its interests are, and thereby enabled us to agree on the details, nothing will happen by 1 May; the fact is that Parliament will not simply abandon the good positions incorporated into the Bradbourn report simply because the Council is obstinately sticking to its own."
"Codecision is at issue here."
"Both sides have to give way."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Bradbourn, I would first of all like to welcome the ambitions of this trans-European network programme."
"It is necessary for employment and growth across the continent, for solidarity between the countries of the EU, in particular the new members, and for supporting the internal market."
"I will make a few comments on the text before us."
"The first comment concerns the motorways of the sea, on which I take the opposite position to Mr Bradbourn and Mr Jarzembowski."
"I think that they are spatial planning tools."
"They are transport policy tools."
"If they were only market tools, the motorways of the sea would not become a reality, because they would not be able to compete with roads and would be reduced, at best, to motorways of the sea between Antwerp, Rotterdam and Hamburg, which would be woefully insufficient for relieving the majority of European traffic."
"I think that they need public support, because they are public policy tools and not just market tools."
"Secondly, I would like to draw your attention to the need for the European Parliament to have as much involvement as possible with the latest revisions and to be kept informed, if possible, of their implementation."
"We know that Quick Start exists, not legally, but actually."
"I think it would be reasonable for Parliament to be kept regularly informed, as the projects that it undertakes are implemented."
"Finally, on the subject of funding, you said yourself, Commissioner, that you needed EUR 4.8 billion per year in order to set this particularly ambitious programme in motion."
"Unfortunately, I now have the impression that we are being given the luxury of choosing a spending programme without the restriction of finding income."
"I would like to say that Parliament will support you, in the Council, to help you ensure that this programme does not exist solely on paper and that it does not end up with the Essen syndrome, in other words that it is not just something that is talked about but has no future."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the brief time that Parliament has accepted for debating the vote on these guidelines, as well as the strong commitment being made to reaching an agreement that will allow the work to be completed by the end of this parliamentary term is proof of the importance that Parliament too attaches to defining the European transport networks. These are seen as tools both for constructing the internal market and for strengthening the cohesion of the Union."
"TENs were first defined in 1996, whereupon we found ourselves, little by little, having to look again at this project several times, changing the content too, because motorways of the sea are fundamentally a novelty that must above all be seen as a tool for allowing some traffic to be taken away from our Union’s congested roads."
"We are now faced with a dual necessity: that of strategically defining the works that will have a long-term effect and that will significantly reduce the construction time, and that of continually adapting to those economic and social changes that, in turn, alter the demand for transport."
"Flexibility on two levels is therefore to be commended: flexibility over time, which should be partially – and I must say adequately – guaranteed by the concept of biennial reports that can lead to the agreed forms being revised; and flexibility in the actual definition of the group of projects corresponding to each of these proposals."
"I say this because we are essentially talking about major waterways, but major waterways can only be classed as such if they have working tributaries and if proper links to these are put in place."
"Well then, I will take the liberty of insisting that thought be given to the possibility of ensuring that major tributaries and the links essential for major waterways to work are placed on an equal footing, as indicated in the tabled amendments."
"Mr President, as a result of a number of bottlenecks in the trans-European transport network, the movement of persons and goods gets snarled up at the crossing with the Alps, the Pyrenees and a few sea straits."
"Not only the hauliers, but also the people living in mountains, valleys and coastal resorts complain about a huge traffic burden."
"Nobody took it upon themselves to build tunnels and bridges in order to remove those bottlenecks."
"Furthermore, for years, rail traffic did not keep up with demand for fast connections between the big cities in different countries."
"That is why we desperately need to work on maintaining, improving and extending the transport network in Europe, and in this the primary option should be for transport by rail and at sea, which are the least environmentally threatening forms of transport."
"It would be narrow-minded to measure our prosperity, well-being and progress according to the rise in transport, or the surface area of asphalt and concrete for motorways and airports."
"On the contrary, preventing unnecessary transport contributes to a better environment and to the well-being of people and animals."
"According to my group, a sufficient level of government spending is indispensable in the provision of public services, social security and the environment."
"Wasting government funds and megalomania, however, do not solve anything."
"We are opposed to the idea of endless investments of Community funds in asphalt being the best way of creating and maintaining jobs or of helping new Member States along."
"Neither are we taken with the intention of giving businesses overcapacity, thus enabling them to decide on every occasion which infrastructure, funded with Community support, can be used by them at the time in the most cost-effective manner."
"When it was presented at the end of June last year, the Van Miert plan was immediately hailed by the Italian Transport Minister as transport's answer to the euro."
"Does he see transport as an unmanageable natural phenomenon which makes people reliant on it?"
"We see transport as taking second place to people and the environment."
"That is why we consider the Van Miert plan too unwieldy, too threatening to the environment and far too expensive."
"A more selective plan, focusing on more direct and quicker rail transport is preferable."
"That will be our guiding principle when we amend this proposal."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the reform of the trans-European networks, which has been mentioned in this debate, has no future."
"It does not appear to be underpinned by any real and sustainable concept of mobility for the whole of Europe; on the contrary, it is no more than yet another mixed bag of national interests."
"The proposals that have been tabled are the ones that it was thought would gain acceptance."
"These projects do not appear to have been analysed in terms of their benefits and optimum costs, and, in many respects, they contravene European environmental law."
"One of the things that make this clear is that projects given priority status are in breach of the Birds Directive, the Habitats Directive and the Water Framework Directive."
"Among them, let me mention only the Kresna Gorge and the bridge over the Straits of Messina."
"The concept of trans-European networks must be able to stand up to a strategic environmental assessment if the projects are to receive European funding."
"Only projects that pass this test can be supported."
"European funds must be invested in a sustainable way; they must also be capable of opening up ways ahead, enabling our children to enjoy mobility in the future."
"The projects we are planning are long-term ones."
"We firmly reject these misconceived plans, especially those to which I have referred."
"Mr President, Commissioner de Palacio, I will just focus on a few of the aspects relating to updating the priority projects, in particular on Project No 29 and more specifically on the Ionian/Adriatic intermodal rail route which, over time, has been shortened by a section that today should have instead been reopened, the Bari-Varna route."
"We believe that this is an issue of great importance if it is true that the European Union and this Parliament intend to attach importance to the integration of the Balkan area into the trans-European networks too."
"It cannot be said that this is not a project of European interest because it brings major added value – facilitating the mobility of goods and people – and because it will contribute to territorial cohesion of the European Union."
"An objection is being made to the impossibility of using the structural funds because these countries are not currently within the European Union. This is, however, an objection that, in my opinion, can be easily overcome only if there is a will to suggest access to the EIB funds or a more prudent reworking of the funds already earmarked by the European Union for the whole Balkan area."
"The Balkan area is very important, not just in terms of transport, but also in terms of security, and transport can help the issue of security, especially in an area where illegal immigration represents a constant danger for the border countries such as Italy and, in general, for the whole of the Mediterranean area."
"This is why we hope that the three institutions, as the Commissioner mentioned, want to agree in the most rational way on a number of guidelines provided through the modernisation programmes listed in Annex III."
"Mr President, all those involved behind the scenes are working very hard under the guidance of the rapporteur in order to complete this dossier before the end of this mandate."
"Given the importance of this matter and the amount of time that has already lapsed, time is of the essence."
"In a few months' time, the number of interested parties will grow to 25, which can further delay decision-making, certainly if the project list in the annex is extended."
"I am pleased that various MEPs appear to be settling for an optimisation of the projects already included."
"This being the case, the only addition will be Seine-Nord, for which there is already considerable support."
"What we are apprehensive about is additional obligations being imposed in respect of the environmental impact reports."
"This obligation is already in place in most Member States, and duplicating it would delay the implementation of projects even further than they already have been."
"It is already bad enough that the financing holds up the projects for some time."
"In short, let us arrive at an agreement with the Council soon, essentially on the basis of the Commission proposals."
"– Mr President, I regret having to begin my speech with words of criticism."
"The fact that the President and the Presidency have left the Chamber does not bode well for this project."
"Mr Roche was present earlier while we had a very successful and positive discussion of the issue of enlargement, but now we are dealing with the technicalities of making enlargement possible, of giving it substance and life, the Presidency is not there."
"For such neglect we must reproach the Irish presidency, which has otherwise been so painstaking."
"Turning to the matter in hand, let me point out – as a number of speakers have already done – that we need a functioning infrastructure if the European Union, and the internal market in particular, are to function."
"Nothing will work without adequate rail, road and water links."
"The enlargement of the EU makes it a matter of urgent necessity that the network should be extended; to put it more precisely, what this means is establishing links or rather restoring those that Europe had, in some instances, 70 years ago, but most of which were shut down during the 70 years in which parts of Eastern Europe were under Communist rule."
"We now have to expend a great deal of effort on closing these gaps."
"I refer in particular to a number of links running from Austria, my home country, in relation to which I have proposed a number of minor additions, and will take this opportunity to contradict my colleague Mr Jarzembowski."
"The majority was not fortuitous; it was deliberate and very determined, for the sake of the matter in hand, to close loopholes; we were concerned with, among other things, particularly the rail link between Graz and Spielfeld, which provides a functioning rail link with the new Member State of Slovenia, with the line from Linz to Prague and with what is known as Summerau line."
"It also mattered to us that the Czech Republic should be connected via a proper and functioning rail link."
"I would rejoice if, despite the resistance with which this meets, not least from my own country, we could also succeed in incorporating what is called the Southern Railway and the Semmering link into this network."
"What the Vice-President stated earlier strikes me as being extremely important in the context of our present discussion and the further progress that we hope we can expect."
"It is not lines on a map that we need; they have to become reality."
"It is for that reason that we have to make it our concern that a start really is made on these projects, that they are brought to completion, and that funding should be provided for them."
"If we succeed in this, it can be expected to have a positive effect on employment."
"We would thereby be implementing some of what we constantly demand in connection with Lisbon."
"– Mr President, it would of course make for enormous fun if I were now to talk about the dispute among the Conservatives, but, as Mr Bradbourn has submitted a good report, I shall refrain from doing so."
"I think we should start by stressing what a fascinating European transport project the trans-European networks are."
"Jobs are at stake, as is the transport of goods, and this is also of course about how this can be done without damaging the environment."
"The Commission proposal is very consistent, in that it makes clear Europe’s desire to change over to environmentally-friendly modes of transport and to water-based ones."
"With the motorways of the sea, we are breaking new ground, and European transport policy can hold its head up there."
"It has to be said, though, that railway projects and waterways have effects in terms of environmental policy, and so, as part of the trans-European networks, there is a need for strategic environmental assessment."
"If codecision means anything at all, it means that there have to be changes in the way specific projects are developed."
"If there are plans for motorways of the sea between the North Sea and the Baltic – and I think they would be a good thing – whilst the canal between the North Sea and the Baltic, which would cut the journey significantly, is forgotten, then that is not on; it would be absurd."
"For that reason, there is a need for improvements here."
"I think we need to tell the Council that we, in this Parliament, have had experience of the development of the trans-European networks; let me just mention the Christophersen Group or the Essen projects."
"That is why it cannot be surprising that this House should attach importance to the realisation – and hence also the funding – of the trans-European networks and the priority projects being subject to strict controls and rigorous monitoring."
"That I see as one of our tasks as a parliament."
"If the Council wants solutions – and I think it capable of getting them – then fair compromises are needed, and they have to be agreed by us together; the Council cannot simply announce a done deal."
"If it makes good use of the opportunity, we can achieve the right results."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for updating the priority trans-European transport network projects is important for Europe’s development."
"I hope that it will be swiftly implemented, and for that reason it would be wise if this Parliament showed moderation in the number of projects."
"The motorways of the sea is a new operational mode that I also hope will be realised with prompt decisions being taken."
"It will permit the development of a sustainable and more environmentally friendly mode in a way in which logistics can be developed to the full in terms of efficiency."
"I think the motorways of the sea concept should not be too limited."
"These projects must also be available on existing sea routes."
"With regard to the Nordic Triangle, in the vote there is a proposal to extend this to include the northern part of the Gulf of Bothnia."
"I support this small amendment, which, if implemented, would improve cross-border rail transport services between Finland and Sweden."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the Commission has presented us with a new modification of the guidelines for the trans-European transport networks, in which it proposes extending the number of priority projects which will be declared to be of European interest."
"We do not agree with some of them, but, above all, what we cannot accept is that, in parallel, a quick start list should be proposed to the Council, which would be restrictive, with the justification that it is necessary for the Community's growth strategy."
"If we want the priority projects to be implemented between now and the end of 2006, we propose the establishment of a funding bonus for works certificates genuinely executed within this period of time."
"This would really contribute to development, and not restrictive measures such as the quick start list."
"We welcome the inclusion of the motorways of the sea, but we must view them as cross-border routes so that they can have access to as much Community funding as possible."
"Finally, for those cases in which States have difficulties funding a certain project of European interest in time, we would request that interested autonomous communities and regions which have their own resources be permitted to present proposals to implement them, and also that these communities be able to access aid for funding trans-European transport networks included in all lines of the Community budgets."
"Mr President, I must begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Philip Charles Bradbourn, on the effort he has put into producing this report throughout its negotiation."
"The projects affected, classified as priorities, which will be declared to be of Community interest, will enjoy the very significant advantage of easier access to the available Community resources."
"In our case, we are glad that the modification of project No 16 in Annex III has been included, the Sines-Badajoz railway line, changing its dimension and adding certain links by road and rail which will also provide greater permeability for the Pyrenees and which are going to resolve the bottlenecks which usually arise in this area."
"But it must be made clear that this permeability of the Pyrenees – and this is our opinion and our demand – must extend all the way to Algeciras itself."
"We are also pleased with the support for the so-called ‘motorways of the sea’, since attaching the same importance to these transnational maritime routes as to motorways or railway is going to facilitate connections with countries isolated by natural barriers."
"The benefit will undoubtedly extend also to countries with island or peripheral regions."
"In line with this thinking, nevertheless, we cannot understand why, in certain passages, specific reference to the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal) is being removed in connections with the North Sea and the Irish Sea."
"We will vote in accordance with these considerations."
"– Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, on 1 May, a whole array of new states will be joining the European Union, but that day will not, of course, accomplish integration or the real unification of Europe; for that, many measures will be needed, in particular where infrastructure is concerned, and in the extension of the railways."
"I recall how, in this Chamber, Mr Jarzembowski, we crossed swords on the subject of the Transit Regulation and how some of you – including you, my dear Mr Jarzembowski – said: ‘so let us invest more in railways!’"
"Well, we now have the chance to support not only Austria but also the countries bordering on it if, tomorrow, we vote in favour of these rail projects linking East with West, North with South, becoming reality."
"I am referring here, on the one hand, to the project that has already been mentioned – from Prague to Graz via Linz and then further southwards – and also, on the other, to the southbound line through Vienna."
"These will help not only our neighbours, the Czech Republic and Slovenia in particular; if we think ahead a bit, we will be including the whole of the Balkans, and if we want to free up the roads for those who have to use them or for whom it makes more sense to use them, whether with private vehicles or HGVs, then I believe this extension of the railways is what we need."
"Madam Vice-President, I am very glad that a representative of the Commission, addressing the Committee during its deliberations, took a very positive view of what is known as the Summerau project, that is to say, the line running from Prague to the south via Linz."
"I hope that the Commission will support these projects, for what matters is that we provide this Europe of ours with an infrastructure that is environmentally friendly, that is efficient and that really does link the countries in Central Europe with one another."
"I would not wish to deny that profits may well accrue from this to Austria, which suffers a great deal from heavy goods vehicle traffic, but I do hope that we will receive support from all sides of this House; this is not about self-centred interests, but about those of Europe as a whole, and when it comes to pursuing and maintaining those, we should as far as possible be in agreement."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to describe a case for which I can find no solution: let us imagine a network, a link between two countries, backed up by all studies which tell us that in 2010 we are going to be faced with gridlock in the traffic in goods and passengers between those countries."
"We are faced with the problem that one of the two countries does not support the implementation of that project."
"We cannot find a solution."
"Something is failing, because the result will be that in 2010 the gridlock will take place and that network will not be created."
"I, as an Aragonese Member, and you, as a Spaniard like myself, know that I am talking about Vignemal."
"We are dealing with a project which is absolutely essential to the interrelationship between the north and south of Europe and with a country, in this case France, which seems to be withholding its interest in implementing the project."
"Frankly, Commissioner, I cannot find any solution to this problem in the Commission's documents."
"I hope that you, who I know offer enormous support to the project, can resolve this problem I am faced with."
"– Mr President, as representatives of Europe’s electorate and people, we have some comprehensive tasks as politicians."
"First, we must ensure a good environment to live in and, second, we must ensure that there is employment, particularly for our young people in the future."
"In order to achieve a good environment, employment and growth, we must make use of transport links and communications."
"We must make use of the trans-European networks in a European context."
"We can thus promote both growth and a good environment."
"This must also take place in the peripheral northern areas where we have close trade relations with Russia, for example."
"This would benefit the whole of the EU from an industrial point of view and create opportunities for employment."
"We therefore propose in Amendment No 47 that the Haparandabanan line should be a priority project within the trans-European networks."
"The railway is connected to those main lines that together make up an important goods route within northern Sweden and that, in turn, are connected to the Nordic Triangle, the Council’s Project 12."
"The Haparandabanan line is a missing linkIt is a mature project that involves the upgrading and new construction of railways on the Swedish side in order to raise the standard, and a rational track gauge shifting facility at the national border in Haparanda - Torneå."
"The project would facilitate trade with Russia and improve the environment in the EU."
"North-western Russia has great access to raw materials which should be of value to European industry and which are transported by this route."
"An improvement of the rail connection can therefore be expected to contribute to a continued beneficial development of trade."
"The section of the project relating to track gauge shifting facilities will provide experiences that can be drawn on also in other places in the EU that have problems with the linking of railway networks with different track gauges, for example between the Baltic countries and Central Europe and between Russia and the EU."
"Finally, I would like to agree with the comments of Mr Savary at the beginning of the debate."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we are at first reading, not at ‘second first reading’, and I must say to you, as rapporteur for the report on the White Paper, that the project you are presenting to us is organised and is in line with those recommendations."
"I would therefore like to congratulate and thank Mr van Miert for his work, because, naturally, the railway, the ports and maritime transport, inland waterways and roads, essentially in the enlargement countries, are quite rightly included, and we are therefore moving in the right direction."
"The time has now come to respect the role of Parliament."
"We cannot be convinced, as the rapporteur intended, that Parliament cannot modify this proposal."
"Parliament’s proposals are not nit-picking amendments."
"I believe that the Commission must continue to play its role so that many of the extremely reasonable proposals, which I am not going to refer to, are accepted, because they contain extremely positive elements."
"Mr President, Commissioner de Palacio, I will use this minute to announce that our group will vote in favour of Amendments Nos 39 and 45 that provide for the bridge over the Straight of Messina to be eliminated from the projected Berlin-Palermo Corridor."
"When the funding of new public works is being debated, amendments to delete things are quite rare."
"In general, parliaments propose additional and supplementary features."
"This increases still further the political significance of the position of our group and of other groups that will vote in favour of these amendments on the grounds that the bridge is economically and environmentally unsustainable."
"To link Palermo with Berlin, more than a bridge would be needed, Commissioner. A whole railway would be required."
"In Sicily, trains still run on single tracks, like in the time of King Vittorio Emmanuele. We stress that we do not have any ideological prejudice because of this; we are simply convinced that this is a useless, unrealistic and costly project."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like firstly to thank you for all your speeches and in particular, of course, the rapporteur, Mr Bradbourn, for the work he has done, which I know has been extraordinary, as well as the whole Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, which has reworked the amendments and produced great European added value and very interesting proposals."
"I would like to say to the honourable Members that yesterday, on the occasion of the meeting of the Council of Ministers for Transport, I said that if the Council had modified the Commission’s initial proposed projects – even if it was a single modification, dealt with and supported by the Van Miert Group, but which had not initially been given the green light by the States – we would have to allow Parliament to act in a similar way."
"In other words, to incorporate and where necessary amend the projects, provided that they had been considered by the high-level Van Miert Group, discussed by the representatives of all the States – also by the EIB and others – and furthermore given the green light by the States in question."
"I also told them that it was not a question of substantially modifying Annex III nor all the projects, but of allowing Parliament its prerogatives, that is to say, the capacity to make contributions to the proposals for the trans-European networks."
"In this regard, I noted the degree of flexibility on the part of the Council, a constructive flexibility, which could be interpreted as indicating, ‘we have also been very respectful; it has been an exceptional case; the issue cannot now suddenly be reopened’."
"And it is within the context of this balance that we have to operate."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say that, as well as the specific modifications to specific projects, which I will refer to at the end of my speech, there are various amendments in your proposals which refer to general issues and many of them have been accepted."
"In this regard, I am happy to tell you that the majority of those intended to clarify the text of the proposed Decision can be accepted by the Commission."
"For example, Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 11 (first part), 12 (second part), 16 and 17; others can be accepted with certain modifications of the wording such as, for example, No 10 (first and second part) and No 40, in relation to the reference to environmental analyses; it is clear that all projects funded by the Commission must respect the environmental legislation in force; that is an obligation."
"The Commission therefore accepts the addition of the reference in the text aimed at emphasising this aspect, as in the case of Amendments Nos: 33, 34, 37, 42, 43 and 44."
"With regard to the other amendments, some cannot be accepted because they have already been implicitly included in the proposal and are therefore superfluous; for example, Amendments Nos 11 (second part), 12 (first part), 18 and 21."
"Other amendments have been rejected because they go beyond the scope of the proposed Decision; for example, Amendments Nos 2 and 13 (second part)."
"Amendments Nos 7, 8 and 15 do not precisely correspond to the objectives of the proposal and, therefore, it is not appropriate to accept them."
"With regard to Amendment No 7, we cannot accept it in its entirety, because we do not believe we should extend the concept of ‘motorways of the sea’ so far, since ultimately that would reduce the strength achieved by concentrating and selecting specific projects; nevertheless, there is one part I would like to refer to which we can accept and which relates to Amendment No 22 by Mr Jarzembowski, and that is that we could include an express reference to the fact that motorways of the sea will include canals linking two seas."
"I believe that this makes sense and we can include this modification."
"We should not remove the open procedure for competition, that is the announcement of proposals."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we must not hand out the motorways of the sea just to people we know, because that would be entirely contrary to our approach."
"What we must do is open up the contracts to competition, because that is the only way to maintain balanced systems, to gain the greatest advantages offered by the various opportunities and maintain the basic principles of the Treaties."
"We must guarantee transparency and competition, and that means we must make open tenders, announcements and proposals."
"The economic conditions are specified in the financial Regulation and not in this document."
"With regard to the European coordinator, as I indicated previously, the Commission accepts Amendments Nos 9 and 10, with certain clarifications, while Amendment No 8 cannot be accepted as such by the Commission, which does not mean that this Parliament will not be informed of the appointment of coordinators, but that the Commission will inform Parliament of the appointments as and when they are agreed."
"With regard to Annex III, as I said, the Commission's view is that the debate should not be reopened but that it should maintain a degree of flexibility because, I would insist, this House co-legislates on an entirely equal footing with the Council."
"The Council has reopened it and, therefore, we believe that we must provide a margin for flexibility."
"Furthermore, the Council has heard the Commission's argument."
"In this regard I would like to say that four amendments which contain modifications or details of routes for projects already included in Annex III, proposed by the Commission, must be accepted, provided that the countries in question accept those modifications."
"Because we cannot do anything against their will."
"And in reply to Mr Ferrández Lezaun, you have no idea how much I understand you."
"Unfortunately, this is not the only case; when one is in my position one realises that this is not the only country, nor the Pyrenees the only border, where situations of, shall we say, asynchrony, or lack of coordination of times, arise, and that is bad for everybody."
"We cannot therefore make modifications which are not accepted by the countries."
"In this regard, yesterday we were trying to reach an agreement with the countries on the modifications of this nature they would be prepared to accept."
"I have received certain replies which I will mention to you."
"For example, the first part of Amendment No 22 could be accepted, that is to say, in relation to the linking of the two canals, either because we present it black on white, or because we present it in a general manner, but, in this case, the countries in question are prepared to include it."
"The first part of Amendment No 20, Algeciras-Bobadilla, which is a mixed project, not as it is at the moment, when it is considered as transport; it is already included in project 19 and what we must do is include it as part of Sines-Madrid-Paris, the great cargo route and we have the green light here as well."
"The second part of Amendment No 22, the Baltic Motorway of the Sea, project 21, can go as far as the North Sea; its name will be changed to ‘Baltic-North Sea Motorway of the Sea’ and we also have the green light from the countries in question."
"In the first part of Amendment No 19, relating to project 6, that is, Lyon-Turin-Trieste-Koper-Ljubljana-Budapest, it would be a question of specifying that the railway line from Trieste to Ljubljana should pass through Divaca and that the line between Venice and Trieste should pass through south Ronchi."
"The Commission has difficulties here, because the countries affected are not expressing their agreement."
"We are talking about modifications which consist of establishing a route with differences of 20 km to the north or to the south, as happens for example in the case of south Ronchi."
"In the rough sketch we have on our map it is not clear whether it goes a little further north or a little further south."
"At the end of the day this will depend on the will of the specific country and the routes which can be defined in accordance with environmental and all other types of criteria."
"Nevertheless, ladies and gentlemen, it is difficult for the States to accept it as it is."
"And the same is the case with the proposal that the Trieste-Ljubljana route should pass through Divaca."
"Slovenia says that it has difficulties accepting it."
"Let me make it very clear that the Commission has no problem, but that the problem is with the countries affected themselves, and we are talking about modifications of 20 km, of going into the details of important routes."
"I would insist that the Commission has no problem but that we need the agreement of the States in question."
"Certain amendments involve adding projects or sections which have already been carefully assessed by the Van Miert Group."
"With regard to these, if the criteria of Article 19 are met, including the firm commitment on the part of the States to carry them out, the Commission is fully prepared to facilitate this agreement."
"But only two projects have been analysed in accordance with this criterion: one is the Sena-Escalda river project, which does not appear to pose any problem, because the Council accepted it at the meeting on 5 December, and naturally if Parliament proposes it, the Commission has no problem."
"And the second project is Amendment No 26, relating to the Prague-Linz link."
"I know that this is very important for certain Members of Parliament."
"On this line we may very possibly be given the green light by the countries in question, but I am not so sure that we will be given the green light from them for the rest of the project."
"I would therefore ask you, ladies and gentlemen, not to vote for this project or, at least, only to consider the first part."
"Naturally, the Commission will accept what the countries affected say in the Council, because we cannot go against their opinion."
"Other amendments introduce significant modifications which have not been assessed by the Van Miert Group, such as the Marseilles-Turin railway line, referred to in Amendment No 19, and which has been rejected; the same is the case with the Haparanda line, referred to in Amendment No 47."
"These projects were not initially presented by the States in question and do not fulfil all the selection criteria in Article 19, in particular, the commitment of the States of the Union to a timetable."
"In accordance with the spirit of Article 156 of the Treaty, the guidelines for the projects require the approval of the State in question, and the Commission must therefore oppose these amendments."
"Other amendments propose routes in third countries."
"In this case, the Commission cannot include routes which cross third countries in the trans-European networks, but we are aware of the problem posed by the existence following enlargement of an enclave surrounded by Union territory."
"In Compostela, in June, we will meet with the chiefs of the various pan-European corridors in order to review them, bearing in mind that two-thirds of those corridors, following enlargement to 27 States, will be within the Union and will be trans-European networks, which is what we are approving today."
"In that review of the pan-European corridors we will have to deal specifically and very dynamically with those works which represent a connection of European territory via non-European territory, as in the case of certain countries of the former Yugoslavia in the Balkans region."
"Ladies and gentlemen, certain amendments propose withdrawing or removing parts already integrated within the proposals of the Commission's Van Miert group and approved by the Council."
"These amendments, which the Commission cannot accept, are Amendments Nos 1, 7, 20 and 25."
"The projects included in Annex III, I would insist, are based on economic studies and political approval from both the Van Miert group and the Council."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it has been requested that in relation to motorways of the sea there should be explicit mention of Spain and Portugal rather than saying ‘the south of Europe’; this is what Mr Camisón said."
"I am going to check this but, as far as I know, it remains in the proposals."
"With regard to the central crossing of Vignemal, the central crossing of the Pyrenees, I would insist that we must respect the will of the States."
"We must try to encourage them, but we must respect what the Treaties say: that without the agreement of a State works cannot be carried out on their territory."
"I would like to end by once again thanking the honourable Members and saying to you that, as you can see, the positions of the Commission and the Council offer a degree of flexibility in order to take up some of the proposals and contributions of this Parliament which improve the initial text and which, furthermore, respect the balance between the institutions."
"I would ask Parliament to understand that this margin for flexibility exists, but that it is impossible to entirely reconsider the fundamental points and the whole range of proposals for these new trans-European networks, which we must approve urgently so that, from 1 May 2004, when we are 25 countries rather than 15, the ten new Member States are included in them, since they will be part of the Union as a whole."
"I would like to thank Mr Bradbourn and the whole of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for their work."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is Question Time (B5-0066/2004)."
"The following questions are addressed to the Council."
"Since the United Kingdom joined France and Germany in backing certain Community policies such as defence, and supported both countries when they failed to comply with the Stability Pact, some elements in the institutions and the media interpret this as meaning that, in the face of the problems arising in the adoption of the draft Constitution, the axis formed by these three countries is moving towards the creation of a 'pioneer' group, which would lead to a two-speed Europe relatively remote from the other Community democratic institutions."
"What steps will the Presidency of the Council take to avert this grave danger, whilst seeking agreement for the adoption of the draft Constitution submitted by the Convention?"
". – The presidency will be submitting an assessment of the prospects for progress in the Intergovernmental Conference to the European Council in March, as agreed at the European Council in December 2003."
"However, it is not for the presidency, speaking on behalf of the Council, to express an opinion on the issues raised in the honourable Member's question."
"The Council has neither discussed nor taken a view on the question of a two-speed Europe."
"It is not on the agenda."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to ask you a supplementary question on behalf of Mr Nogueira and then, if you will allow me, to ask one on my own behalf."
"Mr Ortuondo, you will only be able to act as substitute for Mr Nogueira, because in accordance with the Rules of Procedure there are other Members who wish to put supplementary questions."
"Please restrict yourself to speaking as a questioner."
"Mr President, I am a Member of the European Parliament and I have as much right as everybody else to speak on my own behalf."
"Please follow the Presidency’s instructions."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we have heard that the main points of divergence in the Intergovernmental Conference are the composition of the Commission – whether or not there should be one Commissioner per Member State – the Presidencies of the Council and the redefinition of the qualified majority for the adoption of decisions in the Council in accordance with a majority of States and a majority of population."
"Do you not believe that representation by all States in the Commission helps greater numbers of citizens to identify with European integration, and do you not believe that positions such as that of the Spanish Government, intended to create blocking minorities on the basis of the third Nice criterion – the number of votes in the Council – may push other governments to evade restrictions and to move towards a two-, three- or more speed Europe?"
"– Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, although I do not completely share the concern expressed by Mr Nogueira and Mr Ortuondo, it would be good if it could be made clear in Parliament regarding what importance should be attached to these summits held by just a few Member States."
"The fact is that three countries convened at this meeting held on the eighteenth of last month and, apparently, some details concerning the Constitution were also discussed there."
"Information has been openly passed around regarding these voting procedures, the weighting of votes in the Council, and the appointment of Commissioners, and it would be good if we heard from you how Ireland, as the country holding the Presidency, dealt with these issues."
"Were they dealt with, did any concrete proposals to the Council emerge from this summit of the big three, and what are the future intentions with regard to this matter?"
". – As I said at the outset, the issue of a two-speed Europe is not on the agenda and I am not going to speculate on this issue."
"I am aware of, and in my statement this morning made reference to, many of the other issues that are of concern in the context of the IGC."
"The further supplementary question on the meeting of the three countries in Berlin is one that I responded to in a previous part-session."
"I indicated that these three countries were holding discussions amongst themselves, that they were not the only countries doing so, and that these were in fact very helpful to the Irish presidency."
"But the main point is that this issue of a two-speed Europe is not on the agenda in the context of our considerations in the IGC."
"Cuba's annual Book fair is a cultural and media event of great international prestige."
"This year the organisers planned that Germany should be 'guest of honour', but the German government, in line with the Common Position defined by the Council and its recent policy of cultural sanctions against Cuba, turned down the invitation."
"However, the number of writers and publishers from Germany and other EU countries attending has not been reduced."
"Does the Council consider that the Common Position and the sanctions are beneficial, or merely detrimental to both Cuban and European culture?"
"Did the Council not feel that its authority was being undermined, in view of the fact that the European businessmen and authors invited to the Book Fair ignored the Council's line and will take part?"
"A number of them have said that the policy of cultural sanctions imposed on Cuba by the EU is 'absurd, unjust and contrary to our interests'."
". – As both the Council and the Commission have repeatedly made clear in the European Parliament, the decision of 5 June 2003 was part of a package of measures taken following the violation by the Cuban authorities last year of international human rights standards."
"This took the form of the summary trial and lengthy prison sentences imposed on a large number of dissidents for exercising their right to freedom of speech and participation in public affairs, as well as the summary trial and the rapid execution of three hijackers of a ferry boat, in breach of international minimum standards for the implementation of the death penalty."
"The four measures announced on 5 June 2003 were symbolic and political in nature and therefore their implementation concerns only the governments of the European Union Member States and their officials."
"It does not affect the private sector or individual citizens, who are free to attend the Cuban Book Fair and indeed any other cultural event organised by the government of Cuba if they so wish."
"Regarding the private opinions mentioned in the question, the Council has no comment to make on what those attending the fair may have had to say."
"They have the right to express their views, even if their views are wrong."
"Once again the EU calls on the Cuban authorities to release all political prisoners without delay and to resume the de facto moratorium on the death penalty."
"The Council reaffirms the continuing validity of the common position as the basis of the European Union's constructive engagement with Cuba, to be pursued through political dialogue so that tangible results can be achieved, particularly in the political, economic and civil rights areas."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council and dear friend, I am not in the mood for arguing about a choice of words."
"A few months ago there were certain actions by the Cuban authorities which the European Union reacted to with measures which you thought were appropriate and which I thought were disproportionate, unfair and absurd – particularly those adopted in the field of cultural cooperation."
"I do not know what you want to call these measures."
"You say they are not sanctions."
"I would like to find another word. I do not know if they are restrictions, reprisals, pressure, coercion, cultural blockade – as the Cubans themselves say."
"I would like you to tell us what word we should use so that we can really receive an answer to what we are asking."
"Apart from that question, I would reiterate the question which I have put: do you believe that the measures adopted in the field of cultural cooperation help or harm Cubans and Europeans?"
"And, secondly, does the President-in-Office of the Council believe that the conduct of our civil society, participating en masse in activities which have been, if not boycotted, at least hindered by the European Union, is a way for civil society to raise doubts about the Union’s policy with regard to Cuba?"
". – The words I used were very specific."
"As I mentioned, the measures were symbolic and political in their nature and therefore the implementation concerns only governments and EU Member States."
"They do not have a direct implication so far as individual citizens are concerned."
"I also make the point that the measures which were announced on 5 June were taken only after the most careful deliberations."
"It was the Council's considered view at that time that the application of the measures represented a balance between maintaining the willingness to engage in political dialogue to allow for tangible results, and the necessity to make it clear that grave human rights violations such as those that have occurred in Cuba in the last 12 months were not acceptable."
"I am sure that Mr Martínez would accept that is the position."
"Finally on a general issue regarding the EU and Cuba: the measures adopted by the Council were very carefully calibrated."
"Some people might say that they are very mild, but the are proportionate in response to specific circumstances."
"The European Union values this relationship with Cuba and hopes that those relations can be improved."
"It is mutually beneficial to aim for an improvement in that regard."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I will naturally not be supporting the executions carried out by the Cuban Government."
"But I must point out that there are many executions in the United States and also many selective assassinations in Israel."
"They are happening on a daily basis."
"I would like to ask in this regard whether the Council is going to adopt any measure with regard to the agreements with these two countries I have mentioned."
". – The supplementary question goes rather beyond the question from Mr Martínez Martínez."
"If Mr Ortuondo Larrea wants to table a question on a specific issue he may have in mind, I will answer it."
"I have something I would like to say to the Council."
"I have just returned from Cuba, where I was able to observe the situation on the ground with an open mind, and a visit to the island might not be a bad idea for some in view of the way in which violations of human rights are discussed in this House."
"As a result of our policy towards that country, we are overlooking a real treasure."
"Whatever might be said about Cuba, the country has a great deal to offer; we can learn a lot from it, certainly in the field of actions for the benefit of specific target groups in selected neighbourhoods."
"Moreover, it is regrettable that Europe's attitude means that many European NGOs are now having a very difficult time over there."
"They would like Europe to restore and improve relations with Cuba and look at that country from a different perspective without being influenced by third parties."
"There are many rumours about Cuba and, compared to other countries, we look at that country with different eyes."
"Without going into specifics, I could list other countries where the death penalty is still in place."
"In short, there are lots of exciting things happening in Cuba, and it would be useful to visit that country and take a dispassionate look at it."
". – I am sure that everything the Member has said is quite correct."
"I am sure Cuba is an intriguing and interesting country."
"The diplomatic measures announced on 5 June were intended to send a signal to the Cuban authorities that the new and grave violations of human rights simply were not acceptable."
"The measures were not designed to isolate Cuba in any way."
"On the contrary, in reconfirming the validity of the common position on Cuba on 21 July 2003, the Council stressed that political dialogue should be continued with a view to producing tangible results, particularly in the political, economic and rights spheres."
"The Council remains very much open to political dialogue."
"With regard to the point made about the impact, the Cuban Government is aware that the Council acknowledges its significant achievements in the field of social rights such as health and education."
"However, it remains our earnest hope that the Cuban authorities will come to realise the necessity to make similar advances in the field of fundamental civil, political and human rights."
"The same level of achievement in those areas as in the areas mentioned by the honourable Member would be very welcome."
"Documents that have been obtained by a civil liberties organisation, EPIC, under the US Freedom of Information Act, reveal that the US-based Northwest Airlines – providing connections between main US and European cities – disclosed millions of passenger records to NASA as part of a massive datamining experiment."
"The data were disclosed in violation of Northwest's privacy policy, and the collection and use by NASA may also have violated the US federal Privacy Act."
"Under European Union law, the routine disclosure of personal information for purposes unrelated to the original collection is prohibited."
"Is the Council aware of this violation of EU and US laws?"
"Does the Council know if these data concern EU citizens, and if they involve PNR data?"
"When will the Council raise this issue with the competent US authorities?"
"Does the Council not consider that the current US policy on privacy (transfers of personal data to NASA, creation of CAPPS II, unilateral initiatives on passengers' data infringing EU laws) cannot allow the US to be defined as 'adequate' in terms of the EU directives, as also stated by the French CNIL and other national privacy authorities, as well as privacy advocates?"
". – The Council does not have any specific information regarding the issues raised in Question H-0075/04 regarding the transfer of passenger data to NASA by Northwest Airlines, and is thus not really in a position to answer fully the questions raised by the honourable Member."
"The Council understands that the honourable Member has also referred his question directly to the Commission, which is the competent body in relation to most of the issues."
"However, I would say that detailed enquiries of this kind come within the competences of the data protection authorities in the various Member States."
"The competences of the data protection authorities in this case would be those linked to the specific flights concerned."
"For instance, for data collected concerning a flight between Boston and London Gatwick, the United Kingdom authority would be the competent authority, whilst for data collected on a flight between Boston and Amsterdam, the Dutch authorities would be responsible."
"As I said at the outset, I have not enough material to give a more comprehensive answer to the Member."
"I am sure the Member will understand that, within the range of material I have, this is as comprehensive as I can be."
"Of course, I understand that the Council has not had the opportunity to obtain information. I must, however, also point out to the Council that there was plenty of time to obtain it."
"We are, in fact, talking about disclosure procedures, that is to say about access to documents and about procedures that make these documents public."
"We have provided you with all the details of the documents in question, and it seems to me very strange that there was no time to read them."
"It is, for example, very clear from these documents that, as we know, Northwest has a cooperation agreement with KLM and that there is therefore a huge overlap between airline reservation databases, including those relating to air traffic internal to the European Union."
"You said that the issue is the Commission’s responsibility."
"This is not the truth, because the international agreements are commissioned by the Council; it is the Council that gave the European Commission the mandate to determine adequacy finding of privacy protection in the United States."
"Political responsibility therefore falls to the Council."
"Is the Council therefore considering including this point in the current negotiations or is it of a different opinion?"
". – I would draw the Member's attention to the fact that it is not an issue of time, it is more an issue of competence."
"The competent authorities in this particular case, as I said in my main response, are the privacy authorities in the individual Member States."
"The competence lies at national authority level, not at this level."
"Mr President, I am utterly amazed at the President-in-Office's answer."
"At the moment, the Council is discussing a European agreement with the United States, whereby the Article 31 Committee, which is competent in this area, has given, or as good as given, the green light on behalf of the Council, to the conclusion of an agreement with the United States."
"The annex to this agreement also refers to CAPS II (Computer Assisted Passenger Pre-screening System II)."
"It is therefore highly unlikely that the Council is unaware of what is going on, and Mr Cappato's question is in my view very plain: he has asked whether this is not a case of illegality and of violation of our regulations."
"The Council cannot say that this is a matter for the data protection authorities alone, which have themselves indicated that this is illegal."
"Action is indeed needed."
"The Council is right to say that this should be done at national level, but it too has a task to perform here."
"The Council has, to some extent, passed this task on to the European Commission, being apparently unfamiliar with the facts involved, and – what is worse – has not informed the national parliaments."
"I therefore ask the Council to ensure that this is still done."
". – The supplementary question touches on the issue of the transfer of name records."
"The general question of the transfer to the US authorities of name records for transatlantic flights is of great concern to the Council."
"We are not questioning either the concerns of the Members or particularly the concerns that Mr Cappato outlined in his original point."
"This matter is the subject of ongoing discussions and negotiations with the United States."
"Following the unilateral introduction last year of a US requirement on European airlines to provide passenger name records on flights into the US, the European Union has been working to establish a legally secured framework for passenger name record transfers to US customs and to border protection bureaux."
"Every effort is being made in the current negotiations to enhance the legally binding nature of the undertaking so as to protect the privacy of European passenger data, which is the point made in the supplementary question."
"However, this is not simply an EU-US issue, as it is fully expected that passenger name record transfers will also be required by a number of other countries in the near future in order to enhance passenger security in general."
"The European Union is therefore pursing a global approach with regard to the transfer of such data for border and aviation security purposes."
"This is largely an initiative to create a multilateral framework for passenger name record data transfers under the auspices of the International Civil Aviation Organisation."
"It is proposed that any arrangement agreed with the US will be of an interim nature and will in due course be confirmed by international agreements."
"As regards the proposed EU-US international agreement on the transfer of name records, I would specifically mention that, as honourable Members will be aware, negotiations are still ongoing between the Commission – and it is the Commission that is handling those negotiations – and the US authorities."
"Once negotiations have been concluded this agreement will be submitted and it will be considered by this Parliament."
"I agree with Mrs Boogerd-Quaak and Mr Cappato."
"The Council is wrong in trying to say this is the Commission's responsibility."
"It was quite clear yesterday in relation to another issue, Guantanamo, when Commissioner Patten said 'We cannot do anything without the Council'."
"Mr Cappato asks, 'When will the Council raise this issue with the competent US authorities?'"
"The Council is trying to wriggle out of its duty here."
"It is not just an issue for the Commission, it is an issue for the Council."
"Surely it can be raised at the forthcoming EU-US summit and also during the ongoing negotiations in relation to this issue."
"It is completely unacceptable that European citizens and their rights to privacy are not being protected."
"That is a responsibility for the Council."
"The Council should at least answer that part of the question."
". – The Council has answered that part of the question."
"I would draw Ms McKenna's attention specifically to the points I made with regard to the competence of national authorities – in the case of the United Kingdom and in the case of the Dutch authorities – in the area of data protection."
"The Member is also wrong when she chooses to ignore the reality that the Commission is conducting negotiations with the US authorities."
"It is misrepresenting the role of the Council to suggest that it is a Council function."
"It is not, as the Member well knows."
"How does the Council propose to follow up Parliament's resolution adopted in December with regard to China and the maintenance of the EU arms embargo?"
"How can the Council reassure Parliament that, despite the decision taken in Rome afterwards by the Council to put the issue on the agenda of the General Affairs and External Relations Council (GEARC) for 're-examination', the embargo will not be lifted in silence in one of the forthcoming GEARC meetings?"
". – I should like to thank the Member for putting that question."
"The Council has duly taken note of the European Parliament's resolution on the arms embargo on China."
"We will consider it, together with other elements in the ongoing examination of this topic."
"On 26 January the General Affairs and External Relations Council, in line with the invitation from the European Council of 12 December 2003, invited Coreper and the Political Security Committee to look into this matter."
"The Council would like to stress once more that it has not set any specific date for decisions regarding the arms embargo on China."
"There seems to be some idea that a date has been set."
"There has not."
"The current rules for transparency will apply to the decision."
"I thought the Council was going to say again that this is not its responsibility."
"I still totally disagree with the Council's position on the last question."
"In relation to China I would hope that the Council would take a position which reflects the position of Parliament: the only democratically-elected institution within the European Union."
"Clearly there is a major problem with the lifting of the arms embargo on China, particularly in the light of what has happened in recent years."
"I would hope that the Council will take this issue very seriously and not give in to pressure, despite the fact that there may be some countries in the European Union that would wish to do so."
"I hope that the Council will not give in to this."
"The arms embargo should remain in place until we can see a justification for lifting it."
"I do not think there will be a justification, because arms embargoes are a good idea on all countries internationally."
". – I am aware of Ms McKenna's views on arms embargoes, which are not a million miles away from my own."
"The Council has taken account of the European Parliament's resolution and will continue to do so."
"What action is the Council taking to step up measures against forced prostitution, child prostitution and trafficking in human beings at the present Schengen border with the accession countries, and also at the eastern borders of the new Member States?"
". – This is a very serious matter."
"With regard to trafficking in human beings, the Council would like to refer to its reply to Oral Question H-0575/03."
"As already pointed out in that reply, the comprehensive issue of trafficking in human beings needs to be addressed both at national and international level and needs to be dealt with within a broader context, which involves criminal law, asylum, immigration policies and preventative measures."
"A general agreement has been reached in the Council on a proposal for a Council directive on the residence permits issued to third-country nationals who have been victims of trafficking and who cooperate with the competent authorities."
"The purpose of the proposal is to offer victims who are willing to cooperate in proceedings against traffickers the possibility to remain in Member States for the duration of those proceedings and to obtain other benefits to assist them in escaping from the influence of the traffickers and returning to a normal life."
"Such other benefits may include, for example, access to employment, vocational training and education and other special programmes."
"This instrument, when adopted, will have an important role in the fight against traffickers."
"Formal adoption will be possible when Parliament has delivered its opinion."
"In addition to the framework decision on combating trafficking in human beings, which was adopted on 19 July 2002, the Council adopted a framework decision on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography on 22 December 2003."
"As far as border controls are concerned, the Council recalls that in 2002 two plans were submitted which contained a series of measures designed to achieve a higher level of security at the external borders and to combat trafficking in human beings."
"The first is a comprehensive plan to combat illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings, which was approved by the Council in February 2002."
"The second was the plan for the management of external borders of the Member States of the European Union, which was approved by the Council on 13 June 2002."
"Both plans contain short- and long-term measures aimed at creating integrated border management."
"Since 2002, various pilot projects and joint operations have been launched at the external borders."
"A network of Member State liaison officers has been created; a common risk analysis model and a common core curriculum for border guard training has been established."
"They are very welcome measures."
"Various ad hoc centres were set up or are in the process of being established by Member States, each of which focuses on a specific type of border, for example an air-border centre, a land-border centre, or a sea-border centre."
"Furthermore, a centre for ad hoc border guard training and a risk analysis centre are also being set up."
"– Mr President, obliged though I am for that exhaustive answer, my question had to do with the EU’s present borders with the candidate countries, with their future eastern borders with the states of the CIS, and more specifically with the programmes that are meant to keep in check the prostitution that is prevalent there."
"What is currently going on in the area where the Czech Republic borders on Bavaria is this: most of the victims and many of the culprits are from further to the east, that is, from Russia and Romania, states that are not yet due to join us."
"The scene of the crime is generally in the Czech Republic, which is an accession country, and the customers, those who spend the money, are, lamentably enough, mainly from the present EU – from Germany, in fact, so this is a cross-border problem."
"What I am specifically interested in is what is being done in the border regions to sort out the great deal of prostitution that is going on there."
". – I understand the Member's concerns."
"This is a particularly pernicious and dreadful trade."
"Someone said earlier that it is the 21st century equivalent of slavery."
"It is something that belongs to the dark ages and I believe that every civilised human being would rightly criticise what is happening."
"I mentioned a number of events and the response I gave was comprehensive."
"Other joint operations are planned and will be carried out in the near future at land, sea and air borders in Member States and the accession countries – which is the concern raised by the speaker."
"Furthermore, the Council is awarding special attention to the setting-up of a European agency for the management of cooperation at external borders, which will integrate ad hoc centres into an institutional framework within the Community."
"That would be very much in line with the Member's thinking."
"On 27 November 2003, for example, the Justice and Home Affairs Council adopted a conclusion on the main elements of this agency."
"It was agreed that this agency would, inter alia, coordinate the operational cooperation between Member States in the management of their external borders, assist Member States in the training of border guards, carry out the type of risk analysis that I have already mentioned, and assist Member States in circumstances requiring increased technical cooperation at borders."
"I hope that this answers the Member's question."
"One of the extraordinary things about this particular pernicious trade is that its perpetrators have been extremely astute in the manner in which they have managed to smuggle their victims."
"The framework decision on combating the exploitation of children and child pornography relates to this whole area."
"It was adopted on 22 December 2003 and requires each Member State to take the necessary measures to ensure that all conduct relating to child pornography and child exploitation at an international scale is fully punishable."
"As I said, this is a pernicious trade carried out by ruthless people."
"It is the 21st century equivalent of slavery."
"However, any fair, objective analysis would suggest that the Union is addressing the issue on a significant number of fronts."
"Notwithstanding Mr Posselt's angle on this question, and the Council's response – neither of which I disagree with – would the President-in-Office agree that, sadly, forced prostitution, child prostitution and trafficking in human beings are all also consequences of and an inevitable feature of poverty-ridden states which lack better economic opportunities."
"Whether we like it or not, it is true."
"The parallel that the Minister makes as a 21st century equivalent of slavery may be true on one hand, but there is also another angle on it."
"Does the Council consider that much greater investment in and economic support and assistance for these countries bordering the new external frontiers of the European Union – and in the Balkans – will be essential when we have enlarged the European Union?"
"President-in-Office, what action do you personally feel would be a good idea for either the Irish presidency or any future presidencies to take?"
". – When you address the issue of the specific measures that I have mentioned, you are addressing the symptom and not the cause."
"The cause, of course, is poverty, criminality and a breakdown in civil society."
"The cause is also the extraordinary transition that countries go through when one system that seemed secure has diminished and another is being put in place."
"You are right, Mr Evans: if you look at all the Union policies in the broad sense, that is exactly the approach that the Union is adopting."
"It is adopting a holistic approach."
"In the Balkans, which you mentioned, there is a very specific Union policy, which is well-informed and well-focused."
"It gives people, particularly Member States and their governments, the prospect of closer union with the European Union and indicates very clearly that we have certain standards that they have to set."
"So on the one hand we are encouraging them and on the other hand we are discouraging certain actions."
"We are taking a holistic approach."
"I agree with Mr Evans."
"– I should like to thank Mr Roche of the Irish Presidency for his frankness in saying that this is our era’s equivalent of slavery."
"It is, in fact, in the rich world of Western Europe that despicable men exploit women and children."
"This is not something that is purely related to poverty."
"It is here in rich Western Europe within the EU that they are degraded."
"My question relates to the following."
"Is the Irish Presidency prepared to prioritise the fight against trafficking in human beings and the sexual exploitation of children and women so that this question of decency is elevated to its rightful position as the most important of all issues of civilisation relating to Europe’s respectability?"
"My second question is whether the Irish Presidency is prepared to strengthen European police cooperation and to engage Europol and Eurojust in this necessary fight for respectability in Europe and for human dignity."
". – I should like to thank Mr Sacrédeus for his comments."
"The points that he mentioned were touched on in my original response and fleshed out in the supplementaries."
"This is an issue that requires a very wide range of responses."
"I take issue with Mr Sacrédeus at only one stage: unfortunately, the women and the children who are the victims in this particular case are exploited from birth."
"They are exploited because of the conditions that exist in their states."
"They are also exploited by being exported like products to the rich West."
"It is something that all countries have to take responsibility for."
"I am proud of the work that the European Union is doing in this regard because it is a model for the rest of the world – I have no point of disagreement with Mr Sacrédeus on that."
"Since the beginning of this year an information sheet on 'entry into the territories under the control of the Palestinian Authority' has been distributed to visitors, voluntary workers and officials of the European Union and international organisations."
"The document states that entry into the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, referred to as Judea and Samaria (Areas A) is forbidden without prior written authorisation from the Israeli authorities."
"Entry into these territories without such authorisation may result in legal measures being taken against the persons concerned, including deportation and refusal of future re-entry into Israel."
"Does the Council not consider that this is a violation of the Oslo Agreements and, more generally, international law, as well as a deliberate disregard for the sovereignty of the Palestinian National Authority?"
"Given that the Palestinian National Authority does not control any borders, does the Council not consider that this constitutes an obstacle to the freedom of movement of those wishing to enter the Palestinian territories?"
"Has the Council made any representations to the Israeli authorities, requesting that they withdraw the document and the measures set out in it, or does it intend to take such action in the future?"
". – I should like to thank Mrs Morgantini."
"The Council is fully aware of the restrictions imposed by the Israeli authorities on entry to the occupied territories as described by Mrs Morgantini."
"In a recent joint report requested by the Council of the European Union, heads of mission in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Ramallah confirmed these restrictions, which have been progressively identified and which have a considerable impact on the freedom of movement of European Union citizens, representatives of churches, journalists, NGOs and even European Union officials and diplomatic staff."
"Their application on the ground often appears to be unclear and disproportionate."
"The European Union and its Member States closely coordinate their approaches to these issues."
"They raise the problems of access to the Palestinian territories in their regular dialogue with the Israeli government officials."
"Moreover, the European Union plays a leading role in the task force on project implementation established by the international community to deal with problems of access for development assistance workers."
"I see that the results that have come out of this survey also confirm what I claimed: among them, the fact that whenever foreign citizens travel to Israel to get to Palestine – because the Palestinians do not have any borders that they monitor – they are constantly subject to this procedure, and we ourselves have experienced obstacles to movement."
"There is another issue, over and above our freedom of movement, that I believe the Council must take into consideration, that is to say Palestinian sovereignty."
"In the current situation, not only can Palestinians no longer receive voluntary workers, officials or citizens but, in effect, they are also prisoners – partly due to what is currently happening with the Wall – within Palestine."
"Therefore, the Oslo agreement, which instead provides for autonomous Palestinian areas, is being rendered totally ineffective by Israel when the latter restricts the movement of foreign citizens too."
"I therefore believe that the Council should consider this aspect too and, above all, take specific action to stop Israel preventing freedom of movement, partly because, as things are, we can also respond in kind."
"If we have problems entering Israel, then perhaps Israeli citizens could also have problems entering Europe."
". – The point I made earlier is that the Council and the European Union continue to monitor the situation in the region."
"We have continuously highlighted our concerns and I am not at all convinced that some form of reciprocal action would actually be helpful."
"The Israeli authorities know that we consider the actions they are taking to be regrettable."
"The European Union and both the political and official contacts in the region have been very clear."
"I am not certain, however, that reciprocation would be either helpful or fruitful."
"The Member can be absolutely assured that the Irish presidency has devoted a great deal of time and attention to this issue."
"We do not wish to do anything that would further inflame the situation in an already difficult part of the world."
"As you know, Minister Cowen has visited the region. The authorities there are fully aware of our concerns and they are fully aware of the concerns of the European Union."
"– Mr President, I should like to pose a supplementary question to the minister."
"Do you consider that it might be difficult to maintain full freedom of movement bearing in mind the situation that prevails in the Middle East, Israel and Palestine and the terrorist attacks that Israel is subjected to?"
"Can you agree with the political assessment that it might be difficult for Israel to maintain freedom of movement bearing in mind the fact that the country also has a right to protect itself against terrorist attacks?"
". – I said in a previous reply that one must understand both sides in this difficult situation."
"I said that it would be foolhardy to suggest that circumstances do anything other than contribute to the situation."
"Mrs Morgantini's specific question referred to the impact."
"I said in a previous reply that what we all aspire to in the Middle East is a situation where the Palestinian and Israeli peoples can live side by side in peace and respect each other's cultural positions – a situation where young Palestinian men and women do not aspire to becoming suicide bombers and where young Israeli women and men do not have to consider going into the army or the dangers of being blown up on their streets."
"The Council is, of course, fully aware not only of the history that lies behind the Israeli State, but also of the horrors that lie behind the type of suicide bombing seen there."
"Nothing I have said should be taken – and I am sure this was not the Member's intention – as in any way detracting from the horrors of daily life in that region."
"I completely concur with what you have just said, President-in-Office."
"I would like to bring to your attention a delegation that has gone from this House to look at the construction known colloquially as 'the wall'."
"I did not go myself, but I have had very shocking reports of it from fellow Members of this House."
"I attended a meeting this afternoon with some Israeli citizens talking about their aspirations for peace."
"At that meeting a proposal was made that a delegation should go from this House, not to Israel again or the Palestinian territories, but to Dublin to ask the Irish presidency what can be done urgently in the way of conflict resolution."
"If such a delegation were to come from this House, would the presidency receive it affirmatively?"
". – As Ms Ahern knows, any delegation of which she is a member would be met with an open door."
"She is quite right that this is a very serious issue."
"To refer to the earlier supplementary question, we have, for example, consistently condemned suicide bombings, which are part of this spiral of violence."
"Suicide bombings play no legitimate part in any agenda."
"With regard to the wall, separation, barrier or fence – whatever euphemism one would wish to use – the Union has expressed its concern."
"It has particularly expressed its concern that the route envisaged for the wall has in a number of places departed significantly from the green line."
"I cannot use stronger words that those I used on a previous occasion: this is not the way to create peace."
"Separating people never works."
"At the end of the day we know that it is dialogue that works."
"When people get together and have a dialogue they can resolve their differences."
"On 1 May 2004, the number of official languages of the Union will pass from 11 to 20, and this will involve a modification of Council Regulation 1/1958."
"Gaeilge, while a Treaty language under Article 314, is not listed under secondary legislation as an official language."
"Can the Council confirm that the procedure for granting the status of official language to Gaeilge is for an application to this effect to be made by the Irish Government, and can the Council outline the procedure that would follow such an application?"
"Finally, will the Council state whether there are factors which would prevent such an application from being successful?"
". – Article 314 of the EC Treaty and Regulation No 1/58 determine respectively the authentic language versions of the Treaty and the official languages and working languages of the EU institutions."
"Regulation No 1/58 is based on Article 290 of the EC Treaty which states: 'The rules governing the languages of the institutions of the Community shall, without prejudice to the provisions contained in the rules of procedure of the Court of Justice, be determined by the Council, acting unanimously.'"
"Historically, these provisions, which came under primary law as regards Article 2 and 4 of the Treaty and under secondary law as regards Regulation No 1/58, have been adopted only on the occasion of accessions, by means of successive accession treaties."
"Thus, Article 61 of the Athens Accession Treaty provides for the translation into the new languages of the text of the original treaties and of the Treaties amending or supplementing them."
"These translations are annexed to the Act of Accession and are authentic under the same considerations as the original texts of the Treaties."
"In other words, after accession the Treaties will have to be interpreted on the basis of the text existing in twenty-one languages and not just in the four original languages."
"Regulation No 1/58, as most recently amended by the Treaty of Athens, brings to twenty the number of official languages and working languages of the EU institutions."
"On the accession of Ireland to the Community, the original Treaties were translated into Irish."
"The Irish language version is an authentic version of these Treaties."
"Although Irish has not been added to the list of official languages and working languages of the institutions, each successive treaty is published in Irish as well as in the eleven other working languages."
"The texts in Irish are equally authentic and have equal status with those in all the other languages."
"I might add in my capacity as a Member of the Irish Parliament, and more precisely in my capacity as an Irish citizen, that the honourable Member will be aware that a public debate is taking place in Ireland as to whether or not the Irish language should be recognised as an official working and official language of the European Union."
"The Irish government has established a working group that is analysing the options available for further strengthening and enhancing the status of the Irish language within the European Union."
"That working group is examining a range of issues with a view to identifying additional opportunities in this regard."
"I thank the Member for the question."
"Mr President, is it in order for me to put a supplementary question to the President-in-Office following the questions raised by Ms Ahern and Mrs Morgantini?"
"Mr Beazley, I have applied the Rules of the House that allow for two speakers, of different groups, in addition to the Member formulating the question."
"I have followed the Rules of Procedure."
"I know that."
"I am not aware that Ms Ahern or Mrs Morgantini are members of the PPE-DE Group."
"They belong to different groups."
"So I may not put a question to the President-in-Office?"
"I am sorry, Mr Beazley."
"You can be sure that I am following the Rules of Procedure."
"."
"I thank the President-in-Office for his answer."
"I would also like to ask a supplementary question."
"Would he agree that there are already an increasing number of Irish people who speak the language and that the number of people being educated through Gaeilge in Ireland has increased dramatically, particularly over the last 20 years?"
"Would he agree that the European Union, as well as the institutions within the European Union, should encourage and support this development and also that these further developments would strengthen the case for the Irish language to become a working language of the European Union and the institutions of the European Union?"
". – – thank you very much Brian."
"I agree wholeheartedly with the opening point."
"The extraordinary thing that has happened in the last 30 years has been the explosion of interest in a language that 30 years ago looked as if it was threatened."
"One of the arguments made 30 years ago was that minority languages would be crushed and in particular the Irish language would disappear in the European Union."
"That has not happened."
"Mr Crowley is absolutely correct when he says that one of the extraordinary features has been the explosion of interest in the education sector in the Irish language."
"The most rapidly growing part of education in Ireland is the Gaelscoileanna, the all-Irish schools at first and second level."
"He is correct in that."
"The Irish Government welcomes that."
"We always said that the European Union would not bring about the end of our language; our cultural identity is stronger now than it ever was."
"The language has been accorded a quite distinct status within the Union since Ireland joined in 1973."
"The Treaty status of the language was agreed in 1973 and that right was re-established in the Treaties of Amsterdam and Nice."
"It is also set out fully in the new Treaty; there is a little additional progress there."
"In practice, a number of positive steps have been taken by the Union in relation to the Irish language, for example, the Treaty of Amsterdam confirmed the right of citizens of the Union to correspond with any institutions in any of the Treaty languages, including Irish."
"If my memory serves me correctly, Article 42 in the new Treaty makes a specific cross-reference to that."
"I regard such steps as clearly beneficial moves towards the Irish language."
"They reflect the sort of constructive measures that can have a meaningful impact on the citizens' relationship with the Union and its institutions."
"In short, they are practical measures that make a difference."
"Irish is the only language other than those specified in Council Regulation No 1 of 1958 to which these rights apply."
"Additionally, Lingua, the Union's programme for the promotion of language teaching and learning recognises the Irish language for its purposes."
"As I pointed out in my answer, the government of Ireland has set up a working group to establish what further steps can be taken."
"It is not, as some people believe, simply a matter of knocking on the door, ."
"We are engaged in the matter;"
"I am aware of the debate; it is a debate in which I take an interest."
"Indeed, as someone who comes from the Gaeltacht part of Ireland, I – like Mr Crowley – take a passionate interest in it."
"President, as a former British European Commissioner once said: 'I hesitate to intervene'."
"I understand your ruling and respect that you are following the Rules of Procedure of this House."
"Formally, the Rules of Procedure permit elected Members present to put supplementary questions to the President-in-Office of the Council."
"May I put a question about the Cornish language to the President-in-Office of the Council?"
"Yes, Mr Beazley, but after Mr Paisley, who had requested the floor first."
"I should like to ask the President-in-Office a question in relation to this important issue that is before us today: would he look also at the Scotch-Irish language in Northern Ireland?"
"As with the Irish language, there has been a great interest in it and more people are speaking Scotch-Irish today than have spoken it for many years."
"However, in Northern Ireland there is a feeling that neither the United Kingdom Government nor the European Union are looking at it favourably, as compared with other languages."
"I would ask the President-in-Office to undertake to look into this matter of the Scotch-Irish language and see to it that the principle of equality be implemented with regard to this language, along with all the other languages of the European Union, so that they can all stand on a level playing field."
". – In answer, Dr Paisley, I am of course aware of the extraordinary and unique work that has been done on the Scotch-Irish language."
"I am aware of the board, and in fact I receive correspondence regularly from the board; it is a great joy to receive a Christmas card in the language from the board."
"The lesser-used languages – whether we are talking about the language of Ulster or, for example, the Cornish language – are a matter which has concerned the Union."
"However, support for the languages is not purely a matter for the Presidency-in-Office."
"In the case of the Irish language a specific and unique measure was made in 1973."
"Maybe it should have been made for the other lesser-used languages that have been mentioned here."
"To answer Dr Paisley directly, I am aware of the blossoming of interest in a language which had one stage virtually disappeared."
"I should like to put a question to the President-in-Office that has been already answered in part."
"I support the drift of the question from Mr Paisley that all minority languages should be given equality of esteem."
"The Breton language exists in Brittany."
"I had the honour of representing Cornwall and Plymouth in this House for ten years."
"Speaking as an Englishman, I find it sad that the Cornish language died out in the 18th century."
"It may not be within your, power, President-in-Office, to fully answer Mr Paisley's question, but I support what you said about the importance of the Irish language."
"Could you reconfirm that you would give equal weight to other minority languages – by which I mean cultures – throughout the whole of the European Union, including the ten new Member States?"
". – I would ask the honourable Member not to trespass on my concerns about minority languages."
"As it turns out the part of Ireland in which I was born is very close to Cornwall."
"In fact, in parts of Wexford, where I was born, there was a minority language that borrowed very heavily on the Cornish language."
"The Union should have a concern and a generous policy for the lesser-used languages, because they are part of the extraordinary cultural diversity of the European Union."
"I do not want to say that the Irish language is in a special category."
"For me, it is in a special category, but legally it has a status that is rather different to some of the other lesser-used languages."
"However, I take the point that you made."
"Do not trespass on my concerns, because I have a concern on this and on the issue of the Scotch-Ulster language and the extraordinary revival of this language."
"Perhaps I have said more than I should as President-in-Office."
"In light of the shocking recent admission by Abul Qadeer Khan, the recently-resigned chief scientific advisor to the President of Pakistan, that he organised a nuclear weapons procurement and sales network, secretly selling nuclear weapons components to Iran, Libya, and North Korea, will the Presidency take urgent steps to halt the export from European Union Member States of nuclear weapons-useable nuclear materials, including plutonium from sites such as Sellafield and highly enriched uranium, at least until the extent of the illicit procurement of nuclear explosive capability has been properly established?"
". – Mrs Ahern has raised a very serious question."
"The recent revelations about the secret network illicitly trading in highly sensitive nuclear equipment and technology organised by the former Pakistani chief scientist, Abul Qadeer Khan, are of very serious concern."
"During the recent European Union ministerial troika to Islamabad, these concerns were raised at the highest level with Pakistan and we were assured that new controls have been put in place in order to prevent proliferation."
"As far as the European Union is concerned, exports of sensitive equipment and technology are regulated by Council Regulation (EC) No 1334/2000."
"With regard to the export of weapons-usable materials – for example plutonium and highly enriched uranium – from the European Union, this can only be authorised in accordance with the above-mentioned regulation, as well as other relevant international rules and practices governing such exports."
"Furthermore, all nuclear material within the European Union – as long as it remains in the civilian nuclear fuel cycle – is safeguarded by the nuclear inspection services of the Commission and, where the material is to be transferred outside the European Union, by the International Atomic Energy Agency."
"In the case of export to third countries, the IAEA will also apply safeguards to the third country and will, inter alia, verify the declaration on quantity and composition made before the shipment of any material."
"In the specific case of Pakistan, the issue raised by the Member, there is an additional consideration."
"Unlike all European Union Member States, Pakistan is not a party to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and does not have a full-scope safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency."
"The principles and the objectives of nuclear non-proliferation and the disarmament agreed at the 1995 Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty Review Conference state that full-scope safeguards should be a necessary precondition for transfers of source and special fissionable material or specially designed material thereof."
"The nuclear suppliers group and the export control regime in which all EU Member States participate designates full-scope safeguards as a condition of supply for sensitive nuclear and related technology."
"It follows that no Member State should authorise the export of nuclear material in any form to Pakistan."
"The Council is committed to continuing to strengthen export control policies and practices in cooperation with our partners in various export control regimes and in other third countries."
"This is reflected in the EU strategy against proliferation of weapons of mass destruction adopted by the Heads of State and Government at the last European Council meeting in December in Brussels."
"I accept that the presidency views this as a serious problem."
"However, all of us, and the EU institutions in particular, need to recognise that the plutonium being sent across the seas to Japan from both Sellafield in the UK and La Hague in France is directly usable in nuclear explosive devices."
"If terrorists were to get hold of this material we would be facing devastation."
"We have already had the example of 11 September."
"This trade undermines all attempts to halt proliferation, and I would draw the presidency's attention to a statement made in Washington by President George W. Bush on February 11, when he said that reprocessing is unnecessary for civil nuclear energy programmes."
"The tenor of his remarks is to condemn reprocessing as a sinister activity."
"We need to get a grip on proliferation, and in this context the trade in nuclear technology undertaken by the EU is similar to the trade in heroin in that it is equally lethal."
"I urge the presidency to take the lead in strengthening the European Union's non-proliferation credentials by pressing the UK and France to stop this commerce in plutonium, which was not named after Pluto the God of the Underworld for nothing."
". – I know full well the passionate concern of the Member on this particular issue."
"She is quite right when she says it was not named by accident: perhaps it was a happy accident that it was named after the God of the Underworld."
"The issue raised in the first part of the question is absolutely terrifying."
"Since that report became available, there have been further reports of people travelling with caesium in the boot of the car."
"These reports, and their implications, are terrifying."
"They are, if anything, more horrific than heroin."
"The Community is engaged in the issue; we have made the concerns of the Community known to the Pakistani authorities."
"I take the point Ms Ahern made in her supplementary about matters nearer to home, but it is not up to me to provide a definitive solution."
"The general point about non-proliferation is that the strengthening of the Non-proliferation Treaty is obviously the way to go and that is the way that civilised countries will go."
"Since September 11 we have a different view on security, and we should all be very conscious of the implications in this particular area."
"As the time allotted to questions to the Council has elapsed, Questions Nos 9 to 26 will be replied to in writing (1)."
"That concludes Question Time to the Council."
"(2)"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"- Recommendation for second reading (A5-0064/2004) by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on a common position of the Council adopted with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council regulation concerning protection against subsidisation and unfair pricing practices causing injury to Community air carriers in the supply of air services from countries not members of the European Community (rapporteur: Nicholas Clegg)"
"- Report (A5-0061/2004) by Jan Dhaene, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing common rules in the field of civil aviation security"
"and"
"- Recommendation for second reading (A5-0088/2004) by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the common position of the Council with a view to adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on insurance requirements for air carriers and aircraft operators (rapporteur: James Nicholson)."
". Mr President, let me melodramatically apologise in advance."
"For some reason a nasty virus has descended upon me in the last three quarters of an hour so if I do not make a great deal of sense and if I leave early I hope the reasons are at least forgivable."
"I would like to summarise where I see this legislation has improved or changed for the better during our deliberations."
"In a sense the proposal from the Commission had quite a faltering and uncertain start."
"I was struck as rapporteur by how weak the apparent support from a number of European airlines was for this measure."
"They expressed a fear, which I certainly shared at the beginning of the discussions, that the instrument being proposed and discussed here could, if mishandled, be a pretext for protectionist behaviour rather than, as is intended, a targeted instrument to deter unfair pricing and excessive use of subsidies elsewhere."
"The original draft was a little too open-ended."
"It rather bluntly stated that the European Union would have the power to extend for the first time anti-dumping disciplines from the trade in goods to the trade in services, without a great deal of detail about how that would take place."
"Our efforts in Parliament during the first reading in particular have been to fill in some of the gaps, to make it a more usable and credible instrument, rather than a sort of blunderbuss threat which might arguably have been too crude to use at all."
"To that end we are all pleased that the Council has adopted some of the amendments we tabled at first reading, notably, and probably most importantly, those specifying in the legislation itself that the Commission must develop a detailed methodology by which dumped, unfair prices are calculated so that there is a coherent and credible methodology to distinguish dumped prices from normal pricing."
"I am very pleased the Council has adopted that."
"I am very grateful to the Commissioner and the Commission for accepting those amendments too."
"As rapporteur, I would have liked both the Council and the Commission to move a little further towards our position as adopted at first reading."
"I remain a little concerned that there is no caveat in the legislation to the effect that this instrument should only be used if significant material injury is inflicted upon European Union aircraft carriers."
"There is a theoretical, potential danger that this instrument will be used to pursue frivolous or insignificant cases."
"This instrument needs to be used sparingly and I would have preferred to have seen greater adoption of our wording, which targeted it at the really important cases."
"Having said that, I accepted the wisdom of my wiser colleagues in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, to which I am only a very occasional visitor, who told me in the debate ahead of the second reading that this was a good package to settle with. I happily did so, except on one issue, in a sense on behalf of the Commission, which had understandably expressed concern about the provisions of recital 5, and which suggested that this regulation would be subservient to existing bilateral agreements."
"I am extremely grateful to the Irish presidency for persuading its colleagues in the Council, according to all the accounts I have received, that the offending wording should be deleted so that a rigid hierarchy between bilateral instruments and EU instruments would not be established to the detriment of the latter."
"Let me take the remaining seconds to thank the Commission services, which have been enormously helpful in providing a lot of technical detail to a complete ignoramus like me."
"I should like to thank the Commissioner for proposing this in the first place and accepting the final settlement, the Council and, most importantly, my colleagues in the Committee on Transport."
"I am, as I said before, an interloper from the trade community and it was certainly an interesting and useful exercise for me to see how trade policy and transport policy have in this case come together in an extremely satisfactory manner."
"Given the bug you have picked up, Mr Clegg, I am sure that no one would be offended if you wished to go home to have an early night and a hot drink."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the broad consensus about my report and that of my fellow Members Mr Clegg and Mr Nicholson, I can be brief, and shall be using no more speaking time than is necessary."
"According to the Commission, the safety measures in very small airports had to be adapted because they were difficult to put into practice."
"It was necessary to alleviate the distress that was caused by the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002 of 16 December 2002 establishing common rules in the field of civil aviation security."
"Safety in aviation has always been important to the public and therefore also to this Parliament, even more so after 11 September 2001."
"That is why the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism carefully studied the topic in 2002 and insisted on 100% control, appropriate technical standards and attention to the question of who should pay for everything."
"On 16 December 2002, a Regulation was approved, and entered into effect a month or so later."
"I was still new to this House at that time and was not really in a position to follow those discussions."
"The Regulation in question had been prepared by the Commission in a short space of time, in order to respond to the increased sense of lack of safety in civil aviation."
"Parliament was very keen to approve the Regulation at the earliest opportunity."
"From the first experiences with applying it, it transpired that there was room for improvement in some areas and that some terms needed clarifying."
"That is how this amending proposal, which is mainly technical, came about."
"It appeared inefficient and expensive to apply the same safety regulations to airports for small aircraft only and for adjacent zones for light aircraft in larger airports."
"Even so, safety must be guaranteed in those places too."
"That is why safety measures established nationally will now apply each time when the Regulation provides for measures that are, objectively speaking, impractical or disproportionate."
"Accordingly, for general aviation involving small aircraft, delineated areas have been introduced which are separate from the rest of the airport."
"In addition, a criterion for the eligibility of being a small airport has been clarified."
"The word 'control' has also been clarified, and a number of inconsistencies have been removed."
"I take the view that it is important for the Regulation to be made clearer and for the mistakes in the legislative text to be corrected, but, above all, to ensure that the regulations are practical and applicable."
"We once again have an excellent working relationship with the Commission, but if at first reading, the Council adopts a position as a result of which the Regulation is altered dramatically, we should probably review our position."
"I suggest at this stage to approve the proposal amending the Regulation, and would thank the services for the support that I have had during the compiling of my report."
". Mr President, this report evolved from the need to look at insurance cover for aircraft carriers after the atrocities that took place in New York on 11 September."
"It seems a long time ago, but it still remains in our memories."
"We had to try to achieve a level playing field between European airlines and the airlines of the United States, which then received even greater support than our airlines."
"We also have to keep the necessary balance between the rights of travellers, their security and, above all, the safety of air travel against these new terrorist challenges that threaten everyone in Europe, and indeed in the greater world."
"We have come a long way towards achieving this."
"After the first reading, the Council accepted 16 of the committee's 26 amendments, which included the provision that the depositing of proof of insurance in one Member State should suffice for all Member States."
"It also accepted the definition of a passenger."
"State aircraft have been exempted."
"The application of global amounts in accordance with commercial practice has also been accepted as have, in a range of other areas, the inclusion of local flights, measures to be taken when aircraft land without adequate insurance cover, and withdrawal of operating licence if the insurance cover is not sufficient."
"But there still remain areas of difference between us."
"The Council did not share our view on how to regulate for overfliers."
"Nor did it agree with Parliament's view on the need for a harmonised inspection regime."
"Members will recall my concern on how our proposals would affect the small aircraft operators and how we could resolve that, as also those involved in leisure flying, be it in gliders, hang-gliders or microlights."
"I believe it would be totally wrong to penalise any of these areas."
"That is why I held out for a fair deal for them."
"For all our aircraft in the middle to large categories we are now in basic agreement."
"To safeguard the leisure flyer, in respect of gliders and microlights, I have asked my Group to put forward an amendment."
"I have agreed with the Council and the Commission – and I hope other colleagues will be able to agree with this as well – on what I believe is the best consensus available."
"There are those who have said to me that this still does not go far enough, but I think we have the best consensus available to us at this moment in time."
"It allows those involved in flying for pleasure to be exempt from insurance cover for war and terrorism."
"Microlights have small engines, air stall speeds as low as 35 knots and limited weight."
"I believe the amendment covers an adequate compromise."
"If the Council and Commission agree, I will withdraw my amendment and there will be no need for a third reading of this particular report."
"We can then go forward into the future."
"I would add one word of caution."
"This is an area of legislation that can change rapidly."
"We should return to and revise this directive within three to four years, in the light of whatever changes may take place."
"We must see and analyse the effects of this directive."
"The truth is that the major players in the aircraft industry have been totally unconcerned, it has not affected them."
"But it is the small, the vulnerable and the hobby flyer who could suffer most."
"I would like to thank the Commission and the Council for their extremely positive cooperation."
"I would like to thank the Irish presidency because it was, as stated in Mr Clegg's report, positive in ensuring we came to a final conclusion. Without that we would not have had this result, which I trust will bring forward a directive that will work."
"I thank my shadow rapporteurs for their cooperation, which has enabled us to get to this stage, and also my committee colleagues for their cooperation."
"For me this has been something of an exercise in bringing a directive to Parliament that, by the time I go for re-election will, I hope, be effective legislation."
"That is something that will live with me for a long time."
"I look forward to the future."
"This is now a very good report."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament has decided that we should deal jointly with three issues relating to the air sector, but which are of a different nature."
"I am therefore going to talk about them consecutively and separately and I am going to follow the order used by the honourable Members in their speeches."
"I will begin with unfair pricing practices in the supply of air services from countries not members of the European Community and I would like to thank Mr Clegg for remaining in the Chamber for a while despite his condition."
"I would like firstly to say that I am delighted that we have reached the second reading under the best possible circumstances in relation to such an important proposal, which must protect the position of our air sector, although it is absolutely correct to say that under no circumstances must it be used to restrict competition or the entry of third countries into our sector, but rather quite the opposite."
"What it must do is prevent our companies from having to face a situation of disadvantage when compared to third countries."
"We can expect this text to enter into force soon thanks to the wonderful spirit of cooperation between the institutions and in this regard I would like once again to thank Parliament and in particular Mr Clegg with whom we have worked in close cooperation."
"The text provides the Union with new competences in order to defend itself in the event of certain anti-competitive practices on the part of third countries."
"This House has repeatedly expressed its concern about the harm which could be done to the competitive operation of the air market by certain subsidies granted by third countries."
"Mr Schmitt, draughtsman for the report on the negotiation of bilateral agreements on the part of the United States, has insisted on this very point and I hope that the approval of this regulation on this type of unfair practice at second reading will respond to his expectations and therefore assist development in the field of agreements with third countries."
"In its first reading, the European Parliament contributed to clarifying and increasing the efficiency of the mechanisms laid down in the draft regulation, particularly by means of setting of time limits."
"The only amendment proposed at second reading will make the text completely consistent, laying down the sequential organisation between the activation of the mechanisms established in the bilateral instrument of the State and that of the Community instrument."
"In this regard, the Commission entirely agrees with the objectives of this amendment."
"Once adopted – very soon I hope – this regulation will be an essential instrument so that the Union can prevent and correct any practice which may be adopted by third-country airlines which contravenes unfair competition standards."
"I would insist that this represents an important supplementary stage to which we can add the other progress made over the last year in the consolidation of our air transport policy with the aim of fully controlling the vitally important international dimension of the air sector and defend the already very prominent role our industry plays."
"With regard to the second report, I would like to highlight the work of the rapporteur, Mr Dhaene, and say that in the case of civil aviation security, in view of the numerous proposals presented, the introduction of certain modifications of Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002 on civil aviation security, is not very significant."
"In truth, the intention is to rectify certain deficiencies in the framework regulation which the Member States indicated in 2003 on trying to apply the European Union rules in the field of aviation security to smaller airports, in which, due to their size and activities, there were aspects which did not make much sense."
"The proposal does not relate to any point of principle and I am happy to say that both the Council and the European Parliament have expressed their will to adopt it quickly at first reading."
"In this regard, the Commission is prepared to maintain a dialogue on possible changes to the content of this important regulation during the next legislature, if we consider that there are still issues to be dealt with."
"With regard to the third report by Mr Nicholson, whom I wish every success in the coming elections, on insurance requirements for air operators and air carriers, I must say that I am delighted with the long journey taken by the proposed regulation."
"It is an extremely important regulation as we saw after 11 September, when our air companies were stretched to their limits and had to respond with the support of the public sector."
"The decision-making process has led to strong support from all the institutions in order to reach a compromise."
"I would like to express my satisfaction at the constructive role played by this Parliament and I would stress once again the importance of this institution’s role and actions in achieving social support and the support of the sectors and people involved."
"I would like in particular to thank Mr Nicholson for the vital work he has done."
"It has been demonstrated that aviation insurance is necessary in order to guarantee that people and property are adequately insured against possible damage on the ground and in flight."
"We want to guarantee cover for damage of all types, including that caused by acts of war or terrorism."
"The Commission understands and supports the form and the content of the amendment presented by the European Parliament to the common position."
"In fact, to a large extent it reflects the Commission's initial proposal in relation to sporting and recreational flying which uses small aircraft, weighing less than half a tonne."
"At the same time, with regard to the damage caused by war and terrorism, it makes the insurance requirements for certain aircraft subject to the principle of subsidiarity."
"This guarantees, on the one hand, that governments, if they wish, can establish the insurance requirements for such risks and, on the other, that this type of aviation activity can be maintained without excessive costs, since the insurance requirements in the case of war and terrorism laid down in the regulation will not be applied to aircraft of less than 500 kg, which includes gliders and microlights."
"I would like to point out that Mr Nicholson is completely right to say that we are dealing with a legislative proposal which will very possibly have to be revised within three or four years because it will depend on the international progress made in this field – and we hope that it is as positive as possible – in relation to liability with regard to third parties and progress on the Rome Convention – which is currently dealing with the issue."
"When the time comes, that will oblige us to modify the proposal, which is something we are prepared to do."
"In any event, I hope that the general result will be acceptable to Parliament and the Council and that the codecision procedure on this issue can be completed at second reading during the current legislature."
"So I would like to end, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, by once again thanking the three rapporteurs for their wonderful work, which falls within the framework of our support for the European aviation sector and I hope that, with the agreement of the Council, it can be completed quickly."
"– Mr President, Madam Vice-President, speaking on behalf of my group, I wish to extend warm thanks to the three rapporteurs."
"It is rather sad that there is nobody here – no journalists, no members of the public – but that is how things are."
"The three rapporteurs have done an excellent job of dealing with substantial legislative initiatives, and we are pleased with the progress that has been made."
"I would like to thank Mr Clegg for having enabled us to come to an agreement with the Council on a joint regulation protecting our airlines against subsidisation and unfair pricing practices."
"Both of us – indeed, I believe, all of us – agree that this is not so much about the use of weaponry as about stocking up an ammunition box, one that we hope will enable us to prevent unfair subsidisation in America, among other places."
"We can in any case, if a stop is not put to it, threaten them with a whole ammunition depot full of sanctions against their airlines and to the benefit of our own."
"While we have no desire to restrict competition, we do want to have an ammunition box for the sake of fair competition at global level."
"Mr Dhaene has done well to improve the practical details of the Regulation establishing common rules in the field of civil aviation security."
"I think that Parliament and the Council will endorse the Commission’s approach, which involves adapting the highly stringent rules that we need, post-9/11, to smaller airports in a practicable and affordable way, so I am grateful to Mr Dhaene for his practical solution."
"Contrary to what might sometimes be believed, we are not just engaged in enacting meaningless laws."
"Mr Nicholson probably had the toughest brief, that of insurance requirements, which is the most expensive issue to deal with."
"On these, insurance premiums depend, and they can get very expensive."
"I think we have managed to reconcile both the passengers’ interest in having a proper and high level of insurance cover and the airlines’ interest in premiums that remain affordable."
"The amounts involved represent a fair compromise."
"It is, I think, a very fine thing that Mr Nicholson has managed to take the right approach to gliders, too."
"In conclusion, I would like to reiterate my thanks to Vice-President De Palacio."
"We are engaged – as we need to be – in adopting every kind of legislation relating to air transport by the end of this legislative period."
"One might say that a majority in this House, drawn from every political group, is united in favouring the adoption of these practical rules for really safe air transport, so, on behalf of my own group, let me thank the rapporteurs and the Vice-President."
"Mr President, the European aviation industry is in full swing and is experiencing exciting times."
"Since 11 September 2001, there has not been a dull moment."
"Before I comment on the content of the reports, I should like to tell the House how satisfied I am that we have received a European approval for the merger of Air France and KLM and that the competent American authority has also given its stamp of approval."
"This is important for the industry, particularly in terms of strengthening the European aviation industry, because there is more to come."
"Even more is yet to be done to ensure that the industry has a sound economic basis."
"With regard to the report by my colleague Mr Clegg, who has now left the House, I should like to stress the value of the amendment in the light of increasing competition."
"Many international competitors of European aviation companies operate unaffected by government measures, and this enables them to compete with European aviation companies in improper ways."
"It is good to stand up to this sort of practice."
"As far as the report by Mr Dhaene is concerned, I find it extremely agreeable if someone can indicate so specifically and realistically why he is not writing an own-initiative report at the moment."
"I think this bears witness to much class and I expect him to organise another bicycle trip; perhaps that is when the next round of discussions can be held."
"Finally, as for Mr Nicholson's report, I am pleased that we were able to work together so intensively at a very early stage, across the political divide, to achieve a realistic result which is also in keeping with the ICAC (International Civil Aviation Conference) agreements that refer to a system of international premiums."
"Within this framework for European aviation, distortion of competition is virtually ruled out."
"The special exemption to which attention was drawn this evening is, of course, extremely important for ultra-light aircraft, government aircraft and historic aeroplanes."
"I am delighted with the progress and I also think it is very positive that Mr Nicholson has made every effort, right until the end, to ensure that we have a sound product here before us."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will be tomorrow at noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0116/2004) by Bill Miller, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of Regions – Internal Market Strategy: Priorities 2003 – 2006."
". Mr President, I should like to thank all those who have been involved and helped me shape this report."
"The report is somewhat like the curate's egg – it is good in parts and not so good in parts; in fact, it is lousy in some parts."
"I hope that tomorrow we will be able to rectify the bad bits and remove them."
"First, I want to concentrate on one or two of the good bits."
"The report recognises that the Solvit project is up and running."
"It recognises that there is a need for a consistent and correct application of the CE mark."
"It supports the work of the Competitiveness Council. It recognises that the internal market is about creating more and better jobs; it is about creating wealth, not just for businesses; and it is about social cohesion."
"It also recognises the benchmarking of existing liberalised services, based on a broad set of criteria, some of which are social."
"There is also the consultation with our social partners."
"It also encourages Member States' parliaments to address the whole problem of gold plating. These are the good bits in this report."
"Unfortunately they are only the icing on the cake."
"Once we get into the cake we find the bad bits. That is where this report goes wrong."
"Reading the Commission's document, step-by-step, there is a clear agenda."
"The Commission argues that many of the Member State economies are in a downturn at the moment and that in order to give them a boost and to help those flagging economies we must look at more structural reform."
"What does it mean by structural reform?"
"You read on and it starts talking about liberalising more of our public services."
"It argues that because the electricity and gas sectors are smaller than the water sector and have been liberalised, we should liberalise the water sector."
"Taking that argument even further, in Europe our health and education sectors are bigger than the water sector is today."
"If you go down the road of liberalising our water sector then you go down the road of liberalising our health and education sectors."
"That is not what I am about."
"I have looked at this report. This is not what Europe is about."
"We have had liberalisation of certain industries in Europe."
"I only need to look at British Rail to see what a disaster that has been."
"Before we go down the road of further liberalisation of any services we have to take stock of what has happened so far."
"We have talked about the Lisbon agenda."
"That features strongly in the internal market report from the Commission."
"However, when we look at the Lisbon agenda, what comes up time and time again is the economic criteria."
"There is another side to the Lisbon agenda – a social side."
"That never gets mentioned these days."
"We always forget about workers' rights when we talk about the Lisbon agenda."
"Instead, it is market, market, market."
"It is high time that we moved away from that."
"I believe that the internal market is about workers; it is about workers' rights; it is about health and safety; it is about living conditions; it is about elderly people; it is about young people; it is about disabled people; it is about employment and unemployment; it is about the training of young, old and unemployed people."
"It is not only about profit for major companies."
"Tomorrow we will vote on one of the most important issues that faces European citizens: whether we give the green light to the Commission to go down the road of looking at the liberalisation of our water sector."
"I do not believe that water is an internal market issue."
"I do not think that it should be in this report, but it is."
"I hope that we will remove that tomorrow."
"Our citizens do not want a liberalised water sector."
"Europe has a soul."
"If we sell out our social agenda, which is part of the internal market agenda, part of the Lisbon agenda, then we are lost forever."
"We cannot let down our citizens."
"Tomorrow we must support all the amendments that reject further liberalisation."
". Mr President, I am sorry I was not here for the initial part of that very passionate diatribe against liberalisation."
"I am here wearing two hats."
"First of all I have had the pleasure to shadow Mr Miller on this report in my own committee, as well as producing the report from the Committee on Industry, during which time we have undertaken the job that we were asked to do, which was to comment on the Commission's strategy document."
"Mr Miller produced a very interesting report, with much of which I disagreed."
"I am pleased to say that the committee shared my view and therefore we have substantially improved it in committee."
"I very much hope and indeed encourage the House to approve our version of the report tomorrow because it addresses a number of the issues that the Commission asked us to address and it was not intended as the forerunner of the PSE Group's manifesto for the forthcoming elections."
"I want to pick up one or two points, but first I must respond briefly to what Mr Miller said."
"The internal market has been one of the biggest successes of the European Union."
"I had the privilege of speaking when Mr Bolkestein produced the ten-year report on the single market last year, and we have seen the figures on that which, I am pleased to say, were included in my report to this committee."
"They were challenged by some people who do not accept the fact that markets deliver jobs, deliver economic prosperity and therefore deliver the sort of social benefits that Mr Miller was advocating so eloquently earlier on."
"The core of European social policy is having a thriving and active economy."
"This is because we made the single market work, because we have stimulated competition and, yes, because we have liberated those privatised sleeping giants of state industries and subjected them to competition, which has expanded choice and reduced costs to consumers."
"Mr Miller and colleagues need only look at the report from the Commission, look at what has happened to energy costs and to telecommunications costs, to see what can be done."
"I do not want to get too hung up on water."
"I am interested to see that this is a tremendous preoccupation of colleagues on the other side of the House."
"It is referred to here but actually the Commission makes it absolutely clear that policy on ownership is not an issue."
"Yet there is no doubt at all that there is a lot of scope for improving the efficiency and delivery of water services."
"You only have to look at the immense discrepancy in the cost of water to communities across the European Union to see that something needs to be done about it."
"That is all we are asking for and that is what we, by way of my Amendment No 1, hope colleagues will support tomorrow."
"In my concluding remarks I would like to comment on one or two points."
"I would like to congratulate the Commission on producing for the first time a three-year perspective with a clear view forward and a series of important and coherent policies to make the single market work better."
"I would like to congratulate it on putting a higher priority on delivering what we have, on enforcing the measures in the single market, on improving mutual recognition, which I agree with the Commission is entirely at the foundation and the heart of the single market project."
"That is going to give us an important perspective."
"I hope, with colleagues in the next Parliament, we will be here to revisit it."
"In conclusion, this is an excellent report."
"I want to thank the Commissioner for taking on board so much of the previous internal market committee report, for which I had the privilege of being a rapporteur."
"I am pleased to say that colleagues in my committee have agreed with the amendments and we have adjusted the report to reflect a continuation of what I did before, not the retrogressive views of the rapporteur in this instance."
"Thank you for this report."
"We look forward to working with you to deliver the continued benefits for all citizens in the European Union."
". Mr President, this afternoon, Commissioner Bolkestein presented here in Strasbourg his latest book on Europe's borders."
"Unfortunately, I was unable to attend this presentation, Commissioner, but I should like to congratulate you on it all the same."
"This evening, I should like to consider the limits to the Commissioner's urge for liberalisation, which appear to be non-existent."
"First of all, I should like to extend warm thanks to Mr Miller for the good working relationship."
"It is not his fault that the vote in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has produced a somewhat distorted report."
"As I understand it, Mr Harbour is taking on the blame for this."
"As rapporteur for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I am naturally very disappointed that only three of my amendments have been adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"My group has re-submitted the other amendments and we hope that the Christian Democrats and Liberals will be supporting those tomorrow with their Socialist hats on."
"As far as the urge for liberalisation is concerned, I can put Mr Bolkestein's mind at rest."
"Unlike some of my colleagues here on the left, I am not by definition against liberalisation, but I am opposed to market fundamentalism and to pushing through liberalisation at all costs, if the conditions and public guarantees are not yet in place by a long way and liberalisation is loss-making on all fronts, except for the private monopolies and their adherents who can seize on their chances in this."
"It is high time that we in Europe put a brake on liberalisation of that kind and that a framework directive was put in place for services of general interest, thus providing a counterweight for the dominance of the competition rules."
"I can see the Commissioner hesitating in that respect, and he is palming us off with one excuse after the other."
"One final remark about the new directive on the internal market for services: that really seems to me to be a case of extreme madness, because it undermines everything that we have laid down in Europe in the area of subsidiarity and the precedence of the rules of the country where the services are performed."
"The new proposal for a directive is throwing the existing regulation into utter confusion and threatens drastically to restrict the Member States' policy room to determine conditions on the basis of general interest, monitoring the quality of society and the environment and guaranteeing fundamental rights."
"In my view, some elements are even inconsistent with the corresponding guiding principles in the Treaty."
"It is beyond me why you want to get this through Parliament before your departure, and I am pleased that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has in any case decided not to proceed too hastily in this matter."
"In the Miller report, my group urges that no final decisions should yet be taken, about this new directive among other things, until such time as the discussion about the legal framework for services of general interest is complete."
"This does not strike me as being unreasonable."
". – Mr President, as we are only a matter of weeks away from enlargement it is most welcome for Parliament to be sending a strong signal that it wants the internal market to be strengthened to serve effectively the interests and aspirations of more than 450 million European citizens and well over 20 million companies."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Miller, and his colleagues in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market for all their hard work in raising the profile of the internal market over the last few years."
"Indeed, they can claim credit for some of the measures in the Commission's internal market strategy, as these were originally their ideas."
"The internal market is one of Europe's finest achievements."
"Since 1993 it has helped to create more than 2.5 million extra jobs and has added nearly EUR 900 billion, cumulatively, to our collective prosperity."
"There is much more to come!"
"There are still major gaps in the legal framework, such as on services and taxation."
"Furthermore, in a Union of 25 Member States or more, we need to strengthen the foundations on which the internal market is built."
"The internal market strategy 2003-2006 sets out exactly what needs to be done by whom and by when."
"It is a ten-point plan for making Europe better off."
"There is no time now to go into all the details of Parliament's reports or, indeed, of the internal market strategy."
"Therefore, I will focus on a few key issues."
"I welcome Parliament's support for strengthening the mutual recognition principle."
"I know that views differ on where the balance needs to be struck between mutual recognition and harmonisation."
"The benefits of mutual recognition are that it respects national traditions and avoids further regulation at the level of the European Union."
"We all know that negotiating harmonising directives will be no sinecure with 25 Member States around the table."
"Therefore, if we can avoid more legislation, so much the better."
"The point, however, is not to impose mutual recognition at all costs."
"By getting Member States to notify cases where mutual recognition cannot be relied upon we shall be much better placed to propose a targeted solution which does not go beyond what is necessary to kick-start free movement again."
"I share Parliament's concern over the slow implementation of internal market directives."
"Late transposition creates legal insecurity and can cause significant harm to businesses and citizens from other Member States."
"It is difficult to understand why Member States that fulfil their obligations do not hold to task other Member States that are consistently late in doing so."
"The Commission, of course, takes immediate legal action where Member States fail to transpose on time."
"Nor do we shy away from hanging Member States' dirty linen out to dry."
"Public embarrassment often has more impact than a pile of infringement proceedings in the post."
"Late transposition, however, is only a symptom of a larger problem."
"The bottom line is that we shall not have a fully functioning internal market as long as Member States treat the internal market like a rented car that they do not need to wash or maintain."
"I am therefore attracted by Parliament's suggestion that Member States should establish internal market offices that would be responsible for good internal market behaviour and to which people could apply if they have a problem."
"We shall certainly pursue this line of thinking."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the implementation of the internal market is truly one of the most important steps in achieving the Lisbon objectives."
"If the internal market is to work efficiently there needs to be genuine commitment at supranational level with regard to setting internal market objectives and at national level with regard to the implementation of decisions."
"Although the objectives are in place and the necessary laws have now been enacted at EU level, the extent to which they have been brought into effect in many Member States is truly shameful."
"The Commission should invest more time in monitoring the implementation of the decisions taken."
"I agree with the rapporteur, Mr Miller, that Member States in breach of their obligations should be condemned more frequently, expeditiously and severely than is now the case, by imposing fines, for example."
"Furthermore, the impact and effectiveness of EU legislation should be continually assessed, as unnecessary laws are something we do not need."
"A viable internal market is an excellent way of creating jobs and wealth."
"One of the most harmful barriers to the proper functioning of the internal market is restricted mobility of the workforce and inflexibility of the labour market."
"The decision by many Member States, including Finland, not to allow the free movement of the workforce from the new Member States is nothing less than blatant discrimination against the nationals of those countries."
"So far only Ireland and Great Britain have said they will open up their borders on 1 May to the workforce arriving from the Central European countries that are joining the Union."
"Other old Member States are using the opportunity to keep their borders closed, even though one of the pillars of the EU is the free movement of the workforce."
"The new Member States certainly could not have expected the decisions that were made owing to pressure by the trade union movement."
"The restrictions might even have been accepted if the new Member States had been aware of them at Copenhagen, when the membership agreements were just being signed."
"It is short-sighted and pointless on the part of the current Member States to fear change in this way and be unwilling to implement essential structural solutions, and it undermines the prospects of economic growth in both the current and the new Member States."
"The opening of the market for net-based industries has delivered significant benefits for consumers, businesses and society."
"Competition has increased, prices have fallen, and there is more innovation and choice."
"To boost international competitiveness, it is important to address all the problems that are troubling the internal market."
"Removing the cross-border barriers to trade in services in the service industry is the most crucial of these."
"I hope the directive on services makes swift progress."
"Mr President, the main virtue of the report by Mr Miller is that it attempts a global approach."
"Thus, it is rightly considered that the strategy for the market, together with the broad economic policy guidelines and the employment guidelines, are one of the three means for promoting the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives."
"Consequently, proper operation of the market presupposes acceptance of this basic political objective."
"If the Lisbon strategy failed to bring about the results we were expecting, this is due to ambiguity about its real content."
"We believe that, in the same way as competitiveness of the market is being proposed, the social dimension of the strategy for it should also be jointly evaluated without fear."
"Thus, competitiveness, in the sense of ‘competitiveness based on quality’ rather than ‘competitiveness based on eroding labour costs’, as well as being a governing principle for economic relations, will also become a general principle for all social relations."
"Only thus will it be possible for the European model to be exported and to play a leading role in the global market."
"If this strategic objective is accepted unreservedly, we can resolve the individual problems of malfunctions on the internal market more effectively."
"Our first concern is for the Member States to be convinced at long last that an internal market cannot function without advanced harmonisation of its legislation, including the lifting of tax barriers, and without increased responsibility for the application of the agreed rules without delay and without distortion."
"The current regime for monitoring the application of Community rules has failed and radical reform is needed."
"The second concern is to address the phenomena of the development of the internal market by just one section of the companies and the active population."
"Unless small- and medium-sized enterprises and consumers are brought on board, any decisions we take at European level will have limited results."
"Therefore, above all, we must see what it is that makes the man in the street opposed to the internal market and how we can link its future with the vision of Europe."
"Commissioner, you want to build the internal market on purely commercial principles and with fiscal and regulatory competition, when an efficient internal market in accordance with the European social model requires the creation of public assets and a substantial harmonisation of the rules at European level."
"In order to impose your views, you tend to use the cutlass method."
"I would like to take my turn to say that the directive on services represents a real danger, a poison for the European Union."
"You want liberalisation in all areas, while in January 2004 Parliament again rejected the liberalisation of the education, health, social services and water sectors."
"You want to remove the exclusive rights for services of general economic interest and impose the rules of public markets, while Parliament has asked for these services to have a legal codecision framework and given its opinion in favour of a right of autoproduction for public organisations."
"You want to extend the principle of mutual recognition and the application of the law of the supplier’s country of origin across the board."
"This can only cause ill-feeling and disputes."
"The only method that can unite Europeans would involve establishing common positive criteria in the different sectors of the internal market by codecision, which would produce harmonisation rules in accordance with our social model."
"I must also highlight the lack of consultation of civil society in your practice."
"This is largely responsible for the bad quality of texts and for the large number of disputes."
"The Lamfalussy method for financial services is much more participative than the one that you use in other areas where you seek to obtain a blank cheque to eliminate regulatory barriers."
"Nevertheless, the Lamfalussy method is handicapped by many inadequacies that we wish to overcome: the lack of a right of call-back for Parliament, insufficient economic analyses and consultations that are still largely limited to professionals."
"For all these reasons, I beseech my colleagues – and I have already written to them all to this effect – to re-establish the political line in Parliament in favour of the social market economy."
"This line was sacrificed at the vote in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"In order to re-establish it, we need to adopt the amendments tabled by Messrs Miller and Ortega."
"Mr President, in supporting Mr Miller's general line about this report and in particular his points about water, I want to draw special attention to Amendment No 13."
"It would be a very illiberal doctrine to say that liberalisation should be pursued in an inflexible way, insensitive to local realities."
"We ought to look at, for example, the case of remoter parts of the European Union."
"We should therefore, for example, welcome the flexibility in relation to local transport services indicated by the recent Altmark judgment."
"Unfortunately, however, the Commission has said that this cannot possibly apply to ferries."
"Buses are not ferries – indeed they are not – but transport is transport, by sea and by land."
"Mr Miller mentioned the problem of Railtrack in the United Kingdom."
"Split the ownership of the rails from the ownership of the trains and you get a crazy situation."
"In Scotland it seems that we are about to split the ownership of the ships from the ownership of the companies that sail them."
"Railtrack by sea!"
"This is liberalisation pursued in an extreme and inflexible way."
"Mr Bolkestein is a frequent and always welcome visitor to Scotland."
"I hope that on his next visit to the Hebrides he does not have to travel under an assumed name to hide his responsibility for the fiasco which is about to be wished upon us!"
"Mr President, Commissioner, I too believe that the principle of mutual recognition is one of the keys to developing the single market."
"In the few seconds that I have available, I do, however, want to focus on the much-discussed issue of water."
"The water, or water services, sector is, and will be, crucial in Europe too."
"I believe that it would be unreasonable, especially in this sector, to forego the efficiency that can derive from liberalisation and competition."
"The ownership of water is not at stake, contrary to what someone, not in this House, has said. Nor are we concerned here with the privatisation of water, but merely with opening up the water services market, which is often managed in an inefficient way by public, local and national monopolies."
"To those who say ‘come and look at the railways in Great Britain’, I would say, ‘come and see the public water mains in Italy, including the major ones, together with the waste of water resources and of public money’."
"I am not saying that there has to be a dogma, but I believe that opening up public services to competition and the market is actually a move towards a social Europe."
"– Mr President, we will have to be very careful, when voting on the report on the Internal Market Strategy, not to turn Mr Miller’s work, which is in fact outstanding, on its head, so that this House ends up, after only a few weeks, overturning the decision it took in January on public services of general interest."
"Let me clarify what I mean by reference to our water."
"In January, we expressed our opposition to the unrestrained privatisation of basic services such as water and sewerage, as well as health services and education."
"We set down in writing our recognition that decisions on these things have to be taken, if at all possible, close to the citizen in towns and communities."
"Services of general interest are the business of the people who use them; they are not to be the plaything of an unrestricted market."
"That is the point that Mr Miller reiterated in his report on the Internal Market Strategy, using persuasive examples to warn of the dangers that ensue if, for example, we make our precious water nothing more than an ordinary item of merchandise."
"It was apparent from the deliberations in the committee, though, that there are powerful conservative and liberal elements who believe that there are more, and quicker, profits to be made out of the public services."
"This is meant to be Mr Miller’s report; we must make sure that it really is by, in the plenary, stopping them in their tracks."
"The amendments needed to make good the fudge for which the committee is responsible have been tabled."
"I ask you all to help ensure that our towns and communities are not stabbed in the back, which is what this unholy alliance between conservatives and liberals wants to happen."
". – Mr President, I would very much enjoy a visit to the Isle of Skye, and perhaps Sir Neil MacCormick would accompany me."
"But I shall certainly do that under my own name and not under any assumed name. I hope Sir Neil would agree to that."
"I shall address two points that appeared to be important in this debate."
"Firstly, the question of whether the internal market strategy takes enough account of social, employment and environmental concerns."
"I must stress that the main aim of the internal market strategy is to strengthen the application of the key principles on which the internal market is based, especially as the Union expands and enlarges to take in ten more Member States."
"Hence the focus on the free movement of goods and services, mutual recognition, taxation obstacles, implementation and enforcement, and the simplification of rules."
"That does not mean that social or environmental aspects are not important."
"However, there are other instruments which are much better placed to address those concerns, such as, for example, the employment guidelines."
"Not every document the Commission produces should deal with each and every issue."
"I disagree with the view that the internal market is not socially or environmentally friendly."
"More than 2.5 million jobs have been created since 1993 because of the internal market."
"Nearly EUR 900 billion cumulatively has been added to our combined gross domestic product – money that supports our social security system, pensions, healthcare and education."
"Costs of baskets of services and goods include jobs, leaving more money in people's pockets."
"The internal market has promoted innovation and the adoption of clean-air technology."
"Therefore, the internal market is a good social and environmental policy."
"Secondly, on the matter of liberalisation, firstly, I must stress that privatisation is not the Commission's concern."
"In fact, Article 295 of the Treaty prohibits the European Commission from dealing with ownership."
"Liberalisation and competition are the Commission's concern, but not privatisation."
"Concerning the services of general economic interest, the Commission makes no apology for its actions to open up the network industries to further competition."
"Industry and citizens have generally benefited, as demonstrated by the results of performance and evaluation measurement."
"Quality and user satisfaction are higher than before market opening and prices are often lower."
"Further market opening is desirable."
"For example, the Commission has just proposed further steps in the railway sector and we are also looking at ways of injecting more competition into the water sector."
"This debate is not about deregulation but re-regulation."
"The quality of service and respect for general interests remain critical requirements."
"However, I disagree that public monopolies are the natural guarantor of such standards."
"Competition is the consumer's best friend."
"It will always be up to governments to lay down the conditions that services of general interest – public or private – will have to fulfil."
"Mr President, Mr Bolkestein offers to visit Skye. He is very wise!"
"It is the only island of the Hebrides now joined to the mainland by a bridge and does not depend upon the services of ferries subject to public service obligations."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be tomorrow at noon."
". – This report is of enormous importance."
"It is a strategic report, even though it conceals or disguises its class nature, which the so-called Lisbon strategy reveals clearly."
"Just four topics."
"First, point 38: I welcome the statement that the free movement of workers is the least developed – particularly when compared with the rampant movement of capital; the GUE/NGL draft amendment would make this even clearer and more positive."
"Secondly, point 40: the two freedoms of movement mentioned above oppose each other in the management of pension funds by multinational companies, which is presented as highly desirable."
"For whom?"
"Serving what kind of economy?"
"A speculative one?!"
"Thirdly, point 10: its welcoming of ‘the proposals to continue liberalisation and the opening up of markets in other sectors (notably water and postal services)’ inspires in me a feeling that is the very opposite of welcoming and makes me strongly support the amendments tabled by my Group and the rapporteur."
"Fourthly, point 9: this should quite simply be phrased the other way round: ‘the effective and efficient working of the internal market should reinforce rather than hamper the social dimension.’"
"That is all for now, although there is a lot more!"
"The next item is the second report (A5-0122/2004) by Olle Schmidt, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 77/388/EEC as regards value added tax on services provided in the postal sector."
". – Under Article 93 of the Treaty, provisions concerning VAT must be adopted to the extent that harmonisation is necessary to ensure the establishment and the functioning of the internal market."
"Directive 97/67/EC was the first step towards the establishment of such a postal market."
"For the first time, consumers were given a choice and operators were free to provide their services outside their own small national markets."
"As is often the case with European tax legislation, the VAT Directive has lagged behind and now requires urgent changes since it no longer reflects the needs or the situation in the Community."
"As they are currently being interpreted by many Member States, the current VAT arrangements are not compatible with the establishment of an internal market since they provide for the exemption of services provided by certain operators in their own market, their taxation once they dare to supply services in other Member States and the taxation of all other operators at the standard rate, wherever they happen to supply their services."
"In the event of legislative inaction, there is a clear risk that the European Court of Justice will be called upon to resolve this apparent breach of the neutrality of the tax in order to re-establish a level playing field and ensure that internal market principles are respected."
"It could only do so by restricting the scope of the exemption to those services which are still not open to competition."
"That would mean taxation at the full rate for all other services."
"The Commission, in presenting its proposal, is fulfilling its obligations under the Treaty, in particular under Article 93."
"It has done so after extensive consultation with universal postal services and other postal operators, as well as representatives of postal customers."
"It has taken into account their opinions, in particular those of private customers and charities by proposing that a reduced rate be applied to services such as letterpost, small packages and direct mail, which such customers use most."
"The combined effect of the savings to postal operators resulting from the right of deduction the proposal would open to them and the application of a reduced rate to a wide scope of postal services is intended to limit or neutralise any increase in postal prices."
"The Commission was the proponent of the universal services concept at the heart of Directive 97/67/EC and considers that every citizen in the union has the right to a wide range of affordable, quality postal services."
"Universal postal service providers will not be in a position to provide such a service if they are discouraged from investing and modernising and as a result can no longer compete with other operators in the parts of the market which are already open to competition."
"The current VAT exemption makes the required investment more expensive."
"Universal postal operators in Europe recognise such challenges and accordingly most of them support the objectives of this proposal."
"To conclude, I would invite Members of the House to support the Commission's proposal."
"Mr President, Commissioner, so here we are again, and I am again trying to get this House to realise the importance of changing the current rules on value added tax exemption on postal services."
"The committee and plenary rejected my proposal a few months ago, so now Mrs Lulling and I are back with a list of amendments to appease our critical fellow Members."
"I would, as the Commissioner says, have preferred that the Commission proposals had been adopted straight off, but there was no majority for doing so."
"The market is being liberalised at both European and national level."
"Several old government postal and telephone companies have been converted to public limited companies."
"They need different rules."
"The current unequal tax treatment not only hampers the development of open markets, and thus the deregulation of the postal services, but it also distorts competition and makes it more difficult for both the public and private operators to compete."
"The economic impact on consumers would be negligible."
"It is the famous increase of a penny per stamp, or no increase at all."
"There can even be a price reduction if the Member States use a reduced rate."
"Those postal operators mentioned by the Commissioner are subject to VAT."
"They will also be able to reclaim input VAT paid, thus lowering their overall costs."
"This is good for new investment and the modernisation of old monopoly companies."
"I should like to emphasise this."
"We have made some amendments since the last reading."
"It is proposed that the weight limit for the reduced rate for standard mail be raised from 2 kg to 10 kg."
"This is one of the weight limits set by the International Postal Union (IPU)."
"In this way, important pieces of standard mail would be included in the reduced rate range."
"This includes newspapers, weeklies and other parcels."
"The entry into force of the directive is postponed until 2007."
"This will give enough time to the Member States and postal operators to adapt to the new provisions of the directive."
"This also fits in with the different liberalisation stages envisaged for the postal market."
"It is also recommended that the Member States which, on 1 January 2003, applied a super-reduced rate might continue to apply that super reduced rate to postal services."
"We also have suggestions regarding various organisations that deal with gifts and the like."
"I hope that these compromises are sufficient."
"It would be unfortunate if nothing were to happen at all."
"The biggest issue that has been dealt with recently is the case of Royal Mail."
"Other providers of postal services, according also to the Commissioner, support this proposal."
"The industry approves."
"Data from the national regulator, Postcomm in Great Britain prove that removing the VAT exemption for public operators would not result in price increases for users."
"It would, on the contrary, create a level-playing field ultimately leading to increased competition, greater choice for postal users and lower prices."
"I spoke to a leading employee of Postcomm who told me that there was no reason for Royal Mail to retain this VAT exemption as it was not needed to protect either Royal Mail or the users."
"Rather, the opposite is the case."
"It is a shame that I have been unable to convince so many intelligent fellow MEPs such as Mr Goebbels, Mr Skinner and Mrs Villiers, and particularly my own party colleague Mr Huhne, to adopt a sensible line of thinking."
"This is regrettable, and I can but state that if Parliament rejects my proposal again tomorrow – as, unfortunately, there is much to indicate that it will – then I have failed horribly."
"Maybe we can live with this, as I myself can live with it, but it is however Europe’s consumers who have lost."
"They are the big losers."
"I hope that my fellow Members can consider this, if only overnight before the vote tomorrow."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, you have just heard that the rapporteur, Mr Olle Schmidt from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, and I are not going to give up."
"In the run-up to the elections, we face opposition from populists, among others, to our efforts to get this House to say loud and clear what proposals it has to make in respect of the Commission’s proposal for VAT on services in the postal sector."
"It is for that reason that we have resubmitted our amendments to the Commission proposal."
"Simply rejecting this proposal out of hand, which is what Mr Goebbels, and others who speak for the Group of the Party of European Socialists, have been trying to do for almost a year now, is too primitive an approach."
"To be sure, it plays well with the public to proclaim your opposition to VAT on postage stamps, but we are well aware that, as various postal services have been liberalised, there will, in the long term, be no getting away from the need to treat postal services and private service providers equally in order to avoid competition in this sector being distorted. So it makes more sense to us to tell the Council of Ministers, and the Commission too, what we want done to prevent postage stamps going up in price."
"This is what our amendments are aiming at."
"In the first place, we want to defer the entry into force of this directive until 2007, in order to give the postal services enough time to implement it without difficulty."
"Apart from that, we would like to allow those Member States that have a greatly reduced VAT rate – Luxembourg has been one since January 2003; ours is 3% – to apply it to postal services too."
"That is a tangible and positive policy; simply saying ‘no’ or adopting some similarly populist approach does no service either to the postal service or to those who use it."
"I therefore hope that the majority in this House will vote to approve the sensible proposal that I, on behalf of my group, have joined with the rapporteur in bringing forward."
"Mr President, Mrs Lulling is the embodiment of non-populist intelligence."
"Nevertheless, the total harmonisation of indirect taxation has never been an objective of the European Union."
"An internal market can work perfectly well with fiscal competition, as long as it is fair competition."
"The proof of this is the American internal market, in which the fifty States of the Union continue to tax consumption through local taxes of between 0 and 10 percentage points."
"The coordination of VAT rates and excise duties that took place with my modest contribution, in 1991, under the Luxembourg Presidency, established the base rates, including zero rates in some areas, and the ceiling rates, allowing the Member States a degree of freedom of action for a national taxation policy."
"However, the Commission is still pushing for fiscal unification."
"Each Community acquis is fiercely defended."
"This is the case in the debate surrounding a possible decrease in VAT rates for some highly labour-intensive services."
"Normally, Mr President, people eat wherever they happen to get hungry."
"There are very few people who will go abroad to find a hair salon with a better rate of VAT."
"There are even fewer citizens who call on the European competition when they have a plumbing problem."
"Why does the Commission not take notice when the Member States want, for example, to promote employment in certain sectors in which the VAT rate is too high?"
"The Commission’s proposal to abolish the VAT exemption granted to public postal services comes from this same vague desire for standardisation."
"The postal sector is still a service organised at national level with a national price system."
"Until, for example, you can put an Italian or Swedish stamp on a letter in France, there will not be an internal postal market, or a real distortion of competition between the different postal systems."
"The reasons why postal systems are, nevertheless, fighting for the introduction of a VAT rate are basely material."
"By charging even minimal VAT on standard postal services, postal operators could deduct the VAT paid on their purchases."
"Those who would not benefit are consumers."
"They would very quickly face increases in postal prices."
"The majority of the Socialist Group will vote against VAT on postal services."
"We want to defend consumers."
"The harmonisation of VAT on postal services sought by the Commission is in fact just an attempt to create the conditions required for a subsequent privatisation of a public service for the benefit of certain private companies that are already active in that field."
"We oppose the privatisation of this universal service which, even in the United States, functions as a public service."
"Mr President, I think that the VAT exemption should be lifted."
"I do not share the Commissioner’s views on liberalisation, but I am not convinced by Mr Goebbels’ arguments."
"I think that there is already an internal market for postal services, except for private use."
"Mail to private individuals, for example, only represents 10% of the turnover of the French postal service."
"The remainder is mired in competition, and there are inequalities in that competition."
"Contrary to what Mr Schmidt said, I think that the traditional public operators are particularly penalised by the inappropriate taxation system and by being unable to deduct VAT from their purchases."
"The reasons are not only purely financial; it is about being able to develop."
"I would also like to add that there is a tax on salaries to compensate for the so-called privilege of VAT exemption ."
"It would be paradoxical to claim to want to defend public service companies while allowing them to be strangled."
"I think that the correct solution in these circumstances is to keep the Schmidt and Lulling amendments, which are a further step to the left, with obligatory reduced and super-reduced rates for services that are part of the universal service."
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to express my appreciation for Mr Schmidt's work."
"Having to submit an amended report twice in order to gain sufficient support struck me as being no mean feat."
"I hope that the amendments by Mr Schmidt and Mrs Lulling will be supported in the plenary tomorrow."
"In the European Union, the postal market will be liberalised by no later than the beginning of 2009."
"You may, or may not, like that, but, now that the decision is before us, it is important to ensure that this does not result in chaos, with the public no longer being able to receive or send mail."
"The equal treatment of public and private providers of postal services in terms of VAT basis and the VAT rate is therefore of major importance."
"In addition, with a view to the free postal market, provision must be made for equal opportunities within the internal market."
"That is why I shall be supporting the amendments tabled by Mr Schmidt and Mrs Lulling."
"Mr President, the publicly-owned postal company in Ireland, An Post, is currently struggling for survival."
"Following the impact of liberalisation, it has lost significant parts of the profitable portion of its market while it continues to bear the burden of carrying a universal service obligation to the furthest corners of the Republic of Ireland."
"It must deliver a letter, which may originate in the UK or elsewhere, regardless of the cost and regardless of what area of the country it is addressed to."
"It is also losing significant state contracts, which enabled it to maintain its public service obligations, because of the public procurement requirements."
"To oblige An Post to now apply VAT to its postal services could well be the death knell of the company."
"No doubt many of those free market enthusiasts will be rubbing their hands in glee at such a prospect because they can then pick up what remains of the profitable bits of the Irish market."
"But then what happens to the public service obligation?"
"Who will deliver the letter to the person living alone in the extreme north-west or south-west of the Republic of Ireland?"
"The Irish Government has recently indicated its opposition to this measure, having kept its mouth shut very tightly since the subject was first mooted by the Commission in 2000."
"I welcome its recent conversion and I hope that it is successful in blocking this measure."
"There needs to be some common sense in the way we deal with public services like the postal services."
". – The Commission hopes for the support of Parliament for its proposal and is ready to take into account a number of significant amendments proposed by Members of Parliament."
"The Commission's position as regards the amendments is as follows: the Commission considers that any study of the postal sector, and particularly those carried out under Directive 97/67/EC, should take into account the impact of VAT in the sector."
"The Commission undertakes to take into account the spirit of Amendment No 5."
"In view of a possible compromise with Parliament and with regard to Amendments Nos 4 and 11, the Commission could accept a delay until 1 January 2007 in the entry into force for the actual implementation of the directive in order to allow operators enough time to adapt their systems."
"In view of a possible compromise with Parliament, which has stressed the need to protect consumers from price increases on standard postal services, and with regard to Amendments Nos 6, 9 and 10, the Commission could agree to widening the proposed scope of postal services that may qualify for a reduced rate so as to include standard postal services relating to items of up to 10 kg in weight."
"With regard to Amendments Nos 1 and 7, recent events have once again shown that Member States are very much attached to the optional nature of reduced rates, and the Commission cannot, therefore, undertake to amend its proposal in this sense."
"However, these amendments would indicate in no uncertain terms that this Parliament considers price stability of postal services of paramount importance and certainly sends a political signal to Member States to make use of the option which the proposal includes."
"With regard to Amendments Nos 3 and 8, the Commission considers reduced rates under 5% to be temporary measures which should not be applied to new categories of goods or services."
"As regards Amendment No 2, endorsing a reimbursement mechanism for charitable organisations, the Commission would like to repeat its view that nothing in the Sixth Directive prevents Member States from introducing such a mechanism outside the VAT system."
"However, it would not be appropriate, nor in keeping with the subsidiarity principle, to amend its proposal to advise Member States how they should spend their tax receipts."
"Lastly, as regards Amendment No 13, the Commission considers the issues posed by philatelic stamps are no different from those existing today."
"Under current legislation, stamps are only exempt when sold at face value."
"They are taxable in all other cases."
"Since this different tax liability is not causing problems today, it should not cause problems once the proposal is approved."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be tomorrow at noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0115/2004) by Godelieve Quisthoudt-Rowohl, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council decision concerning the conclusion of the Agreement on Scientific and Technical Cooperation between the European Community and the State of Israel."
". – Mr President, I am grateful for this opportunity to discuss with Parliament the issue of scientific and technological cooperation between Israel and the European Community."
"I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl, and the members of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy for their work and constant interest in science and research matters."
"The aim of this agreement is to enable continued cooperation with Israel in the field of science and technology."
"This relationship has been developing ever since Israel's participation in the Fourth Framework Programme for research."
"I would also emphasise the importance of this cooperation within the framework of the development of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, as well as in the implementation of the European Research Area."
"The present agreement is an extension of the one associating Israel with the activities of the Fifth Framework Programme for research and technological development."
"The latter is based on the fundamental principle of reciprocity, which takes into account the mutual interests of the two parties and covers all the fields suggested by the Sixth Framework Programme, with the exception of nuclear research."
"Scientific cooperation with Israel has already resulted in numerous joint projects in the field of research and technological development."
"Under the Fifth Framework Programme, 623 projects were undertaken by European research teams in association with Israeli teams, who coordinated 149 of those projects."
"The public and private partners engaged in this cooperation have stressed the value of that cooperation and the benefits of it. This was emphasised during the evaluation of the impact of the agreement associating Israel to the Fifth Framework Programme."
"I should also like to stress the value of this type of agreement for the development for Euro-Mediterranean regional scientific cooperation."
"For example, the Hortimed project associates Israel and neighbouring countries such as Egypt, the Palestinian Territories, Cyprus and Greece in the search for economic and sustainable solutions for the use of water in irrigated horticulture, particularly by using recycled and cleaned water."
"Another major element, mentioned previously, is the contribution this agreement makes to the implementation of the European Research Area and its opening-up to the rest of the world."
"More generally, it also contributes to the development of a knowledge-based society."
"In this context, the Commission is willing to promote international cooperation in scientific and technological matters with third country partners."
"The Cooperation Agreement with Israel fits naturally into this strategy, particularly in respect of the Middle East."
"The agreement should also enable scientists to continue their efforts for regional cooperation with the countries neighbouring Israel for the benefit of all, and this in the difficult circumstances currently prevailing in the Middle East."
"I am therefore convinced that Parliament should and will give its support to the conclusion of this agreement."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, on 20 November 1995 a Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement was concluded between the European Union and Israel by which Israel became associated with the EU in the fields of the movement of goods and services, the right of establishment, the movement of capital and economic and cultural cooperation."
"This institutionalised a political dialogue with Israel, which was already taking place on a highly regular basis."
"The EU also maintains a special relationship with the autonomous Palestinian Authority and is one of the partners in the Middle East peace process."
"I have thus now mentioned the two elements that are crucial to the consideration of this Agreement."
"Since 1975 Israel and the European Union had been cooperating in the field of research and development, and in 1983, they began jointly to finance research projects, and, as Commissioner Bolkestein has already said, Israel participated fully in the Fifth Framework Programme;"
"I was the rapporteur on this association at the time."
"These agreements were and are a recognition of the international nature of research at the end of the twentieth century, and also recognise that to limit research to EU territory would frequently be contrary to its best interests."
"There is a very innovative research climate in Israel, which, relative to its GDP, still spends more on research than does the EU, and is a world leader as regards the number of scientific publications per capita."
"I do not propose to repeat the figures to which reference has already been made."
"Both sides have benefited from cooperation under the Fifth Framework Programme: Israel gains access to a more extensive network of research institutes, while the EU is able to tap Israel’s innovative potential."
"Just how successful this cooperation has been is shown, among other things, by the large number of projects supported."
"Some projects have partners not only from Israel, but also from the entire Mediterranean."
"Water treatment has already been mentioned; there are also institutes in the areas under the autonomous Palestinian Authority that participate successfully in our Research Programme."
"Let me take this opportunity of repeating, for the benefit of some in this House, that this report does not envisage any research cooperation in the sphere of military research or under the aegis of Euratom."
"As in the two previous Agreements, Israel is expected to contribute financially to the Sixth FP in proportion to its GDP."
"It participates in the programme as a partner with the same rights and obligations as EU Member States: the only exception is the Scientific and Technical Research Committee (CREST), in which it is only an observer."
"Israel’s contribution to our research funds and the know-how provided by Israeli institutes can only be seen as positive for EU participants, and so we are very definitely in a win-win-situation here"
"In order to implement the Agreement, a Joint Committee will be set up, which will ensure the involvement of Israeli officials in the administrative committees and the participation of experts to give their expertise and in programme committees."
"There is no obstacle, then, from the research point of view, to the extension of the Agreement."
"In order that this statement should not be misunderstood, let me quote from a letter written to me by the Israeli Ambassador, Oded Eran, who had this to say: ‘As you pointed out, the overall situation in the Middle East and specifically between Israel and the Palestinian Authority is far from being ideal at the moment."
"And the whole Middle East peace process is facing a critical test.’I therefore sympathise with those who tabled the amendments, who are opposed to this and believe that we should put every form of cooperation with Israel on ice until such time as peace prevails in this region, which is so sadly lacking in it."
"I have to say, though, that it is my firm conviction that shutting doors prevents us from cooperating further."
"Let us be prepared to have frank discussions with all sides, for that is the only way in which we will be able to influence the peace process."
"This means that, from the research point of view, the Agreement is very much to be welcomed."
"This cooperation will benefit not only researchers and research institutes in the EU, but businesses too, and, where the political situation is concerned, I am persuaded that it can help to ease tensions, as Palestinian researchers and institutes will be enabled to work together with their Israeli and European counterparts, and those who work together are not fighting each other."
"Let me conclude by thanking all those, on every side, with whom I have had discussions – those in favour, those against, those who will benefit and those who wanted changes made – from whom I have had a great deal of support and with whom I have, in any case, been able to have very calm and relaxed dialogue."
"I thank you all, and hope that my report will make it through tomorrow with the backing of a large majority."
"Mr President, normally a scientific and technological cooperation agreement is straightforward, very welcome and an occasion for optimism, especially if it is the successor to earlier agreements on which good scientific work has been done."
"Sadly, this agreement cannot be straightforward."
"From the scientific point of view, collaboration with Israel is no doubt useful in the Sixth Framework Programme."
"It is a strong scientific country and, as we have heard, some very useful Mediterranean-wide projects, including research into water treatment, have been carried out and could be carried out in future."
"However, we are not discussing a normal country or a normal part of the world."
"Israel is not a normal country because many of the present government's actions are completely unacceptable: building a fence, occupying territory, breaching human rights, using repression."
"Despite some joint scientific work with Palestinians, I have had complaints regarding barriers to some of that work."
"Our Group considered very carefully whether to vote in favour of this agreement."
"There are two perfectly valid, tenable points of view."
"One could say – as some will – that signing or ratifying this agreement will be perceived as giving the green light and an encouraging signal and endorsement to the actions of the Israeli Government."
"That is certainly not the intention."
"In the past the European Parliament has very successfully asked for scientific cooperation to be frozen."
"Some Members advocate voting against this agreement and indeed taking much further action to show the Israeli Government our disapproval."
"A second alternative – and the one that I recommend – is to consider that science and research are positive, that the results of that work are of benefit to human beings and that this allows dialogue and provides an opening for work with Palestinians."
"Other points can certainly – and probably will – be made in political dialogue."
"There may be cause for action elsewhere."
"We have had long discussions and have come to the conclusion, in majority – although not unanimously – that the second alternative, to put faith in the possibility that the scientific dialogue, without any endorsement of the Israeli Government's actions, will bring some progress."
"We have great reservations."
"We want Palestinian participation without barriers or handicaps."
"Of course we want no nuclear, military or dual-use research."
"We want a very close monitoring of the situation."
"We want the EU-Israel Research Committee to report regularly so that we can see whether this act of faith in the value of science has been worthwhile or has been misinterpreted by a government whose actions we condemn."
"Mr President, in 2002 this Parliament agreed a resolution not to pursue scientific and technical cooperation with Israel because of the violent and shocking situation in the Middle East at the time."
"Nothing has changed since, or at least very little."
"Indeed a recent delegation from this Parliament, which looked at the effects of the so-called security fence or wall, had deeply shocking things to report."
"I believe that an acceptance of this agreement would be an indication of normality and cooperation and as my colleague Mrs McNally said, this is not a normal country, it is not a normal situation, and it should not be endorsed."
"The Verts/ALE Group has therefore tabled amendments asking for the suspension of this agreement in the present situation, particularly because of its unequal benefit for one protagonist – Israel – and until more progress has been made towards realistic conflict resolution in the region."
"We have also requested that dual-use technology with a potential military application be excluded from this agreement."
"It would be extremely strange if the European Parliament did not support this last request."
"However, to my great surprise and disappointment, I believe Members will not be able to vote on that amendment."
"That is a political, not a technical, decision."
"Europeans have a historic responsibility for the problems in this region."
"These are responsibilities that we are far from bearing and properly discharging."
"I would ask you to support the amendments I have tabled."
"Mr President, following an intense and controversial debate, the Socialist Group has decided to support the report we are dealing with."
"My group has decided to distinguish between the scientific and technical nature of the report and the political nature of the conflict, while condemning the attitude of the Sharon Government which – with its policy of indiscriminate killings, with the construction of a wall which steals even more Palestinian territory and its failure to evacuate settlements – is blocking the Quartet's roadmap and making it increasingly difficult to establish a viable Palestinian State."
"Furthermore, my group believes that on the issue of scientific and technical cooperation we should take particular account of the society which may benefit from that cooperation."
"Talking now on my own personal behalf, I would like to say the following: in the explanatory statement, the rapporteur acknowledges that the extension of the agreement, and I quote, ‘comes at a politically critical time in which the Middle East peace process is floundering’."
"I would say that floundering is something of an understatement."
"It is in such serious danger that only decisive action on the part of the Quartet, which so far has not been taken, could save it."
"The rapporteur also says that, and I quote, ‘it may help ease the tensions, since it will also enable Palestinian researchers and institutions to work together with Israeli and European institutes’."
"I frankly doubt that this would be the case."
"We are dealing with a situation of military occupation which goes much further than the concept of ‘tension’."
"And, furthermore, I believe that Palestinian researchers and research institutions will find it very difficult to benefit when they are surrounded by a wall which denies them freedom of movement and which encloses them in ghettos and Bantustans which bring shame on humanity."
"– Mr President, I think Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl and my colleague Mrs McNally have both done a very good job of explaining their divergent positions."
"Whenever there is a situation of problematic political conflict – and it goes without saying that Israel is one – this House finds it difficult to come to a decision."
"I do believe, though, that it is a good thing to clarify what is involved, what we want to achieve, and what message this House is sending out by endorsing the position taken by the Commission and the Council."
"This has to do with the continuation of cooperation and dialogue that are already going on in scientific and technological circles, and that benefit both sides."
"Contrary to what has been said by some Members, this is not just about the eventual benefit to Israel; we too will benefit."
"Not only will this benefit scientists, university departments and research institutes; humanity itself will benefit from cooperation and exchange between scientists, in which politicians too will have their part to play, and, as a fellow Member pointed out, society as a whole will benefit."
"We are investing in a future in which – or so we hope – Europe will be able to do its bit in resolving a situation that is, in political and human terms, extremely difficult."
"So I am both proud and glad that Mrs McNally, as my group’s coordinator, has, in the group’s discussions, always emphasised that we would endorse this report."
"On just one small point, I would like to point out to the Members in the Group of the Greens, who have difficulties with the ‘dual use’aspect that the European Union does not support any military research, nor does our research programme cover it, so any cooperation in that area is automatically ruled out."
". – Mr President, no questions have been put to the Commission and I have nothing to add to the debate."
"On behalf of my colleague, Mr Busquin, I would simply like to thank the rapporteur and the other Members who have taken part in this debate."
"I have the impression that the majority of Parliament will support this proposal, for which – again on behalf of my colleague, Mr Busquin – I should like to express gratitude."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be at noon tomorrow."
"– I am indignant at the conclusions of our rapporteur that these scientific exchanges cannot be affected by political considerations!"
"This is denying the political dimension of human rights under Article 2 of the Euro-Mediterranean agreement and contradicting the Barcelona process based on respect for fundamental rights."
"Israel systematically violates human rights in territories occupied by colonisation and occupation, violates democratic principles with regard to thousands of Palestinians, Israeli citizens, victims of discrimination."
"Israel is violating the Geneva Convention, international law, the United Nations Charter and the Vienna Convention by not respecting the trade clauses of its association agreement."
"This is a real human, ecological and political disaster."
"It is an annexation, undermining the creation of a Palestinian State, ghettoising Palestinians and ruining all hopes of peace."
"The EU cannot have trade or scientific relations with a third country without taking into consideration the abuses of international law that it is guilty of."
"Given that the EU reacted in the former Yugoslavia and in Africa, refusing to be complicit or complacent in the face of violations of humanitarian law, why should it keep silent in the case of Israel?"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0124/2004) by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the common position of the Council with a view to adopting a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on Interoperable Delivery of pan-European eGovernment Services to Public Administrations, Businesses and Citizens (IDABC) (rapporteur: Imelda Mary Read)."
". Mr President, I am delighted to present this report on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on IDABC."
"I have been the rapporteur on several previous occasions and have had the pleasure of seeing the IDABC programme grow."
"We have seen improvements in the effectiveness of cross-border cooperation between public administrations and what is now being proposed is that this be extended to businesses and to citizens."
"The journal that the Commission publishes on IDABC often mentions the IDABC way and it is important to emphasise that the IDABC way is about eMethodology: not only about the projects, but looking at the way in which those projects are developed."
"IDABC is a means to an end, a means to interactive government services at a pan-European level and it is absolutely logical to want to extend this now to businesses and to citizens."
"I have submitted just three amendments after discussions with the Commission."
"They are technical amendments, which will give legal clarification to the original text."
"I shall spend a couple of minutes talking about why this is so important."
"It is about giving value in terms of quality of services."
"It is about encouraging citizens to be better informed in voicing their own praises and their own criticisms of those services."
"It is about economies of scale and sharing common services."
"It is true that IDABC has been a driver of modernisation of public services and a contributor, as it will continue to be, to eGovernment in the candidate countries."
"It is also important that one of the achievements of IDABC is that it can give our citizens practical, very workmanlike examples of how the European Union, the Commission, Parliament, the Council have worked together to bring citizen-friendly benefits from the European Union to the Member States."
"I commend the report to you."
"I particularly thank my colleagues at the Commission who continue to work so hard and so effectively on this."
"I also thank the Council presidency, which took its time, but did so because it wanted to put down constructive and progressive amendments that were born of its own experience of the implementation of IDABC at Member State level."
". – Mr President, the Commission would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Read, for her strong support, her openness and her cooperation."
"My colleague, Mr Liikanen, has asked me to convey special thanks to Mrs Read for her excellent cooperation and to say it has been a pleasure working with her over the years."
"The Commission would also like to thank the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and the European Parliament as a whole for its support and flexibility, which almost ensured a conclusion at first reading."
"The Commission is very pleased to see that both the European Parliament and the Council have viewed the IDABC programme very favourably."
"On 18 November 2003 the European Parliament gave its full support to this programme at first reading, delivering an opinion with five amendments."
"The Commission amended its initial proposal accordingly and the Council common position takes the amendments suggested by Parliament into account almost word-for-word."
"The Commission, like the Council, fully supports the three amendments suggested by the rapporteur and the Committee on Industry at second reading, and hopes for a favourable vote in this House tomorrow."
"That would allow for swift adoption by the Council."
"It would also allow the Commission to prepare carefully, during the course of 2004, the transition from the current IDA programme to the new IDABC programme."
"The new programme will allow the Commission to continue supporting the implementation of Community legislation, which requires that Member States and the Community exchange information, by providing financial resources and infrastructure services while also ensuring interoperability."
"It will also allow the Commission to extend further the provision of pan-European eGovernment services to businesses and citizens, and to coordinate the delivery of such services in cooperation with Member States."
"In conclusion, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1 to 3."
"On behalf of the House I would like to place on record our thanks for all the work that Mrs Read has done on this, and on related issues, over the last 15 years."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be at noon tomorrow."
"(1)"
"Colleagues, this morning it is my sad duty to draw to your attention that in Madrid, at the height of the rush hour earlier today, there were at least five bomb blasts at three railway stations – the worst of these on a train entering the Atocha station."
"Tens of people have been murdered; scores of people have been injured."
"With each report the casualty list is growing."
"This is, in terms of its consequence, the worst act of terror in the history of Spain, and could be the worst act of terror in living memory in any European Union state."
"It is an outrageous, unjustified and unjustifiable attack on the Spanish people and on Spanish democracy."
"On behalf of this Parliament, I express our heartfelt, deep, sincere sympathy and condolences to the families who have suffered loss and injury; to their friends, and, through His Majesty the King of Spain, to the people of Spain and the authorities in the city of Madrid who – even as I speak – have field hospitals in the railway station and in the streets."
"A general election is to take place in Spain on Sunday."
"What happened today is a declaration of war on democracy."
"Let Sunday give the answer that Spanish democracy is strong; let Sunday give the answer that Spanish democracy is determined to overcome terrorism by all of the means available to that process."
"In Madrid, in January, I addressed the first-ever international conference for the victims of terror."
"I repeat today what I said there: in our political duty to the people of Spain and to the peoples of the European Union, it is our firm resolve that there shall be no safe haven for terrorism and terrorists in our European Union."
"On behalf of the European Parliament, I would like to express our firm commitment to democracy and human rights."
"No more bombs."
"No more deaths."
"Between us, we will put an end to the terrorists."
"I have instructed the services of our House, as a mark of respect, to fly the Spanish and European flags at half-mast."
"I invite you, in your own way, to show your solidarity by observing a minute's silence."
"The next item is the report (A5-0058/2004) by Mrs Gillig, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons, to self-employed persons and to members of their families moving within the Community, and Council Regulation (EEC) No 574/72 laying down the procedure for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71."
"Mr Solbes Mira has the floor on behalf of the Commission."
"Allow me, Commissioner, particularly in view of your nationality, to express to you my deepest sympathy."
". Madam President, thank you very much."
"Unfortunately, we now have to return to our work, but I would like first of all to express my complete solidarity with what President Cox has just said."
"Madam President, the objective of the Commission's proposal today is to update Community Regulations (EEC) Nos 1408/71 and 574/72 in order to take account of the evolution of national legislations, to clarify the legal situation with regard to certain articles of these regulations and to take account of the recent judgments of the Court of Justice."
"The present proposal, which is based on criteria endorsed by the Council, contains a new list of non-contributory benefits which are subject to specific coordination."
"This coordination, based on the principle of residence, was ratified by the Court of Justice in relation to the case."
"In its judgment, the Court established, on the one hand, the non-exportability of the benefits in question and, on the other, the obligation of the new State of residence to grant benefits in its territory."
"On the basis of this judgment it was essential to re-examine the list in Annex IIa in order to verify whether all the benefits fulfil the special and non-contributory criteria."
"In this regard, special benefits are those which are halfway between special security and social assistance and are principally aimed at guaranteeing, as a supplementary or additional sum, a social security benefit, a minimum subsistence income the amount of which is set in accordance with the socio-economic circumstances of the State of residence or those which are intended to ensure the specific protection of disabled people."
"The examination of Annex IIa has demonstrated that many of the benefits currently appearing in it should not be maintained."
"I am talking about those which, despite being intended for people with disabilities, have the main objective of alleviating the dependency of these people, improving their state of health and living conditions with regard to people requiring special care."
"What is the Commission's position on the amendments?"
"I would like firstly to congratulate Mrs Gillig on her excellent report on a delicate and technically complex issue."
"The Commission can accept Parliament’s Amendments Nos 1 to 3, since the benefits indicated in them fulfil the criteria I mentioned previously."
"The Commission, however, cannot accept Amendments Nos 4 to 8, whose objective is to exclude two Dutch benefits from Annex IIa: that for unfitness for work for young disabled people and supplementary sums or minimum incomes for receivers of social benefits."
"The Commission takes up these two proposals in its proposal, the first already appears in the current Annex IIa, because on examining its characteristics once again it notes that they are special non-contributory benefits."
"Nevertheless, neither can the Commission accept Amendments Nos 9 to 12, which do not intend to exclude, but rather to include in Annex IIa, four benefits laid down in Swedish legislation, since they are family benefits and are therefore exportable."
"The regulation defines family benefits as those intended to compensate for family burdens and this definition was interpreted in a very broad way by the Court of Justice in the joined and cases."
"With regard to Amendments Nos 4 to 12, which the Commission cannot accept, the Commission insists on the importance of treating all benefits, both those whose inclusion in Annex IIa is accepted and those which are excluded, in the same way in terms of analysing the special and non-contributory criteria."
"This is the approach the Commission has taken in the negotiations of this Annex for the candidate countries and we believe it must be maintained in relation to the Member States."
"Therefore, to remove the Dutch benefits from Annex IIa and to include the Swedish benefits would compromise the balance proposed by the Commission in relation to the Annex."
"For all these reasons, the Commission can adopt Amendments Nos 1 to 3, as I have indicated, but not the others."
"Madam President, I wish to open my speech by joining others in conveying my deepest sympathy to you, Commissioner, in light of what is happening in your country."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this report, which concerns the updating of Regulation No 1408/71 and of the Regulation which lays down implementing procedures for the former regulation is, therefore, the subject of debate in our Parliament today."
"As has just been pointed out, the purpose of the amendments proposed to us is, on the one hand, to incorporate into the document changes that have appeared in the various social security schemes and, on the other hand, to perform the essential task of incorporating the decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Communities when the latter has had to give a ruling upon these topics."
"It should be remembered that the issue of the updating or general modernisation of the Regulation is currently being debated but also that, on many occasions, our Parliament has asked for a general overhaul of the regulations coordinating social security schemes."
"The proposal that we have to consider today is basically aimed at updating the list of what are termed non-exportable benefits, contained in Annex IIa of the aforesaid Regulation."
"The decisions of the Court of Justice have made it possible to single out two essential characteristics which these benefits must exhibit in order to be considered as non-exportable and, therefore, to enjoy derogations from the general principle of the exportability of social benefits: their special character in the Member State concerned; the fact that the beneficiary does not contribute to them, in other words that they are funded from, and on the basis of, general taxation in the Member State concerned; and, finally – and as a supplementary factor – the fact that the amount is in line with the minimum necessary income required to live in the economic environment of the country granting the benefits."
"In practical terms, non-exportable benefits may be talked of in the case of certain additional resources paid to elderly people or designed to offset transport costs or even in the case of benefits linked to disability."
"We can only note that, when they are not exportable, similar versions of all these benefits exist, in general, in the other Member States and are, therefore, able then to be collected."
"What is the meaning of this updating?"
"It seems to us that the import of the proposal being put to us is very positive."
"Firstly, it effectively enables the exceptions to this general principle of exportability to be limited through the strict application of the ‘special’ and ‘non-contributory’ criteria."
"Once systems predicated upon exceptions are left behind, the conditions are always more favourable for everyone concerned."
"Secondly, this proposal puts an end to the divergent interpretations of the various national administrations and so ensures legal security for employees induced to move within the European Union."
"It brings transparency and greater clarity to an area which, as we know, is eminently complex, bordering, as it does, upon both what appear to be social security benefits in the very strict sense of the term and social action, which is a non-compulsory feature put in place by the Member States."
"It is at this level that the debate must take place and at which all the interpretations are possible."
"Thirdly, it must be possible for this proposal to be adopted without delay in order to avoid further legal disputes in this area that is very sensitive for the citizens of the European Union."
"As we know, this issue does, at a social level, sometimes alienate people from the European Union. In their eyes, the EU seems not to respond as quickly as it should to putting everyone on the same footing."
"Finally, the proposal is a factor that facilitates and promotes the advances expected in the current general overhaul of Regulation No 1408/71."
"Nonetheless, we have to express a reservation regarding the specific situation of one of the Member States which has not so much seen a benefit removed as a formerly exportable benefit reintroduced in the non-exportable category."
"This situation should, we think, give rise to a more thoroughgoing study of the citizens concerned."
"There do not appear to be very many of them, but the simple fact that a number of them are likely to suffer would in our view seem to require that, when cases come to light, thought be given to having a transitional period and a series of bilateral negotiations."
"Madam President, when, in a moment, we vote, I shall consequently have to table an oral amendment in the form of a supplementary recital along the same lines as the amendments that have been tabled by my fellow MEPs and that the Commission tells us it cannot follow up."
"This was also the position adopted within the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"This oral amendment should enable us to move forward."
"I shall conclude by pointing out that, in this scenario, we are faced with delicately balanced situations, linked to the procedure used."
"It is this open method of coordination that is delicate."
"We definitely must preserve the gains it affords in cases such as this."
"That is why I hope that this report is adopted."
"– Madam President, allow me first of all, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats, to express my condolences with the Spanish people and government."
"Fighting terrorism is an extremely difficult business."
"Today, we are discussing a proposal that is an annual fixture and that concerns all Member States, because every year, a clear distinction should be drawn between exportable and non-exportable social rights."
"The former are related to social security contributions and premiums."
"It has always been Europe's wish for social security to be exportable in terms of the offices to which contributions and premiums are payable."
"As far as non-exportable social rights are concerned, we continuously aim to perfect the definition."
"Even now in the report on the proposal for a regulation submitted by the Commission, an attempt has been made to further specify the definition of non-exportable rights."
"It is necessary to do this every year, because the Member States update their regulations every year and there are new developments on the market all the time."
"That is why the exportability of the rights involved should be considered each time."
"The Commission has written in its report: ‘The first element of a “special non-payment-based or non-contribution-based benefit” is, essentially, the “special” nature that this performance must have."
"“Special” benefits are situated halfway between “traditional” social security and support benefits and are related to social security “since the need constitutes the essential criterion for allowance”.’"
"I think that with regard to what has been listed in the annexes, the need does indeed constitute the essential criterion for allowance."
"On this basis, my group takes the view that the countries where rights which, according to Europe are not exportable, are exported nevertheless, will need to adapt their social legislation."
"In this respect, as Mrs Gillig has already mentioned, a transitional period will need to be provided for during which a solution is sought with the countries to which social legislation is exported."
"The Netherlands has clearly formulated a request and tabled quite a few amendments."
"In other countries, including Belgium, the situation is probably not so very different from that in the Netherlands."
"I am therefore of the opinion that Mrs Gillig's oral amendment, which is in keeping with the position of some of my fellow group members, should be supported."
"We are prepared to accept Mrs Gillig's text and meet the request that the Commissioner made a moment ago."
"In that way, we have an agreement in this House."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners, having observed a minute’s silence, it is sad to have to speak about a piece of legislation that is actually calculated to bring the people of Europe together, to endow them with rights that carry weight throughout Europe, and to open up to them the chance of seeing Europe as providing employment prospects and as providing a labour market."
"This legislation has been in place for over 30 years, and, as has already been said by others, we reform it every year in order to incorporate the latest changes to national laws, and also to take account of the most recent rulings by the European Court of Justice."
"I think the Commission proposal makes sense, as do Commissioner Solbes’ suggestions relating to the amendments."
"I see it as regrettable that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats seeks to use this report as a means of engineering changes that belong in the main reform and not here."
"In fact, it might seem somewhat confusing that we should today be discussing the revision of Regulation No 1408, for, over recent months, during the last few weeks, and in the last meeting of the Committee, we have been having very in-depth discussions about the major and imminent reform, which has been in progress alongside this, in which, too, we have made definite improvements for the benefit of the European public, and which is, to all intents and purposes, about to be completed."
"All this, though, has to be said with the small reservation that the great reform will enter into force only in 2007, and that is why adjustments are needed right now."
"Let me extend my group’s thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Gillig, who has produced a creditable and responsible report; she could, of course, have yielded to the temptation to introduce lots of nice amendments, but either the Commission or the Council would have ended up preventing us from putting them into effect."
"That is what makes this report so responsible."
"One problem, of course, still remains, one that my two lady colleagues from the Netherlands and Belgium will address, namely the situation of those who commute across borders; this will no doubt give rise to more major difficulties in all the Member States and will probably still be doing so after enlargement."
"We have, however, managed to find a balance between, on the one hand, enabling citizens to enjoy the social security benefits of a particular state, and, on the other, preventing national social security systems from being overloaded."
"It is a balanced report and a realistic one, and what I would say to the Members from the Group of the European People’s Party is that we should not weigh it down with amendments that are actually ill-advised at the present time."
"Madam President, I too should like to express my condolences with Spain."
"It is difficult after such an incident to return to business as usual, but we have to do this all the same."
"I have listened to a number of fellow Members here, and they assume that the proposal is an improvement on the current situation."
"What is certain is that this is a very complex issue."
"I have also listened carefully to Mr Solbes, who particularly envisages an improvement for people who are disabled or partially disabled."
"I share Mrs Smet's view that there will be problems that will need to be overcome in more than one country."
"I am not familiar with the situation in all of them, Commissioner, but as far as the Netherlands is concerned, I can tell you that the situation is deteriorating for people who are unable to participate in the labour market, those who probably never have been and never will be again."
"In their case, it is true that they are not entitled to contribution-based benefits, but this right should nevertheless be exportable, in my view."
"To those fellow MEPs who take the view that the discussion should be reduced to contributory versus non-contributory entitlements, I should like to press home the fact that there is also such a thing as social justice."
"I cannot see a need for housing costs to be exportable to another country, because these are related to the duration of housing."
"However, this specific case is about people, including people in the Netherlands, who are unlikely to ever be able to enter the labour market again."
"I would ask you to consider seriously whether other rules should not apply here."
"We wax lyrical about the free movement of persons, while at this moment in time, 1 300 people from the Netherlands live elsewhere in Europe and will lose the benefit they are currently drawing."
"I will therefore examine which premiums or proposals will receive my backing in order to haul in as much as we can, but I hope you will allow me to ask the fellow members and the Commission to consider this very carefully."
"Commissioner, I am very anxious about the future of Regulation No 1408/71."
"Can a committee be set up to examine carefully what the restrictions are?"
"The fact is that, as a result of enlargement, major debates on the exportability of social security are anticipated right across Europe."
"I would urge you to set up a committee which follows all the problems, looks for solutions and also consults with the Member States in earnest in order to eliminate injustices of this kind in one way or another. I am not saying that this is the answer to all our problems, but I think that the derogation that the Netherlands has requested affects the weakest and least protected."
"The benefit in question will be exported to third countries, but on the basis of Regulation No 1408/71, it will no longer be exported within Europe, and that is a huge injustice."
"Madam President, I would also like to add my voice to the condolences that have already been expressed in this House following the unspeakable happenings in Spain this morning."
"To move to the business of the sitting, I would like to thank the rapporteur very much for her work on this report and for the moves that she has been prepared to make in terms of a general solution to what may be a general problem, which is, after all, part of what the Regulation is supposed to do."
"Therefore, we are prepared to support her oral amendment on this occasion."
"One of the difficulties with this Regulation is that over the years we have seen the Court substituting for a lack of clarity in the current Regulation and, indeed, for the shifts in the development of social security systems within Member States."
"One of the important things provided by this update, for the simplification and modernisation of the Regulation as a whole – which we have already taken on board at first reading – is the set of definitions relating to special non-contributory cash benefits."
"Once that is adopted it will provide a clear reference framework for what is in and what is out."
"In the past this has been left more to the opinion of Member States and there has not been any set of clear criteria which people can understand."
"It will mean that for some Member States some things will be brought into the exportability pattern."
"Therefore, it will provide benefits for some people."
"I sympathise with the Dutch colleagues in their particular situation and, as I said, the oral amendment tabled by Mrs Gillig will go some way towards that."
"One of the background arguments that we have heard in this debate concerns issues of parity between the treatment of nationals and third-country nationals."
"That is not part of this discussion."
"We need clear criteria, which is why we support the rapporteur."
"Madam President, on behalf of the French MEPs, I should like, in my turn, to offer our condolences to the Spanish Government, to our fellow MEPs and to yourself, Commissioner."
"I turn now to the document submitted to us."
"Allow me first of all to congratulate the rapporteur who, on a sensitive subject, has succeeded in preparing a document that is balanced and, I think, satisfactory to employed persons, self-employed persons and members of their families."
"This document will enable the current system to be updated in a very positive way and, as the rapporteur said, will put an end to the differing interpretations at national level, while making it easier for our fellow citizens to move about."
"Moreover, it is based upon the decisions of the Court of Justice, defining the non-exportable character of certain benefits."
"The latter have three characteristics: their specificity, their non-contributory character and the fact that they are in line with each country’s level of income."
"I understand the position of our Dutch fellow MEPs where a number of the benefits are concerned."
"It has to be understood, however, that, in a system of social benefits, there are, on the one hand, what are termed legal benefits, having to do with retirement and sickness and, on the other hand, benefits of another type, termed non-contributory and referred to in France as optional benefits."
"All countries have benefits of this type."
"When I was responsible for social matters in France, I created what was termed a parental presence benefit."
"For families suddenly finding themselves with a disabled child, we created, in Paris, a benefit in the region of EUR 500 per month for 12 months."
"This benefit is now non-contributory and does not meet the criteria of exportability, meaning that, if a family with a disabled child goes tomorrow to Belgium or Spain where they are not granted a benefit of the same type, they will be hit very badly."
"That is why we must support Mrs Gillig’s report."
"In a certain number of cases not exclusively concerning our Dutch friends, we must also come up with bilateral solutions, for this issue has to do not only with freedom of movement and, therefore, greater intelligibility but also with social justice."
"That is why we must support the rapporteur’s amendment and why, Commissioner, we must also be able to benefit from your support."
"Indeed, you will appreciate that, for our fellow citizens, it is social justice that is at stake today."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I too endorse the words of sympathy addressed to the Spanish population and, above all, to the relatives of the victims."
"I think that this Parliament cannot condemn such acts of violence enough."
"This year’s annual update of the coordination regulation is a little unusual, for we are not only discussing technical changes, but also attempting to formulate a coherent position for non-exportable benefits."
"I am pleased to concur with the words of Mrs Hermange, who notes that the Court of Justice has always stressed that the exceptions to the principle of non-exportability must be interpreted to the letter."
"In other words, these pertain much more to measures of social security that are payable to all citizens within the territory."
"The Commission too is in favour of a strict interpretation, and that is why I support the proposal that is now before us in Annex IIA."
"I should, nevertheless, like to make two crucial observations."
"First of all, an overall agreement is to be reached shortly about the modernisation of the coordination regulation, including an agreement about non-exportable benefits."
"Word has already reached me that serious attempts are being made in the Council to extend the list of non-exportable benefits considerably, thus undermining the coordination regulation."
"By approving these annexes today, we have to send a message to the Council that Parliament will not tolerate this."
"Secondly, it is interesting if a system is constructed logically, but we should also realise that changes affect real people."
"Certainly if they concern regulations that have been laid down in order to guarantee people a minimum income, we have to consider very carefully what impact changes have on a country’s citizens, and particularly if there is no analogous regulation in place in other countries."
"I believe therefore, Commissioner, that it is appalling to have to conclude that, yet again, no such verification has taken place."
"For years, this Parliament has asked for the marginal effect to be verified, and what is happening now demonstrates what a fair question this is."
"By adding the Dutch Extra Allowance Act, which was included on the list with good reason in my opinion, nearly 200 Belgian border workers will be losing their extra allowance."
"Some of those will be compensated on the basis of the Belgian Social Security Act, but others will lose part of their income and that is why, Commissioner, I urge you to mount a thorough investigation into the effects on those involved, if need be via the EURES networks."
"Furthermore, it is necessary for the Member States responsible, in this case Belgium and the Netherlands, to agree on transitional periods and compensation measures, possibly by means of a bilateral agreement."
"The amendment that is being tabled in the plenary meeting today must be supported come what may."
"Along with my Belgian and Dutch fellow MEPs, I intend to write to the ministers responsible in order to find solutions for the people who risk losing part of their income and, consequently, falling below the poverty line."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I wish to express my sympathy with your country and your people at this difficult time."
"The key date will be 1 May 2004."
"It is then that the new Europe will be built. Unfortunately, our celebrations are commencing, however, with all the Member States erecting new walls to keep out those who wish to come from the new Member States to the 15 current Member States."
"That is extremely depressing."
"I believe that this can be avoided."
"I do not therefore share the Commissioner’s view."
"The basic conditions are so different from one Member State to the next."
"As long as we do not have a common welfare system, common funding and a common tax system, it is only sensible for us in the new, large EU to take account of different national viewpoints."
"Doing so will not in any way endanger freedom of movement for workers. On the contrary."
"What is important is that, through these changes, we reduce the need for transitional rules."
"No one will be discriminated against."
"The situation is the same for Poles, Germans and Danes."
"The two most generous benefits in Sweden – parental benefit and child allowance – are paid to everyone who has children in Sweden."
"They are not earnings-linked, but are funded through tax."
"Most other countries have already safeguarded themselves and entered many benefits among the derogations in the annex."
"I would therefore request the House’s full support for Amendments Nos 9 to 12."
"– Madam President, my fellow MEP, Mrs Boogerd-Quaak and I having been on our own in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I am happy to see that a number of fellow Members have in any event seen the light today."
"Today, we are adapting the coordination regulation on social security, which we do nearly every year because something changes in the Member States nearly every year."
"We are also adapting it to take due account of the decisions of the Court of Justice."
"The result is not necessarily a great gift for the people to whom the regulation applies."
"Something about which I, together with some other fellow MEPs, have remonstrated, is that the Netherlands has added to this list of non-exportable rights a benefit intended for one-income families, in an attempt to prevent the family from falling below the social minimum, namely a benefit of EUR 200 a month."
"By including this benefit in the list, this benefit is repealed immediately."
"The Netherlands is therefore saving that money."
"This means not only that 2 Danes, 193 Belgians, 395 Spanish people, 94 Italians and 55 French people are losing that benefit, it also means that the inclusion in the list is, in my view, not acceptable, because it creates discrimination between people within the European Union who no longer receive the benefit and people outside the European Union who do."
"It is true that I am campaigning as a candidate in the European elections, but quite apart from that, I think that an MEP simply cannot justify the fact that a European citizen is treated worse than third-country nationals."
"I can even give you the details: we export to Morocco 1 061 benefits, and a total of 1 300 within Europe."
"We export to Bosnia, Indonesia, the Czech Republic, the United States of America, Israel, and other countries."
"It is this unfair treatment that has caused me to include in my amendment a number of elements that I have also heard echoed in the discussion by fellow MEPs, and to submit this as a basis for a compromise."
"What this amendment boils down to – and with this, I am also addressing Mrs Van Lancker's remarks – is that the inclusion of the benefit in question on the list by the Netherlands should take effect from the moment that European and third countries are treated equally."
"The second condition is that arrangements should also have been made with regard to phasing out these benefits and compensation for them."
"I believe that, if those two elements are added to the compromise, a solution is within reach."
"I respect the Council, which has managed to mobilise people in this matter by creating the impression that something dreadful is happening here, while Parliament surely has the right to rubberstamp the text by ordinary qualified majority."
"It follows that this social dossier requires unanimity in the Council, but if we notice that certain things are going wrong, we are entitled to bare our teeth."
"The whole of my group supports Mrs Gillig's compromise amendment and it will also back the compromises and Mrs Van Lancker’s request for more precise wordings."
"I hope that this will enable us to reach agreement."
"Cross-border work is very important in my region."
"Mobility is also a topic within the framework of the Lisbon objectives."
"If we do not regulate mobility effectively, we might as well forget about the Lisbon objective."
"– Madam President, I should like to play down the Dutch problem that is before us."
"We are not in an election campaign here."
"There is a need for some sharp criticism on a number of issues, but it should be levelled in a matter-of-fact way."
"First of all, I should like to say that I wholeheartedly support Mrs Gillig's and Mrs Lambert's position to follow a clear system in this coordination regulation and the corresponding annexes, and I am in favour of dealing with the annexes in a very restrictive manner, because the sting is in the tail in this case."
"We already stated with regard to the Lambert report that whatever was removed from the regulation could be retrieved via the annexes, and that is what the improvements we have made risk doing in a number of areas."
"The third point is that, when a benefit is no longer exportable, equivalent benefits and protection should be in place in other European countries."
"The Dutch government, but also the Commission to a certain extent, can be blamed for not having checked carefully enough whether this was the case."
"Mrs Van Lancker already indicated that there is no comparable system in Belgium, and we are, of course, unable to dash such an evaluation off for the 15 Member States, let alone for the 25 Member States following enlargement."
"That is clearly an omission in the report."
"It is also the point that we should address the most firmly."
"A solution is only possible if there are bilateral compensation regulations between Member States."
"I welcome Mrs Gillig’s willingness to include a recital in the text by way of an oral amendment, which Parliament, it is to be hoped, will approve."
"The Member States should subsequently set to work, and the Commission should see to it that sound work is carried out."
"Madam President, on behalf of all my Irish colleagues I too condemn out of hand the savages who perpetrated this appalling atrocity on the citizens of Madrid this morning as they travelled to work and school."
"Commissioner Solbes and all my Spanish colleagues have my heartfelt sympathy."
"In relation to the Gillig report this morning, each year we visit the whole area of further clarification of the exportability of benefits to try to achieve the goal of free movement of more and more of our citizens in the European Union."
"This is necessary as Member States add to or change their own legislation in this area and as European Court judgments point out anomalies or clarify certain Articles."
"I accept that several entries that are currently in Annex IIa will have to be removed from it in the light of recent jurisprudence."
"On the issue of the amendment to Article 33(1), I am anxious to ensure that a Member State should not be able to levy more contributions on a pensioner who receives pensions from several Member States than if that pensioner were receiving all his pensions from just that Member State."
"I particularly welcome the addition of mobility allowance in Annex IIa under Heading G 'Ireland', that is, new point (da)."
"I have one difficulty which is not exactly related to this, but I would appreciate a response from the Commissioner as to what the Commission will do about it."
"At the moment there are different criteria in each Member State regarding eligibility for certain benefits, such as invalidity, disablement, blindness, and so on. With the permission of a constituent I shall read a couple of paragraphs recording a specific case where this is hurting:"
"'I was involved in a traffic accident in May 1988."
"As a result of the damage to my brain I have been registered as blind with the National Council for the Blind of Ireland."
"A scan showed damage to my brain, then different tests that were carried out by ophthalmologists for both hospitals and the National Council showed that permanent damage to my eyesight had occurred."
"This qualified me for the blind person's pension and to be registered for blind in Ireland."
"The problem that I – and I am sure many others like me – now face is this: my registration is accepted here in Ireland, but once I cross the border to the north, to the UK, different criteria are needed to be registered as blind, and I am led to believe that this is the case in every other European state."
"This seems to say that when you enter another European country a cure of some description happens and if I was to live in another part of Europe I would have to go through the same process again."
"If I am a cripple in Ireland, I am a cripple in Europe."
"If I am deaf in Ireland, I am deaf in Europe."
"If I am blind in Ireland, I am blind in Europe.'"
"My constituent goes on to say that it is not just a cross-border issue, but a European one."
"Commissioner, could you please tell us how quickly we will be able to resolve this issue of different eligibility criteria for different benefits?"
"Because this is causing major problems to the mobility of our citizens, particularly the disabled and the invalided, in the areas I have referred to."
"Another small issue I point out is that the word 'benefit' in English, certainly under the Irish system, means different things."
"It is 'contributory pension' in some countries."
"In other countries it just means a social welfare payment of some kind."
"We use it rather lightly here and as a result it can cause confusion."
"Madam President, on behalf of the Swedish MEPs, I wish to convey our condolences to our Spanish fellow MEPs and Commissioner Solbes Mira and to condemn the terrible deed committed in Madrid today."
"Alongside our debate on the annual changes, the modernisation of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71, which is linked to these annual changes, is also taking place."
"This means that we shall presumably have to debate this annex again in the autumn."
"It will then be called Annex X instead."
"I rather think that the Commission should have been cautious and not made any changes this year until we had completed the modernisation, in which the principles are partly changed and laid down."
"That is my personal view."
"Annex IIA is based upon certain principles governing what may be entered by the Member States."
"The Member States cannot enter whatever they think is appropriate in Annex IIA."
"The benefits concerned must not be universal ones, but require something in the way of a means test."
"Family benefits definitely do not have their place there."
"To Mr Schmidt and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I wish to point out that the Swedish child allowance is universal."
"That also applies to the supplement for families with more than one child, to study grants and to the sum guaranteed for the parental benefit."
"This means that they do not have their place in Annex IIA."
"This may be considered right or wrong, but everyone must no doubt agree that the annexes have to be based upon certain principles."
"Nor, probably, should a question mark be placed over the housing allowance for families with children, but that is the only benefit that could possibly be discussed."
"I therefore reject Mr Schmidt’s proposal."
"It is unacceptable to ignore all the principles upon which we have jointly agreed."
"Mr Schmidt says that we have such different systems – which is true – but he also says that we could live with these different systems, that they do not affect freedom of movement and that we do not need these regulations."
"On that point, I do not at all agree with him."
"We naturally need regulations governing people who move across the borders and who are to receive social benefits."
"Were we drastically to change this system by, for example, saying that no family allowances might be transferred, it would have a harmful effect upon freedom of movement."
"Madam President, please allow me firstly, as a Spaniard, to thank all the honourable Members who have expressed their solidarity."
"Allow me also to express my deepest disdain for this vermin in human form and above all affection and solidarity with the families suffering today; solidarity and affection in their pain and suffering."
"As Commissioner Solbes said, we must carry on, although it is not easy."
"We are debating the Commission’s proposal to update Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 with regard to specific benefits and non-contributory payments."
"The proposal is mainly aimed at incorporating the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, specifying the special and non-contributory nature of certain benefits, and also reflects the changes which have taken place in the different national legislations."
"I believe that the crux of the debate is whether or not to include in Annex IIa the benefits laid down in national legislations and the consequences of that inclusion in the said annex, in other words, their non-exportability or, where relevant, their exportability."
"Of the various amendments presented, I agree with Nos 1, 2 and 3, both because of the characteristics or nature of the benefits in question, or because of the conditions for receiving them, or the difficulty or impossibility of controlling them."
"Naturally, Amendments Nos 4, 5, 7 and 8, which relate to benefits whose exportable nature was mentioned a while ago, are dealing with benefits which sometimes have equivalents in the Member States, suited, furthermore, to living conditions."
"In any event, I believe this should be studied."
"I cannot agree with Amendments Nos 9 to 12; firstly because they involve family benefits in all cases."
"The general criterion of the regulation is that family benefits are exported; anything else would be discrimination, and would hinder the free movement of persons, and within the context of that free movement, would prevent families from travelling with their rucksacks of social protection on their backs."
"Finally, Madam President, I would like to draw attention to making present or future health care in certain Member States conditional upon payment of certain contributions from pensions."
"Naturally I am referring to the new paragraph 1 of Article 33 of the Regulation."
"This means that the incomes of a very significant number of pensioners would be reduced."
"In the case of Spaniards residing in other Member States, their pensions would be reduced while, if they lived in Spain, they would receive 100% of them, since health care is a right which we could describe as automatic."
"We would therefore be faced with a clear case of discrimination and hindering of the free movement of persons."
". Madam President, speaking for once as a Spaniard in this House, I would like firstly to thank everybody who has expressed solidarity with the victims of terrorism in Spain and the terrible effects the attacks have had in my country."
"As I said earlier, we must return to our work and I am going to try to respond to your concerns."
"Firstly, we must not forget that the issue we are dealing with here is the competence of the Member States: organising their own social security systems."
"It is important to stress the point raised by Mrs Doyle."
"It is a real problem."
"Nevertheless, it is also the case that there is no harmonisation of these issues at Community level."
"We can make progress by means of the coordination of national legislations undoubtedly."
"This naturally means that each Member State should adopt national legislation in agreement with the others."
"In this regard, the open coordination method can help us, but we have no one single solution."
"There may be an intermediate way – which is being worked on and on which we may make progress – mutual recognition, which would not lead to a situation of complete harmonisation, but to a situation of recognition which could allow us to solve some of the problems."
"Secondly, if we work on the basis of the fundamental fact that we are talking about decisions and competences of a national nature, it is clear that any element of coordination must be carried out according to pre-established set criteria."
"Those objective criteria are the ones we have tried to include and which I referred to earlier in my speech."
"In some cases, therefore, we accept some of the solutions you propose and in relation to others we believe that the solutions you suggest do not resolve all the problems."
"With regard to the issue we are talking about, the fundamental idea is based on special advantages based on the principle of residence."
"In some cases, therefore, the intention is that, if residence is changed, the advantages of one country be replaced by the advantages of another."
"Those advantages depend on objective conditions, in accordance with the characteristics and the social security systems defined in each country."
"I appreciate that in some specific cases this may mean of loss of relative advantages in comparison with the country of origin, which reflects the existing differences between the nationals of the different States of the Union."
"I therefore believe that there is no gap in the legislation, there is coherence throughout the system, which does not imply that no specific problems will arise or that we will not have to try to resolve them."
"In my opinion, the situation is that the margin here is much more evident at national level than at Community level."
"In this regard, the best system for moving forward would be the adoption of national actions allowing this type of problem to be corrected or bilateral agreements between countries which allow some of these difficulties to be resolved."
"Otherwise, clearly, at Community level, we can apply harmonisation where possible – in many of these cases it is not – we can make progress on coordination by means of the open coordination method, we can make progress on the issue of mutual recognition in order to prevent these problems with the free movement of persons which many of you have mentioned."
"This is the basis we are working on and we will continue to do so in the future."
"– The debate is closed.The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0098/2004) by Mrs Jöns, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on Health care and care for the elderly"
". – Mr President, I too wish to join with the previous speakers in expressing my deepest sympathy with the people of Spain, the victims, and their families."
"Difficult though it is to pass on to the agenda, our topic is ‘health care and care for the elderly’, and it is a very important one."
"In all probability, this report will receive very broad support in the House today – the result of excellent cooperation between Members belonging to all the political groupings, for which I would like to extend the warmest of thanks to all of them, but especially to Mr Mantovani."
"I might add that my report follows on from his own, which he presented a year ago, and the things we called for then are every bit as relevant today as they were at the time; indeed, the problems have become even more pressing."
"Let me only cite the length of time people have to wait for treatment, the worsening staffing bottlenecks and the alarming reports of conditions in care homes, some of which are degrading."
"Governments, too, have now realised how important it actually is to organise a structured exchange of information both in the health sector and in the sphere of care for the elderly."
"Whilst the results of the high-level reflection process speak for themselves, we now have no more time to lose, and so we strongly urge the European Council to adopt at last the principle of application of the open coordination method and a detailed timetable."
"The common objectives and indicators should be agreed by early 2006."
"After all, the Convention did, in its draft treaty, specify open coordination for health policy – with, of course, this House participating as it should."
"If the Member States want to guarantee the future accessibility, quality and financial viability of health systems and care for the elderly, then what is needed most of all is more prevention and transparency."
"At both European and national levels, prevention and health promotion must receive the same attention as curative medicine."
"If they do not, we really will soon be unable to cope with the growing burden of patients."
"Transparency, though, is an indispensable requirement if quality is to be maintained and if the best possible use is to be made of the resources that health systems possess."
"Far more than has formerly been the case, the quality of medical services must be demonstrable."
"We must no longer spend a lot of money and get poor quality in return."
"Patients’ organisations have a very important part to play in this, and must, in future, be more involved in all decisions on matters of health policy."
"All Member States should also adopt a patients’ law or patients’ charter, but, in order to secure greater legal security for people who become ill and have to be treated abroad, we also need common European standards for patients’ rights."
"It would indeed be a major breakthrough if a European patients’ charter were to be adopted, and so we urge the Commission and the Member States to devise shared criteria for one."
"A large number of questions, though, still remain open after the European Court of Justice’s rulings on the reimbursement of treatment costs incurred in another Member State, and so what we expect from the Commission is proposals, not only as to how patients can have greater legal certainty, but also as to how the national health services can be protected from the potentially adverse effects of the internal market rules."
"The effects of European rules should be monitored by a standing committee of experts, which would submit reports on a regular basis."
"The fact is that health is not an economic commodity; our health services are founded on solidarity, and that must be defended."
"All the Member States also face major challenges as regards long-term care and care for the elderly."
"We should join together in seeking strategies for integrating health provision and care more effectively with each other, for better care at home and for the provision of sufficient care homes."
"There is also a need for clear standards of care, not only in people’s own homes but also in institutions, and, above all, for regular and independent quality controls."
"There is, then, much to be done if our European model of a health policy founded upon solidarity is to be maintained in the long term."
". Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Jöns and her colleagues for the excellent report they have presented to us containing a significant number of proposals and recommendations which deserve the Commission's full attention."
"Mrs Jöns, we particularly value your report’s support for the application of the open coordination method in order to improve health care for the elderly in the countries of the Union."
"The Commission intends shortly to adopt a communication with a proposal to apply this open coordination method in relation to health care issues."
"We will base this on previous experience because we believe it is essential to provide assistance in this area, which is key both in order to confront the problems of demographic ageing in our countries and in order to maintain high and appropriate levels of social protection."
"The first condition for implementing this open coordination method is that the Member States adopt a series of common objectives which allow us to establish a useful framework for the process of reforming issues relating to health."
"In accordance with the conclusions of the joint report presented last year to the spring European Council, we will focus on three areas: health care, accessibility and quality and financial viability."
"We will also have to consider the second aspect which you have referred to: monitoring."
"Monitoring which must be carried out by means of appropriate comparable indicators."
"Without such indicators it is very difficult to assess the application of the different measures by the different Member States and to see whether this learning process, which we are undergoing jointly, is achieving the intended objectives."
"We are also going to produce detailed working proposals up until 2006, when we hope to begin a new simplified process for coordinating policies which deals with health care, pensions and social inclusion."
"If we want to establish this working plan, it is essential to exploit synergies, the inter-relationships in the current public health strategy and the Community action plan which is linked to it."
"In order to achieve the best results, it is essential that indicators receive strong support from this working programme."
"Otherwise we will not have the necessary references to understand the situation of each country."
"We hope that the Council will debate the Commission's proposals during this year and we believe that, in this regard, the report you are presenting to us today is extremely timely and useful, and will make a fundamental contribution to this debate."
"The Commission has also carefully examined the conclusions of the process of high-level reflection on the mobility of patients and will shortly present a communication on its monitoring."
"Your report, Mrs Jöns, deals with a wide range of issues relating to social protection, public health, the free movement of people and services within the internal market."
"They are all important instruments for defining a global policy within the framework of our internal market competences in relation to free movement within the public health programme and the open coordination method applied to these issues."
"The Commission must pay special attention to these different instruments so that they are coherent and consistent amongst themselves."
"The fact that they are all of differing legal natures does not mean that we do not have to maintain complete consistency between all of them and the Commission will spare no effort in order to progress in this direction."
"We will always remember – and this is an essential point – that primary responsibility on these issues falls to the Member States, particularly in relation to health and care for the chronically ill."
"Our work on the specific points is to support the work carried out by our Member States as much as possible."
"Thank you very much for your contributions, which will undoubtedly be extremely useful to the Commission."
"Mr President, on behalf of Mr Mantovani too, I would like to thank the rapporteur Mrs Jöns for her superb work and for the excellent cooperation she has demonstrated on this sensitive issue, which is more of a priority than ever before."
"As shadow rapporteur for our group, Mr Mantovani – who as long ago as January 2003 was the author of the report that opened the debate in the European Parliament on the future of health systems and care for the elderly – has confirmed the key importance of the fundamental challenges concerning, in particular, provision, quality, content and cover in the field of health care expenditure in Europe."
"As the Commissioner has also confirmed, the ageing of the population, progress in medicine, greater life expectancy and the increasing demand for health services, linked with unprecedented mobility and information, together contribute to a substantial widespread increase in the costs of the health system, which at times has proven to be unsustainable for the current economic climate and above all for public administrations."
"According to figures contained in the European Commission’s latest report on the health situation, the number of elderly people over the age of 75 will rise to 27% by 2010."
"In the next 15 years, the number of the very elderly, that is, over the age of 80, will increase by almost 50%."
"At the same time, in this context the level of dependence of the elderly is also set to increase."
"Changes in the over 80-year olds age group will be greater and quicker than those in any other age group."
"This trend will also generally hold true for the ten new countries that will soon join the current Member States."
"Indeed, with the exception of Poland, the Slovak Republic and Cyprus – where the active population continues to grow, even if somewhat slowly – the ageing of the population in all of the other countries is a phenomenon that has already taken root and is tending to increase."
"A lot will depend on the effectiveness of the strategies implemented in the health area and on the political choices made at European, national and local level."
"Changes in this area are not only necessary but also more of a priority than ever before."
"Even though the provision of health care and care in general currently remains essentially the competence of the Member States, we realise that a similar trend with significant and complex implications cannot be dealt with effectively and thoroughly at national level alone."
"In January 2003, when the Mantovani report on health systems in Europe was adopted, there was broad consensus in this Parliament in favour of developing Community cooperation to improve health systems, which, in my opinion, is the only way to deal with the ageing of the population in particular."
"This trend means that European society must adapt and citizens must change their behaviour and habits."
"In the decisions of the Court of Justice, these various issues – which concern different policies that compete both on an international and a national level for total subsidiarity, and I am thinking of patient mobility, the completion of the internal market and consumer policy – must be considered to be increasingly crucial and there must be a new context within which European cooperation is stepped up in order to be able to achieve tangible results as soon as possible."
"There is a requirement for more extensive cooperation and for common standards to be drawn up in terms of quality and quantity."
"The European Union’s objective, set at Lisbon four years ago, was to become the most competitive economy in the world by 2010."
"Today, attaining this objective has become particularly difficult as a result of low growth and the unfavourable economic climate and will therefore not be attained unless we approach it seriously and in the same way as the other challenges that await us."
"– Mr President, much is being said about how older people will, in future, have to work for longer and about their special significance in terms of the economy, but far too little about how, with advancing years, they need more help and more social and health care."
"The way in which we respond to older people’s needs and fears is also a cultural issue."
"In care homes, human dignity and the right to personal freedom are of the utmost importance."
"There is a desire to live and to strive to live innate in every person, and this mental elemental force must be cultivated."
"It is, above all, strength of will that makes life significantly easier for old people themselves and also for those who care for them."
"That is why it is so important that training in all health care professions – from carer to physician – should be developed."
"Psychological knowledge, empathy and sensitivity are even more difficult to acquire, understand and develop than professional expertise and practical skills."
"It is not only training, though, that must take greater account of increased life expectancy."
"Research, too, must commit itself more to gerontology and to the support of programmes in palliative medical care and develop its own Europe-wide networks."
"More research, and hence greater safety, is needed to better underpin preventive measures."
"Only if there is interaction between these two will we have a guarantee of being able to keep an eye on costs in health care."
"In presenting us with the issues and problems of ageing, this own-initiative report highlights one of the major social issues for Europe and calls us to ongoing work on health policy."
"I would like to express the very high regard I have for the rapporteur and for her work."
"Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report."
"Our health is, quite rightly, the responsibility of the Member States and I would not like to see a change in that practice."
"I would like to see more exchange of best practice at European level."
"I am delighted that all but one of my amendments were accepted in committee, but I would like to point out that the text in recital K is not quite correct."
"My amendment talked about long-term care, not long-term intensive care."
"I have taken it up with the services and they said that the mistake could be rectified at plenary."
"I hope that is going to be the case, because long-term care is not the same as long-term intensive care."
"I still think there is a problem in the last sentence, but I am sure the services can also rectify that."
"I was particularly pleased also that my amendment regarding the use of cage beds in psychiatric institutions and social care homes was passed, and that it was recognised that this was in contravention of all international standards regarding the care of people with mental health problems and/or intellectual disabilities."
"Let us hope now that this practice can be discontinued completely, across the EU and in the accession countries."
"There has been improvement since the Mental Disability Advocacy Centre report on this subject last year."
"Another of my amendments that was accepted – which I was pleased about –concerned the need to undertake more research projects at European level on various conditions that affect European citizens and, perhaps more importantly, for any information to be disseminated across the European Union."
"I hope the Commission might now look at the possibility of helping in that exchange of information, especially if the research has been funded by the EU, in fields such as age-related macular degeneration, for instance, which is the main cause of loss of sight in the elderly in the EU."
"There is much good work taking place, but no clear system set up to exchange research information."
"I have talked to the Commission already about the possibility of publishing results on the Internet, but I am sure the Commission could come up with some other ideas."
"I have only touched on a couple of issues of concern to me because of time constraints;"
"Mrs Jöns' report has gone into many other areas."
"On behalf of the ELDR Group, I congratulate her on her work and commend the report to the House."
"Thank you, Mrs Lynne."
"I am sure that the corrections that you asked for will certainly be made by the services."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, I wish firstly to say that, in our view, Mrs Jöns’ report is constructive in many ways."
"Above all, we welcome the way in which it makes it clear that health care must be provided close to the patients in their local environments, because family, friends and colleagues mean such a lot in terms of rehabilitation and the quality of care."
"Right now, it seems, however, as if the trend is in completely the opposite direction."
"Health care is to be part of the internal market."
"This very day, as we are having this debate, the Competition Council is sitting and discussing matters in Brussels, where Mr Bolkestein will propose a radical step towards the commercialisation of care, and other, services."
"The basic principle is to be that every producer who is an approved operator in one Member State must freely be able to establish operations in any other Member State."
"This will quickly break down the public health care systems and prepare the way for extensive privatisation."
"Instead of care provided close to patients in local environments, we shall have large multinational health care companies, medicine-producing industrial groups and health insurance companies as the large and powerful actors in a market where it is large-scale production and the profit motive that govern activities."
"I have even read a report dealing with the way in which the sick, or what are termed mobile patients, are to be moved around in this large market."
"These developments are a threat to patients’ rights, and we in the European Parliament must do all we can to stop them."
"We must get the Commission to stop and give us more time for responsible debate."
"There are many services that can operate very well in the internal market, but there are also services – and health care is one such – that are of a different character and are not at all suited to market principles."
"Cross-border cooperation is required when it comes to health care services too."
"This can and should, however, be developed between Member States and border regions on the basis of more practical needs instead of in accordance with the abstract principle of the organisation of the internal market."
"If the Commission successfully carries out its offensive in terms of subjecting what were previously public services to the principles of the internal market, popular resistance to the EU project will, in general, rise to unguessed-at levels."
"Where Mrs Jöns’ report is concerned, the House must reject paragraph 23, which is about health care being subject to the principles of the internal market."
"If it does not reject it, at least the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left will not be able to vote in favour of the report in the final vote."
"– Mr President, I should like to join in the condolences to the friends and relatives of the victims, the Spanish people, the Spanish government and the Spanish members of this House, and I deeply regret this brutal attack on democracy."
"Last week, I was astonished at the statements by the Belgian Prime Minister, Mr Verhofstadt, who stated that families need to be given more financial incentives to care for their elderly parents at home."
"According to him, this idea should be the topic of a national debate in Belgium."
"Most of the time, I like the idea of national debates, but in this case, the question arises whether the need for this debate is not simply as a result of the embarrassment with the issue of growing older."
"By means of fine policy proposals and election rhetoric, we try to address the problems of the elderly in health care."
"That, however, cannot conceal the fact that we are at a loss when it comes to this issue."
"After all, we ourselves hope to grow old in good health and not to have to rely on care for as long as possible, but we have no control over this."
"I can remember that we discussed Mr Mantovani's report here last year, on 14 January to be precise."
"I then expressly stated that the discussion on care of the elderly and health care must not be bogged down in good intentions."
"It has to pay off for those who work in that sector."
"Sharing working practices and treatment methods should lead to an improvement in care."
"In addition, it must be made clear that health care and care of the elderly should not be considered from the perspective of economic costs alone."
"The elderly and patients are more than a debit entry."
"That is why I endorse the amendment tabled by Mrs Lambert about the change to paragraph 23."
"The purpose of the internal market is not to attain financial gain on the back of the distress of patients."
"Equal access to care in all Member States is desirable, but mobility of patients does not appear desirable to me on account of the costs involved."
"In my view, paragraph 37 should not be deleted."
"Indeed, I can identify well with the conclusion that the rules of the internal market impact not only positively on health care."
"I should like to return briefly to the statements by Mr Verhofstadt."
"Things can get worse still."
"In my country, a television station recently presented a docu-drama on the reception of poor Dutch elderly people in an African country where the care is more efficient because wages in the care sector are lower."
"Many viewers did not notice until later on that this programme was played by actors and the minister was even getting prepared for questions in parliament – but the fact that it was only fiction does not remove the impression that there is little room, if any, for voluntary care of family relations."
"Both the fine policy intentions and mocking satire are trying to give us a message."
"This is food for thought."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Jöns, ladies and gentlemen, with the 14 January report on services of general interest, we made it very clear that social and health policy issues are issues of general interest."
"The internal market is not the only starting point for today’s debate."
"Demographic changes, affecting the whole of Europe and our entire continent, represent the greatest challenge to our policies – be they on the labour market, the economy, social affairs, health, or the Budget."
"If we want to build up the internal market, create mobility and flexibility as well as social security, whilst at the same time facing up together to the great challenges to our policies on civil society, we will not be able to reduce them to a matter of national borders."
"In my capacity as President of the Austrian Aid Organisation, I face these challenges on a daily basis."
"What we have to do, I believe, is to review the public sector’s effectively statutory functions and the consequent transfer of public tasks carried out by the non-statutory sector to private non-profit service providers at national, regional and local level."
"The person being cared for must have a choice in where they stay and are cared for if they are to enjoy the right to self-determination."
"Even when they are in need of care, most people want to stay in their own homes."
"They can often be better looked after by mobile care services, which adjust more flexibly to the patient’s actual needs, and this also represents a much more economic use of the resources available."
"What this requires, though, is firstly that the quality of the care service be regulated not merely at the national level, but also across borders, with as much standardisation as possible, and at least in a coordinated way; that the training of care workers be organised as far as possible to a national standard and coordinated throughout Europe; that service providers be assessed in a transparent and objective way; and that funding be secured by way of long-term contracts."
"Mobile services and the ancillary services on which they depend need to be upgraded and extended."
"They need to be integrated, with better management of the interface between nursing homes and the mobile services, and the promotion of an overarching and patient-oriented case management Let me conclude by saying that there is a need for more resources within reach of family members and more support and assistance for them; both the state and Europe must create the regulatory environment that is needed if that is to happen."
"Mr President, I should like to echo the many compliments that have been addressed to the rapporteur."
"She has compiled an excellent report, with a pertinent appeal for more European cooperation in health care and care of the elderly."
"This cooperation should not be restricted to public health, the quantitative and preventive aspects, but should also pertain to the cost-conscious and effective handling of provisions and the reinforcement of the financial basis for the health costs and the costs resulting from an ageing population."
"The Directorate-General for social affairs and employment should play an active role in this."
"I have mainly focused on the aspects of financing and supporting the national care systems, and have tabled a number of amendments to that effect which relate to the internal market, an amendment to paragraph 37 which, to my disappointment, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats wishes to delete."
"Decisions by the Court of Justice about the internal market already affect the national health systems."
"The funding of care is no longer a purely national matter."
"Many fellow MEPs from different Member States fail to understand why I make this into such an important issue."
"They continue to stress that health care must be protected from the market forces, that it is of general interest and, consequently, it has nothing to do with the rules on competition and free movement."
"I would like to say to them – and to Mr Herman Schmid in particular – that this has not been the case for a long time."
"We cannot be blind to private commercial parties within the health market operating according to free-market logistics."
"That is why we must provide a solid counterweight against market forces."
"In the Netherlands, there is currently a discussion about the review of the public health cost system, in respect of which it is planned to hand this over completely to private health cost insurers."
"I see this as a risky strategy as long as there is no framework provided for it."
"I have nothing against private insurance companies, as Mr Karas can attest, but the government should be able to put sufficient conditions in place."
"It should not be possible, for example, for sick people to be turned down, for people with a high health risk to have to pay a higher premium, or for insurance cover to be more expensive for women because they can fall pregnant."
"The Dutch Cabinet takes little account of the fact that the European agreements about the internal market could thwart its plans."
"If, in due course, insurance companies feel too restricted by the government, they can head to the European Court and refer to the European rules."
"This will be at the expense of the weakest groups. The national governments will then blame Europe."
"I should like to prevent that from happening and that is why we must try to achieve better coordination at European level."
"One last remark: I am pleased with Mr Solbes' announcement that a progress report will soon follow for the high-level reflection process."
"I am really looking forward to this."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to begin by congratulating my fellow MEP, Mrs Jöns, on the value of her work and the quality of her report."
"It is a very comprehensive report."
"Her description of the situation, of the problems and of what is at stake is particularly exhaustive, and the rapporteur’s analyses are completely relevant."
"We are very pleased, particularly with the fact that the report calls upon the Member States to do away with inequalities in the area of health, especially those linked to socio-economic factors, gender or age."
"We support the criticism that patients have to bear an ever greater portion of the cost of health care, which penalises people on low incomes."
"We support the call for a detailed charter of patients’ rights, designed to bring about a high-quality health system in the short, medium and long term, based on solidarity."
"Like the rapporteur, we request special measures for the new Member States which, for the most part, experience situations more critical than those in the Fifteen."
"Finally, I am, like the members of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, hostile to any further privatisation of health care."
"As far as I am concerned, I wish, by way of summary, to say some very simple things."
"Where health is concerned, it is perhaps necessary, in a number of sectors, to spend better by spending differently. That is something I do not deny."
"If, however, the desire is to treat and cure serious illnesses that are rapidly becoming more widespread, particularly cancer; to deal much better too with rare, orphan diseases, as they are termed; to confront the needs arising from the ageing of our societies’ populations; to provide better psychological and human support to patients; and to be better at developing all public research, including research into surplus embryonic stem cells, which raises new hopes, particularly in connection with illnesses linked to ageing; then, yes, if the desire is to attain all these objectives, more budgetary resources are needed."
"It is a need no doubt opposed to other state and European priorities and, above all, to the rigour of the monetary stability criteria."
"Finally, I would draw attention to the fact that the poor in our societies, who are too often excluded from care, must never be forgotten. Nor must we forget the poor countries of the world, which do not even have the minimum of health care and whose people, as a consequence, have much shorter life expectancies than ourselves."
"I shall conclude with a saying that, familiar though its sentiments undoubtedly are, needs constantly to be recalled if it is to be put into practice."
"If I remember rightly, it is to the effect that quality, not length, of life is what really matters in the end."
"Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur."
"This report on health care and care for the elderly is timely."
"According to the 2001 census, 18.61% of the population in Scotland are over pension age and, even more interesting, 19.54% – almost 20% – of carers are over pension age."
"The ageing population presents us with huge challenges, not just in Scotland but across the whole EU."
"That is why sharing best practice between countries throughout the EU is so vital."
"We need to look at simple solutions focused on individual persons."
"Older adults can often have multiple medical problems."
"That is why a holistic approach, involving a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, speech and language therapists, dieticians and social workers, along with the person's family, is so important."
"Although more doctors are being trained in geriatric care, which is a growing area of interest, there still needs to be more investment in this expanding specialism."
"For the older person, there are other issues to consider."
"It is a popular misbelief that a large percentage of older adults live in some form of care home."
"In fact, a large proportion of older adults live independently, with family or social support."
"My great aunt Agnes, at 91 years of age, is one of them."
"Sometimes when an older patient is ill and recovering in hospital what is important to them is to be able to return home and cope at home."
"For some older patients this can be more important than the treatment of their medical condition itself."
"With people living longer, and an increasing proportion of the population over 65, it is also interesting that a lot of medical trials do not include elderly patients, although this matter is beginning to be addressed."
"We have a responsibility to the older population within the EU."
"After all, one day we too will be part of the older population, since none of us is getting any younger."
"– Mr President, the increase in life expectancy that has arisen as a result of the scientific and social breakthroughs of the twentieth century must not now be considered a burden on society in the twenty-first."
"Elderly people have the right to live in dignity, to have access to health care and other forms of care, irrespective of their social or financial situation."
"This is being called into question in a number of countries, such as mine, Portugal, because of a neo-liberalism that is trying to impose itself in a wide variety of areas, including health, by prioritising competition and competitiveness, thus jeopardising quality public services and showing no respect for people or their rights."
"The fact that the majority of the elderly in the European Union are women – over 63% of people aged between 75 and 84, and 72% of those over 85 are women – means that they in particular will be the ones most affected by problems in health care systems and long-term care, either as carers themselves or as people in receipt of care."
"The persistence of inequalities in women’s wages and retirement makes them especially vulnerable to the consequences of dismantling public health services and to the shortage of care for the elderly."
"It should be noted that women form the majority of the 55 million people at risk of poverty in the current 15-Member European Union and of the many millions in the enlargement countries."
"That is why we are so strongly critical of the fact that the Member States are increasing the proportion of health costs to be borne by patients, both for prevention and for treatments, drugs, and palliative or other care."
"This situation is jeopardising the principle of solidarity in health systems and contributing to the growth in social exclusion of the less favoured groups in society, who are finding it increasingly difficult to access appropriate, high-quality health care."
"Therefore, although I believe the report has its positive aspects, I cannot agree with the insistence on creating an internal market in health services and products, since this will only benefit private organisations, particularly insurance companies, and jeopardise a high-quality, universal public service."
"What is needed is greater public investment in facilities and equipment and in the training of the technical and specialist workers needed, better provision of quality care and assistance for the elderly, specifically in the health services, and the setting-up of home care services, ensuring that all citizens have access to these services in all the countries of the European Union."
"Hence the proposals that we tabled."
"What is also needed is greater participation by user organisations, the health and care services themselves and their workers in the preparation and implementation of measures, so as to ensure greater democracy in the operation of these services, which must be quality services."
"Mr President, this is an important report on an important subject and I congratulate the rapporteur on her usual thoroughness and commitment."
"The title is significant: 'Health care and care for the elderly: Supporting national strategies for ensuring a high level of social protection'."
"We should all want to see a high level of social protection and learn from each other via the exchange of best practice at European level but, ultimately, it is national strategies that have to deliver."
"Certainly, in the United Kingdom, there is still much to do."
"Two weeks ago, Age Concern England held an important debate in London called 'Creating opportunity – is Europe working for older people?'."
"It was a privilege to be on the panel together with three other colleagues from this House."
"We agreed about many things, particularly the need to move such issues sharply up the agenda."
"We like to think of the United Kingdom as a rich country, but one in five pensioners are in low-income households; the incomes of those over 75 are lower still."
"Women pensioners are the worst off of all; fully 25% of women pensioners in the United Kingdom today live in poverty."
"Their healthcare needs are proportionately greater and therefore need addressing with greater urgency."
"As the number of elderly people grows, the requirement for good healthcare and care services grows also."
"I was told recently that in the United Kingdom there are some 40 000 fewer places available in care homes today than ten years ago."
"If this is true, it is not a statistic of which any country can be proud."
"It is a reminder in each of our countries that excessive regulation, which may well have been intended to provide greater social protection, can often destroy what it wishes to promote."
"This is a lesson for our committee on other dossiers too."
"Finally, may I record a brief message to Commissioner Diamantopoulou, whose successor has just been announced by the Greek Government."
"The role of Employment and Social Affairs Commissioner can never be easy, especially when it involves dealing with such difficult United Kingdom MEPs as Mr Hughes and myself."
"I believe she has left without having to declare who has been the more difficult, but I am sure that both of us, and hopefully all of us in the committee and this House, would wish her well in her new life back home."
"If colleagues agree, I would like to ask Commissioner Solbes to pass that message on."
"Mr President, it is generally assumed that all EU care systems are based on the principles of solidarity, justice and universality."
"These entail that every person, in the case of illness or need for care, is entitled to the appropriate high-quality care without any distinction according to income, means or age."
"The European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights, which was compiled in 2000 and is to form part of the European Constitution, guarantees for the elderly a dignified and independent life and for each person the right to access to health care and medical treatment."
"Moreover, the draft constitution provides for the pursuit of a high level of social protection."
"Everyone can therefore rest assured, because on paper, everything is regulated down to the last detail."
"However, in practice, economies of scale mean that there are increasing complaints about the unacceptably long travelling distances between home and hospital, about waiting lists for hospital admission, about a shortage of accommodation for the elderly who need care, a shortage of medical and care staff, a reduction in medicines available and the need to go abroad."
"For some people, the shortage of care leads to premature death and for others, it leads to such a poor quality of life that they choose to die by means of voluntary euthanasia long before they have reached the natural stage of dying."
"Needless to say, there are all kinds of excuses for these wrongs."
"On average, people tend to live longer, they have fewer children than before, and those children – men and women – are completely absorbed by the ever more binding obligation to work."
"Help from neighbours and children is less and less available."
"In those circumstances, it is irresponsible to reduce taxes and premiums on the basis of the argument that we need less."
"Since this is done anyway, there is ever more public doubt as to the affordability of health care, care for the elderly and pensions in an ageing society."
"Additionally, staff for care tasks are increasingly scarce, since, in times of economic growth, those people are drained away to production sectors that are, for a time more profitable and offer a higher salary."
"As soon as they lose their jobs as a result of an economic crisis, they are not suitably trained to be able to deal with care tasks effectively."
"The drain of personnel from countries with a lower standard of living exacerbates the problems over there."
"In one candidate Member State, Romania, a large proportion of the population is now no longer insured, so they rely on the goodwill of doctors."
"If insurance cover and care tasks are entrusted to private companies that claim to make a profit despite charging less, then accessibility, quality and equal treatment are further eroded."
"The European Union should discourage this development rather than encourage it."
"If we want to realise all the fine intentions that have been made on paper, a collective approach will be needed on a larger scale than is possible the basis of voluntary work by family members."
"In that case, the necessary funding should also be made available, which means that a larger proportion of our national income should be spent on public services in the care sector."
"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur."
"We live in a world undergoing a process of ageing."
"At first glance, this sentence may seem negative, but it also has a positive side, which is that people’s lives are getting longer."
"Both aspects should be considered objectively."
"Naturally, the right of elderly people to lead a life of dignity and independence and to participate in social and cultural life is objective, and is provided for in Article 25 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union."
"Incidentally, this article falls within the framework of the second chapter, entitled ‘Equality’ – perhaps as an extension or a specification of the principle of equality: ‘Everyone is equal before the law’, as stated in Article 20 and, at the same time, of the prohibition of all discrimination, including discrimination on the grounds of age, as stated in Article 21 – and not within the fourth chapter of the Charter, entitled ‘Solidarity’, as one would logically assume, though this fourth chapter does include the right to preventive health care and to benefit from medical treatment under the conditions established by national legislations and practices."
"Naturally, the three great objectives we need to achieve are: universal accessibility regardless of the economic situation of each person, high-quality health care and the long-term sustainability of health care systems."
"In a Europe whose principles and objectives include the free movement of persons, national strategies must include promoting modernisation and coordination, both in order to prevent any possible social exclusion, and in order to promote our going back to a society of experience, wisdom and knowledge of the elderly."
"Worthy of additional consideration are very old people, as a sector of this demographic group is described the report; since their care is going to require a large workforce, it is going to be a source of employment which, in any event, is going to require the professionals of this sector, the services, training and specialist care sector."
"I would like to end by talking about the need to become aware of the problems."
"Increasing awareness within society as a whole often prevents problems from arising in the future."
"A typical example of this is the rules on building or the removal of architectural boundaries."
". Mr President, I would firstly like to thank all the speakers for their contributions to this debate."
"I believe that issues of enormous interest have been raised, which we will try to consider as far as possible."
"I would like to make just two comments."
"Firstly, the use of the open coordination method is going to provide us with a new dynamic in relation to the specific field of health."
"Naturally, the diffusion of best practices will allow for greater efficiency, which will undoubtedly benefit both national health systems and users and service providers."
"This use of the open coordination method will also allow us to enhance the social policy aspects of the Lisbon strategy."
"Secondly, I have noted the concern amongst certain speakers about the inter-relationship between the internal market and health."
"Nevertheless, I believe there is a broad consensus on the three fundamental objectives: accessibility, quality and sustainability."
"This demonstrates that the approach does not focus solely and exclusively on the internal market, but that the provision of adequate health services is also fundamental."
"This is also reflected in the communication initially adopted by the Commission, which, as well as insisting on the need to make progress on the internal market, also stresses the need for appropriate provision of services for all patients and, naturally, the public funding necessary for these services to be provided."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"– Mr President, even though we are all reeling from the terrorist act in Spain, there is a matter on which I would ask you to provide the Members of this House with full information."
"According to reports in the media, there have been irregularities and instances of fraud in connection with the registers."
"In order that this should not reflect on all the Members of this House who sign themselves in properly on a regular basis, I ask the Bureau to conduct a full investigation of this – and also of the individual cases – and to inform all Members as to what is going on."
"In the run-up to the elections, it would be a worst-case scenario if – as is now being asserted in the media – individual Members of this House were to be found regularly misusing the registers as a means of pocketing money to which they were not entitled."
"I would ask that these things be investigated fully and that we should all be given full and honest information."
"I do not want to have a debate on this."
"However, let me reassure the House that we have asked the Quaestors to carry out a full enquiry."
"Their findings will be open, transparent and everyone will know the results of the enquiry."
"At the moment we have no evidence to back up what has been claimed in the German press."
"– Mr President, the only thing I wanted to say in response to that is that the Conference of Presidents, which met this morning, is already discussing this topic and that there is to be an official statement by Parliament."
"We have to put a stop to the way in which rumours are constantly undermining the hard work done in this House."
"Let us have the names out in the open."
"If we have the names, we must also take action against the persons concerned."
"You are absolutely right, Mr Karas."
"That is why I do not want to have a debate this morning."
"It is all just rumour and scaremongering."
"– Mr President, you have announced that these goings-on will be investigated."
"I would also ask that this investigation should consider the claim by German magazine journalists that they have in their possession all the lists of the secretarial assistance allowances paid by the House in 2002."
"I would like to know how lists relating to the 2002 secretarial assistance allowances can end up in the hands of journalists and what conclusions you draw from this."
"I will not draw any conclusions at the moment."
"There will be a full enquiry."
"The next item is the vote."
"I know that Mrs Read does not intend to stand for re-election to this House."
"She has produced many reports over the last 15 years on topics related to this."
"I should like to thank her, on behalf of the House, for all the work she has done."
"Mr President, I would like to propose an oral amendment to Amendment No 22 to include the words 'in addition to the North Sea and the Irish Sea'."
"I have spoken to Mr Bradbourn, the rapporteur, and he can accept this amendment if the House accepts it."
"I should like to welcome to the official gallery a delegation from Uzbekistan, who have been taking part in the first meeting of the Uzbekistan Joint Parliamentary Committee in Strasbourg."
"The delegation is chaired by Mr Erkin Vakhidov."
"We are very pleased to welcome you here."
"We now continue with the vote."
"Mr President, this report has been the subject of negotiations right up to the last minute, and I should therefore be grateful if you would take account of this proposal for an oral amendment which, in the form in which I shall read it to you, should perhaps facilitate the adoption of the report at first reading."
"I shall read the amendment to you, and I shall call upon you to go on to ask the representative of the Commission what the latter’s position will be on this proposal."
"Here is the wording of the amendment as it has finally been negotiated: ‘Whereas the Commission could call upon those Member States in respect of which various insured persons are in danger of being prejudiced to come up with bilateral solutions and to suggest a transition period’.This amendment could be added as a recital."
". Mr President, the Commission is in agreement with the oral amendment proposed."
"Mr President, an oral amendment will be tabled on this."
"It was submitted to Parliament’s services yesterday, and it is also included in the voting list."
"Mr President, we approved an amendment by the Group of the Party of European Socialists outside of the text."
"What Mrs Gillig is doing here with the help of her friends is unacceptable."
"We tabled the amendment last night, we had reached a compromise among ourselves, and now I notice that Mrs Gillig is taking the floor."
"I am sorry, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten."
"The Rules of Procedure are very clear: if 32 or more Members object to an oral amendment, then it cannot be accepted."
"(1)"
"Mr President, we are going to vote on a resolution in paragraph 4 of which we state our support for and solidarity with the victims of terrorism and their families."
"By a fatal and terrible coincidence, on the very day on which we are calling for a European Day to commemorate these victims, the murderous terrorist group ETA has caused the condemnable massacre of more than 138 people and hundreds of injured at various points in Madrid."
"In my capacity as chairman of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and also on behalf of the spokesmen of the groups who have offered me their support, I would like to table an oral amendment to paragraph 4 of this resolution referring to the date of the European Day, changing it from 11 September to 11 March."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall of course begin by offering my condolences to the Spanish people and in particular to all the Members from Spain, and assuring them of my solidarity."
"In this matter of approving a date for the European day commemorating the victims of terrorism, we must bear in mind the fact that it will have to be a date that the European Union can later uphold to be a world day or an international day, which is the purpose of the paragraph."
"I must say that I support this proposal because, when he opened this sitting at 10 o’clock this morning, the President of our European Parliament, Mr Pat Cox, set an example to those of us who were here and able to pay our respects and gave us our cue in this matter."
"He clearly stated that this is not just an attack on the people of Spain."
"It is an attack in the middle of an electoral process; it is a direct attack on democracy and freedom."
"It is also the first attack of this magnitude on a European Union country."
"I therefore believe that nobody would understand it if – since, by sheer coincidence, we have to vote on this today – we did not choose 11 March to pay our respects to present and future victims, and also past ones, by choosing a European day."
"I suggest that we accept Mr Hernández Mollar's oral amendment."
"Mr President, I believe that reflecting for a moment on an issue of such importance will do no harm."
"Despite all our genuine and heartfelt sympathy for the tragedy that has happened, in dedicating a day to terrorism and to the victims of terrorism, it is one thing to explicitly link the date of 11 March to that of 11 September, but it is another thing entirely to replace 11 September with the date 11 March. This seems a rather unwise decision, also in terms of the attempt to make it a world day."
"The events of 11 September led to a universal political outcry across the world, and I feel it would be dangerous to today replace this date and track the current terrorist situation: this could be a rather unwise gesture."
"I do not know if we can defer this decision or if we can symbolically add the date 11 March to 11 September. Replacing the latter, though, seems to me to be a dangerous choice."
"I respect the way in which you have put your case."
"Obviously emotions are running very high today."
"The last thing I want is for the dignity of this House to be sullied in any way by a debate on dates, when so many people are facing such massive losses today."
"I do not want to have a full-scale debate on this."
"Mr President, I have suggested that the groups do not take the floor."
"I believe this suggestion makes sense."
"We can reflect and work on it later on."
"This is the worst terrorist attack in the European Union to date."
"We have plenty of time."
"Today we are simply making a suggestion and a gesture which I believe to be appropriate."
"Please let us vote on the amendment and let us not turn something which was a gesture into an absurd and out-of-place discussion."
"– Mr President, as the author of this motion for a resolution I beg the House to be patient."
"I am not going to argue, but now that this debate has been opened I should like to clarify a few doubts that have been raised here and which I myself have also entertained, to tell the truth."
"That is why I referred to the speech by the President of the European Parliament at the opening of today’s sitting."
"I think he is sufficiently objective and independent for us to identify with his words."
"Secondly, again as the author of the motion, I wish to recall that, even though 11 September was the favourite date in the vote in committee, not everyone in the committee voted for it."
"Now it is to our advantage if there is also a greater consensus in this House on the choice of a date for commemoration."
"I appeal to the House to find common ground, at least on our motion."
"Afterwards, of course, the decision will be up to the Council."
"Notwithstanding what Mr Cappato said – and I respect the way in which he made his point – I hope that the House will accept that today we are making a gesture of solidarity."
"It is only a recommendation."
"I hope that we can move forward on that basis."
". Mr President, I should like to recommend to the House that we split this vote in two and, in respect of the wishes of the House, that we delete the first half of the paragraph and then vote on the second half."
"I believe that will meet all Members' concerns."
"– Mr President, as Baroness Nicholson has announced that the first sentence is to be deleted, the Group of the Party of European Socialists wishes to withdraw Amendment No 2."
"Mr President, I would prefer to keep Amendment No 13."
"Amendment No 2 has been withdrawn, but as we have just heard, Amendment No 13 stands."
"– Mr President, yesterday evening, we asked Parliament’s services to regard Amendment No 12, which the Group of the Party of European Socialists tabled in an attempt to bring about equal treatment, as an addition."
"We are not opposed to equal treatment, except where it takes precedence over the reduction of administrative burdens for businesses, as the two are completely unrelated."
"No doubt this is a ruse to remove this reduction from the text."
"I look forward to hearing whether Mr Miller is going to see this as complementary."
"If that is not possible, then I see it as a ruse to delete from the text the reduction of administrative burdens on businesses, which the Socialists, possibly, do not want it to include."
". Mr President, I am not in the business of helping out the Liberals."
"Paragraph 33 is poor."
"Even if this were added to it, it would not sufficiently improve the paragraph to make it a good one."
"Consequently, I would rather vote against paragraph 33 and vote on the amendment."
"That concludes the vote."
"– Mr President, what we have just seen in the voting is an example of anti-social conduct on the part of the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"We had come to a number of agreements with them as regards the tabling of oral amendments – it is very important to note that this was done on the basis of reciprocity."
"As soon as their amendments, which did not propose anything major, were approved, the members of the Socialist group got up to go."
"What I object to is people putting their brains into neutral, which is what Mrs Gillig, the rapporteur, has done in being perfectly ready to support things that will have an utterly adverse effect on frontier workers, even though she is a spokesperson for the Socialists, and, moreover, the Socialist group has followed her in doing so."
"I am grateful to the Liberal Group and to the D66 delegation for the support they gave this oral amendment."
"More was not possible; perhaps we will get another chance."
"I might add that what is true of the Socialists is also true of the Greens."
"We will get another chance when it comes to the Regulation itself."
"The game is not yet over, but I would like to denounce this anti-social, stupid and cowardly behaviour here before you."
"People have been let down by this who should not have been."
"Thank you, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten."
"I take it that you are not very happy."
".– According to Article 23 of the Act of Accession, the European Union can make any amendments to the Act’s provisions on the common agricultural policy that may prove necessary as a result of changes in Community regulations."
"In other words, the Treaties of Accession, ratified by the ten countries that are to join the European Union on 1 May 2004, may be amended in the agricultural sphere by decisions made by the Fifteen."
"The result of this adaptation is that the situation, which already discriminates against the enlargement countries in agriculture, is made even worse for them."
"It should be noted that direct payments to farmers in the enlargement countries were already going to be phased in over time, starting at only 25% of the current Member States’ direct payments in the first year."
"Now they are also to be subject to the financial discipline mechanisms, which means that they may suffer yet further cuts in agricultural payments."
"In addition, the new direct payments for energy crops and nuts introduced with the CAP reforms will be covered by the same gradual phasing-in arrangements."
"These countries will no longer have the opportunity for derogation with regard to the single farm payment, which implies greater discrimination and has already led to objections from the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovenia and Estonia."
"This is just one more …"
".– The Commission has proposed adaptations to the Acts of Accession of the 10 new Member States in order to take account of last year’s reforms of the common agricultural policy, particularly the introduction of the Single Farm Payment."
"In fact, as the rapporteur has emphasised, in their current form the CAP reform texts take no account of the results of the accession negotiations or indeed of enlargement itself."
"It is well known that the observer members are dissatisfied with the proposal because the farmers in their Member States will be given different treatment at first, with direct payments for certain products only being made gradually over 10 years."
"Despite the observers’ dissatisfaction on a number of issues, however, the Commission’s proposal was accepted without amendment by the rapporteur, and his position was adopted unanimously by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"This decision also reflects the fact that the Council has already reached agreement on this matter."
"I voted for it."
".– I feel I have to support this report, which seeks approval for a proposal that is aimed at providing the Community with a valid instrument protecting the interests of a vital sector of the European economy, which is the provision of airline services."
"The severe distortions of international competition in this sector, caused in part by the substantial subsidies given by several Member States to their own airlines, fully justify the Commission’s initiative to provide the Community with an instrument for reaction, based on the model that already exists in the private sector."
"Where there is evidence that a given subsidy is causing undue damage to the Community civil aviation industry, it will be possible to open an inquiry and thus clarify the situation, so that the foreign companies in question may be required to pay compensation."
"The European airlines’ scepticism as to the effectiveness of this instrument, due to the difficulty in proving that carriers from other, non-Community countries are operating unfairly by setting their ticket prices too low, will depend only on the Commission’s ability to put this instrument into practice."
".– I supported this report because I consider Mr Nicholson’s proposal very well balanced in suggesting very few changes, which should not prevent this important dossier from being brought to a swift conclusion."
"The aim of this draft regulation on insurance requirements for air carriers and aircraft operators is to restore a certain stability to the aviation insurance market in Europe after the events of 11 September 2001 in the United States and the Commission’s decision not to authorise an extension to the agreements on state-subsidised insurance in the European Union."
"The measures proposed by the Commission, namely the adoption of legislative provisions that are binding on both Community and third-country air carriers, and the setting of minimum insurance requirements regarding liability towards passengers, baggage, merchandise, mail and third parties, will be enhanced by the rapporteur’s positive contribution."
".– As I said in the vote at first reading, I welcome the Commission proposal and the rapporteur’s excellent work."
"Electronic interchanges between national authorities and between these and the Community institutions are of vital importance at two levels."
"At an operational level they are a precious source of information and cooperation for national, local and regional agents of public administration, and therefore lead to greater effectiveness; while at the level of guaranteeing citizens’ rights they make relations with national and Community public authorities easier and more transparent."
"Now that the Council has unanimously adopted the common position (including the amendments proposed by Parliament at first reading), I hope that the good results achieved by the IDA (Interchange of Data between Administrations) programme will, as the Commission proposes, ensure the continuation of the previous programme (IDA II), henceforth to be known as IDABC – Interoperable Delivery of pan-European Government Services to Public Administrations, Businesses and Citizens."
"Finally, I must emphasise the importance of indeed extending the benefits of this information interchange to businesses and citizens, thus fulfilling both the goals of the Lisbon strategy and the Europe 2005 Action Plan, approved at the Seville European Council in June 2002."
". Social and economic development require the completion of important infrastructure works."
"However, the Commission programme on trans-European networks does not respond to the real need for development for the benefit of the workers and grass roots, to the need to improve their standard of living or to the need for easier communication between peoples."
"On the contrary, it ties up important national resources, in some countries even almost all public investments, in works selected by big business on the sole criterion of its needs: to increase its profitability and consolidate its position."
"Sectors and works which safeguard the participation and their subsequent exploitation by private capital are being given priority, while these infrastructures should belong to the people and should be designed to serve their needs."
"Thus, there are works which are not combined with productive activities, works which damage the environment and works which offer little or nothing to local society."
"We are opposed to any participation by private capital, especially the exploitation of works by private capital."
"We believe that the workers must claim public-sector infrastructure works, define their priorities and demand wholly public investments with Community participation."
". The issue of improving means of communication is a strategic factor for developing the economy of ‘Padania’."
"This is why the voted in favour of the trans-‘Padania’ rail link and Corridor 5 that would put ‘Padania’ at the centre of a route stretching from Lisbon to Ukraine."
". The vote in this Parliament on the Trans-European Networks (TENs) for transport has fortunately brought back the strict obligation to respect the Community directives on the following: strategic environmental impact assessments, consultation of residents, preservation of conservation sites and of protected human settlements."
"This is an obligation that the initial proposals from the committee and the Commission ignored."
"The bridge over the Strait of Messina, an addition to the North-South rail route – only proposed at the request of the Italian Government, though never subject to environmental impact assessments, as the former Commissioner Mr Van Miert admitted to the Members of this Parliament – has been crossed off the list of projects of European interest."
"Indeed, this was an unsustainable project, which had already squandered EUR 80 million on producing incomplete studies on the impact of more than 60 km of road and rail links on a highly urbanised area."
"The landscapes of the Costa Viola and the Messina region would end up devastated, and the tourist resources and the urban settlements would be destroyed."
"Fortunately, after the proposal by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Party of European Socialists, this project, which came about only as the result of the Italian Prime Minster’s megalomania and lack of respect for the environment, will not uselessly drain Community funds."
"A battle remains to be fought to ensure that the project is also crossed off the list of Italian works provided for by the Law on Objectives, and that instead employment and development are revitalised in Southern Italy."
". The problem of improving means of communication, either by road or rail, is a strategic element of Europe’s economic development."
"Within this context, the implementation of Corridor 5 and the trans-‘Padania’ high-speed rail link is a response that is needed more than ever and that is very useful as regards the problem of congestion and inefficiency of public and private transport in the Veneto; this inefficiency must be blamed on the lack of interest that the Roman authorities have shown for years towards a balanced development of our region of Veneto and of the North-East in general."
"The Berlusconi government, spurred on in this matter by the , has quite rightly taken steps in Europe in order to obtain the go-ahead and the necessary funding to implement Corridor 5, which will place ‘Padania’ at the centre of an economic and commercial route stretching from Lisbon to Ukraine; in particular it will be possible to encourage and develop foreign trade with the Eastern markets."
"All this is detrimental to alternative projects that provided for taking Corridor 5 beyond the Alps, thus cutting off our regions and our businesses from the Eastern markets."
".– I congratulate Mr Bradbourn on the report he has submitted to us, which I support."
"This work reveals great technical knowledge in its approach to a subject of vital importance: the development of a truly trans-European transport network in the context of enlargement."
"I should, however, like to underline the following points:"
"- the act of withdrawing the classification of projects of European interest should be a task for the Council and Parliament;"
"- the need to accept the list of priority projects in Annex III without changes;"
"- the importance of developing ‘motorways of the sea’, which are essential to eliminate gridlock in the trans-European transport network, and of achieving a real modal shift in this network."
".– The question that is being raised, in Portugal as in other countries, concerns the integration and coherence of high-speed links with the remainder of the rail network, forming a coherent web of access for populations, ensuring connections with the regions of the country and other countries, and contributing to economic, social and territorial cohesion."
"Therefore, alongside the TGV, it is essential to finish work on modernising the national network, with substantial increases in speeds, new signalling, electrification, duplication of congested sections, automatic control systems, substantial improvements in station quality and functionality, and the purchase of rolling stock that can adapt to different gauges."
"The Commission proposal continues the communication on investing in networks and knowledge with a view to growth and employment."
"In Portugal, however, while investment is made in the TGV, now included in the ‘Quick Start’ package, preparations are under way to dismantle , a highly specialised national company that is ready for this challenge."
"Many TGV projects included in this package by the Council are due for completion roughly at the time proposed by the Commission for the liberalisation of international passenger transport."
"This would be funny if it were not an example of contradictions, whereby what prevails is always what is least useful to the populations, always to the detriment of public service."
"In this explanation of vote, I must insist on the absolute need for the projects and measures to be assessed in terms of the indispensable linkage between national policies and the trans-European networks."
".– I supported this report on Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network."
"This is indeed a strategy that will have a great impact on Europe in terms of both growth and employment, and one that should ensure great progress in terms of the continent’s economy."
"I agree with the position of the specialist parliamentary committee when it supports the essence of the Commission’s approach but proposes important changes regarding greater involvement for the European Parliament, specifically in the evaluation of projects over time, including the possible withdrawal of the ‘project of European interest’ classification and the appointment of a European coordinator for a transnational project."
"I also consider the suggestion very appropriate that the Commission should submit the projects for the so-called motorways of the sea within one year."
"In view of the many doubts that have been raised recently regarding the Quick Start communication, which shortlists priority projects that are in a position for the work to be carried out more rapidly, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism is prudent in highlighting the fact that this communication is not binding."
".– I agree with this report, which seeks approval for a proposal to exclude those parts of airports reserved exclusively for small aircraft from the scope of Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002."
"This regulation, which entered into force in January 2003, was adopted in the aftermath of the terrible events of 11 September 2001 and sought the adoption of heightened civil aviation security measures, especially at airports."
"The amendment particularly concerns aerodromes for small aircraft and leisure flying that are adjacent to airports and results from the fact that it is inefficient and costly to apply to these areas the same security standards that are applied to airports."
"In those situations where small aircraft use facilities adjoining airports, the Commission proposes to introduce ‘demarcated areas’, separated from the other areas."
"I voted for the report."
". I fully support this report and welcome its adoption by this Parliament."
"Adoption of this report is crucial for the approval of the general revision and simplification of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71, which is long overdue."
"I support the rapporteur, who has worked hard to achieve a positive conclusion of this dossier at first reading in order to facilitate the coordination of social security schemes."
"It is important that we continue to improve transparency and clarity and strengthen the legal protection of citizens."
"It is particularly important that we continue to remove barriers affecting the mobility of workers within the Union."
"Ease of mobility is needed if we are ever to achieve the proclaimed objectives of the Lisbon Summit."
". I congratulate Mrs Gillig on her uncomplicated but effective report on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation amending Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons, to self-employed persons and to members of their families moving within the Community and Regulation (EEC) No 574/72 laying down the procedure for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71, which I support because of the need felt by the citizens for social security schemes to be better coordinated between Member States."
"This is an attempt to remove the remaining obstacles to the mobility of workers in the EU."
". Mrs Gillig’s report is concerned with the annual proposal to amend Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 and Regulation (EEC) No 574/72 to take account of the development of national social security schemes, incorporate changes in national laws and take account of the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities."
"The current Commission proposal seeks essentially to update aspects of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 relating to special non-contributory cash benefits following a number of decisions by the Court of Justice."
"The Court is of the view that these derogations from the principle of exportability of benefits must be interpreted strictly."
"In this context, we must emphasise the importance, in an extraordinarily technical field, of ensuring that the national laws of the Member States are complied with in the field of social protection, whilst bearing in mind that the ultimate aim of the desired coordination of these systems is to guarantee a dual dimension: social security and social assistance, throughout the territory of the European Union."
"This becomes all the more important in situations involving people with disabilities or who are particularly dependent, such as those covered in the amendments we are now looking at."
"The concept of real cohesion and social inclusion makes this necessary."
"I therefore voted in favour."
"This report returns to us, having been referred to a parliamentary committee, which shows how untimely the Commission’s proposal is."
"The Hunting, Fishing, Nature and Traditions members of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities retain their original position concerning the postal sector. Because of the specific characteristics of this sector – particularly in France, given the part played by the sector in promoting social and territorial cohesion – we are opposed to any European liberalisation."
"The amendments proposed are a lesser evil in so far as they permit a degree of adaptability when it comes to the taxation of postal services."
"That being the case, we do not subscribe to the logic that consists in removing the exemption from VAT, because we cannot be certain how matters will develop in the future, particularly in terms of increases in rates, the widening of the VAT base and the harmful effect upon consumers."
"We are therefore in favour of rejecting the Commission’s proposal but, contrary to the rapporteur, we are still not registering our support for the internal European market in the postal sector."
". This Commission proposal is intended to remove the VAT exemption granted to public postal service providers."
"Its adoption would have an impact, not only on these providers themselves, but also on consumers and would result, in particular, in higher prices for the services provided."
"Furthermore, this proposal should be seen against the backdrop of the current wave of liberalisation of postal services taking place at Community level and related to the creation of a common VAT system."
"It should be recalled that, although Parliament rejected this proposal for a directive on 18 December 2003, the Commission has insisted on retaining the proposal."
"The rapporteur tabled various compromise amendments to the directive but, although they were intended to soften its impact, they sought to ensure its adoption without calling into question the logic of the VAT system or of the directive on liberalisation."
". At the first reading, on 15 December 2003, when I was rapporteur on this report, I came to the conclusion that privatisation of postal services had great disadvantages in terms of quality, punctuality of service, the prices charged to the consumers, and working conditions for the staff."
"There are now, moreover, added disadvantages, in that those who post letters are going to have to pay yet another new tax, and so I was happy that a majority in the House shared my concern and rejected the report."
"Lamentably, the state-owned French postal service has jeopardized the former good result by putting pressure on the French Left. believes its interests to be served by welcoming the tax, which it will be able to claim back from the State."
"To my surprise, my colleague Philippe Herzog defended this position yesterday afternoon, and, today, the French MEPs from the Group of the Party of European Socialists have prevented this report from being rejected again."
"Tomorrow, my group, despite its sympathy for the special situation in one particular country, will stick with the original rejection that I advocated."
"The damage, though, has been done."
"Yet again, Europe’s citizens are having imposed on them a tax that does not relate to their income or wealth."
". Following Parliament’s rejection on 16 December 2003 of the Commission proposal to remove VAT exemption for public postal services, the Commission did not withdraw its proposal."
"The report was referred back to the competent committee in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and it is this new report that was submitted to the vote today."
"Let us bear in mind that the Commission proposal seeks to remove VAT exemption for public postal service providers, in order to create a level-playing field with the services provided by private competitors being subject to full VAT."
"Consequently, the Commission proposes that the normal rate of VAT should be applied to all items of mail weighing more than 2 kg, whilst leaving it to Member States to decide whether to apply a lower rate of VAT to items weighing less than 2 kg."
"The rapporteur proposes, however, that this time, note should be taken of the objections that led to the report’s initial rejection, and suggests increasing the weight limit from 2 kg to 10 kg for the reduced rate applicable to normal post and that the entry into force of the directive should be postponed until 2007."
"In my view, the proposal represents a significant improvement on the previous one, and therefore warranted my vote."
"I voted in favour of this agreement, as I did in favour of the previous one."
"I voted in favour of it, not because I support the policy of Mr Sharon’s government but because, for me, such an agreement would promote peace by helping the forces for peace that are present very widely within the scientific world."
"I am sure, moreover, that everything that promotes intelligence combats fundamentalism and, therefore, violence."
"I would add, on this Thursday 11 March 2004, that the appalling attack on Madrid, which is traumatising Europe, should enable us better to ‘understand’ public opinion among Israel’s civil population, which is under permanent threat and the victim of bloody terrorist attacks."
". I wish to record my opposition to this report."
"It is totally inappropriate for the European Union to engage in this form of cooperation with Israel while that state continues to blatantly ignore international law and abuse the human rights of the Palestinian people."
"I recently visited the so-called 'security wall' and was horrified to find that Palestinians are being walled and fenced into enclaves – their opportunity to leave these enclaves being totally dependent on the will of Israeli security forces."
"I unreservedly condemn the atrocities carried out by both sides in this conflict."
"Palestinian freedom will not be obtained by murdering civilians – terrorism destroys freedom."
"Israeli security will not be obtained by building an 'apartheid wall', which has less to do with security than with Ariel Sharon's long-standing plan to annex Palestinian territory."
"Parliament should reject the Commission proposal for a Council decision and the conclusion of the Agreement in protest at Israel's contempt for world opinion and international law, and its failure to engage constructively with elected Palestinian leaders in efforts to bring peace to the region."
". How should we view this proposal, when we are faced with the colonialist and aggressive approach of the Israeli government against the Palestinian people?"
"How should we view this proposal, when the Israeli army has carried out further attacks that have killed scores of people, including children?"
"How should we view this proposal when the Israeli authorities continue to build an illegal and unacceptable wall of occupation and apartheid?"
"How should we view this agreement, having heard the testimony of Palestinians who are denied the most fundamental rights, such as peace, security, food, health, education, housing, employment, freedom of movement, the most basic living conditions, dignity, an independent and sovereign State?"
"How should we view this agreement, having heard the testimony of Israelis who are fighting in their own country for peace and against their government’s policy, many of whom have been or are in danger of being imprisoned for refusing to serve in the occupying Israeli army?"
"How should we view this proposal, given the unacceptable position of the EU which, whilst claiming to be ‘impartial’, insists on placing the aggressor and the victim, the colonising force and the victim of colonisation, the Israeli army and the Palestinian people on the same footing?"
"How should we view this proposal, when the Israeli army has destroyed practically all Palestinian infrastructures, many of which were built with EU funding?"
". Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl’s report proposes that we adopt the Council decision and conclude the scientific and technological cooperation agreement, in particular on research in the field of biotechnology, optoelectronics, medical research and space travel, information technologies, telecommunications and software development."
"From the point of view of research policy, I agree with the rapporteur’s statement that ‘there is no reason why the agreement should not be extended’ and there are advantages to maintaining economic and political links with Israel, which would enable the European Union to play an effective role in the region."
"The agreement has also been warmly welcomed by the scientific community, which sees clear advantages in maintaining cooperation."
"Returning to the fundamental political issue, this constructive partnership could help to ease dialogue between the parties that are today in conflict or to open new dialogue between them, in the hope that Palestinian researchers and institutions will also be able to cooperate with Israeli and European institutions."
"We must also bear in mind that those who are committed to construction will find it hard to support destruction."
"I voted in favour."
". Panic has descended on Brussels because the objective which they set in Lisbon 4 years ago for the ΕU to become the most competitive economy in the world – for the benefit of its monopolies – is a very long way from being achieved."
"The Council due to meet on 25 to 26 March is being called upon to take even more anti-grass roots measures, in order to make up the ground lost thanks to grass-roots reactions and demonstrations."
"The Commission’s proposals as a whole and for each country are revelatory."
"Our country, for example, is accused, among other things, of not having yet put its old people out to work, of not having proceeded with far-reaching changes in the pension system, of not having reduced employers’ social security contributions, of not having made contracts of employment sufficiently flexible, of not having adequately promoted part-time employment and of not having completed privatisations."
"Even the national collective contract of employment comes under fire, because it hampers employers, who would prefer local or individual contracts of employment."
"The Greek and other governments must respond to these provocative demands and we have no doubt that they will willingly do so, as they have done for so many years."
"However, there is also the other pole, the workers’ and grass-roots movement in general, which has the power, by rallying and fighting, to ruin these plans."
"The European Parliament’s resolution on the constitutional process and the preparations for the European Council of 25 to 26 March 2004 practises the usual blackmail that we have seen in the case of each treaty, whereby it is proclaimed that an absence of agreement would have harmful repercussions for both integration and enlargement and would entail ‘a devastating loss of solidarity and legitimacy’."
"We think, on the contrary, that anything is preferable to a bad agreement that would tie our hands for a long time to come."
"Do we have to draw attention to our warnings about the Treaty of Amsterdam which, in particular, transferred basic competences to the Community on issues of immigration and increased the powers of the Commission?"
"Do we have to draw attention to our warnings about the Treaty of Nice, which was to get rid of France’s second Commissioner and reduce our representation in the European Parliament from 87 MEPs to 78 (and soon 72), while Germany retains 99 MEPs?"
"Nor have many others. Now, everyone feels desperately locked into processes that are weakening France."
"The current draft European Constitution is untimely, as I again explained yesterday in my statement attached to the debate on enlargement."
"If we were to adopt it, we should quickly regret having done so."
". Since last December, the dominant forces in Parliament – on the right (including the PSD) and the social democrats, which include the PES – have ramped up the pressure for the so(un)-called(for) ‘European Constitution’, if possible before 1 May."
"We are seeing one initiative after the other from the most excited parliamentarians."
"We have the proposal favoured by Giscard D'Estaing – one of the godfathers of the so-called constitution – for the EP to symbolically adopt the draft Convention, as a media stunt and the utterly preposterous proposal for the EP to blackmail the Council by refusing to endorse the next President of the Commission."
"We have scenarios being created in which failure to adopt the ‘constitution’ will result in disaster, perhaps with the interests of the Union’s employers in mind."
"I cannot leave out the chairman of the PSE, Mr Barón Crespo, who is predicting victory for the Spanish Socialist party in the Spanish elections of 14 March, with the consequent change in position of that country’s government."
"Furthermore, there has been a huge increase in negotiations in Council, with one proposal having been put forward, apparently by Germany, to unblock the lack of agreement over ‘who is the boss’ – is it just three countries or a few more?"
"This entire issue and everyone involved are far removed from the real interests and needs of the workers and citizens of the various countries that make up the EU."
"The resolution just adopted by the European Parliament on the area of freedom, security and justice (AFSJ) undoubtedly scales the same heights of irresponsibility to which, on immigration issues, this House has accustomed us."
"Where asylum, for example, is concerned, it calls upon us quickly to ratify the Commission’s bad proposals concerning refugees."
"The European Parliament adds ideas of its own devising, such as the establishment of protected entry points for asylum seekers outside European Union territory, coupled with a ‘resettlement scheme at Community level’, whereby refugees would be transferred from a first reception country to the European Union (paragraph 13)."
"Because people in European countries are seemingly in danger of failing to understand these matters, the European Parliament is suggesting to the Member States that they adopt ‘the measures necessary to promote understanding of immigration and integration as positive factors for the economy and for economic growth, and as elements of cultural enrichment’ (paragraph 20)."
"The resolution continually asks the Council to adopt the Commission’s proposals more quickly."
"We, on the contrary, call upon the Council to curb these proposals and to reject them whenever they are lax. We once again regret that, on 1 May, the Commission will acquire a monopoly on initiatives in these matters."
". It is now time to evaluate the results and progress achieved on adopting and implementing the set of measures necessary to attaining the objectives set by the Treaty of Amsterdam and by the Tampere European Council."
"We have managed to produce quite a balanced and widely supported report in terms of the message that Parliament wishes to send, both to the Council and to the Commission."
"Although substantial progress has been made on creating some areas within the area of freedom, security and justice (AFSJ), some of this progress has not been achieved within the deadlines set at Tampere and, what is worse, other previously defined objectives have still not been attained."
"The Council and the Commission must adopt practical measures, which are clearly indicated in the report, in various areas of the AFSJ."
"I hope, in this way, that by the end of 2004, all of these measures that are lagging behind and which form part of the objectives and timetables already set are adopted."
"I would also recall that the initiative adopted by some Member States to undertake a substantial reduction in the Community budget in the forthcoming EU financial perspective (2007-2013) can only obstruct the objectives that we propose to achieve, because this would prevent the Commission from completing its work in the areas of Justice and Home Affairs, amongst others."
". This motion for a resolution is in line with the federalist viewpoint of gradually bringing the field of Justice and Home Affairs, opened up by the Treaty of Amsterdam, into the Community sphere."
"The intention is gradually to remove prerogatives and competences that lie at the very heart of Member State sovereignty."
"The process was expanded in the Treaty of Nice, adopted in 2000, and gathered pace on the pretext of the so-called ‘fight against terrorism’ following 11 September 2001."
"This has led to repressive measures being implemented, specifically in conjunction with the US, which undermines freedoms and fundamental rights and guarantees and which the motion neither criticises nor condemns."
"Despite making some relevant and necessary criticism, the motion basically supports the European Union’s current policies in this field, examples of which include: extending the Schengen Information System, EUROPOL and EUROJUST, gradually ensuring the common management of external borders, a restrictive asylum policy, an immigration policy that criminalises immigrants and which promotes their repatriation, the use of biometric data, the arrest warrant and the European Union’s definition of terrorism."
"This motion for a resolution even argues the case for the so-called ‘European Constitution’ and its use as a tool for achieving new and dangerous developments."
"Paragraph 63 of the resolution on the progress made in 2003 in creating an area of freedom, security and justice takes issue with a sovereign decision by the French Parliament: the legislation it has adopted concerning respect for the principle of secularity in French public educational establishments."
"This position constitutes inadmissible interference by the European Parliament in an area that is strictly a national competence."
"This blatant interference is compounded by an error of judgement, since the legislation in question is aimed at protecting fundamental rights, particularly those of women, and not at undermining them."
"This attitude on the part of the European Parliament does not augur well for the future when the Charter of Fundamental Rights will be in force. This legal instrument is in danger of being to the detriment of nations keen to protect the freedom of their people."
". This resolution calls on the European Parliament to take stock of the development of the ‘area of freedom, security and justice’ in 2003."
"The radical Members of the believe that the text adopted should have been much more critical of the Commission, the Council and the Member States, in particular, by condemning the unbalanced way in which the institutions that hold the power of initiative and decision-making power in such sectors have acted and are acting."
"Indeed, the energy and timing with which these institutions have proposed and adopted measures aimed at strengthening the instruments for repressive measures in the areas of combating terrorism, cooperating in criminal matters, harmonising sanctions and combating illegal immigration, has not been matched by a strengthening of the rights of citizens, of the EU or otherwise."
"By way of example, one need only refer to the fact the Commission has not yet adopted the announced framework decision on procedural safeguards."
"Furthermore, with the freezing of the European Constitution, the structural problems, which the European Parliament has been criticising for years, remain unsolved. For example, the absence or the failing of democratic and legal control at European and national level of measures and organisations developed at European Union level"
". – Once again Parliament has turned its attention to the progress of the candidate countries."
"The truth is that this is a question of the annexation of these countries to the ΕU, which is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece will be voting against the report, which has every reason to welcome the ‘progress’ which has allegedly been made by these countries."
"Their peoples have every cause for concern."
"The selling off to big business of public corporations and their wealth, the abolition of all socialist achievements and ownership, the restriction on their sovereign rights and so forth are the price which the peoples of the candidate countries are paying and will continue to pay."
"The report is brimming with hypocrisy as far as human rights are concerned."
"There is not one single reference to the lack of political rights of the Russian minority in the Baltic states, to the persecutions and prohibitions of communist parties and their leaders and symbols, none of which, in the EU’s eyes, qualifies as an infringement of human rights, as their officials have repeatedly and provocatively stated."
"For Cyprus in particular, we wonder: what does the reference to the imminent accession of the Greek Cypriots alone mean?"
"Similarly, why, given that everyone recognises that Denktaş is responsible for the lack of progress in negotiations, are they pushing for further concessions from the Greek-Cypriot side?"
"We are certain that the Cypriot people will fight for a fair and viable solution."
"In the Swedish referendum on EU membership in 1994, all the political parties campaigning for Swedish membership of the EU asserted that marriage legislation and issues relating to cohabitation and abortion did not come within the decision-making competence of the EU."
"All the parties promised to work for these issues remaining within strictly national areas of legislation, without interference by the EU."
"We Moderates stand by this pledge to the Swedish electorate and believe that national legislation is much better than common EU legislation in this area."
"We observe that other Swedish political parties have abandoned their pledge and are now prepared to transfer the issues to EU level."
"In the longer term, this will be to the detriment of Swedes and is in danger of conflicting with Swedish traditions and customs."
"There is no obvious need for coordination."
"The best adapted legislation is obtained if the various national parliaments within the EU devise the legislation themselves."
"Prior to EU enlargement, respect must also be shown for the legislation of individual candidate countries in this area."
"We Swedish Moderates share the Swedish view on the rights to abortion and homosexual partnerships but, out of respect for other EU countries, we have voted against the section of the Brok report demanding new legislation on abortion and partnerships in Poland."
"I abstained from voting on the Brok report, although I obviously support completely the enlargement of the European Union to include the ten Member States whose membership will become effective on 1 May 2004."
"I have problems with two paragraphs of the resolution, however."
"Paragraph 63 states that the absence of an agreement on the reunification of Cyprus could constitute a ‘serious obstacle to Turkey’s European ambitions’."
"That is all well and good."
"It needs to be added, however, that there are many other problems that are just as serious."
"Otherwise, Turkey will say tomorrow that it had been promised membership if it favoured an agreement that brought the secession of the north of the island to an end."
"Moreover, paragraph 64 states that, if Cyprus is reunified, the European Union would be ready immediately to ‘accept Turkish as an official language’."
"This is completely the wrong moment for such a move."
"The Turkish Cypriots are few in number, and their situation is comparable with that of the Gaelic—speaking Irish, whose language has not been made official."
"Why go any further for Cyprus’s Turkish minority?"
"Do the translation services need to be overburdened at this time?"
"There is no reason for giving such pledges in advance to Turkey."
". In advance of the accession to the European Union of ten countries from Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean on 1 May, the Commission and Parliament are once again setting out their long list of requirements for these countries to meet."
"Although this list is more restrained than it has been in previous years, it still demonstrates the complete lack of balance that characterises the negotiating process, in other words the obligations imposed by the European Union on those countries that have applied to join."
"The report exerts unrelenting pressure on the new countries to adopt the dangerous draft version of the so-called ‘European Constitution’ before 1 May, and to ensure that these countries have fully implemented the Community ."
"The report is obsessed with ensuring compliance with the rules of the capitalist ‘internal market’ and signals its approval of applying ‘safeguard clauses’, which are tools for blackmailing and pressurising these countries."
"As to the unacceptable restrictions on freedom of movement imposed on these countries, I would simply say that these should be removed as swiftly as possible."
"With regard to the consequences of neo-liberal policies, the report merely acknowledges a ‘significant increase in unemployment, inequality, and social exclusion’."
"Concerning any serious evaluation of the socio-economic impact and consequences of enlargement and the measures necessary to address these, the report says nothing at all."
". In two months’ time, the EU will be gaining ten new Member States."
"Although last year’s decisions make enlargement a certainty, the Brok Report lists 148 areas of concern, and the addition of still more such areas is proposed in the form of amendments, some of them tabled by myself."
"It would appear from the texts that some Members of this House are primarily concerned about the failed privatisations, the sluggish tempo at which all barriers to the free market are being removed, and what they see as the excessively high level of public expenditure."
"I disagree with them very strongly."
"In reality, these countries have already given in to many unreasonable and unwise demands, which means that their problems can only get worse in the future."
"The price they have had to pay for accession to the EU will prevent them from meeting their people’s expectations, which will constitute a threat to democracy."
"Others are more concerned about the desperate situation of the millions of Roma, about the marginalisation of the Russian minority in the Baltic states, the continuing discrimination against homosexuals, the introduction of electoral laws intended to exclude smaller political movements and the serious lack of concern for the environment."
"I endorse these criticisms and will continue to do so even after these countries’ accessions."
". On 1 May, ten new Member States will join the EU, under the Accession Treaty, which was signed on 16 April 2003 in Athens."
"These countries have made strenuous efforts to comply with the EU’s demands, with particular regard to institutional and economic issues."
"I shall therefore vote in favour."
"I should, however, like to raise two points."
"The first of these relates to Cyprus, a country that has still not been reunited."
"The Cyprus question remains the greatest political issue to be resolved."
"It strikes me as essential, therefore, to put all our efforts into supporting negotiations towards a settlement between the Greek Cypriot side and the Turkish Cypriot side."
"My second point concerns the rapporteur’s maximalist tendencies towards federalism, which all opinion polls, including Eurobarometer, are unanimous in dismissing as unrealistic because the majority of Europe’s citizens do not feel it makes sense and do not want it."
"We are not satisfied with this report and the evaluation of the progress of the future Member States that it contains. We do not want to go into detail for every country, but rather express our general opinion on the principle itself of this enlargement."
"Indeed, the Members of the Hunting, Fishing, Nature and Traditions (CPNT) delegation in the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities have said on several occasions that it is against this enlargement, in particular, considering the lack of preparation, both on the part of these States and of the European Union."
"It is indeed surprising to see that, even though everyone agrees that no one is ready on a number of issues (necessary economic reforms, corruption, human rights, political institutions, environmental and social regulations and so on), we are continuing against all odds on the forced march towards this enlargement planned for 2004, then 2007, then … without any preliminary democratic consultation."
"We therefore reject this report for the same reasons that we rejected its predecessors, because we believe that we are going too far much too quickly, and I will conclude by saying that we will end up right against the wall."
"Unlike in previous instalments, in particular the last of them in November 2003, Turkey is strangely absent from the string of reports devoted to the enlargement process and examined in this sitting."
"Is it that the impending elections make it preferable to overshadow the persistence of a very lively debate on the possibility of Turkey’s accession?"
"This issue passionately splits opinion in Germany and is even tearing apart the Commission, if we are to believe the recent position of Commissioner Bolkestein against the entry of Turkey into the EU."
"In any case, it is dangerous to state, as the Brok report does, echoing the Commission, that a lack of an agreement on Cyprus is an obstacle to Turkey entering the EU, because that implies conversely that such an agreement would give them an automatic right of entry."
"Equally, it is totally premature to propose that Turkish should become an official language of the EU at a time when nobody knows what status would be granted to this language in the event of accession, nor the importance of the population affected, which must be taken into consideration if we want to stop multilingualism leading to unmanageable problems."
"There is, in any case, suspect haste in this."
". This report ‘on Bulgaria’s progress towards accession’ describes the underlying economic and political aims of the current enlargement of the EU."
"The report is especially illuminating on economic questions: it ‘commends Bulgaria on its functioning market economy’, ‘encourages the government to continue with its economic reform programme’, ‘welcomes the increasing importance of the private sector’ and ‘is concerned that any postponement or cancellation of strategic privatisation procedures may lead to a reduction of foreign direct investment’."
"In other words, capitalism is welcomed and criticism is levelled at any reservations about the process of privatisation and at any obstacle to the greed of the current EU countries’ large-scale capital in Bulgaria’s strategic economic sectors."
"Cynically, the report ‘calls on Bulgaria to remove the need for EU nationals to have a permanent residence permit to perform economic activities’, while saying nothing about the unacceptable constraints imposed on Bulgarians as regards their freedom of movement and residence in EU countries, even after accession."
"The report also alludes to Bulgaria joining NATO, planned for 2004 – which remains an implied prerequisite for accession to the EU."
". As we are all aware, Bulgaria submitted its request to join the EU on 18 December 1995."
"The Commission recommended, however, that Bulgaria should not be part of the first wave of enlargement."
"At the time, the country was on the right track, as far as strictly political issues were concerned."
"When it came to economic criteria, however, progress had been extremely slow."
"This was in 1997 and 1998."
"Once clear improvements to this situation had been observed, Bulgaria was finally invited, in 1999, in Helsinki, to open negotiations with a view to future accession."
"Since then, the country has made strenuous efforts to comply with EU recommendations, especially as regards the transposition of European legislation."
"These efforts have now been acknowledged, and the rapporteur calls on the EU to strengthen its support, with the aim of preparing for accession at the earliest opportunity."
"I completely endorse this view and the observation that Bulgaria fulfils the main criteria for accession to the EU."
"I therefore voted in favour."
". This parliamentary report on ‘Romania’s progress towards accession’ is most illuminating and characteristic of the current process of the EU’s enlargement to Eastern European and Mediterranean countries."
"I should like to highlight the rapporteur’s concern, when she states that ‘Romania has so far not received the stamp of approval concerning the full functioning of its market economy’, and recommends that the country ‘needs to persevere in its efforts of economic reform in all areas’."
"The report calls on Romania to ‘pursue its structural reform programme with enhanced vigour’ and to ‘complete their privatisation agenda’ in order to bypass what it sees as the ‘late start of privatisation and restructuring of public enterprises’."
"The aim of which, as the report explains, is to generate business that is attractive to direct foreign investment, in other words, to place the strategic sectors of Romania’s economy under the control of the large corporations from EU countries."
"To conclude, I must say that, reading some of the points in this report, it is tempting to wonder whether, rather than giving ‘lessons’ to others, Parliament would be better advised to address first what is happening in the various countries of the EU."
". The admission of Romania to the EU in 2007 is quite rightly giving rise to misgivings and disquiet, but sometimes for the wrong reasons."
"Yesterday, I heard the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats use the argument that, in Romania, too few businesses had been privatised over recent years."
"There were at least as many reasons to seriously criticise Romania when it was under its former right-wing government as there are now that the present one, which calls itself left-wing, is in power."
"Children begging and sniffing glue, poor people without any right to medical care, decaying buildings and public amenities, a democratic deficit, corruption and the collapse of public services are as much a fact of life now as they were then."
"I have even recently received the complaint from a Romanian party, the Socialist Workers’ Party, which now has to call itself the Socialist Alliance Party in order to remain legal, which started by gaining 4.6% of votes in elections in the 1990s, but was later, in the official results, given 3.9%, thus falling below the 4% threshold and remaining outside the parliament."
"It is doubtful whether Romania has ever met the Copenhagen criteria for a democratic state where the rule of law prevails, or that it will do so within a reasonable period of time."
"That can be a good reason not to put its accession on a faster track than that of Turkey, where too, much is amiss."
". I recall that it was on 22 June 1995 that Romania submitted its request to join the EU."
"Once its situation had been analysed, in line with the criteria laid down in Copenhagen, Romania was demoted to the second group."
"Romania’s situation deserves special attention, and its route to accession appears to be a long one, with some difficult obstacles still to overcome."
"The country has a large number of problems to solve, which it must do if negotiations are to be successful."
"I acknowledge, however, that important steps have been taken in order to achieve accession – most importantly the Constitution was amended last autumn."
"I shall therefore vote in favour."
"I am, however, especially concerned about certain areas that require urgent solutions to be found."
"The rule of law does not yet exist."
"Levels of corruption are alarmingly high."
"The judiciary does not operate independently."
"Media freedom is not safeguarded."
"These are just a few of the problems that must quickly be resolved."
"I endorse the report, but I call on Romania to strive harder towards joining the EU in 2007, otherwise its accession will certainly be delayed."
". The VVD delegation is satisfied with the report and hopes that it will send a powerful message to the Commission and the Council about the need for Europe to become, by 2010, the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world."
"If that is to be made possible, the European economy will have to be given adequate opportunities."
"Such opportunities are provided by the amendment to paragraph 33 adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which emphasizes the need for deregulation and for the reduction in the administrative burden for businesses, as well as the need for an independent advisory body to be set up to examine the practicability of EU legislation and its effects."
"Becoming ever more detailed and sometimes intrusive, EU law is resulting in great dissatisfaction on the part of the business community and the public, which erodes support for Europe and has been shown to be one of the reasons behind the poor response to the European elections."
"The distortion of competition brought about by the profusion of administrative burdens laid on European firms means that economic regions such as the US and China represent an economic threat to our jobs and prosperity."
"The VVD delegation, as part of the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reform Party, has voted against the Group of the Party of European Socialists’ Amendment No 12, not out of any opposition on the part of Liberals to the principle of equal treatment, but rather because Amendment No 12 would replace the version of paragraph 33 that we want to see."
". The completion of the internal market is the main objective of big business, in order to safeguard the greatest possible privileges, squeeze small and medium-sized enterprises and exploit manpower more effectively."
"The enlargement of the markets goes hand in glove with the penetration of the private sector into public services and the selling off of the people’s wealth."
"Thoughtless privatisation, which is the constituent element of the single internal market, affects the most vital sectors and converts all social possessions to merchandise."
"The Miller report welcomes the Commission’s proposals for the privatisation of public utilities."
"It waves the flag of competition and the four freedoms which accommodate big business."
"The opening up of the networks market, on the pretext of the alleged ‘benefits’ to consumers, also includes the water supply."
"In the name of profit, the fact that water is a social possession ,which no one can be deprived of, is being completely ignored."
"In other words, nothing will be left standing in the name of the profit of big business and the multinationals."
"The only thing we have not yet seen is privatisation of the air we breathe!"
"We believe that the workers must set their priorities and fight back against the choices of big business, and we are fighting with the workers and the working classes for new rights which respond to modern needs."
"The report before us addresses the strategy of the internal market, an issue of key importance to the EU."
"The report sets out the tasks that must be carried out by the EU, or, to be precise, by the Member States on an individual basis."
"The various areas of action encompass key questions in the pursuit of the most important aim, which has always been the continued development of the internal market."
"We welcome measures aimed at reducing contraventions of Community rules and those that promote the opening up to competition of the energy, transport, telecommunications and postal service markets."
"It is equally important that we succeed in developing competitiveness, with a view to increasing growth and jobs."
"I should also like to highlight those proposals that will lead to a reduction in tax obstacles and to greater transparency in public procurement."
"Given that this report will help to achieve what we hope will be a perfect internal market, in its various facets, such as persons, goods, services and capital, I voted in favour."
"I should also like to point out, in this regard, that the sovereignty of states is a prerequisite that has always underpinned the construction of the internal market."
"This has remained the case throughout the phases of development that it has undergone."
"Sovereignty must be safeguarded."
"I am therefore in favour of the Miller report."
"The Moderates believe that the organisation and content of health care and health services, as well as of care for the elderly, are national issues that should not be dealt with at supranational level."
"Because the report prescribes in a very detailed way how the Member States are to organise their health care and health services, as well as care for the elderly, we have voted against it, and this in spite of the fact that we can, in principle, support a number of the proposals presented in the report, for example that concerning the right of EU citizens to health care throughout the EU."
". Health care systems across the EU face the same challenges: to deliver access for all, high levels of quality and financial sustainability."
"The Member States are responsible for organising and funding health care systems, but cooperation must be enhanced by exchanging information, experience and best practice."
"We endorse the application of the open method of coordination and a detailed timetable, but Member States must lay down common objectives and indicators by the time of the 2006 Spring European Council."
"Some Member States are struggling with long waiting times for certain treatments and ever-dwindling numbers of doctors, health care professionals and suitably qualified health care providers."
"Member States must improve the quality of services and, by means of the Structural Funds, must invest in infrastructure and the training and development of professionals in these sectors."
"A network of European reference centres for diseases must be created, in which a particular concentration of resources and specialist knowledge is required, with a view to improving the use of current EU capacity."
"In view of the ageing of the population, these problems will be exacerbated, and as a result there will be a marked rise in the number of diseases requiring intensive medical treatment and long-term medical care."
"This will endanger the financial sustainability of health care systems."
". I have voted for this report to indicate my support for cooperation between the Member States in the field of health care and long-term care."
"I particularly support the principles contained in the report concerning access for all regardless of income or wealth, high quality of care, and financial sustainability of care systems."
"I believe that the creation of an integrated framework and tighter coordination in the field of social security is an important part of our progress towards achieving the social dimension and social protection incorporated in the Lisbon process."
"I support the call for the Commission to bring forward proposals for further progress on this matter and for the Council to adopt the principle of application of the open coordination method and a detailed timetable at the European Council next June, and for the Member States to lay down common objectives and indicators by the European Council in 2006."
"As Liberals, we always put the individual at the heart of all political decisions."
"In her report, Mrs Jöns addresses the subjects of health care and health services which, in different ways, have a big effect upon individuals in their daily lives."
"She addresses many important aspects of health care and the health services, which we too, of course, consider to be of great importance to the population of Europe."
"We nonetheless believe that responsibility for health care and health services must remain as close to the user as possible."
"In order to obtain the best adapted health care and health services, we believe that responsibility must lie at national, rather than EU, level."
"We have therefore chosen to vote against this report."
". I should like to congratulate Mrs Jöns on her excellent report on the Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions – Proposal for a joint report on ‘Health care and care for the elderly: Supporting national strategies for ensuring a high level of social protection’, which has my wholehearted support."
"I particularly endorse the need to put forward measures intended to accomplish the three aims proposed by the EU in this area: access, quality and financial sustainability."
"The ageing of the population is one of the greatest long-term challenges facing the EU."
"All Member States must therefore cooperate more closely and in a more structured manner, including those acceding in May, in order to define best practice in the sector."
". This report is based on a Commission communication on the proposal for a joint report on ‘Health care and care for the elderly’, supporting national strategies for ensuring a high level of social protection."
"I welcome the report’s support for cooperation in health care and long-term care systems, with Member States continuing to be responsible for organising and funding health care systems."
"This will facilitate the exchange of ideas, experience and best practice."
"I also agree with the rapporteur when she states that care at home by a member of the family or another person brings advantages and that people who provide such services should be supported."
"Important steps in this field were also taken in the Bastos report on reconciling working life, family life and privacy, on which we have voted during this part-session."
"There must be a balanced geographical spread of suitable facilities for health care and long-term health care between urban and rural areas, and Structural Funds must be used to create infrastructure to provide health care and long-term care."
"These are essential steps that must be taken if we are to achieve our aims."
"I voted in favour."
"That concludes the explanations of vote(2)."
"Mr President, on a point of order under Rule 181 of the Rules of Procedure, I tabled a written declaration under Rule 51 calling for a boycott of Ferrero SpA."
"This was initially distributed, but on 9 March I received a letter from President Cox stating that in his view it was inadmissible and he was therefore withdrawing it from circulation."
"Search as I may through the Rules of Procedure, I can find no rule allowing the President to act in such an arbitrary manner and no rule is quoted in his letter."
"I therefore request that the matter be referred to the committee responsible."
"There is a long tradition of political campaigning through boycotts: Barclays over South Africa, Nestlé over breast milk substitutes and Shell over both Brent Spar and Kabinda."
"I find it staggering that the European Parliament forces us to be gagged in this way, without the appropriate committee being consulted."
"I therefore ask that you refer the matter to the appropriate committee for urgent consideration."
"Thank you, Mr Ford."
"Your comment will, of course, be taken into consideration and noted in the Minutes.(3)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on Haiti."
"I give the floor to Commissioner Solbes Mira on behalf of the Commission."
". Mr President, the Commission is extremely worried about the political, economic and social situation in Haiti and calls on all groups to abstain from violence and respect the Constitution."
"This idea of respecting international law, including humanitarian legislation on human rights and refugees, is essential."
"The Commission supports a peaceful and constitutional solution to the crisis and that is necessary in order to hold free and equitable elections in the future within a climate which makes them possible."
"The Union has also supported the initiative of CARICOM and calls on all the Member States to accept and support it as well."
"This initiative is based on the resolutions of the Organisation of American States and must contribute to a sustainable solution to the crisis."
"The European Commission has granted financial assistance to the mission of the Organisation of American States in Haiti in the sum of EUR 1.25 million."
"Following the departure of President Aristide, the Commission has noted certain positive developments on the political front and, in particular, in the process which has led to the appointment of Mr Latortue as provisional Prime Minister."
"His appointment is an important milestone in the initiative of CARICOM and should open the way to a constitutional solution to the current difficulties facing the country, provided that the necessary measures are adopted to break the cycle of violence and establish a climate of security in Haiti."
"Last week, the European Commission dedicated EUR 1.8 million in urgent humanitarian aid intended essentially for health assistance for people in the areas affected by the rebellion and in Port au Prince, and we are prepared to study the possibility of additional aid in accordance with humanitarian needs."
"In this regard, we are working in close cooperation with the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Haiti in order to ascertain the existing needs."
"This team is receiving support and funding from our Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO)."
"Finally, I would like to point out that the Commission is also working in cooperation with other international donors present in Haiti in order to coordinate development strategies and respond to the country's immediate needs, with a view to speeding up development aid as soon as the circumstances allow."
"Mr President, 200 years ago, there was a slave revolt in San Domingo."
"The slaves overthrew their French masters and established the world's first black republic, which they named Haiti."
"A Proclamation of Independence pledged both brotherhood to those former masters whom 'do us justice' and 'its government henceforward to be one of justice'."
"That was as good as it ever got for Haiti, which in our lifetime has sunk into poverty and terror."
"It has become a byword for state-sponsored violence and horror, with the Tonton Macoutes and the years of Papa Doc."
"With Aristide came a beacon of hope, which was snuffed out by a military coup, reinstated, but then the country steadily lapsed into a regime of economic decline, human rights abuses, murderous militias and dubious electoral practices."
"Now it has imploded again."
"Bodies lie in the streets – victims of all sides – and children caught stealing beg for mercy to spare their lives."
"Children are at risk from hunger and disease."
"Factories and warehouses lie demolished, and with them have gone the jobs."
"Armed bandits, drug traffickers and death-squad leaders are exploiting the leadership vacuum."
"The world listened too late to Caricom's increasing anxiety, as so eloquently expressed by Louis Straker, Deputy Prime Minister of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, at the ACP Joint Parliamentary Assembly in Addis Ababa a few weeks ago."
"By that point it was too late to bring the government and opposition together – not that the opposition was particularly helpful when it came to sticking to its conditions for cooperation."
"What can be done?"
"France has sent troops to join those of the US."
"Presumably they will keep their EU partners informed, consult with them, and call on them as and when necessary."
"Should the rest of us wring our hands and leave it to them?"
"Do we follow in the wake of UN resolutions?"
"Do prepare and activate our humanitarian and subsequent development aid?"
"Do we contribute to the cost of peacekeeping?"
"Do we respond to UN calls to unblock roads to bring food and aid to the north?"
"Do we help the local police to recapture the 3 500 prisoners who have escaped from 20 prisons, making it difficult to bring to justice the perpetrators of crimes during military rule?"
"We need to do all these things."
"We need to release the frozen EDF monies."
"We need, once the multinational interim force has re-established order, to support CARICOM initiatives for a stabilisation force."
"We need to give support to the Prime Minister, Gérard Latortue, appointed by the Council of Wise Men, and the interim President, Alexandre."
"Then we need to help with bringing the guilty to justice and the establishment of a truth and reconciliation commission."
"On a day when terror has struck on our own continent, in Spain, and our hearts are with the people of Spain, we need to find room in our hearts for the people of Haiti too and to lend them our support and help them to have justice."
"– Mr President, the profound structural crisis in Haiti calls for long-term involvement on the part of the international community."
"Failing that, there is the threat of continuing political and socio-economic collapse, with all its terrifying consequences for its people."
"I have recently read reports from reliable sources in Haiti of just how little change there is in the situation there, and how grave it continues to be."
"Even more than the restoration of public order, the first priority is the rehabilitation of Haiti’s national police force, at the heart of which are reliable people who deserve every support on the part of the interim international emergency force."
"After all, in that way alone will it be possible to proceed with the mass disarmament of all the lawless warring groups."
"So far, though, the international emergency force continues to adopt too passive an approach; the result is open season for criminals and armed gangs."
"So it is, according to informants on the ground, that the bloodletting in Haiti continues."
"This is quite unacceptable, Commissioner."
"I call upon the international community to take firm action in Haiti in order to stabilise the situation."
"What will otherwise become of the provision of humanitarian aid?"
"In the meantime, the foreign aid workers who remain are under enormous pressure as they attempt to alleviate the misery."
"Let me quote from what one of them said: ‘Personally, though, I am still convinced of the usefulness of what we are doing here, or else I would have left the country a long time ago; my family are worried about me, and that is what they have asked me to do."
"I think that, in these difficult times, it is more than ever vital not to leave the people of Haiti alone in their struggle for autonomy and democracy and to support them without controlling or coercing them.’"
"Such a courageous, steadfast voice must speak to us and bid us get involved in Haiti."
"What are we to make of the tireless dedication of these brave aid workers?"
"They do not want to leave Haiti; nor, in any case, can they."
"I therefore ask the Commission, while we await a new government in Haiti, to use its best endeavours in order to resume ongoing activities as soon as possible."
"In that way, we will be keeping hope alive among the rural population and we will not be wasting any more time."
"Mr President, I was totally taken aback when reading the draft resolution by this House on the situation in Haiti."
"I was expecting France and the United States to be congratulated – especially France, as a European country – for having put an end to an insurrectionary crisis, which was visibly degenerating into a very serious civil war."
"Yet, I did not see such congratulations in the draft resolution, even though the European Union has been saying, for several weeks, that it is greatly concerned about the outbreaks of violence and called on all political forces, without exception – and I am quoting the Presidency declaration of 18 February – to refrain from any kind of violent behaviour."
"These friendly calls came to nothing, whereas France and the United States have at least achieved something."
"I was also expecting France to be congratulated for not being cravenly disinterested in a country with which it maintains cultural links and with which it has long-standing ties of affection, even though this country is in immediate proximity to the United States."
"France intends, in this way, to show that it is still aware of its historic commitments and the European Parliament should have been able to support this act of responsibility."
"I also expected France to be congratulated on having implemented a measure for preventive diplomacy, a measure to which the European Union, if it had been a good sport, would have been able to lend its support."
"Instead, the proposed resolution seems to primarily deplore, without daring to say so clearly, the fact that a European country took an initiative without continually remaining in the ranks of those who issued friendly calls."
"This is a negative attitude and altogether deplorable, which leads the draft resolution to surprising expressions."
"For example, I see in Recital F, that the conditions for the departure of Jean-Bertrand Aristide are criticised in a veiled manner and he is referred to as President, even though everyone knows, and the report itself recalls this in Recital H, that the election to his second term in office took place without the participation of the opposition parties, which wished to protest against the vote count at the previous parliamentary elections, thus creating a crisis which has only got worse and degenerated since."
"I also see, in paragraph 11, that the European Parliament called for the multinational interim force, authorised by the United Nations Security Council, to be formed, not of French, US and Canadian military personnel, but of United Nations peace-keepers, as if the European Parliament’s one overpowering concern was to exclude from this force the countries that have a presence in the region, because they are the ones primarily interested."
"To conclude, Mr President, I am disappointed that the draft resolution does not recognise that France acted out of duty and general interest, that it gave assistance to a population in danger – to avoid the worst – and that France defended the sovereignty of the Haitian people and that furthermore, France endeavoured to protect the legitimacy of a process of political restoration."
"This, I stress, is par for the course because the Council of seven wise men, representative of the diversity of Haitian society, has just nominated a Prime Minister, Mr Latortue, with the approval of the interim president Mr Alexandre, which, by the way, makes Recital K of the draft resolution somewhat out of date."
"We should welcome this recent decision, which is within the context of a move towards reconciliation and opens the way to forming a transitional Government of National Unity that will itself be responsible for preparing the next elections."
". Mr President, I would like to thank the speakers for their comments."
"I would just like to mention two additional elements."
"Firstly, the Council, in its statement of 1 March, clearly highlighted its support for the creation of a provisional multinational force to be deployed in Haiti, thereby supporting the Council of the United Nations."
"Secondly, with regard to the possibility of using funds from the eighth EDF, the Union has made the normalisation of relations conditional upon compliance with the necessary conditions and measures laid down in the resolutions of the Organisation of American States and that is the direction we are continuing to work in."
"Meanwhile, in cooperation with CARICOM, we are prepared not only to provide the scheduled humanitarian aid funds, but also any additional sums which may be necessary."
"Thank you, Commissioner Solbes Mira, in particular for being succinct."
"To wind up the debate I have received six motions for resolutions, in accordance with Article 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.(1)"
"The vote will take place after the debate."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolution tabled by the following Members:"
"– Mrs Isler Béguin and Mrs Schroedter, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on Ukraine (B5-0129/2004);"
"– Mr Belder, on behalf of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities, on Ukraine (B5-0132/2004);"
"–Mr van den Bos, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on Ukraine (B5-0135/2004);"
"– Mrs Caullery, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, on Ukraine (B5-0137/2004);"
"– Mr Wiersma and Mr van den Berg, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on Ukraine (B5-0139/2004);"
"– Mr Posselt, Mrs Stauner and Mr Tannock, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on Ukraine (B5-0141/2004);"
"– Mr Vinci, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on Ukraine (B5-0143/2004)."
"Mr President, in a true democracy a struggle for political power and ideas is healthy and gives people their own choice of government and political leaders."
"However, the results of an election can never be made certain before polling, preventing people from dismissing an unpopular regime."
"President Kuchma's belated interest, shortly before his term of office expires, in transforming Ukraine's system from an executive presidential to a parliamentary majority one, with an appointed executive prime minister, raises suspicions that this is a political manoeuvre designed to perpetuate his hold on power when he is trailing far behind opposition leader Mr Ushanka in the polls."
"The first constitutional amendment vote in this direction on 24 December was strongly criticised by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe because it used a show of hands."
"Some deputies were even photographed with both hands in the air, which is clearly against the Ukraine parliament's own rules of procedure and a violation of Article 3 of the Council of Europe's Statute, to which Ukraine has made a binding commitment and whose violation could jeopardise Ukraine's membership."
"The PACE also criticised the behaviour of the opposition, which protested by blocking all the parliament's work."
"On 3 February, and under international pressure, the constitutional bill was amended, which we must welcome as an improvement, to maintain a directly elected president – albeit a weakened presidency – and introduce lifetime security of tenure for judges in order to carry support from the socialist block of Mr Maroz, which has also declared that it will only support the final reading of the bill if substantial reforms are made to democratise the parliament via a proportional representation system."
"Once again, the government invoked questionable emergency parliamentary procedures to accelerate the voting and bypass national or parliamentary debate."
"I would also like to remind the Ukraine Government that under their constitution, normally a constitutional change requires a confirmatory referendum by the people."
"Like the rest of this House, I am also concerned about measures which might stifle open and free debate in Ukraine."
"Certainly pressure on the opposition media is commonplace."
"The case cited in the resolution of the paper is a bad one, in my view, as it was understandably and rightly prosecuted for publishing three extremely anti-Semitic articles."
"The government also claims that the end of Radio Liberty broadcasts was entirely due to commercial considerations rather than political reasons of pressure on the opposition."
"In defence of Mr Kuchma, the United States allegations of breaking United Nations sanctions last year by exporting the Kolchuha radar system to Iraq have not been proven, as no such radar system has ever been found during the weapons of mass destruction search in Iraq."
"Ukraine is now at a crossroads between a western-style democratic future with EU aspirations, which we in the European Parliament support in principle, and reverting to a semi-democratic authoritarian type of system."
"The choice is Ukraine's to make."
"We strongly believe the former is preferable for the future prosperity and freedom of its people and that wonderful country."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our European Union is enlarging by bringing together, on the basis of its values and standards, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe liberated from decades of communist oppression."
"This harmonisation from the top down of the political and economic spheres, which is what the accession countries have called for and sought, maintains the stability and prosperity of this European area."
"Enlargement has, however, brought to light and made us see a new neighbourhood on the edge of Europe."
"Ukraine is one of the European countries that are working hard to extricate themselves from the negative effects of and practices carried out by last century’s Sovietism."
"The contrast with a Central and Baltic Europe, that is standardising and restoring rights, highlights the democratic deficits, the multiple restrictions and economic insecurities that remain throughout this new neighbourhood."
"Of course, this social, political and economic divide between the two poles of the same Europe means that the European Union must, within the context of its enlargement, activate its measures, means and initiatives, and its mutual assistance based on solidarity."
"This decoupling of the enlarged Union and its Eastern neighbours also, and above all, raises the issue of the European Union’s historic links with its Eastern cousins where Community interest is too restricted to making its border more secure and to its nuclear facilities."
"Instead of today calling for the Tacis programmes in Ukraine to be stepped up, in order to economically restore some sort of stability with this neighbour, why did we not make our solidarity, our programmes and our budgets more open to them after 1991?"
"Nevertheless, Ukraine fully contributes to the European identity and its government stands by its claim, despite the reluctance of the European Union, to take its legitimate place there."
"The European Union has a political and moral obligation to the Ukrainian people to set to work to effectively restore the fundamental freedoms to their country: freedom of thought, freedom of speech, freedom of political and union association."
"It is imperative that the European Union remains vigilant, as regards the places of detention, and that it should also be present at the next elections."
"However, as the current enlargement shows, there are no better foundations for the rule of law, democracy, human and environmental rights than those in the European Union, and not those on its doorstep."
"It will be at the cost of a new enlargement: this will be the price we will pay for the unification of Europe."
"– Mr President, the day before yesterday, an estimated 5 000 to 7 000 Ukrainian citizens demonstrated in Kiev, their country’s capital, calling for ‘freedom for the word’."
"This demonstration was in response to President Kuchma's regime’s increasingly repressive policy on the media."
"Last Saturday, the had some justification for writing on its front page that opposition media in Ukraine had to fear for their continued existence."
"The situation reflects this."
"Exactly a week ago, Nikola Tomenko, chairman of the Ukrainian parliament’s committee on media freedom – note its name! – delivered a devastating indictment in the parliament, the Verkhovna Rada; presidential elections are to be held this year, and President Kuchma is attempting to use all possible means to suppress dissident opinions."
"In this connection, there is currently a great deal of controversy surrounding the death of Yuri Chechyk, the director of the private radio station, last Wednesday."
"Chechyk lost his life in a traffic accident on the way from his home in Poltava to Kiev for a meeting with Radio Svoboda, the Ukrainian branch of Radio Liberty."
"This fact alone has aroused suspicion about Chechyk’s unexpected death."
"Only a few hours after his death, the Ukrainian security services stormed the Kiev station Radio Continent and seized all its broadcasting equipment."
"This station had evidently incurred the displeasure of the Ukrainian powers-that-be by transmitting programmes from Radio Liberty."
"Radio Continent’s director has, in the meantime, left the country post-haste, himself stating that he has done so in fear of his life."
"It was Radio Continent, too, that employed the journalist Georgi Gongadze, who went missing in the year 2000 and was later found decapitated."
"The campaign that President Kuchma and his associates are evidently waging, at the present time, against independent media contradicts Kiev’s official claim to be promoting democracy in Ukraine and to be seeking to draw closer to Europe."
"At the beginning of this week, the former US Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, writing in the New York Times, called for action on both sides of the Atlantic to defend political and personal freedom in Ukraine."
"I hope that Washington and Brussels will indeed close ranks, as Albright puts it, in order to defend freedom’s borders and set them wider."
"Mr President, on behalf of the PSE Group, I wish to say that we recognise the importance of Ukraine as a country with historical, cultural and economic ties to the EU and with long-term aspirations of membership of the European Union."
"We also welcome the preparation by the Commission of the action plan – due to be ready in spring this year – that will enable Ukraine to integrate progressively into EU policies and programmes."
"However, a genuine partnership can only develop on the basis of shared common values, in particular democracy, the rule of law and respect for human and civil rights."
"At the moment, those conditions are not being met in Ukraine and the situation is deteriorating."
"Prison conditions, arbitrary detention and excessively long periods of pre-trial detention in Ukraine remain serious problems."
"Freedom of expression – as some of my colleagues have mentioned in more detail – is coming under increasing threat and there have been a number of serious violations of the rights of the independent media and journalists."
"We therefore call on the Ukrainian authorities to improve prison conditions and end arbitrary detention and excessively long periods of pre-trial detention."
"We call on the government of Ukraine to respect freedom of expression and to undertake sustained and effective measures to prevent and punish interventions against free and independent media."
"We ask the government to clarify allegations that its secret services were instructed to spy on journalists and Ukrainian and foreign politicians in their respective home countries in order to discourage them if necessary from continuing to take up human rights issues."
"We ask the Ukrainian authorities to make a formal commitment to hold October's forthcoming presidential elections in conditions of the greatest possible transparency, and hope that the European Commission will consider, along with Parliament and other bodies, whether we should send an election observation mission."
"– Mr President, Ukraine is without doubt a European country – one of the largest – and we must not forget how this European country was for decades oppressed and plundered as a Soviet colony."
"There is no room for self-righteousness in the criticisms we level at Ukraine today, for we, thank God, have been spared a fate such as theirs – or, at least, most of us have been."
"There is much, then, that we have to appreciate and understand."
"For Ukraine to develop will take some time."
"We in this House have, over recent years, done a great deal to support Ukraine, and even before the great changes between 1989 and 1991 there were elements in Western Europe who cooperated with it."
"I am thinking here of the Ukrainian university in exile in my electoral district in Munich, or of Radio Liberty, which used to broadcast from Munich, which was perhaps something of a free Ukrainian metropolis."
"That has always given us a great deal of sympathy and understanding for the Ukrainian people in their aspiration towards a life of their own."
"We cannot, however, show any consideration towards politicians who are not merely corrupt, who are not merely dragging their heels when it comes to getting their country to make progress, but are even doing the very opposite by trying to freeze to death the tender shoots of democracy and the rule of law, who are actively using criminal methods to counter their opposition, and attempting to silence their critics in the media."
"To take one example, it is an appalling scandal when a Member of this European Parliament – Mrs Stauner, and she is surely not the only one – is shadowed by an officer of the Ukrainian secret police, because she brought members of the Ukrainian opposition into this House or raised critical issues, such as the trade in organs, the trafficking in children and many other problems that there are, unfortunately, not only in Ukraine but also with Ukraine."
"Our policy, then, must be an utterly unambiguous one. While we must, in principle, be sympathetic towards the Ukrainian people as an important European partner, we must speak out strongly against, and take firm action against, all those who, in whatever way, seek to whittle away and destroy the democracy that is coming into being in their country."
"Mr President, Commissioner Solbes Mira, ladies and gentlemen, in 2002, I travelled at Easter to Ukraine as one of the European Parliament’s election observers."
"I noticed with concern how remarkably fearful and uneasy people were, and particularly young candidates, about freely expressing their political opinions."
"Within the framework of the Commission’s programme for a wider Europe, I have worked to bring about a situation in which, as in fact has happened, the European Parliament might come down in favour of Ukraine’s adopting a European perspective and, having at one time been a European nation, becoming a member of the EU."
"At the same time, I wish to call attention to the fact that Ukraine is a very old nation."
"In terms of statehood, it is, however, young, having been subject to Russian and Soviet control."
"Against this background, it is all the more unfortunate that so many in the media and journalism are getting into trouble, that Radio Liberty is being closed down, that the biggest opposition newspaper, Silsky Visty has been brought before the courts, that the privately owned radio station, Radio Dovira, has been silenced and that journalists are not only being exposed to threats but have, in some cases, in fact been murdered."
"The deaths of the journalists Georgi Gongadze and Jurij Tjetjiks have in actual fact still not been explained."
"Many here in the European Parliament have warm feelings towards Ukraine."
"We are therefore all the more distressed about the developments, especially in the media, in a country that is one of the most dangerous countries of all in which to work as a journalist."
"In June 2003, the Canadian Senate adopted a resolution addressing the genocide and mass starvation under Stalin in which seven million Ukrainians died."
"Let us remember these events."
"Every year, the fourth Sunday in November is a day for commemorating this genocide and this mass starvation."
"– Mr President, I think it is important that in any policy relating to a larger Europe and partnership that we remember the importance of Ukraine as a country that certainly has historical, cultural and also economic ties to Europe."
"At the same time we have to remember, and remind the Ukrainian administration, that real partnership can only be developed through democracy, the rule of law and a respect for civil and human rights."
"Ukraine really still has much to do in these areas."
"For example, freedom of speech and the independent media are continually under threat in Ukraine and the rule of law does not function in any satisfactory way."
"Poor prison conditions, random arrests, and excessively long pre-trial detentions are still serious problems."
"The resolution lists many concrete defects and violations of human and civil rights, which have to be put right for partnership to really develop."
"The EU must encourage Ukraine to strive for better government and democracy."
"One instrument for this is the TACIS Democracy Programme, which should be used to strengthen the independent media, so vital for the creation of civil society, and democratic institutions."
"The Council and the Commission should monitor developments in Ukraine carefully and play an active and transparent role in organising the presidential elections in October, as well as other matters."
". Mr President, I would like to begin by emphasising the importance the European Union attaches to Ukraine as a strategic partner."
"This is reflected in our common strategy agreed in 1999 and our cooperation within the framework of the Association and Cooperation Agreement."
"With the enlargement of the Union on 1 May, the Union and Ukraine will become neighbouring areas and therefore over the coming years we will have an even greater opportunity to enhance our relations."
"Within this context, as you know, we have implemented our neighbourliness initiative which sets ambitious objectives for intensifying cooperation in many areas, basing that cooperation on an unequivocal commitment to shared values and the effective application of political, economic and institutional reforms."
"The European Commission therefore appreciates the attention being paid today to the debate on the process of political and constitutional reform under way in Ukraine and particularly the freedom of the press."
"These are the issues we must continue to deal with within our current debates."
"I would also like to make a few comments and point out the importance of the issues within the context of the coming elections in October."
"With regard to the substance of the constitutional reforms, I would like to reiterate the statement of 29 January."
"Naturally, it is Ukraine which must choose its own form of government and its Constitution, in accordance with European democratic standards, but the circumstances and the way in which the debate on this reform is being carried out continue to cause concern."
"At the same time, we were pleased to see that the Ukraine parliament, at the beginning of February, adopted proposals for constitutional reform initially intended to take account of the criticisms made by the national opposition and the critical comments of the Council of Europe and the Union."
"This represents a step forward."
"Within the context of the coming elections, the problem of freedom of the press is going to require special attention."
"On several occasions the Union has insisted on the need for a more transparent relationship between the press and the public powers based on the unequivocal rule of law and the effective protection of the rights of journalists."
"The recent judicial decision to close an opposition newspaper and a radio station have raised new serious questions."
"The Union will therefore continue to clearly express its concerns with regard to the freedom of the press and will continue to insist that the role of the press be adequately respected, as should be the case within the context of freedom, within a democratic system."
"I will make a comment on your request for information on the sending of observers to the elections."
"The priorities for formal missions of electoral observers within the Union have been defined by the Commission and Parliament in close cooperation."
"Generally speaking, missions as such are not sent to countries which are Member States of the OSCE – as in the case of Ukraine."
"However, as is customary, we intend to carry out coordination and cooperation work with the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights of the OSCE, which is preparing a long-term observation mission."
"Furthermore, the Commission hopes that the European Parliament will once again send its own team to join with this OSCE mission, as it did for the last parliamentary elections in Ukraine."
"I would like to end by assuring you that the Commission is closely following all the issues raised by the honourable Members in this debate within a constructive atmosphere with our Ukrainian partners."
"Within this context, we are right now producing and applying several specific projects to assist and cooperate with Ukraine in order to make progress on institutional aspects."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Solbes Mira."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debates."
"– The next item is the joint debate on the motions for resolution tabled by the following Members:"
"– Mr Fernández Martín and Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on Venezuela (B5-0123/2004);"
"– Mr Linkohr, Mr Medina Ortega, Mr Pittella and Mr van den Berg, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the human rights situation in Venezuela (B5-0126/2004);"
"– Mrs Boumediene-Thiery, Mrs Frassoni, Mr Lipietz, Mr Mayol i Raynal, Mr Nogueira Román and Mr Ortuondo Larrea, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on the human rights situation in Venezuela (B5-0128/2004);"
"– Mrs André-Léonard and Mr van den Bos, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on Venezuela (B5-0136/2004);"
"– Mr Bertinotti, Mrs Figueiredo, Mr Marset Campos and Mr Wurtz, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left on Venezuela (B5-0144/2004);"
"– Mrs Muscardini and Mr Queiró, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, on the situation in Venezuela (B5-0147/2004)."
"Mr President, Venezuela is currently suffering a crisis which is leading to a social polarisation with unpredictable consequences, and has cost the lives of a number of people."
"This Parliament’s position, during the long Venezuelan crisis, has clearly expressed the need to find a peaceful solution, a solution through dialogue, a constitutional solution and a solution achieved through essentially electoral means."
"This solution was enshrined in an agreement between representatives of the government and of the Democratic Coordinator by means of a recall referendum, which is the constitutional mechanism laid down in Venezuela’s Magna Carta, which allows the popular support for the President of the Republic to be revalidated."
"The recent decision of the National Electoral Council not to validate a significant number of signatures collected in order to call the referendum does not, in our opinion, respect either the spirit or the letter of those agreements and has been the catalyst for the recent events in that country."
"We believe it is clear, Mr President, that citizens cannot be deprived of exercising their legitimate rights and that the National Electoral Council is obliged to facilitate and guarantee the exercise of the popular will."
"This Parliament, therefore, by means of this compromise Resolution, signed by three political groups, must call firstly for calm and moderation."
"It must call on the government to guarantee the rights of all citizens, including the right to peaceful demonstration."
"It calls on the National Electoral Council to accept and adopt without delay the recommendations of the mission of the Carter Centre and of the mission of the Organisation of American States."
"It reiterates its support for the agreements reached between the government and the Democratic Coordinator."
"It expresses its concern at the failure to comply with them and calls on the government to guarantee their implementation as soon as possible."
"Mr President, it is also necessary to call for a redoubling of the European Union's efforts, with the aim of ensuring that these agreements between the government and the Democratic Coordinator are complied with."
"I believe that the most desirable thing, as a result of these agreements, would be for a recall referendum to take place soon, which is the European Union's desire, expressed by means of various statements by the Council of Ministers of the European Union on the initiative of the Commission, and for a mission of European Union electoral observers to be appointed to accompany this process of ratifying and holding the recall referendum, which is the institutionally established mechanism."
"Mr President, as my predecessor, Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, said, this motion for a resolution has the support of three political groups, the three largest in the House."
"The motion for a resolution is in line with the statement of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council of last February, which urged compliance with the agreements between the government and the opposition."
"In this regard we are facing a degree of contradiction because the current Venezuelan Constitution has been drawn up by the party currently in government with a large majority."
"Nobody obliged the government to include the recall referendum in that Constitution, but it was included."
"Nobody obliged the government to reach an agreement with the opposition on 29 May 2003, but it was reached."
"Furthermore, that process is currently being carried out in cooperation with the Organisation of American States, the Carter Centre and also, to a certain extent, the European Union – because we are contributing to the process."
"At the moment, in line with the statement of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and in view of events, Parliament, which has expressed its opinion on Venezuela on other occasions, wishes to point out that constitutional rights can be infringed by violation of essential procedural requirements and we believe that in this case there is a violation of essential procedural requirements, since by alleging that there were certain ‘coincidences’ in handwriting, hundreds of thousands of signatures have been annulled. Other procedures could have been used."
"If it was believed that those signatures were not correct, a system of sampling could have been used, for example, in order to verify whether those hundreds of thousands of signatures were really correct."
"But what is not acceptable is for them to be annulled in this way without in any way bearing in mind more that the one million signatures needed for a recall referendum would have been collected."
"We are currently facing a decision by the National Electoral Council, supported by the government, which is intended to deprive Venezuelan citizens of a constitutional right recognised in the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela."
"I believe that the resolution is very clear."
"We are not trying to inflame passions. Quite the opposite."
"We are appealing for calm. But we want this process of restoring constitutional normality to conform to the spirit of the agreement of 29 May 2003."
"In other words, it is not a question of one side imposing its will on the other, but neither is it a question of preventing the exercise of a constitutional right such as the right to call for the recall of a President."
"And to do so in the way that the National Electoral Council has done, by annulling signatures en masse, makes the exercise of that right impossible."
"At the moment, it is clear that the Carter Centre for Democracy and the Organisation of American States are negotiating with the Venezuelan Government and with the opposition with a view to seeking a way out of the conflict and we hope that the Commission, as always, will cooperate with Parliament and the Council in the task of reassuring the Venezuelan population and making it possible to put the Venezuelan constitutional process back onto a democratic electoral course."
"– Mr President, Europe formerly knew of Venezuela only as a supplier of crude oil and iron ore and as a base for European adventurers."
"Now that a stubborn president is refusing to accept the democratic will of the people, must the country go back to being what it was?"
"I want to share with this House my own experiences of it."
"Half a century ago, I was one of the children in Caracas, the Venezuelan capital, who did not go to school but instead roamed through sewers and shanty towns built against mountain slopes, their houses made out of orange crates with roofs of corrugated iron."
"Large cars, luxurious houses and golf courses were enjoyed by a small elite, while, on the street, close to the doors of smart offices and shops, I saw sick, legless beggars."
"The hospital where my father died was filthy and chaotic."
"What limited public transport existed was in the hands of various companies, each with buses in their own colours, but without proper connections."
"In other parts of the country, in the second city, Maracaibo, for example, I saw Indians, impoverished and shunned by everyone."
"The road from the capital to the coast was lined with crosses for people who had fallen to their deaths, while, on other roads, dust storms were whipped up as you drove along."
"The president was a dictator who had his opponents hanged from lampposts by his police force, recruited from Italian immigrants."
"My experiences at that time gave me the hope and the expectation that the people would not always accept this scandalous combination of dictatorship and extreme wealth, extreme poverty and extreme neglect."
"Forty years later, they stopped resigning themselves to their lot and could at last have a hope of a stable existence, growth and solidarity."
"By a large majority, they democratically chose a parliament composed along different lines, a new constitution and a quite different sort of president."
"That President Chávez put too much faith in the army and did little to help the victims of the great natural calamity does not justify the coup d’état in which he was abducted and replaced temporarily by the chairman of the employers’ federation."
"Nor do his shortcomings justify the forging of an immense number of signatures in order to get sufficient support for a referendum aimed at again deposing him."
"While the United States recognises the present Venezuelan Government as legitimate, the two major groups in this European Parliament allow themselves to be led by their contacts with parties that were formerly in government, but have been voted out by the Venezuelan electorate."
"Things can and must get better in Venezuela, but going back to the way things were will not help matters at all."
"The European Union’s support for the new Venezuela is the best way to prevent provocative and violent acts on the part of both the government and the political opposition, but unwarranted nostalgia leads only to disaster."
"Mr President, I would like to make clear on behalf of the PSE Group that we will be opposing all of the amendments by the GUE/NGL Group and the Verts/ALE Group."
"Nevertheless we find less than credible the much delayed decision by the Venezuelan National Electoral Council to reject 1.2 million out of 3 million signatures on the recall referendum; two in five signatures have actually been declared invalid."
"We understand the wave of protest and disturbances in Venezuela in the wake of that decision."
"Nevertheless, we reject unconditionally the use of violence and deeply deplore the loss of human lives."
"We express our sympathy with the victims of that violence."
"We call on the National Electoral Commission to accept and adopt forthwith the recommendations of the Organisation of American States Observation Mission and the Carter Centre in relation to their preliminary report."
"We endorse the Irish presidency's statements of 23 February and 2 March, and ask the Commission to use its considerable political weight in that country to ensure that the agreements made on the basis of democratic coordination are actually kept."
"Mr President, the people of Venezuela took the country into their own hands and elected Mr Chavez as president."
"Apparently, this was not to the liking of the United States, the local plutocracy or the European Union, which is maintaining an indulgent silence."
"They even went as far as organising a coup d’état in order to oust President Chavez and his government, but they failed thanks to the decisive intervention of the people of Venezuela themselves."
"A new attack is unfolding at this time."
"The opposition has made a huge effort to collect signatures, but I wonder where it submitted the petition, which was a failure in that most of the signatures proved to be forged. And now the opposition is crying that it has been discriminated against."
"The time when the imperialists imposed dictatorships everywhere has passed."
"The people of Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, of the whole of Latin America are stepping up their fight for democracy and social change."
"To all these peoples we express our solidarity and undivided support."
". Mr President, the European Commission is pleased that Parliament has presented an initiative on this issue."
"The serious political crisis in Venezuela and its serious economic consequences are a cause of concern to the Commission, which is closely following how events develop."
"The political stability of Venezuela is essential not only to the development of this country but also to the security of the Andean region and the whole of Latin America."
"Venezuela needs international support in order to achieve a peaceful and democratic solution to the internal conflict without this having to mean interference in the country's internal affairs."
"The Commission therefore welcomed the beginning of dialogue between the government and the opposition and supported the facilitation of this dialogue by the tripartite group consisting of the Organisation of American States, the Carter Centre and the United Nations Development Programme."
"We also supported the signature of the Declaration against Violence and for Peace and Democracy in Venezuela, in February 2003, and the agreement of 29 May of that same year."
"This agreement offered opportunities for achieving a peaceful, democratic, constitutional and electoral solution as advocated both by the Organisation of American States in its Permanent Council Resolution 833, and by the European Union, an idea which we continue to support."
"To this end, the National Electoral Council organised a collection of signatures to call for recall referendums and the opposition set out to collect the signatures."
"In parallel, supporters of the government also collected signatures to recall certain representatives of the National Assembly."
"The Commission shares the concern expressed by the Organisation of American States and the Carter Centre in its declaration of 2 March last and is fearful of the possible consequences of the decision of the National Electoral Council to subject 876 000 signatures for the presidential referendum considered doubtful to validation."
"The Commission fears that this may represent an insuperable obstacle to an electoral solution or affect the results of the process."
"Nevertheless, we would urge the opposition to submit to this process of validation and the government and the National Electoral Council to guarantee the defence of the popular will in such a way that it can be expressed by means of an electoral process."
"The Commission regrets the climate of violence that has been created, the loss of human lives and many injured and urges the parties to apply the Declaration against Violence and for Peace and Democracy, which they themselves agreed."
"The Union has published several statements on the need to seek a peaceful, democratic, constitutional and electoral solution and we have also given the Organisation of American States economic support in its efforts to apply the May agreement and we are prepared, if necessary, to examine how the support can be increased if that organisation requests it."
"Furthermore, in response to certain questions put, if the National Electoral Council decides to hold the referendum and the Venezuelan authorities invite the European Union, the Commission would be prepared to send an exploratory mission of electoral observers if it is advisable, useful and feasible."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Solbes Mira."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debates."
". We deplore in the strongest terms the content of the motion for a resolution that was put to the vote today in Parliament, which was jointly signed by the right, consisting of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, and by the social democrats, in the shape of the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"This is tantamount to unacceptable meddling and pressure on the Venezuelan National Electoral Council."
"We must not forget the short-lived military coup of 11 and 12 April 2002, promptly supported by the Spanish presidency of the European Council, the failed embargo on oil extraction and the continued attempts at economic and social destabilisation of the country."
"All of this was carried out by the captains of industry and by sectors connected with the oligarchy that has exploited the Venezuelan people over recent decades, and which was actively and brazenly encouraged and supported by the US administration."
"The democratic and patriotic process is enshrined in the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, which was adopted in a referendum with the broad support of the people."
"In recent years, this process has sought to address the deep-rooted causes of inequality in Venezuela, and has responded to the most pressing needs of the overwhelming majority of the population."
"What Venezuela needs is support and solidarity with this process."
"We have always shown and shall continue to show such solidarity."
"The next item is the joint debate on the motions for resolution tabled by the following Members:"
"– Mrs Sandbæk, on behalf of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities, on Burma/Myanmar (renewal of sanctions) (B5-0127/2004);"
"– Mr van den Bos, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on Burma (B5-0134/2004);"
"– Mrs Kinnock and Mr van den Berg, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on Burma (B5-0138/2004);"
"– Mr Bushill-Matthews, Mr Cushnahan, Mr Deva, Mr Mann, Mr Posselt and Mr Van Orden, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on Burma (B5-0140/2004);"
"– Mrs Boudjenah, Mrs Eriksson and Mrs Morgantini, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on Burma (B5-0145/2004);"
"– Mrs McKenna, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on Burma/Myanmar (renewal of sanctions) (B5-0146/2004)."
"Mr President, for the fourth time within a year Burma is on the European Parliament agenda, and our resolution asks for renewed and stronger sanctions."
"However, recent evaluation shows that the sanctions previously decided were not even fully implemented."
"We know that the military regime's power relies heavily on foreign trade and investment, and they have chosen military expansion and defence expenditure to the detriment of the Burmese people."
"Burma's social indicators rank among the lowest in the world."
"EU investment in Burma has increased in importance over the last decade and EU Member States are amongst Burma's biggest investors and trading partners."
"The great majority of Burmese people are working in the informal sector, while the military establishment and its associates mainly own the formal economy."
"Economic sanctions, supported by Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD, would mostly hit the regime and its supporters."
"There is absolutely no justification for inertia and indecision."
"It would be a disgrace for the European Union and the Member States to continue a policy that does not weaken but, on the contrary, clearly strengthens the military regime."
"Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi is still under house arrest."
"Political leaders are imprisoned and the Burmese people brutally oppressed."
"The EU has the means and hence the responsibility to make a difference."
"It is time to translate our resolutions into actions."
"International diplomatic efforts should be resolutely pursued, but the EU must confront Burma's military regime through effective and fully implemented sanctions."
"Mr President, speaking on behalf of the Socialist Group, we realise that EU targeted sanctions against the Burmese military regime – the State Peace and Development Council – require review and renewal before 29 April 2004."
"When the Council initially imposed sanctions, they agreed to monitor closely the further evolution of the situation in Burma and reaffirmed its readiness to react proportionately to future developments."
"The situation, in our view, has not substantially improved."
"Aung San Suu Kyi, imprisoned until September 2003, is now again under house arrest where she remains without access to telephone communication and where visitors require government permission to see her."
"There are 1 350 prisoners, many members of the National League for Democracy in jail in Burma."
"Last week, the United Nations Special Envoy to Burma, Rosali Ishmael, had meetings with both Aung San Suu Kyi and General Kin-Yun, Burma's authoritarian leader."
"When he returned, he stated that the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and other detained NLD leaders was an essential pre-condition for any meaningful dialogue with the regime."
"The United Nations Special Rapporteur said that the most urgent requirements today are for the lifting of remaining restrictions on freedom of expression, freedom of movement, information assembly and association, the repeal of security legislation and the opening and re-opening of all political party offices throughout the country."
"There are numerous human rights abuses in Burma: forced labour, persecution of dissidents, conscription of child soldiers, etc."
"We also insist that the authoritarian government release its grip on power and that the results of the last election are allowed to stand."
"We demand that sanctions be strengthened if this does not happen."
"We equally insist that Burma should not attend the ASEM meeting scheduled for April 2004 in the Republic of Ireland, and that the presidency should refuse to issue the relevant visas."
"Mr President, speaking on behalf of the PPE-DE Group and the British Conservatives, the Burmese military regime, which euphemistically calls itself the 'state peace and development council', is a narco-dictatorship financed by heroin that brutally exploits and terrorises its own people."
"This includes forced labour, persecution of dissidents, forced relocation, conscription of child soldiers, as well as rape of ethnic minority women and children by government troops. These crimes are not committed by rebels or hidden guerrilla forces."
"The people of Burma suffer at the hands of their own government soldiers. There are 1 350 political prisoners still in jail in Burma, subjected to inhumane conditions, while the country's political hope – Aung San Suu Kyi – lingers under house arrest."
"It is simply intolerable that EU Member States remain one of Burma's biggest investors and trading partners."
"The EU common position on Burma must be strengthened."
"Sanctions must enter into force if the regime does not take meaningful steps towards the restoration of democracy."
"The common position will be reviewed in 2004, but the Council should also ensure that the situation in Burma is reassessed in June 2004."
"If these meaningful steps, such as the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and other detained members of the National League for Democracy Party, as well as tripartite dialogue between the NLD ethnic minority leaders and Burma's authorities, have not taken place, sanctions should be implemented with immediate effect."
"Sanctions should include the following measures: preventing EU companies and citizens from investing in Burma; banning imported goods and services from enterprises owned by the military, military personnel and their associates; banning the import of strategically important goods from sectors of the economy under monopoly, such as gems and timber; and banning international financial transfers and transactions either by a citizen or an entity of an EU Member State."
"I call upon other ASEAN states to cooperate with the EU on this issue and to exert greater pressure on the Burmese regime to take the necessary steps towards democracy."
"Mr President, Commissioner Solbes Mira, ladies and gentlemen, the military junta that seized power in Burma has taken root, benefiting from this Asian region’s regrettably fertile soil for dictators, and also profiting from the complaisance of Western States and businesses."
"A new peak in violence and repression affecting the suppressed and suffering population of Burma puts this country back on our agenda."
"This time, however, we refuse to be happy with declarations of principle and verbal condemnations whilst waiting for it all to begin again."
"The schedule is in our favour and the tools of repression against the oppressors are within our reach: to not make use of them would be failure to assist a person in danger."
"Two dates come to the fore to finally force the Burmese totalitarian regime to reason and surrender."
"By next month, 29 April 2004, the European Union common position must be revised."
"This month, officials of the Burmese junta are to go to Ireland within the framework of the Asia-Europe meeting."
"This event is as near as it is decisive in sending out a frank and definite signal to this junta."
"There should not have been any exception to the policy of banning Community visas for Burmese officials and those in charge."
"What a provocation of counter examples of our founding values that Ireland, currently holding the Presidency of the European Union, can welcome on its soil."
"What a shame, moreover, that Ireland, the symbol of European success, re-established diplomatic relations with Burma in February."
"This shows very well that over and above the official and impersonal statements from democracies, the interested parties with their roots in our countries are collaborating with these infamous dictatorships, supporting them and profiting from them."
"How many years did it take to decide to freeze the assets of Burmese dignitaries abroad?"
"How many mass graves and labour camps in Burma will it take before we refuse to grant our visas to the torturers of this country?"
"This resolution calls for the tightening of sanctions and restrictions targeted against this regime, as well as the immediate release of political prisoners, starting with our Sakharov prize-winner Aung San Suu Kyi."
"All we have done for a long time is ban any trade, investment and partnership that could benefit the leaders of this junta."
"The Burmese people deserve more than that and so does our enlarged European Union."
". Mr President, the Union has adopted a very firm common position in relation to Burma, which consists of an arms embargo, the suspension of defence cooperation, the suspension of all bilateral aid other than the strictly humanitarian, the prohibition of the granting of visas and the freezing of the assets of members of the military regime, members of the government, people collaborating with them and their families."
"High-level governmental visits have also been suspended."
"The Council’s working group for Asia has recently assessed the effectiveness of the measures and has reviewed the different options available to the European Union in order to respond to the current situation."
"At the moment, the response fundamentally consists of the application of specific economic sanctions combined with a series of constructive strategies with the aim of determining how to move forward the political dialogue with Burma and the neighbouring States."
"The Council’s groups are currently debating the renewal of the Common Position on Burma and it should issue its opinion before 29 April."
"Although Parliament must be aware that the Commission cannot have prior knowledge of the result of the discussions taking place in the Council, we cannot exclude at the moment the introduction of new sanctions specifically aimed against the regime and which may be additional or complementary to the existing sanctions."
"The Commission is still awaiting the release of Aung San Suu Kyi, a measure which we believe to be an essential condition for making the progress in the reconciliation process genuinely credible."
"The Commission therefore intends to continue providing the population with humanitarian aid and even to increase it."
"At the moment the humanitarian aid we send to the area, to the country and to the refugees in the neighbouring countries, amounts to EUR 10 million per year."
"On 15 December, the Forum for international support for national reconciliation in Burma was held."
"The Union supports the open process through the Burma Forum and believes that the Union must participate in that process on its own behalf."
"It is in fact a very positive advance and the Commission hopes that the Bangkok meeting may become a ‘Bangkok Process’ which acts as an instrument for securing a commitment from the international community."
"It is essential to support the work of Ismael Razali, special envoy of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, which should facilitate the debate between the State Council for Peace and Development and the other political agents."
"The Commission is pleased about the visit by Razali, scheduled for the beginning of March, which represents a final attempt to move forward the reconciliation process between the military government and the opposition, headed by Aung San Suu Kyi."
"I would like to make a final comment on possible additional sanctions."
"As I said previously, the common position is still awaiting revision."
"In the event that the Burmese Government does not introduce additional political changes, we will have to consider that possibility."
"Nevertheless, we must be very careful, since the effects of those sanctions on trade and investment must be evaluated in terms of their impact on the poorest sectors of the population."
"At the moment, certain sanctions adopted by the United States have led to significant redundancies in the clothing sector which are mainly affecting women workers, with a significant increase in impact in terms of human trafficking and prostitution."
"We must therefore seek a suitable balance between the need to respond rapidly to changes in the political situation and any reaction, which must be proportionate to the situation on the ground and cause as little harm as possible to the least-favoured sectors of the Burmese population."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Solbes Mira."
"The joint debate is closed."
"We shall proceed to the vote on the motions for resolutions within the vote."

"(2)"
"Parliament has completed its agenda.(1)"
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"– I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 11 March 2004."
"– Colleagues, in opening the part-session today, I feel it is appropriate to mark, in solemn fashion, the passing of a much-loved and remarkable former Head of State, Her Royal Highness Princess Juliana of the Netherlands, whose funeral service will take place tomorrow."
"The Queen Mother was monarch of the Netherlands from September 1948 until her abdication in 1980."
"As such she oversaw the extraordinary transformation of her country from the low point of the immediate post-war period, through decolonisation and onto the vibrant and prosperous nation we know today, which plays such a constructive and leading role in our European Union."
"She endeared herself to her people by her humility, her simplicity, her solidarity with the people – most particularly during the floods of 1953 – and her commitment to peace, cooperation and reconciliation."
"Our condolences go to Queen Beatrix, to the members of her family and to all the citizens of the Netherlands."
"I ask you now to observe a minute's silence."
"(1)"
"– I have been informed that Mr Christos Folias has been appointed Secretary of State in the Greek Government."
"I congratulate him on this appointment and note pursuant to Rule 8(4) of the Rules of Procedure the end of his term of office at the European Parliament with effect from 10 March 2004."
"By letter of 24 March 2004 the Greek Minister of the Interior informed us that Ms Meropi Kaldi has been appointed a Member of the European Parliament to replace Mr Folias with effect from 24 March 2004."
"I welcome our new colleague and remind Members that, under Rule 7(5), until such time as a Member's credentials have been verified or a ruling has been given on any dispute, the Member shall take her seat in Parliament and on its bodies and shall enjoy all the rights attaching thereto."
"The Latvian authorities have informed me that the term of office of the following three Latvian observers at the European Parliament has come to an end: Mr Juris Dobelis with effect from 18 March 2004, Mr Aldis Kuskis with effect from 18 March 2004 and Mr Rihards Piks with effect from 24 March 2004."
"The following have been appointed as observers to the European Parliament: Ms Silva Golde to replace Mr Rihards Piks with effect from 24 March 2004, and Ms Inese Slerere to replace Mr Aldis Kuskis with effect from 24 March 2004."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to give your attention, for a moment, to something that is not on the agenda, namely a rather extraordinary occurrence."
"I hope you will not object to my mentioning it, and I ask for your help."
"There is a Member of this House who has today made, in the German press, and to the , extensive and serious allegations against – in his own words – some 200 Members of this House, who he believes to be guilty of offences against the rules by which this House is governed."
"This has to do with the payment of attendance allowances and with who is entitled to sign the attendance registers."
"There is nothing new about this; it is something we have had to discuss on many occasions."
"What I do, however, regard as a very serious matter, is that the Member in question has today told the that he knows of 7 200 specific instances in which this has happened – 7 200 specific instances!"
"I believe this allegation to be so serious that I must ask you, Mr President, to get in touch with the Member in question."
"I would like to see these 7 200 instances brought before you, and I believe that the relevant supervisory bodies – whoever it is that has responsibility for this, be it the quaestors, the Committee on Budgetary Control, the Court of Auditors, OLAF – should deal with them."
"If there is evidence of illegality here, such breaches of the law must be investigated."
"If no such evidence exists, the fact that 7 200 offences have been alleged cannot be allowed to rest."
"What I ask you to do is to help the responsible authorities discharge their responsibility for clearing up any breaches of the law that have occurred."
"If though, what has been done is in conformity with our rules, then that must be established as a matter of fact."
"– Colleagues who travel to Strasbourg from Ireland on a Monday will know that it takes many hours to get here;"
"I was not aware of this matter until now."
"It is an issue of the utmost seriousness and I will treat it as such."
"Having listened to you, Mr Schulz, I will contact the Member in question and ask him to furnish me with some detail."
"I want to give an assurance – as I have already done at a meeting of the Conference of Presidents – that there has not been a single case drawn to my attention as political authority in this House that has not been fully acted on in accordance with the Rules of Procedure."
"I give that assurance today, and if there is evidence to support these allegations we will follow it up."
"But equally, if the evidence is not there, the honourable course of action would be to withdraw the allegations."
"– Mr President, I want to follow that up."
"Grateful though I am to you for this statement, I have something to ask of you."
"These are serious accusations, and serious accusations touch upon people’s honour and integrity, even if they are found to be baseless."
"If there is any substance to these accusations, the actions to which they refer must be punished."
"We are always being accused of looking after our own interests, so that if something is made available to you as President, that is not seen as investigating it sufficiently."
"So let me again ask you to consult not only this House, but also, where necessary, other authorities outside it; the Court of Auditors, for example, which could certainly check to see whether or not Members are obeying the rules."
"That is why I believe it is in the interests of all of us that these accusations should be brought out into the open and examined by an authority competent to do so."
"– Mr Schulz, I do not wish to hide anything from any appropriate authority, but as President, I do not want the details and facts behind the allegation to be hidden from me."
"If there is something worth looking at, then by all means let us look at it."
"The first duty, in terms of collegiality, is to provide the detail."
"Unlike you, I have not had the benefit of seeing the allegations."
"I would like to see the meat, not just the allegations."
"Mr President, unfortunately, as far as I am aware, our Rules make no provision for dealing with a Member who makes spurious allegations about colleagues, particularly in the context of an election campaign, which this clearly is."
"Having taken nine hours to get here, as you did, I have not had a chance to see the allegations either, but you can have no doubt that the College of Quaestors will give them the urgent attention they require, because I know they are causing immense distress to many colleagues."
"Also, in an election year, it perhaps adds to people's paranoia with regard to these matters."
"– Thank you, Mrs Banotti.(1)"
"– On 12 January 2004 I announced that I had received a letter from the French Minister for Foreign Affairs, including an annex containing a file concerning the disqualification from office of Mr Michel Raymond."
"Pursuant to the second paragraph of Rule 7(4) of the Rules of Procedure, the matter was referred to the committee responsible, namely the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"On 17 March the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market informed me that a majority of his committee, after examining the matter at its meetings of 27 January, 19 February, 8 and 17 March, had taken the view that Parliament should not take note of Mr Michel Raymond's disqualification from office until such time as the French , with whom Mr Raymond had lodged an objection on 26 January 2004, had reached a decision on the French Government decree of 25 November 2003."
"In light of that reference and of the advice given to me, I intend to follow the advice of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"Mr President, you will remember that I challenged the referral of this affair to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. I stand by that point of view and I ask you to look at this precedent more closely."
"At a time when we are about to open an electoral campaign, the fact that Parliament is able to protect its Members, even if they commit Community budget fraud, is, I believe, an extremely serious issue."
"The opinion delivered by the Committee on Legal Affairs is characterised by bad faith and a poor interpretation of the texts."
"It does this House no credit to hound any Commissioner who commits the slightest blunder as regards handling budgetary funds or to give undue protection to one of our Members who, for private gain, used and abused Community funds from the common agricultural policy."
"I deplore this decision by our House."
"– I take note of your point, Mrs Berès."
"You have indeed raised this matter before."
"I believe I was correct, in procedural terms, to refer the matter to the appropriate committee."
"As I said, it has been discussed on several occasions."
"I have offered no direction and have not sought in any way to influence the outcome of the work of that committee."
"I feel that the advice given to me follows the due process; it does not seek unduly to protect any Member of this House."
"If there are any further submissions on this matter from you or colleagues, I will refer them to the attention of the relevant committee.(1)"
"Mr President, I wish to express the sorrow that I feel, that we all felt, at the appalling devastation wrought by the Madrid terrorist attack and to express our sympathy and solidarity with the families of those murdered, and with the injured and their families."
"I should also like to express my profound admiration for the public-spirited and dignified behaviour of the people of Madrid, and for the extraordinary efficiency of all of the emergency services provided by institutions at state, autonomous community, city and municipality level."
"The maturity with which Spanish society has behaved, as in other communities afflicted by appalling man-made disasters, confirms Spain as a country that is rooted, both civically and democratically, in Europe."
"All of this took place without any xenophobic reactions or statements, and without any backlash against specific religions or countries."
"In light of everything that took place and the admirable behaviour of the people, it is essential that we adopt strong and democratic measures in the EU in the fight against terrorism. We must also, however, fight vigorously to prevent a militaristic polarisation of views and an ideology that is simply anti-terrorist from taking root in Europe and we must fight to ensure that our societies are never ruled by such ideology."
"Mr President, I appeal to the House and to the President to take every action possible in order to try to bring to an end the human rights abuses in Iran."
"The Iranian regime has been perpetrating severe human rights abuses for far too long."
"I appeal to the President to express the protest of this House to the Iranian regime and call upon it to bring to an end these human rights abuses as soon as possible."
"There was a major gathering of Europe's Iranian community in Brussels on 21 March, and there were heartfelt calls from Iranian exiles for a change to the approach of the regime in Iran."
"Every MEP in this House should back Europe's Iranian community in demanding human rights and in demanding justice for Iranians."
"– Mr President, on the night of 19 March, 23 young people died in a terrible bus accident in Konginkangas in central Finland."
"This collision between a bus and a juggernaut is the worst road traffic accident in the history of our country."
"A committee of inquiry has been set up by the government to investigate the causes of the accident."
"Was the extremely slippery road surface to blame, or rolls of paper loaded too loosely onto the vehicle; or was the accident that took the lives of 23 young people due to something else?"
"I hope that, in the future, Parliament too will be able to benefit from this committee’s investigation."
"At the same time, I would ask you when, in two weeks’ time, you visit Finland, to offer Parliament’s condolences to our people for this terrible accident."
"Mr President, I wish to condemn the arrest, by the armed forces of Colombia, of Rubiel Vargas, a member of the Executive Committee of the Columbian Communist Youth and correspondent of the independent news agency Ancol."
"This arrest comes two months after the arrest of Gabriel Becerra, Secretary-General of the Communist Youth and representative of the social and political front of Colombia, on 23 January."
"Luz Perly Córdoba, a trade unionist from the agricultural movement Campesina de Arauca, was arrested on 18 February and the communist Marίa Lucero Henao was murdered, together with her husband, by soldiers on 6 February."
"This is just a small sample of the persecutions suffered by communists and grass-roots fighters in general in Colombia."
"It illustrates just how hypocritical President Uribe was when he spoke of national reconciliation a few weeks ago, during the official reception which you and the few Members present in the House afforded him."
"Mr President, today marks the official enlargement of NATO from 19 to 26 members as the three Baltic Republics join Slovakia, Slovenia, Romania and Bulgaria – in effect all the current EU accession countries except Malta and Cyprus."
"Last week I was in Austria, where there is considerable political pressure for it too to abandon its cherished neutrality and join NATO."
"It is essential we support the ongoing stability of NATO, which is active in the fight against international terrorism, as evidenced by its out-of-area action in theatres as far away as Afghanistan."
"We must not let the ESDP undermine our alliance with the United States – the only military power spending serious money on defence – whilst all of the EU is cutting expenditure."
"We must also avoid duplication of effort with the separate planning and command and control structures of the ESDP."
"Lastly, we must reassure our Russian neighbours that NATO enlargement – particularly to the Baltics – is no threat to their security, and the rapid ratification by these states of the CFE Treaty would go a long way to calming Russian fears."
"Mr President, I would like to draw the House's attention to a very strange and preposterous statement made last week by the Rector of the University of Istanbul."
"Apparently – though I saw him saying these things on television – he said that Turkey has no reason to make any concessions to the EU over Cyprus and that it is easy for Turkey to resolve this matter by sacrificing 135 000 – he has even counted the number – of its soldiers in order to occupy both Cyprus and Greece."
"He made these preposterous statements to the great applause of his audience, which again, as it so happened, I observed on television."
"I am not saying that this incriminates the Turkish Government or that it incriminates the majority of Turkish public opinion, but if there is a section of public opinion which expresses itself in this way in Turkey, then we have to be more cautious in accepting Turkey and indeed cooperate with progressive forces in the country in order to bring about a real change of mind, without which there can be no real fusion between Turkey and the European Union."
"– I recently spoke at meetings with a number of NGOs in Istanbul, including students from the university there, who seemed remarkably more enlightened in their opinions than the rector who has the privilege to be in charge."
"Mr President, I rise to raise the case of Hans-Martin Tillack, a journalist arrested ten days ago by Belgian police, under instructions from OLAF."
"It was fairly heavy-handed stuff, I believe, with the gentleman being incarcerated for ten hours without access to a lawyer, and there are many other problems with the case."
"I wonder if you could raise this matter with OLAF because, on the subject of Eurostat, there did not seem to be the massive speed that was required for this case and it would be a much more interesting case for us in this Parliament."
"I am also very concerned about freedom of the press in Belgium and I wish you would take this up with the Belgian Home Office."
"Mr President, a dispute has arisen in Italy, to be specific in my region, the Trentino-Alto Adige/South Tyrol, regarding the ethno-linguistic census organised under the region’s statute of special autonomy and assiduously carried out by the German-speaking administration."
"This census runs counter to the principle of free movement as well as to Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data and in particular to Article 8 protecting the ethnic origin of citizens."
"Whilst possible infringement proceedings are underway against the Italian State, it seems that Commissioner Bolkestein directly agreed to a solution with the Governor of the Province of Bolzano, as the President himself announced after returning from a trip to Brussels."
"Considering that the Italian Government, which is responsible for this kind of negotiation, has already made an official protest, I would be pleased to know from Commissioner Bolkestein what the tenor of this meeting was: if it is true that a solution was agreed to or if the issue was simply discussed."
"– I see that Commissioner Bolkestein is here."
"He may choose to respond to your question at some other moment and in a different way, but it is not appropriate to put the question directly to him at this time."
"Mr President, I am addressing you on behalf of our fellow MEP, Mr Eurig Wyn, who is currently in Turkey as an observer for the local elections."
"He has asked me to inform you and our fellow MEPs of the fact that he has been denied access to the premises where the elections are taking place in various places in Eastern Turkey."
"I think he will be enlarging on this experience, which should be added to the reports of violence during these recent elections in Turkey, which has even resulted in deaths."
"This underlines once again that Turkey is failing to fulfil the Copenhagen criteria."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) recently awarded its World Press Freedom Prize to the Cuban journalist and writer Raúl Rivero."
"This incurred the usual wrath of the Cuban dictatorship and led to protests against UNESCO for giving this award to a writer and journalist who was sentenced to 20 years in prison, along with 74 other dissidents."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after this House awarded the Sakharov Prize to Oswaldo Payá, and in so doing encouraged Cuban dissidents and the fight for freedom in Cuba, we cannot remain silent. We must make the point time and time again that Cuba must respect human rights and that the tyranny of the Cuban regime is outmoded and out of step."
"Mr President, I should like to ask you to communicate with the Cuban authorities and express our concern for the political prisoners’ health and at the fact that they are languishing in Cuban jails."
"– I can do that."
"Mr President, the Greek Government's invitation to NATO to assume responsibility for the security of the Olympic Games provoked acute reaction from a very broad political spectrum in Greece."
"This is not just an insult to the Olympic spirit of peace, given that ΝΑΤΟ is a terrorist warmongering organisation , it is also an insult to the pacifist, anti-NATO feelings of the Greek people, as expressed on a daily basis in Greece."
"This turns Greece, as numerous sides have denounced, into a magnet for terrorist counterattacks."
"Clearly, both the measures to suppress and repress democratic freedoms and rights and the deep penetration of NATO into public and private life in Greece will not stop when the Olympic Games end, but will continue and become a permanent feature."
"That is how, on the pretext of security and combating terrorism, the Olympic ideals are being profaned and a nation is basically being bound hand and foot."
"That is how the immense hypocrisy of the pronouncements about the Olympic truce is uncovered."
"Interpreting the pacifist and anti-imperialist feelings of the Greek people, we condemn this situation and call on all those in the House who continue to take even a rudimentary interest in democracy to call for NATO not to interfere in the Olympic Games."
"Madam President, I would like to return to the issue of the extra-judicial assassination of Sheikh Yassin by the Israeli Government, which the European Union has vehemently condemned."
"I wish to express the hope that the European institutions come up with a major diplomatic initiative on this matter, because as we all know, the process will be permanently compromised if we simply tinker with things."
"I would like the decision to suspend the EU-Israel Association Agreement – a decision that Parliament had already adopted – to be reviewed. I would also like us to look into sending a peacekeeping force that would effectively protect the Palestinian population and a major initiative finally to be implemented to hold an international conference that genuinely kick-starts the entire process."
"Madam President, regarding the matter raised by Mr Heaton-Harris, six Belgian police officers assembled at 7.10 a.m. last Friday at a journalist’s private residence and removed lists of addresses and telephone numbers, business cards and four telephones and subsequently emptied his office at an international press centre of, among other things, 17 boxes of documents."
"His requests for permission to telephone his wife, employer and lawyer were all refused."
"The policemen also removed copies of private accounts. We are now in a situation in which OLAF is interested in seeing accounts belonging to journalists who write about fraud, but has still not requisitioned bank statements from those who have been perpetrating fraud."
"I should like to ask the President to see to it that we obtain a full explanation of, and report on, OLAF’s role in this matter, including too the Commission’s role in the decision to go to the Belgian police."
"I would also ask the President to ensure that we obtain a guarantee that the EU institutions will in future respect the freedom of the press and, especially, the important principle according to which journalists’ sources are respected."
"It is necessary in this connection to get the government in Belgium, where there is no law concerning the protection of sources, to guarantee that they will not intervene in the institutions when journalists write about scandals."
"– The next item is a joint debate on:"
"- Report A5-0079/2004 by Mr Skinner, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on the harmonisation of transparency requirements with regard to information about issuers whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market and amending Directive 2001/34/EC"
"and"
"- the recommendation for second reading (A5-0114/2004) by Mrs Villiers, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on markets in financial instruments, amending Council Directives 85/611/EEC and 93/6/EEC and Directive 2000/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Directive 93/22/EEC."
"– Madam President, I should like to thank the European Parliament for the great efforts it has made to approve, on time, two directives which are vital for the completion of a single financial market, namely the directive on financial instrument markets and the Transparency Directive."
"It is with pleasure that I take this opportunity to thank the two rapporteurs."
"I should like to ask your indulgence, Mr Skinner, but ladies first, as you know."
"I should like to thank Mrs Villiers for her report."
"Without her efforts and openness we would not have been able to achieve this consensual and balanced result."
"I should also like to thank the chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mrs Randzio-Plath, who succeeded in reconciling divergent positions among political parties and national approaches."
"The Commission considers that the compromise package that will be voted on shortly improves both on the Commission proposal and on the common position."
"The Commission can accept the compromise package in its entirety, that is Amendments Nos 54 to 82; in consequence the Commission rejects all other amendments."
"The scope of the pre-trade transparency obligation is now clearer, in particular with regard to the transactions to which this obligation applies."
"Other technical amendments – for example those concerning derivatives – provide useful clarifications without changing the orientation of the Commission proposal."
"The Commission is grateful that the compromise package does not include amendments on other political issues that had been fiercely debated in the Council; reopening those issues would have put adoption of the directive in danger."
"The final text will be a significant step forward in the integration of European financial markets."
"For the first time we have been able to agree a common market regulatory framework that will put our market at the forefront in terms of flexibility, innovation and investor protection."
"It deserves the support of a strong absolute majority vote of Members of this Parliament."
"I now turn to the transparency directive and the report by Mr Skinner."
"I should like to congratulate the rapporteur and thank, yet again, Mrs Villiers and also Mr Huhne, the shadow rapporteurs in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, as well as Mr Lehne of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, for their contributions and close cooperation."
"The Commission is ready to accept the compromise package as agreed with the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs, but will reject all other amendments."
"I shall hand out a detailed list with the Commission’s position to the European Parliament after this debate.(1)"
"On the interim management statement for share issuers, we agree on the compromise that has been tabled."
"The Commission will now monitor carefully how the agreed solution works in practice."
"The compromise package also comprises transitional arrangements for those third-country bond issuers in respect of bonds already admitted to trading on a European-regulated market before 1 January 2005."
"Some Member States – but not all – will make use of such arrangements in 2006, i.e. the date by which the directive should be transposed."
"I invite the national regulators of those Member States to do their best to ensure continuity for such bond issuers, pending the completion of the assessment of the equivalence between international accounting standards and third-country accounting standards at European level."
"It is in our interest that we make our capital markets as attractive as possible to non-EU issuers."
"Thus, if you decide to adopt the compromise package tabled before you, one of the final initiatives of the financial services action plan will have been completed in record time, with only a year having passed since the Commission made its proposal."
"Adoption after a single reading would be a major achievement."
"Madam President, it was very useful to hear that statement from the Commissioner."
"It will go quite a long way in sending the right signals in addition to many already issued in the bond markets and the markets in general."
"Commissioner, you are right to say that today's report on transparency obligations is a central plank of the financial services action plan."
"It brings certainty to the financial markets and underlines the process by which companies must inform investors."
"There was much debate amongst the various stakeholders, sometimes leaving us quite confused and with the outcome looking slightly opaque, but I believe we have here the correct blend and a very useful piece of legislation we can push ahead with."
"There are some issues which ought to be underlined."
"The first is that despite the original plan we will no longer have a mandatory approach to quarterly reporting."
"That is clear."
"Parliament was absolutely right in rejecting it and also clearly right in supporting a compromise which regularises and standardises detailed explanations, but does not allow for the mandatory approach already foreseen."
"The reason for this approach is that we wish to forestall any short-termism and we wish to balance this against the need for any costs."
"I particularly hope that this will settle a lot of issues and that we will not see a repeat in German courtrooms of what we are seeing at the moment in discussions between certain companies and certain bourses."
"Furthermore, the type of accounting methodology we need and the necessary reconciliation with third country issuers is dealt here as well."
"The agreement reached between Parliament, presidency and the Commission to pursue a reconciliation mechanism is absolutely vital."
"We must therefore not drag our feet on this issue."
"I also mention the ten-year grandfather clause contained in Article 26 which refers to half-annual reporting."
"This too, Commissioner, is contentious, and that is why Article 29 contains another reference to a review of this legislation within five years of its full entry into force."
"Hard facts have been difficult to ascertain in this short period."
"We need to watch this very closely and I am glad you used the words 'watch very closely' as well."
"Parliament welcomes a decision to bring forward urgently legislation in the company law action plan forcing all senior managers to reveal their compensation packages to investors at some time in the very near future."
"We will be pressing this cause very much."
"We regard it as something which could have been here, but we let it pass since you are going to bring it in later."
"We will, however, be watching very closely indeed."
"Furthermore, there is a great expectation that the Council will be as good as its word – as will the Commission – in supporting the voluntary initiative to make transparent all payments made by companies in the extractive industries to all governments."
"In Angola, 25% of the state's income – some USD 1.7 billion – disappears every year."
"The majority of this money derives from the extraction of oil, and because of the way the money is paid and reported, little is truly known of the corruption."
"Frankly, it is hidden because it is illicit and it goes to the very top of government."
"The oil companies meeting in Canada next week and the governments of the European Union and the institutions dealing with good financial governance need to force the pace on this issue."
"They need to change what is going on."
"Investors need to know and companies should not gamble with their reputations."
"Moreover, those who steal from their own countrymen should be stopped."
"For example, post-war Angola's need for money is tragic for thousands of poverty-stricken families."
"Infant mortality, health in general and education are still priorities in this region, and yet basic greed still thwarts solid progress."
"Calling on these companies to be transparent now would be a cornerstone in good governance and openness."
"In five years' time Parliament will judge progress made in this legislation and it will be looking to see that it is balanced by the approach of the Commission and other institutions in encouraging this progress."
"Finally, I would like to thank all the services involved in this report, particularly Margaret Cazalet in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, my own Group secretariat, Annabel Garner-Boulay, the presidency, the Commission, along with my colleagues both in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market for the great help they have given in drawing up a very balanced report."
"Madam President, I would like first to speak on the transparency directive on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, which supports this package from the presidency."
"We believe that quarterly reporting is dead."
"The changes we have seen on quarterly reporting have been very welcome."
"I am not sure that we need the publication of the statement contained in the compromise, but I do not see that as a particular problem, so it is an acceptable part of the compromise package."
"Mandatory quarterly reporting would have been extremely damaging and costly and would not have yielded real benefits in terms of transparency for investors."
"The transparency package also has vital clarifications on custodians and asset managers and sensible provisions on dissemination of information: ensuring fast dissemination across Europe, but allowing Member States the option if they want to require publication in a newspaper."
"I am particularly pleased with the result on bonds in relation to third country issuers."
"Many of their problems have been solved and I am pleased that elements of my amendment that looked at annual reporting and the issue of equivalence for third country issuers have been taken on board in the presidency package."
"On the ISD, I would like to thank a number of people: Mrs Cazalet from the Secretariat, my assistant Sarah McCarthy, the PSE Shadow George Katiforis, who has given me a tremendous amount of help, and Mr Karas, the coordinator of the PPE-DE Group, who has operated in a very fair manner on this very difficult dossier."
"I will be voting for the presidency package."
"I would urge other Members to do the same."
"I am concerned about it, however: there are many aspects of it which I think are unsatisfactory, but there is no doubt that it is much better than the common position, which is why I propose to support it."
"There are positive points in the package as will be agreed tomorrow. Execution-only services and direct-offer products will be permitted to continue under this directive."
"The framework for those products is more complex than I would like, but execution-only business can continue."
"I would welcome it if the Commissioner would confirm very clearly today that the new Investment Services Directive – ISD-2 – will not prevent people from using the execution-only services and direct offer products that they find so valuable."
"It is regrettable that the Council has rejected PPE-DE amendments on country of origin."
"But, having said that, removing most of the powers of host countries is very welcome and will contribute to cross-border trade."
"We are left with an unnecessarily complex framework for branches, but we are moving a step closer towards proper home country control and country of origin."
"I also welcome the inclusion of investment advice in ISD-2."
"It will plug the gaps that exist in some countries where advice is not properly regulated."
"This has an impact across Europe, because these services from poorly regulated countries could be sold right across Europe under the e-Commerce Directive."
"It is vital that we plug those gaps and give investors a proper conduct of business rule and advice protection."
"I also think investors will find welcome protection with the best-execution rule."
"I am pleased that many of the elements of the European Parliament's first reading amendments are included in the best execution provisions, and particularly a proportionate and pragmatic approach on best execution which recognises that while it is an objective standard, it is not an absolute standard."
"I also welcome an extensive framework of post-trade transparency, which will enable the markets to work better and provide welcome investor protection."
"On customer classification, I hope that ISD-2 is an improvement on ISD-1, where there was insufficient distinction between retail and wholesale investors."
"It is vital that we have a proper distinction, because each needs a completely different regulatory framework."
"Welcome technical clarifications on commodity derivatives have also been included, which will give the ISD framework the ability to adapt to innovation in the future in the commodities and derivatives markets, ensuring that new derivatives can be included in the framework in the future and thus providing more investor protection and greater legal certainty."
"On Article 27 and the concentration rule, after what was frankly a disastrous result in Ecofin, this has been something of a damage limitation exercise for Parliament."
"Speaking from a United Kingdom perspective, I think it is regrettable that Mr Boateng, the Minister representing the United Kingdom in that instance, was not able to get a better result."
"In our second reading in the European Parliament, we have succeeded in repairing some of that damage, but it was always going to be difficult to recover from what was an extremely difficult vote in Ecofin last year."
"While we have taken some steps forward, we have also taken some steps back."
"To that extent, ISD-2 is a missed opportunity."
"I fully supported the Commission's proposal to abolish concentration rules, but to a significant degree that attempt has been undermined by what has now been agreed on Article 27."
"It is a great relief that the threat of companies being required to quote for millions of euros' worth of shares has been averted."
"The move to standard market size from block size is very welcome and there are other important clarifications, for example, allowing firms better protection against multiple hits."
"But I still do not believe that we have got the best balance in terms of liquidity and competition."
"My aspiration was to produce a text which had effective transparency requirements and ensured good price formation without imposing regulatory burdens which were so heavy as to produce a concentration rule by the back door, and to damage liquidity provision."
"I will support the presidency package but I do not think it has got the balance right."
"The text still covers too many firms and too much business within the definition of systematic internaliser, possibly jeopardising a range of over-the-counter and traditional wholesale trading."
"It still leaves firms with significant regulatory burdens if they wish to compete with exchanges, and it is ironic that this piece of legislation is actively forcing firms to take on trading risk which the Basel II framework is telling them to limit."
"Article 27 will in many ways make it more difficult for firms to compete with exchanges, which means that sadly investors will not get all the benefits of a wide range of choice of services and reduced transaction costs that would come with a fully competitive market."
"I am sorry that we had such resistance to more competition from certain members of the Council."
"It is vital that this directive is implemented in a sensible way, both by the Commission, by CESR – 'Caesar' – and by the regulatory authorities in each country."
"If it is regulated in a sensible way, it will yield dividends in terms of increased competition."
"I would appeal to the Commission to ensure that it is implemented sensibly because that is the only way we will achieve real gains in terms of competition and liquidity for investors across Europe."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking to you in my capacity as the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market’s rapporteur on the transparency directive."
"I believe that the compromise proposal that has now been arrived at for consideration at first reading is a good one, and that, as a whole, it deals well with the basic objections that this House expressed to the Commission’s original proposal."
"We in this House have succeeded in avoiding a whole range of rules that would – if I may say so – have been superfluous and costly."
"Let me give as just one example the requirement for quarterly reporting, which would – as Mr Skinner said – have cost businesses a great deal, while yielding little."
"This directive is, after all, meant to prevent things happening in the way they did with Parmalat, Enron, WorldCom and other companies, all of which duly filed quarterly reports, and we can see what the end result was – so let us not burden business with unproductive measures."
"Secondly, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market attached significance to coherence and conformity with the directive on electronic commercial registers, in which we incorporated an option clause on publication media, enabling the Member States, depending on their own traditions, to make provision for the publication of required information in media other than the Internet."
"We have managed to get this rule incorporated in this directive too, thus, I believe, ensuring that two directives with similar subject-matter can – as we believe is essential – be handled in the same way by the legislators in the Member States."
"Moreover, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is satisfied with the solution that has been found to the question of debt securities."
"What came out of the deliberations in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs tended to make us rather concerned that we could be put at a disadvantage in negotiations with the Americans when it comes to implementing IAS."
"I believe that the rule that has now been devised on limiting ‘grandfathering’, avoids that, and that our negotiating position is no worse; we are simply making it more difficult for those who are already in Europe."
"All things considered, I am happy with this outcome and thank my fellow rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs most warmly for their cooperation."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, Mrs Villiers, Mr Skinner, let me start by saying that both directives are part of the Financial Services Action Plan and thus help to strengthen and complete the internal financial market."
"The second thing I want to say is that both directives are triumphs for this House and for the parliamentary codecision procedure."
"Thirdly, both directives, as they stand at present, have made substantial changes to the Commission draft and to the Common Position and have brought them more into line with this House’s point of view."
"Turning to the transparency directive, reference has already been made to the fact that the mandatory introduction of quarterly reports, as proposed by the Commission, for companies listed on EU stock exchanges is now off the agenda, and quite rightly too."
"The transparency requirements in the case of loans have been vastly improved."
"The wording on the publication of company information that has now been agreed on ensures that Member States can require their own companies to publish information in printed form."
"The requirement that information be disseminated simultaneously has been done away with."
"The only thing I can say about the investment services directive is that I would have been happier if Article 27 had specified a minimum account size, or if Recital 49 had been deleted, but it is important that the report has enabled us to steer a middle course between the various national interests, the European interests of the internal market, and our egoisms, and on that I warmly congratulate Mrs Villiers, the rapporteur."
"Thanks to her, three states that are highly important to the financial market – the United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden – are now on board, although they did not initially endorse the Common Position, and participants in the market can now avail themselves of a better directive."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, both the directive on the harmonisation of transparency requirements and the directive on financial services bring us today to the end of a difficult procedure, which required an immense effort as far as financial services are concerned, especially on the part of the rapporteur, Mrs Villiers."
"This is a matter with huge technical and political difficulties and, without her tremendous diligence, I doubt that we could have reached a conclusion."
"That is why I should like to congratulate her on all her hard work."
"The fact that we are arriving today at a final conclusion represents an achievement by Parliament and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and demonstrates that delays in legislation, when they occur, are not due to Parliament’s negligence."
"The purpose of the directive on investment services, about which, as shadow rapporteur, I should like to say more, is to revive the European passport for businesses in the financial sector."
"Of course, the European passport is not a new institution, but it had languished due to the difficulties created by the differences in the national legislation of the Member States in the cross-border activities of companies and, by extension of course, in the free movement of capital in Europe."
"The new directive proposes measures for homogenous and harmonised protection of investors, especially small investors, in the various Member States."
"It also proposes terms of equal competition between the stock exchanges and investment companies."
"This issue is one of the most thorny and complicated we have to address, because we face new phenomena on the market here, with entire stock exchanges being converted to private companies and entire private companies operating as sort of mini-stock exchanges and clearing huge numbers of transactions."
"We have reached a compromise on this very difficult issue which, like all compromises, is not to everyone’s absolute satisfaction, but it was necessary in order for us to move forward."
"Implementation and experience will certainly bring problems and shortcomings to light and in a few years’ time I am certain that we shall need a new directive which, one hopes, will be another step towards combating national barriers and creating the truly pan-European capital market needed in order to develop the European economy. This is also in keeping with the Lisbon process."
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists supports the agreement reached with the Council on the directive on investment services and, of course, it also supports the report on the harmonisation of transparency requirements for financial services."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, I should like very much to thank the two rapporteurs, Mrs Villiers and Mr Skinner for their extraordinary work and for their energy and persistence during the negotiations with the Council."
"I would also thank Commissioner Bolkestein for these two important parts of the financial services action plan."
"We can now create a common financial market within the EU."
"That is incredibly important and, just as Mr Katiforis says, it provides the opportunity for economic growth, continued competition and more job opportunities in line with the Lisbon process, which is proving far too slow."
"If we are to be able to achieve our objectives, it is important for investors and consumers to be able to rely upon the financial markets and their players."
"People have lost confidence in them because there have, unfortunately, been many scandals in recent years."
"We must therefore create credible regulations that are neither too ponderous and bureaucratic nor, however, too lightweight."
"Where the directive on investment services and regulated markets is concerned, the rapporteur has done some exceptional work."
"I think that Mrs Villiers has shown a special ability to achieve reasonable and understandable compromises."
"I should like to say that she has been a very good European."
"It is the view of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party that the committee’s amendments do a good job of balancing the requirements of investor choice and investor protection, as well as creating rules for soundly operating financial markets within the EU."
"I recognise that Mr Huhne and I might have gone further, but we can live with the compromises."
"They provide the opportunity for continued competition between different trade centres."
"The amendments also mean the disappearance of what are termed the concentration rules."
"Finally, a few words about Mr Skinner’s report."
"I myself have had difficulty with the committee’s wanting to delete the Commission’s proposals concerning mandatory quarterly reporting."
"Those countries that have introduced such reporting think that it operates well."
"That is also the view of the Stockholm stock exchange."
"One market player I talked with considered that those who could not account for their companies’ results and give their views on their companies’ futures each quarter had no place on the stock exchange."
"Now, there is a sensible compromise which, at a pinch, can be lived with: half-yearly reporting with a possible review of the directive within five years."
"Madam President, thanks to the corrections made by the Council – corrections that Mrs Villiers is unhappy about but accepts – we have arrived at a text for the Investment Services Directive (ISD) that is deemed acceptable by all parties."
"I will not turn my nose up but all the same I want to say that we are agreeing to a change without being too sure where it will lead us."
"Removing the order concentration rule from the areas in which it still exists means allowing competition between three systems."
"Will the conditions for competition be fair?"
"It is clear that companies established in the City, and mainly US companies, have done a lot to promote their own interests."
"The risk is that they will capture a major share of the European market, to the detriment of other actors, and that they will thus exercise significant control over the financial resources of the various Member States of the Union."
"The Council and the Commissioner have, however, ensured a degree of balance and have not exempted companies from the transparency obligations."
"They can still avoid these obligations if transactions involve above-average amounts."
"I am told that small countries and even some large countries are still controlling the national market share, but I doubt that this division will be viable and we do not know what strategies the various actors, including the stock markets, will adopt."
"Are the conditions of general interest well established?"
"Can we deter the abuse and insider trading that internationalisation allows to flourish or, in any event, allow to flourish and can we ensure a high-quality price formation process?"
"This appears unlikely."
"For example, the volume of above-average transactions that will be exempt from pre-trade transparency requirements might account for 50% of the total for the most liquid shares on the Paris stock exchange."
"Our successors will thus have to supervise the implementation of a directive that is essential and complex but which lacks clear balance."
"We would advise them to be as vigilant as possible."
"As regards the directive on the transparency obligations, we have ended up with an overall compromise that is the result of good work."
"I will, nonetheless, state some reservations."
"What is most positive is clearly the rejection of the obligation to provide quarterly accounts. Equally positive is the fact that the law of the country of origin will not apply as far as of issuer liability is concerned."
"On the contrary, our demands concerning complete information about the size of a company’s finances and about the social and economic impact, were rejected by the Council and postponed until a later directive, as were, furthermore, our demands concerning information on the remuneration of company directors."
"I believe that this is a mistake."
"The most serious issue, however – and this is neither the fault of the rapporteur nor of the directive – is that the quality of information essentially depends on accounting standards and that the situation in this area is extremely serious."
"When the European institutions gave full power to the International Account Standards board and gave a commitment to apply these rules as of 2005, I think that they made a very serious mistake."
"Estimating the basic value of companies, banks and insurance companies mainly according to the market price – deemed to be ‘fair value’ in the prevailing climate – is a source of bias and fundamental insecurity."
"I therefore suggest that we act very firmly against any illegitimate compromise on Rules 39 and 42 and that the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (Efrag) and its resources are strengthened as a matter of urgency and, if necessary, the 2005 deadline is put back."
"Madam President, I think that everyone here is relieved to see these two directives finally adopted after so much work."
"Over and above the collective relief that we feel, however, some of my fellow Members and I would like to continue to ask questions about the Investment Services Directive."
"This is a system, the impact of which few of us have assessed."
"We are legislating for tomorrow, with the aim of avoiding financial difficulties and imbalances, and in the hope that the system that we implement will provide the best means of ensuring the financing of our economies as a whole, and not just of the financial sphere."
"I ask myself the question: do we finally have a compromise that will allow for the solid and transparent harmonisation of our financial markets?"
"Have we really given ourselves the means to avoid the shocks and scandals that we hope to avoid on the European stock markets in order to allow our economy to safeguard everyone’s interests?"
"We are opening up the monopoly of the regulated markets and we can hope that this new competition will provide access to cheaper products and will lead to more liquid markets and, therefore, to the best use being made of resources."
"The original compromise, the only one to work – which consisted of opening everything to the market whilst guaranteeing the smooth functioning of the market through greater transparency – was not fully observed and that was the aim of the discussion has taken place to date."
"We have known for a long time that the markets need the best possible financial information in order to function, so that there is optimum price formation and so that actors have access to the same indicators, if we want decisions to be rational."
"From this point of view, I regret the fact that our Parliament has not been able, in conjunction with the Council, of going further in defining the size of the market and that we allowed, on this issue too, a key point in negotiation and which provided balance in the text to be left to our experts and for the next stage of the regulatory process."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in this debate, I would like to ask you to give special attention to Article 17 of the Transparency Directive, which deals with the dissemination of what is termed price-sensitive information."
"The compromise proposal, as adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, creates, in my view, another problem."
"Indeed, the amendment refers to officially designated mechanisms for the central storage of regulated information."
"Needless to say, I have nothing against a central storage facility for price-sensitive information, but I wonder whether such facilities should be officially designated on a national basis."
"In my opinion, this will open the floodgates to creating, or retaining, monopolies in the field of the dissemination of information."
"As I see it, the forming of monopolies is completely at odds with the directive's objective, particularly the removal of national barriers in terms of transparency requirements and the improvement of efficiency, openness and integrity of the European capital market."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, the adoption of both directives today is a welcome development."
"For a start, I am glad that the acceptance of the directives in this form means that two directives that are significant in terms of the Financial Services Action Plan have been adopted before this Parliament has run its course."
"It is important that we have managed, in the life of this Parliament, before the elections, and before enlargement, to lay the foundation stone of an integrated financial market that will add to Europe’s appeal, all the more so in comparison with the US."
"Secondly, I am glad that we have got this far, primarily largely thanks to Parliament, along with the Commission."
"The compromises and guidelines arrived at by Parliament at first reading demonstrated the goodwill of everyone concerned, among whom I would particularly single out Mrs Villiers, who succeeded, by means of a dialogue that disregarded party and national divisions, in finding a way forward that ended up being acceptable to the Member States."
"I regret the way in which the Member States repeatedly showed, right to the end, how little they are willing and able to pursue a shared objective."
"One of the things the investment services directive is about is more competition between the systems, which differ within the EU."
"This is about more competition, along with transparency, pricing, and protection for consumers."
"If we are to build Europe, the Heads of State or Government must come to realise that this cannot be a matter of one system prevailing over another."
"On one side there are the big investment banks; on the other, the smaller banks, the savings banks and cooperative banks."
"I think we in this House have done a good job, both in terms of its substance and of the time it has taken."
"I want to say something brief about the transparency directive, namely that I am glad – although I take a rather different line from the Commission on this – that we have not got the rules on quarterly reporting that had been proposed, which I believe would have added little value in relation to the extra effort and additional bureaucracy."
"I therefore believe that adopting these two directives this week, and within the life of this Parliament, will add up to a good piece of work on our part for Europe as a financial marketplace."
"Madam President, we have taken another two steps forward in the financial services action plan, and fortunately not one step back."
"I am talking mainly about the Transparency Directive and the criticism concerning mandatory quarterly reporting."
"Whilst I can settle for the compromise that is now before us, what I do regret is that reports are not subject to more requirements in terms of content."
"I have made three proposals to that effect."
"The first had to do with the provision of information about management salaries and bonuses in annual reports."
"The Commission has meanwhile announced that it intends to table a separate proposal on this, so that was a successful action."
"The second was about the reporting of payments to governments, specifically by extractive industries."
"This was the wish of NGOs – like the publish-what-you-pay-campaign – as well as the well-intentioned elements among those companies themselves."
"These companies are happy to abide by an obligation and, as a consequence, competitors that do not yet report these payments or bribes on a voluntary basis would no longer be able to engage in unfair competition."
"A recommendation to that effect has now been included in a recital to the directive."
"That is a partial success that deserves to be followed up."
"The third point was the reporting, in a verifiable and readily understood format, of what companies claim to do by way of socially responsible business management."
"Unfortunately, this point has not yet been included in the text, but I would nevertheless like to bring it to your attention once again."
"This is not, therefore, about forcing companies to do business in a socially responsible manner, but the moment a company boasts about all the good things it does, that should appear transparently and clearly in a verified report, as happens with financial conduct."
"I am reasonably satisfied with the ISD Directive."
"From the outset, I have attempted to build a bridge between the opposing views and interests, and have used my own touchstone in the process."
"In-house matching by large banks, which breaks the monopoly of the stock exchange, is, from my vantage point, positive and can, under the conditions that we are now stipulating in the compromise, offer additional opportunities for investors and for entrepreneurs who need capital."
"The compromise has become neither a purely English City directive nor a stock exchange directive, which, on account of the theoretical abolition of the concentration rule would nevertheless lead to a monopoly of the stock exchange."
"This middle way has resulted in the proposals I tabled at first reading being adopted."
"I think that with regard to supervision, additional provisions by the Council have been included, which I also welcome."
"In that respect too, therefore, this directive has been given the green light."
"Madam President, first of all I would like to thank our rapporteur Mrs Villiers, who has demonstrated remarkable patience in the light of certain positions and changes of direction during this long procedurewhich has finally ended in the compromise on which we must vote tomorrow."
"As our rapporteur has rightly said, this compromise has failed to achieve its basic aim."
"Specifically, the directive should set down Community rules applicable in all the Member States, in order to create equal conditions for the various actors and to allow banks and other financial institutions to enter into competition with stock markets and offer their customers the ability to internalise."
"As you know, France, Italy, Spain and Belgium do not currently authorise these sales outside of stock markets."
"The factor that brought France and Italy around to the common position was that financial institutions have to make their quotes public before the transaction and must keep to a fixed price."
"As you know, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Sweden and Finland rejected this common position."
"I would also like to state that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs rejected it, by adopting Mrs Villiers’ report in February."
"At least the compromise reached continues to partially respect Parliament’s opinion by limiting the price transparency obligation to sales of securities that are smaller in volume than the standard market size."
"To summarise, the compromise that has been submitted to us is a poor compromise, but, with a heavy heart, I will nevertheless vote in favour of it for two reasons."
"Firstly, because of the risk of going back to the common position – which is even worse and would damage the financial sector even more – and, secondly, to avoid having to go into conciliation with a new Parliament that is less well-informed in this field."
"In particular, I deplore the position of the socialists and above all of their coordinator, Mr Goebbels, who have done nothing to ensure that the position championed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is adopted at second reading, when this would have been much more beneficial for consumers and for investment firms."
"– Madam President, the proposal for a directive on transparency requirements is a very important part of the Financial Services Action Plan and is meant to harmonise the transparency requirements for securities and for those who issue them."
"In implementing the directive, not only the Commission, but also, of course, the national supervisors, will have a major role."
"If we are to have an internal market, the information on offer to purchasers of securities must be comparable and reliable, and issuers of securities must not be put at any disadvantage."
"We must therefore be guided by the principles enumerated in Recital 26a."
"A well-developed capital market needs credibility, which itself demands an increasing degree of transparency, all of which, taken together, enable national economies to compete better."
"It is no coincidence that those Member States that have high levels of share capitalisation, and whose stock exchanges enjoy high levels of turnover in relation to the gross national product, also enjoy more growth and have less unemployment."
"So it is that in Finland and the Netherlands – as you, Commissioner, know better than any of us – stock exchange turnover has multiplied since 1995; ten times over in one and six times over in the other."
"A study recently published in Austria demonstrates that there is also a significant positive correlation between share capitalisation and stock trading on the one hand and, on the other, the amount spent in a national economy on research and development."
"In all these complex economic interactions, confidence and information play a major role."
"In Austria, for example, the stock exchange legislation requires the most important companies, which are quoted on the Stock Exchange, to report on a quarterly basis, and so it is possible and practical, given the current state of the internal market, for there to be an upgrading to quarterly reporting at national level without any further obligations being imposed."
"Congratulations to Mr Skinner!"
"– Madam President, the intention behind the draft directive on stock exchange transparency is to improve protection for investors, to foster greater confidence among them and to cut capital expenditure."
"It is also meant to promote investment in Europe’s financial markets."
"I support it insofar as it aims to do these things, but it has been necessary, on a number of occasions, to adjust its course."
"Most of my amendments were accepted, and Mr Skinner was amenable to compromise, so we were able to improve the Commission draft at crucial points."
"One of them, to take an example, was Article 6, which dealt with quarterly reports."
"If they are to function properly, financial markets need reliable information on companies, but what investors value is the quality of the information rather than the frequency with which it is supplied."
"Neither in terms of costs nor of resources are small- and medium-sized enterprises able to cope with quarterly reporting."
"I am pleased to say that we have together been able to delete Article 6."
"A second example is the medium whereby issuers disseminate information."
"In Article 17, the Commission insisted that company information should be published only on the Internet and that notifications should be sent out only by email."
"We can see from the example of this House how we are constantly deluged with emails, and the appalling amount of junk data that we have; are investors supposed to work their way through that sort of thing in order to get at the quality information?"
"I think it would be utterly impossible."
"We have improved matters by including print media, which are the form of publication used by companies quoted on stock exchanges."
"Not only have we been able to ensure the inclusion of such print media in Article 17, but we have also succeeded in deleting the clause that imposed exclusive use of the Internet."
"I am glad that we have been able to do this."
"Mr Skinner’s report is a balanced one and we in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs quite rightly adopted it by a large majority."
"I have advised my group, that of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, to give it overall support."
"Madam President, Commissioner Bolkestein, Mr Skinner, Mrs Villiers, I believe that this Parliament can be satisfied with the work carried out on such an important issue and, in particular, on the directive on markets in financial instruments."
"It was also possible to achieve this result thanks to the valuable work carried out by the rapporteur Mrs Villiers, who has already been praised by Members, and who was capable of listening to different points of view and drawing up a solution that was sound and could be agreed upon."
"As we know, negotiations with the Council were difficult at times but I believe that the compromise, on which we will be called upon to vote tomorrow, includes the important requests – or at least some of them – that were put forward by Parliament."
"The compromise succeeded in taking account of the procedures, characteristics and individual practices of the economic and financial systems in the different Member States – I am thinking, for example, about the case of Italy – without, however, making excessive concessions to the protectionist allures of some of the systems or to those who would have wanted to see a single model implemented."
"The solution upon which we will vote tomorrow will, moreover, offer new possibilities to investors in those countries that had, instead, opted for the market concentration rule."
"The principle of competition between trading systems, which should offer alternatives to regulated markets, was readily agreed to."
"The liberalisation of trading activities on listed financial instruments and the promotion of greater operational decentralisation will reduce the obstacles to entry for service and trading providers, which will lead to a reduction of the operational costs and an improvement in the quality of services."
"Competition will, therefore, encourage innovation and efficiency."
"To conclude, Madam President, I announce that the radical Members of the Lista Bonino will vote in favour of this compromise."
"– Madam President, there is not much more I can say, since only a few questions have been addressed to the Commission."
"Firstly, I should like to reassure Mrs Villiers on one point: I can confirm that the new Article 19 will allow the execution-only business to go on under conditions that will now be harmonised at Community level."
"Mrs van den Berg mentioned two points."
"In agreement with her, I should like to say that the compromise acknowledges that investors must be provided with better information on executive remuneration."
"The topic is currently under review, as Mrs van den Berg quite rightly said, in the context of the action plan on modernising company law and enhancing corporate governance, an action plan dated 21 May 2003."
"I think Mrs van den Berg would agree with that."
"In addition, a push will be given to the movement that favours more transparency on what the extractive industries pay to governments."
"Whilst maintaining a voluntary approach, the compromise gives a clear signal to Member States to encourage more transparency from issuers in their annual reports and within the framework of current international initiatives, such as those taken by the World Bank."
"I now come to a point raised by Mr Mann and Mr Skinner concerning the way in which information should be disseminated in Europe."
"A reasonable compromise has been found."
"The compromise is neutral as regards the use of any technology, thus neither excluding newspapers nor electronic means."
"Furthermore, it would be made clear in a recital that a home Member State may always request publication of regulated information via newspapers, in addition to other measures of dissemination."
"I now come back to a matter raised again by Mrs Villiers, and also Mrs Berès who, unfortunately, has left the Chamber."
"In reply I should like to say that, obviously, during the implementation of the ISD the Commission will make every effort to find a balanced solution."
"To that end, CESR, the Member States and parliaments will be fully associated."
"Finally, the whole process of adopting implementing rules will be fully transparent."
"All market participants will have the opportunity to make known their views."
"Lastly, I would regret it very much if Mrs Lulling were to vote in favour After all, we cannot really allow that, so I hope that she will reconsider and will vote ."
"– Thank you very much, Commissioner Bolkestein."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at noon."
"– The next item is a motion for a resolution (B5-0156/2004) by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the protection of air passengers’ personal data."
". Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we have to decide on our opinion of the adequacy of the so-called light agreement which the Commission and the Council intend to conclude with the American authorities."
"I should like to remind you that in March of last year, Parliament indicated that in its view, the present situation, with unlimited provision of information to the United States, should end."
"Parliament repeated this request in October last year and asked the Commission to indicate what information can be passed on legitimately and without any risks."
"Parliament has also asked for the immediate replacement of the present ‘pull’ system by a ‘push’ system, and for negotiations on an international agreement to provide European citizens with real guarantees and the same legal protection as American citizens."
"That is crucial and lies at the heart of this discussion."
"What is now before us is a so-called light agreement, an agreement in which, to all intents and purposes, this House is off-side."
"After all, our approval is not required; all we can do is to make a recommendation."
"In my opinion, a deliberate decision was made in favour of a light agreement, while we had specifically asked for a heavy agreement."
"Indeed, a heavy agreement would have involved Parliament, whereas now, we are to some extent off-side."
"The Article 29 Committee, the group of experts, has stated that this agreement is inadequate, I, as the rapporteur, would suggest to Parliament that we act upon their opinion."
"After all, what is happening?"
"As early on as in Article 1 of the agreement, it is stated that the existing situation, in which unlimited information is provided to the United States, can be sustained until such time as a ‘push’ system is developed, which, as it happens, it has not been, and neither is it in the pipeline."
"We have taken advice on how long it can take before a ‘push’ system is in place, and I have included that in my resolution."
"A ‘push’ system can be in place within three months, and in actual fact, has been in place already, because we were told in December that such a system was underway."
"What we are therefore doing now is to legitimise what we have considered to be illegitimate on two occasions."
"Meanwhile, we are put under extreme pressure, both by the United States and the Commission, to rubberstamp the agreement, while we are uncertain as to its exact purpose."
"On the one hand, it is stated that it aims to fight terrorism, while, on the other hand, it is also used to fight serious crimes."
"These are not defined, though, which I find extremely objectionable."
"Parliament has asked for an agreement in which the role of the airline companies is clearly indicated, how they are protected and what the guarantees are for passengers, enabling the latter to correct their details."
"We have also asked for an agreement in which the liability of airline companies and governments is regulated in the event of errors in code transcription."
"Meanwhile, we have gained some practical knowledge involving the United States."
"My colleague, Mr Sörensen, has asked, after having travelled to the United States, to peruse his details with a view to changing them if need be."
"After two months, he received a reply, stating that he is not allowed to peruse his details, because that would expose the US strategy."
"If we look at legislation in the United States, we have to conclude that the Privacy Act should provide some level of protection."
"I have asked the United States to inform me specifically what this protection would consist of, and have not had a reply to date."
"The Patriot Act also plays a part in this."
"As a matter of fact, pursuant to this Act, any citizen who is suspected of terrorism can be indicted, without having any access to the courts."
"In short, the judicial process in the United States is not sufficiently regulated."
"The protection of our citizens in the United States is not sufficiently regulated."
"There is no level playing field where European and American citizens are concerned."
"We are therefore discussing a matter in which we, should we approve it, would miss the mark altogether."
"It has been suggested that we would not be prepared to fight terrorists, but it is not about that at all."
"On the contrary, we have asked the Commission three times to table our own proposal which could also apply in Europe."
"Neither is this about bad relations with the United States."
"That is completely unrelated and should, in my view, not come into the discussion in any way."
"It is about us having to protect our citizens and them being able to expect this from us, in the same way as US citizens can expect this of their government."
"– Madam President, this is not the first time that this House has been asked to give its attention to this important and complex issue."
"From the very beginning, all those involved have recognised the difficulty of finding the answer to the question in front of us: what is the right balance between security demands and civil liberty?"
"We tackle this against a rather sombre backdrop."
"Just before the weekend, the European Council agreed on a strong package of measures to reinforce the anti-terrorism efforts of the European Union."
"I know that Parliament will not want to send any equivocal messages about terrorism."
"At the same time, we all agree that the fight against terrorism cannot and must not be carried out at the expense of the protection of fundamental rights such as privacy."
"Against this background, I would like to invite Members to reflect carefully on what this resolution – if adopted – could possibly achieve and to check whether this corresponds to our objectives."
"I dare to say 'our objectives' because the Commission and the Parliament can surely agree on what our goals are."
"Firstly, to cooperate to fight the scourge of terrorism without sacrificing fundamental civil rights and liberties."
"Secondly, to free airlines from the threat of being caught between contradictory legal requirements with which they have to comply."
"Thirdly, to make sure that such transfers are made in a clear and secure legal framework."
"Fourthly, to foster a cooperative and balanced relationship with the United States."
"Fifthly, and most importantly, to improve the protection given to air passengers and to their data that are transferred to the United States."
"For over a year, the Commission has been negotiating with the United States with a view to meeting these objectives."
"I ask you frankly: does the motion for a resolution in front of us pay sufficient attention to the significant progress that has been achieved?"
"The Commission certainly wanted more and pressed hard for more over long months of tough negotiations."
"But, as Members of this House know from their day-to-day dealings, the result of negotiations is rarely, if ever, perfect."
"We must also be honest with ourselves: our own delivery of our high data protection standards is far from being ideal."
"Recent Eurobarometer results show worryingly low levels of knowledge by European citizens about their rights and obligations."
"So let us be cautious before preaching to the rest of the world."
"The key question today on this file is: can we realistically achieve more?"
"The resolution asks the Commission to tell the United States that its concessions are not enough."
"Furthermore, it seeks to open new negotiations with a view to reaching a better solution."
"The list of demands in the resolution is no doubt a very fine one, but will it take us closer to our objectives?"
"In the light of my experience over the last 12 months I am afraid I have to inform the House that this is pie in the sky."
"The results of rejecting this package will not be a better package, but no package at all."
"Having no package does not get us one inch closer to our objectives, which I thought we shared."
"It certainly does not lead to better data protection in the United States."
"We would be simply throwing away all those hard-won improvements."
"It certainly does nothing either for future EU-US cooperation."
"We can only influence the United States if we are credible interlocutors."
"Credible interlocutors deliver results."
"Delivering nothing after a year of negotiations does not meet the credibility test, and believe me, there are voices in Washington only too ready to say to Secretary Ridge 'We told you that negotiating with these people is a waste of time'."
"There is therefore a real risk that the United States will leave the negotiating table and not return."
"Defenders of the resolution by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs may say that this is an unlikely disaster scenario and that the Commission is just running scare stories to justify its own poor achievements."
"Of course, the proof of the pudding will only be in the eating, but if I were a Member of this Parliament, I would not bank on it that the aims of the resolution are achievable."
"Please ask yourselves whether it is likely that the United States will suddenly double the amount of change it is prepared to make and do so by June, as the resolution demands?"
"Members of this House have had their own contacts with American representatives over the last few months, and I am sure you have formed your own views about their openness to our arguments."
"The resolution and its defenders also point to obtaining passengers' consent to the transfer as the 'magic' solution while we skilfully negotiate a new and better deal."
"Let me repeat the Commission's full and active support for measures that ensure that passengers are fully and accurately informed and, where possible, give their agreement."
"But that should be in addition to – not instead of – the actions we have taken to improve protection in the United States."
"Over the last year, Parliament has been an extremely active and outspoken participant in this debate."
"In doing so, it has undoubtedly strengthened the Commission's position in its negotiations with the United States."
"Clearly, Parliament should not be silent at this stage."
"I was indeed expecting some further expressions of concern and constructive criticism."
"Of course nobody is asking Parliament to say that it approves of and espouses the American system and approach."
"Indeed, the Commission itself does not espouse the American approach part and parcel, nor will we stop trying to achieve improvements in it."
"Indeed, I am currently still in touch with the American authorities with a view to firming up and clarifying their commitments regarding the conditions under which they will be able to forward passenger data to third-country authorities."
"So, we are still working to improve the situation even further – and will continue to do so – before the Commission takes its final decision on an adequacy finding."
"It is one thing to say that what is on offer is not perfect, and quite another to seek its complete derailment – as the resolution as it stands does."
"That is why I would ask you to reject this motion for a resolution."
"To conclude, I shall summarise the choice before Parliament."
"Rejection of the motion will allow the Commission's proposed package – the improvements in data protection that we negotiated with the United States – to go ahead."
"Among these major improvements there are annual joint reviews to enable us to keep a close eye on things, and a clear cut-off date after three and a half years."
"It would also end legal insecurity and remove threats of sanctions for the airlines."
"I have no doubt there would be positive spin-offs for EU-US cooperation."
"That is the first choice."
"The second choice is adoption of the motion for a resolution, which would mean foregoing those advantages in return for a declaration of principle and a wish list that – I am sorry to say – cannot realistically be delivered."
"Madam President, we are once again debating an issue in this House with which we are all only too familiar."
"In fact, since data on passengers whose final destination or transit destination is the United States was first forwarded to the United States more than a year ago, this Parliament has expressed many concerns about the completely unacceptable way in which this information has been and is still being forwarded."
"Today, however, we are once again debating this issue, but in rather different circumstances."
"Firstly, because we have before us a Commission decision which describes the level of protection that the United States guarantees for the data forwarded to them as ‘adequate’, and, secondly, because the recent tragic attacks of 11 March in Madrid – following on from those of 11 September – oblige all of us to reflect and accept that only through international cooperation can we triumph over a brutal and merciless enemy which attacks free and democratic societies such as ours."
"Ladies and gentlemen, my group is not entirely satisfied with the decision the Commission is presenting to us."
"It even shares some of the criticisms expressed by the rapporteur in her report."
"But what shall we do?"
"Shall we go back to the beginning?"
"Shall we wait another year?"
"Are we going to concern ourselves with strengthening legal safeguards as much as possible while terrorists move freely from one continent to another and mercilessly murder thousands of people, who – incidentally – have not been given any right to defend themselves?"
"Let us be realistic."
"Let us accept this new legal framework for cooperation with the United States despite all our reservations."
"Let us subject it to a test period and, if necessary, revise it later."
"The general public, who are horrified by all this violence, would not understand any other option at this time."
"The negotiations held between the Community authorities and the United States authorities have led to agreements, the importance of which I believe must not be underestimated: we have managed to reduce the data that will be forwarded, to restrict the purposes for which they will be collected, to restrict the time for which they will be stored and to ensure that our citizens have mechanisms allowing them to correct that data and lodge complaints in the event that these are used improperly."
"Furthermore, following a period of three and a half years, the agreement could be revised in the light of the results achieved."
"In saying this, I am not implying that the agreement reached is ideal in every way, but that it is satisfactory in some respects."
"Furthermore – as I have said – circumstances have changed and have done so in a tragic way."
"The European Union – and this was demonstrated by the European Council, which has just been held – has fully and firmly declared war on terrorism."
"Effective action in this regard requires cooperation and coordination to be promoted within the European Union, between the police and judicial authorities of the Member States and between the bodies which the European Union has created for this purpose – of which I would highlight Europol and Eurojust – but also through cooperation with third countries, and there is absolutely no doubt that we share with the United States the common objective and firm intention of beating the scourge of terrorism."
"In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the agreement we are debating today and which has been the subject of an excessively critical report by the rapporteur, strikes a reasonable balance between implementing much-needed security measures and safeguarding civil rights."
"The agreement also provides citizens with a level of protection and legal certainty that we would lose if we decided to refer the Decision back to the Commission, leading to a further period in which there would be a legal vacuum."
"Madam President, I thank the rapporteur for the work carried out and for the excellent proposal for a resolution that she drew up, a proposal with which I fully agree."
"It is all too clear that the United States, like any other country that seriously wants to combat terrorism, has the right to carry out any type of inspection into the identity of those entering their territory, their reason for entering and the time that they are staying."
"To this end, the European Parliament has often hoped for and continues to call for an international agreement defining what personal data of air passengers must be automatically transferred in advance to the United States security agencies, what further data can be requested, who can use them, how long they can be kept for, what responsibility airlines have in case of error in the transcription or transmission of data and, above all, what redress is offered to passengers in the event of error and what appeals are possible in the event of infringements of their rights."
"Despite the long negotiations, the unilateral commitments made by the United States do not provide the guarantees requested or an adequate level of protection."
"This is because these undertakings do not constitute a binding international agreement, in fact, it is explicitly stipulated that they do not result in any right for any public or private party. It is also due to the fact that a huge amount of personal data, which varies according to the practices of individual companies, is obtained through direct access to different airline archives."
"These data are collected for private purposes and might be different if collected for security purposes: for example, all those who failed to leave the United States on the return flight that they booked could be considered suspects."
"Now we are all used to buying return air tickets simply because they often cost less than single tickets."
"If we were to reply to a question from a policeman or a customs official concerning the date of our return, we would give the exact date and not the one appearing on the flight ticket that we do not intend to use for the return journey. The date that will be considered, however, is the one that appears in the airline records."
"Do you see what serious misunderstandings could be created by the uncontrolled use, for security purposes, of data collected for commercial purposes?"
"The same goes for the accuracy of data, such as the correct and complete spelling of names."
"Personally, I am still waiting for the Council to reply to an urgent question on the serious misfortune of an Italian citizen, arrested on his arrival in the United States and sent back to Europe because of a misunderstanding, without being able to offer any explanation."
"A European manager who is a victim of a similar misunderstanding and thus unfairly considered a suspect could see his career ruined."
"How could he get justice?"
"It is wrong and dangerous, even to effectively combat terrorism, to depend on the arbitrary collection of data that were not specifically selected for security purposes, and it is unfair not to provide for quick and effective instruments to guarantee the rectification of incorrect data for those concerned."
"I recall that Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union states that ‘everyone has the right of access to data which has been collected concerning him or her, and the right to have it rectified.’"
"The Commission’s decision does not respect Community law or the Union’s principles."
"The Commission goes beyond the powers conferred on it by Article 25 of the directive on the protection of data when it states that the United States provides adequate protection of the rights of European citizens."
"It is not true that it is impossible to obtain a more adequate result."
"The US associations for the protection of fundamental rights are themselves calling for better legislative protection in their country."
"Mr President, the Commission is in an unenviable position."
"Airlines are almost certainly breaking the law on data protection by giving the US authorities confidential information about their passengers."
"To take action would harm our airlines and may lead to disruption in travel to the US; not to act rides roughshod over individual privacy in the European Union."
"The Commission has sought to reach an agreement with the United States."
"The concerns about this agreement are widespread."
"They are shared by the Article 29 Committee, and quite possibly by the heads of state and government meeting last weekend, who amended the draft presidency conclusions on this issue."
"They are very much borne out from this House in this report."
"In the United States widespread criticism of methods adopted by the government in the fight against terrorism is evident, whether it is to do with the policy of detention without trial or the way in which the heavy hand of the state is being imposed in areas like this."
"The Commission's proposed deal on the transfer of data is a deal too far: more information is sought than is strictly necessary; that information can be held too long with no right for the individual to correct it; there is no right to compensation for people denied boarding of aircraft and no legal redress against abuse of personal data by the state."
"Liberal Democrats believe that it is possible to be tough on terrorism and true to the treaties we have signed on civil liberties."
"We bow to nobody in our determination to fight terrorism."
"We urge our Member States to act more effectively."
"We recognise the need to work with democracies across the Atlantic; but let us do so intelligently, with a response that is measured and proportionate, and not sacrifice our freedoms in our determination to fight those who threaten them."
"Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur for her considerable work on this issue and to say that my Group will support this report."
"The point has already been made – not least by the Commissioner – that there is an issue here about balancing security and civil liberties."
"It is our job as parliamentarians to scrutinise proposed agreements and to hold the line in terms of civil liberties."
"My Group believes that the balance is wrong in this agreement, because there is a lack of certainty on the protection of information."
"It seems, in many respects, to be a fishing policy – a wide trawl with the hope of catching something, and who cares about the by-catch, as it were."
"We have already heard about the question of those refused boarding."
"What happens to them?"
"What happens to their employment prospects if they cannot get into the United States because some of their details do not look right?"
"The issues of appeal and redress are crucial in any legal situation."
"We are already aware that certain European Union airlines have been fined considerable sums of money by the United States for not supplying full data."
"Certainly the attitude that we have heard from them is that they are quite willing to see the American Government in court over these particular fines."
"This also raises the issue of whether our own institutions, despite the difficult situation, have the right effectively to override our own data-protection rules and controls in an international context."
"Lastly, on the issue of passenger consent: it becomes totally meaningless if it has no result but to sign away rights that you were never sure you had in the first place."
"So we shall support the report."
"Commissioner Bolkestein, we will never agree on the balance between security and freedom if we do not first agree on the fact that this balance must be put into practice in respect of the law."
"Commissioner Bolkestein, for 13 months the law of 15 countries of the European Union and even Community regulations have been violated every day."
"You have not dealt with this."
"We should not have gone into negotiations such as these in the position of weakness of a party willing to give up respect for and enforcement of its own law."
"Of course, today we are in a weak position because we were already in a weak position when we entered negotiations."
"The US security authorities can in no way demand that airlines illegally transfer personal data."
"This is only possible because you, Commissioner, all of you, the European Commission, the Member States and the majority of those guaranteeing privacy accepted all of this."
"There could have been an alternative solution: a solution, for example, that provided for the preparation by the US security authorities of simple visa mechanisms, on the basis of which the individual would provide personal data, not to the airline company for commercial purposes, but to the security authorities."
"You did not want to implement this solution because, just as the United States is doing, you are preparing to allow data that is collected for commercial purposes to be used for security purposes."
"This is contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights."
"Combating terrorism by tolerating illegality for 13 months is a true picture of what this Europe is doing; and ‘Mr Terrorism’ has been appointed on the same basis."
"Europol and Eurojust do not provide for any democratic control, or for any control by the Court of Justice."
"This is no way to build an antiterrorist Europe!"
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is no place for emotion in this debate."
"Terrorists have no fear of our debates, nor of directives or regulations; the only thing they fear is real and effective action."
"We will have to get on with taking appropriate steps to protect ourselves and the European public."
"What this means is that we have to act rather than holding interminable debates."
"What we need is cooperation within the European Union and cooperation with those outside it, specifically with the United States of America, but we do, obviously, expect certain ground rules to be laid down for them and, of course, we expect them to be obeyed."
"We have proposed, and the Commission has agreed, that certain expectations would have to be met, for example that the only data forwarded would be such as would help to combat terrorism, that data would be stored for decent period of time, which we demanded should be reduced, that only one authority in the United States would have access to it, that it would be possible to monitor what was done with it, that passengers had to be informed and that the European public would have an EU authority to represent them."
"Those – among others – were our demands, and we were assured that they would actually be complied with."
"If they have been, and if we can also set up a ‘push’ system with filters, then we should use the opportunity to seek out others with whom we can cooperate in the fight against terrorism."
"We are one step away from bringing this to a close."
"We should see to it that we take prompt action, before it is too late for the European Union and for the security of its citizens."
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to warmly congratulate Mrs Boogerd-Quaak on her excellent and clear political analyses and on her perseverance."
"That perseverance will yet come in useful."
"I will repeat myself yet again: it is necessary to fight terrorism, but not all means are justified."
"The agreement we are discussing today is one such means, which overshoots the mark when it comes to fighting terrorism."
"Although the Commission, in its adequacy finding, has concluded that the United States offers a suitable level of protection for the passenger details that are transferred, I am not all that convinced."
"The present agreement offers EU citizens insufficient guarantees."
"There are no satisfactory legal means for citizens who get into difficulties, as has been demonstrated in the examples that a number of Members have given. Moreover, it is explicitly stipulated that the details can also be used for other purposes, such as the domestic fight against crime in the United States."
"In that respect, the third party to which the details are passed on is not specified, and it is very difficult to monitor what happens to them."
"The Article 29 working party has come to the unanimous conclusion that this agreement contravenes European legislation."
"In fact, the Council, too, carefully mooted the idea in February that the American measures might be in conflict with European national legislation and this doubt, as Mr Watson has already remarked in relation to the most recent European Council, has not been taken away – quite the opposite."
"It therefore looks as if the Commission is the only institution still holding to its conclusions concerning the suitable level of protection."
"Maybe the time has come for the Commission to acknowledge the error of its ways and admit that it has gone beyond its remit."
"The present proposal is inadequate and that is why the Commission has to submit a fresh proposal, one containing sufficient protection mechanisms for the European public."
"For nearly a year now, European legislation has been broken under the pretext of fighting terrorism."
"If the Commission is so convinced that this agreement meets European legislation and does not contravene the Treaty, it is really beyond me why it is not prepared to apply the procedure of Article 300 of the EC Treaty and have the Court of Justice carry out a few verifications."
"I am therefore pleased that this option is still open in the resolution before us."
"Indeed, the fight is not over by a long way."
"Mr President, I very much support the rapporteur's position."
"I agree with everything she said."
"I was quite shocked at the Commissioner's attitude towards Parliament today."
"It was extremely arrogant, to say the least."
"Parliament has adopted a position much more in line with the Treaties than that of the Commission."
"The Commission should ensure that the Treaties are complied with and that data transfer complies fully with EU legislation on data protection."
"Last March Parliament asked the Commission to do this."
"However, what it seems to have done is to have gone away and come back claiming that it has adequate levels of protection."
"The Commissioner said that adequate levels of protection from the US is the best he can do and that Parliament's attitude is irresponsible."
"I do not believe that is justified."
"That is a cavalier attitude towards long-fought and established civil liberties."
"What has been said today is in relation to access to data, trying to correct errors, the purpose for which this data will be used, where else it might go and, in particular, the right of people to legal redress."
"People's lives could be dramatically changed as a result of incorrect data held on them or mistakes that have been made."
"Why should European citizens have a different level of protection from US citizens?"
"Ideally I would like to see an immediate termination of PNR transfers to the US until we have a permanent legislative solution in place."
"This is not the way to fight terrorism."
"If we push aside the rule of law and long-established civil rights, we will not only allow the terrorists to win on one front, but allow them to win on all fronts."
"We are creating a very dark and oppressive future for everyone."
"This is not the approach that should be taken."
"Civil liberties have to be upheld."
"One only has to look at the United States to see the measures that have been brought in, in recent times, to combat terrorism."
"They do not work."
"The Patriot Act and other measures do not work."
"All they do is suppress the rights of ordinary law-abiding citizens, without them having any right to legal redress."
"I do not believe that this is the way forward in the 21st century."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I recently wanted to fly to China."
"In order to do this, I had to apply for a visa and provide a whole array of highly personal details."
"As well as flying from Frankfurt to Peking, I was planning to take a connecting flight with a Chinese airline from Peking to Guilin, and this involved some of the data being transferred from one airline to another, a process that enables the Chinese state to get its hands on a plethora of personal data."
"I have to tell Mrs Lambert that I am unaware of there being any sort of data protection law in China, nor can I ask who there is storing my data, or which data are stored for any particular purpose;"
"I cannot ask for it to be corrected, contact the Chinese data protection supervisor or take the government to court."
"Despite that, we are not banning flights to China or demanding general agreements."
"Now there is, I know, a great difference involved here, in that, when you fly to the United States, their system can directly access or ‘pull’ your data, rather than it being ‘pushed’ over to them, so that the United States have direct access to our systems; they are not limited to the data that we forward to them."
"Let me add, Commissioner, that the demands we are making now bear no relation to some sort of wish list; this is European data protection legislation, in black and white."
"The obligation is now on you to switch over to a ‘push’ system."
"What I would like is a response from you, and right now. Failing that, I appeal for more calm."
"The fact that different standards of data protection prevail does not mean that citizens’ rights are under threat."
"The United States has a legitimate interest in this instance, that being in the defence of their country."
"I doubt whether other countries could claim the same, even though they disregard our data protection legislation."
"I might add, ladies and gentlemen, that I never got to China, because I had not submitted my visa information in good time."
"Unfortunately, I had no legal remedy against that either."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there can be no doubt about the need for us to combat the growing menace of international crime and, most importantly, of terrorism."
"There can also be no doubt that close cooperation is required, both at Community and at transatlantic level."
"What concerns me, however, is that we might be undermining the healthy balance between security and justice by promoting a comprehensive system of vigilance over every single passenger, every single citizen, thereby violating the principle of proportionality, which, in any democratic society, must always be complied with."
"Commissioner Bolkestein asks us what message we wish to send out to our partners."
"What we must send out is a clear message that we wish to cooperate on our common objectives whilst complying with our laws."
"Indeed, we received a most welcome contribution from the Article 29 Group, containing the nineteen essential items of information that strike me as sufficient to protect passenger security. We would also like assurances as regards the retention of this information, a right of appeal and the manner in which it is to be used."
"Commissioner, what kind of message did we send to the citizens, in March 2003, when Parliament deemed the transfer of passenger name records (PNR) unacceptable, in case guarantees were not provided for adequate levels of protection and of compliance with the Community rules in force?"
"Or in October 2003, when we saw that the Commission’s own conclusions indicated that the protection offered was considered inadequate?"
"Commissioner, you have heard speeches on the dilemma that you have posed Parliament in a vote on this proposal for a resolution."
"Let me ask you a different question, in order to get to the crux of the debate: what has changed since March or October 2003 to justify Parliament’s change of attitude?"
"Mr President, frankly I must say that, emotionally speaking, my speech will be different from one that I would have made before 11 March 2004, that is to say before the tragic events that took place in Spain."
"Let us be honest: we had partially accepted, or at least we had become accustomed to the 11 September tragedy and therefore the issue concerning the data requested by the United States also fell within a normal dispute over legitimacy."
"I believe that we need to start with the assumption that, no matter what, citizens must be clearly informed in advance of the fact that they are going to face such requirements and, consequently, such control."
"Citizens also need to be just as clearly informed of the use and the destination of the information, particularly information that goes beyond mere personal details and can, for example, reveal membership of a religion, of a political movement or indicate tastes or habits of an extremely sensitive nature."
"On this subject, I would like to mention Directive 95/46/EC, which I quoted a short while ago pertaining to a request for clarification directed at Commissioner Bolkestein on the linguistic census in South Tyrol."
"I hope, Commissioner, to have an answer sooner or later, before the day is out."
"There is a principle that is also valid in this case, that is to say where Article 6(1)(c) states that the personal data that are collected must be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are collected and/or further processed."
"Precisely: I believe that the phrase ‘not excessive in relation to the purposes’ gives the debate a much wider scope."
"The purposes are known: this is about combating terrorism; and – quite truthfully – doubts are being alleviated, at least as far as I am concerned, and I am also managing to overcome my doubts about the number of agencies that have access to the data, about the fact that an immediate access system is used, about the absence of appeal procedures and many other aspects."
"If I consider the fact that this is all for a purpose such as the one that we are aware of – combating terrorism – then I consider it a necessary sacrifice for a higher purpose."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the EU must of course be part of the international fight against terrorism, and the conclusions from last week’s European Council also show this."
"The conclusions offer a clearer analysis of the issues surrounding the guarantees of legal certainty and the democratic control that is to safeguard the measures concerned."
"It is high time that the EU took seriously the balance between, on the one hand, combating terrorism and other crime and, on the other hand, preserving fundamental rights."
"The new terrorism tsar should work in tandem with a privacy tsar."
"If the political will existed, it should be possible right now – before the Constitution has entered into force – to guarantee democratic scrutiny."
"The EU must not gamble away respect for privacy and private life."
"Europe is a forerunner in this area, and Article 29 of the committee’s objections gives rise to great concern."
"The objective is, of course, a global solution that has to provide people with the same high level of legal certainty."
"The fight against terrorism is much more difficult and needs to be tackled in a much greater variety of ways."
"This solution will not do away with all forms of terrorism, but it looks sometimes as though people believe it will."
"Finally, I wish to point out the following."
"It is an extremely unsatisfactory situation we are in."
"Commissioner Bolkestein has just shown this through his speech."
"Even before Parliament adopts a position on the issue, the Council has gone and stated that it intends to accept the American demands, leading one to wonder why, in such a situation, Parliament has to have an opinion at all."
"Irrespective of how the voting goes on this issue, I would call upon the Commission tirelessly to go on striving for better protection of legal certainty, as well as for protection against terrorism in many forms other than just the present one."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank you all warmly for your remarks, but I should like to add something."
"The fact is that I am a little thrown by Commissioner Bolkestein’s statement."
"He said: ‘we are still negotiating and we will then determine whether what we are doing is adequate’."
"However, in my view, there was an adequacy finding before us, which you described as being in order."
"You have to make up your mind: either it is in order or it is not."
"To Mr Pirker, I should like to say that according to the Dutch Personal Data Board, there are 1 800 enforcement and law enforcement bodies in the United States that could retrieve this data."
"There are still a huge number of uncertainties and if even the European Commission is uncertain, why should Parliament give its approval at this moment in time?"
"I am quite convinced that, if this continues, we will have to ask the EC Court of Justice to advise us whether, in its opinion, this agreement is adequate and whether a light agreement can be concluded which intrudes into the data of EU citizens so drastically."
"This is the only road that is open to us, and we have to take it because this light agreement has been decided on."
"Commissioner, I would ask you again to withdraw this agreement and present a better one."
"– Mr President, I should like to thank Members of Parliament for their various comments."
"I will reply briefly to some of the points, starting with the Mr Watson's remarks."
"He is no longer in the Chamber, but no doubt he will take cognisance of the report of proceedings for this sitting."
"Mr Watson said that the Article 29 Working Party has rejected the adequacy finding, which the Commission has proposed."
"That is perfectly true."
"In reply I would say that the Article 31 Committee has approved the Commission's findings by a qualified majority – in fact, 13 voted in favour and 2 against."
"The two Member States which voted against were Luxembourg and Italy."
"My second remark addresses comments made by Mrs Boogerd-Quaak and Mrs Paciotti on requests for access to own data."
"The American commitments cover access in what the Commission calls a satisfactory way."
"We must verify that the commitments are complied with in practice and there are means to monitor this."
"Furthermore, the joint review and the possibility for European data protection Commissioners to intercede would see to that."
"Mrs Paciotti also mentioned international agreement in the longer term."
"The Commission is seeking a multilateral solution through the ICAO but that, as Mrs Paciotti will agree, will take time."
"I return to Mrs Boogerd-Quaak's comment on an international agreement that would legalise the pull system."
"Mr Pirker also remarked on that."
"I should like to stress here that the Commission is committed to a switch from pull to push and, although that is principally a matter for airlines, it is preparing actions which will facilitate that switch and make it possible in the coming months."
"It is necessary to provide a legal basis for pull until the push system is in place."
"Nonetheless, this provision of the international agreement must not become an excuse for the introduction of push to be delayed."
"Mr Cappato said that the Commission should drop its initiative for a European policy on PNR."
"The fight against terrorism is a global one."
"The European Union cannot afford not to develop its own policy in that area, which is considered to be an important contribution to the global fight against terrorism and organised crime."
"Last Thursday the European Council welcomed the Commission's intention to make a proposal by the middle of this year."
"It called on the Council to act on this before the end of the year."
"The Commission will, of course, take care that its proposal is fully respectful of civil liberties in general and data privacy rules in particular."
"Mr Cappato also criticised the non-application of the law."
"I take it that remark and criticism are addressed to the data protection authorities in the Member States."
"As Mr Cappato and other Members will realise, the data-protection directive is 'policed' by Member States and not by the Commission."
"Mrs Swiebel referred to Article 300 of the Treaty, concerning the international agreement."
"The Commission does not see the need to consult the European Court of Justice on the legality of the agreement or the adequacy finding."
"Mr Santini and others asked about passengers being informed – or not – about their rights."
"The obligation to inform passengers rests with the data controller – in this case, initially the airlines, subsequently the United States Government."
"The US undertakings contain a clear commitment in that regard."
"The Commission is working with the airlines and the travel industry to ensure that citizens have access to full and accurate information that they should receive at the appropriate time, ideally before they purchase their tickets."
"Lastly – and in general terms – I repeat what I said earlier, that the Commission does not espouse or approve of the US approach, but it shares some of the views about its effectiveness."
"However, we have to be realistic and we should take the improvements that are now on offer."
"Thus, it is not that we espouse the American approach, it is just that the Commission is at pains to stress that this is the best possible solution and that no other is on offer."
"– Thank you very much, Mr Bolkestein."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at noon."
"– The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0135/2004) by Mr Bösch, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the protection of the financial interests of the Communities and fight against fraud – Annual Report 2002 (COM(2003) 445 – C5-0593/2003 – 2003/2248(INI))."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 2002 presented us with another sharp increase in misuses, mismanagement and irregularities in the European Union, with which we had to deal."
"If we add together the cases reported in the Member States and what OLAF brought to light – some years earlier, it must be admitted – then we are talking about over two billion euros."
"I cannot recall a time when this sum was as substantial."
"Let me stress that we are talking here about irregularities, and we know that, in the course of further investigations, only a fraction of these irregularities will turn out to be fraud."
"Speaking as a representative of this House, I want to make it clear that this is where the various analyses that appear in the media do not go far enough."
"Particularly at the end of a parliamentary term and of a Commission’s term of office, the amount involved is enormous, and cannot be regarded as satisfactory."
"The increase is particularly marked in the case of the Structural Funds, where the sums reported have trebled – from around EUR 200 million to over EUR 600 million."
"This is where the question arises of how conscientious Member States are about reporting irregularities."
"There are still different ways of interpreting things, and disputes as to what is to be reported and how, and it is quite simply incredible how a country like Belgium can report 14 cases to the Commission and Italy 107, while Germany reports nearly 2000 cases."
"From that we know that there is a massive lack of harmonisation here, and I say this with particular reference to the reform of the structural policies, among others."
"Those of us who sit on the Committee on Budgetary Control do not do so in order to record the history of our times; what we want is to take the weaknesses of the former policies and develop from them strengths for the future."
"I can make this claim only in respect of my own share in the work."
"Something similar applies where the recovery of funds is concerned."
"What is the point, Commissioner, when it comes to fraud prevention, if one has to wait almost decades before the money is returned?"
"One particular Member State, Italy, has been waiting for recovery for many years already."
"That is an open secret, as is the fact that it is being used as an instrument of policy."
"The second major area is that of agriculture."
"Our Committee has for a long time sought to get the Commission and the Member States, once and for all, to do away with export refunds and, most of all, with those paid for the unspeakable, because pain-filled, unethical and cruel transport of live cattle."
"It defies comprehension how, in 2002, of some 262 000 live cattle, the export of which cost us some EUR 62 million of tax revenue, 226 000 could be delivered to a small country like Lebanon."
"We have indications, which we have to take seriously, that Lebanon does not by any means possess the capacity to absorb, consume, slaughter or process this number of animals itself."
"Commissioner, we can remember the case, not so long ago, when a sudden increase in meat exports to Jordan was eventually explained as the circumvention of UN sanctions against Iraq."
"I cannot therefore understand why the Commission is again, ostrich-fashion, burying its head in the sand and pleading ignorance."
"We call for OLAF to get involved in this. I am not talking about prevention;"
"I am just waiting for the first animal rights activists to accompany these exports and for us to see the first pictures in the media."
"This is what European taxpayers’ money is being used for."
"There is a third point I would like to mention: a few days ago, we heard of the unprecedented raid on a journalist’s home, not – contrary to what we have read today – in connection with anything that happens here in this House, but in connection with the case of Paul van Buitenen."
"We would like to raise the issue of how OLAF has handled this case."
"We well remember the reprimand given to OLAF in connection with this by the European Ombudsman."
"We recall how OLAF’s investigations can commence only where there is well-founded suspicion and that they must be of appropriate duration – in other words, they must not be artificially extended."
"We would ask the OLAF Supervisory Committee to state whether, in this instance, these rules have been broken and whether or not this investigation has been misused for the purpose of putting journalists under pressure or of intimidating them."
"Mr Kendall, the chairman of the Supervisory Committee, has informed me that this will be an item on the agenda of the Committee’s next meeting, in April, and has also confirmed to me that OLAF did not seek the Committee’s opinion before calling in the Belgian justice authorities."
"One member of the Committee, Mr Noack, told the press that, if the Committee’s inquiries led it to the conclusion that OLAF’s actions were unacceptable, then the dismissal of its Director-General was not to be excluded as a possibility."
"Let me stress at this point how important the Supervisory Committee’s report on this matter will be to us."
"This is the test case for whether the monitoring of OLAF works or not and for whether or not the necessary action is taken when things get out of control."
"With this in mind, I can do no other than warn those in positions of responsibility within OLAF against hiding themselves behind Belgian justice."
"There must be no exceptions: everything that OLAF has done in this matter so far, everything that has been passed on to the judicial authorities, must be submitted to the Supervisory Committee."
"We need this matter to be clarified, and soon; not in months, but in a few weeks."
"– Mr President, Mr Bösch, ladies and gentlemen, from the very outset, it was a matter of fundamental concern to the Commission under President Prodi that the administration of Europe’s finances should undergo extensive reform and that they should be protected against fraud."
"The decisive action we have taken has achieved a great deal."
"In carrying out our reforms, we have been guided by the report produced by the Group of Wise Men, which your House appointed at the end of the previous Commission’s term of office."
"The clear apportionment of responsibility has been central."
"It is those who administer Europe’s funds who bear full responsibility for the proper handling of them."
"Centralised financial control has been done away with, a course of action that was long overdue."
"The division between financial control and policy management was a relic of a time when Europe still had a very small budget."
"Now, at last, we have the sort of structure that is taken for granted in the Member States, with individual ministries being responsible for the proper spending of their budgets."
"What happened in Eurostat during the nineties, with accounts being set up and administered outside the Budget, forcefully reminded everyone of the old system’s deficiencies."
"The Commission has, however, retained a central internal audit office, the importance of which was underlined when, as long ago as the summer of the year 2000, it was placed under the Vice-President of the Commission."
"OLAF was established as an important and new anti-fraud body, intended to be fully independent in uncovering, by way of administrative investigations, fraud and irregularities within the institutions and in the external sphere."
"Where will you find the like of it in the Member States?"
"In this, the European Union is ahead of the field, and it is of course encouraging that some of the new Member States are taking OLAF’s structure as a model."
"As well as establishing and extending OLAF, the Commission has introduced a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach to combating fraud; we have promoted the development of a culture of prevention not only by faultproofing legislation, but also by drawing up ethical standards for the Commission’s staff and detailed provisions to protect whistle-blowers."
"In combating fraud, we have stepped up operational cooperation with the Member States."
"What makes this essential is the fact that it is the Member States who administer some 80% of the expenditure from the Community budget."
"In this respect, OLAF is developing a true platform of services for the Member States."
"The anti-fraud report for 2002 – which is what we are discussing today – shows that the Member States have made greater efforts to safeguard the EU’s finances than they did in the past."
"It was in 2002 that the Convention on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests at last entered into force."
"Even so, as Mr Bösch’s report shows, there is still more to be done."
"As one would expect of him, Mr Bösch has produced a comprehensive report dealing with a whole range of issues related to fraud prevention, and from various angles."
"I would like to turn my attention to one aspect to which you, Mr Bösch, have just referred, and that is the issue of export refunds."
"It is true to say that export refunds demand a high degree of vigilance, as it always involves more than one country, so it follows that this is an area in which monitoring must always be very consistent."
"According to the Directorate-General of my fellow-Commissioner Mr Fischler, though, the high volume of live cattle exported to Lebanon is also attributable to the steps that the European Union has taken to monitor the exports of live cattle in general."
"At the beginning of this decade, the main players left in this field were Lebanon and Egypt."
"During the BSE crisis, Egypt stopped importing live cattle from the European Union and instead started importing them from Australia."
"This explains the current high volume exported to Lebanon."
"I did of course ask whether the number of cattle exported there bore any relation to Lebanese consumer habits, and the DG Agriculture Policy again confirmed that these figures had of course to be considered in the light of the fact that the Lebanese eat practically no pigmeat and so it was only natural that more beef should be consumed than other varieties of meat."
"I want to assure you, though, that I fully share your particular concerns about the protection of animals."
"In 2003, the Commission enacted new regulations on the export of live animals and tightened up those already in force."
"Today, the DG Agriculture has again confirmed to me that very tight controls are carried out both in the countries of origin and in the countries to which they are exported."
"I would like to emphasise that Mr Bösch’s report, as is usual, takes a highly critical line, and so we are all the more pleased that the report expresses appreciation for the actions taken by the Commission."
"This is not the only reason for the Commission to be grateful to the rapporteur; on the contrary, many of the steps taken by the Commission in recent years to combat fraud originated in demands and suggestions made, in particular, by the Committee for Budgetary Control."
"The improvements and reforms at OLAF are among them."
"Here too, it was the rapporteur, Mr Bösch, who was particularly insistent on changes being made."
"We now propose to amend the OLAF Regulation by improving the flow of information between OLAF and the Commission, by providing better procedural safeguards for those under investigation, and by giving a greater role to OLAF’s Supervisory Committee, to certain of whose functions you have just, again, referred."
"Alongside this, communications within the Commission on the subject of suspected fraud have been improved, notably between the political level and the services."
"These, too, had been brought to our attention by Parliament."
"We – and by ‘we’ I mean Parliament too – have achieved a fundamental reform of the Financial Regulation."
"The new Financial Regulation not only reinforces budgetary principles, but also contains important instruments for combating fraud, and for exclusion of parties from tenders where details given by them are false. Very recently, has described this as exemplary."
"Administrative reform is largely complete."
"We have, in the shape of OLAF, an effective and powerful instrument for combating fraud, but we must, of course, be constantly working to improve it."
"What we still need to do, though, is to set up a European Public Prosecutor’s Office; fraud that is detrimental to the European Budget must be punishable under criminal law."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control – particularly its chairman and the rapporteur, Mr Bösch – have been arguing in favour of this for years."
"Recently, we have joined together in campaigning – and very successfully too – for the Convention to incorporate in the draft Constitution the proposal for the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor’s Office to protect our financial interests."
"It is, fortunately, probable that an Intergovernmental Conference will, before the end of the Irish presidency’s six months, adopt a resolution on the draft Constitution."
"I would reiterate, though, that we have not yet got over all the hurdles, and I see it as absolutely necessary that all those who have worked towards the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor’s Office, should continue to be vigilant, lest it fall victim to some compromise or other."
"Right up to the Intergovernmental Conference, which will be in June, we will need to keep a very watchful eye on this."
"– Thank you, Mr President; in 2002, EUR 1.8 billion went astray as a result of fraud and irregularities, which amounts, approximately, to an increase of a cool 36% over the previous year, and the greatest increases are to be found in the areas of own resources and structural policy."
"That may be interesting, but there is nothing new about it."
"It all adds up to a sorry story, Commissioner, and you cannot put a positive spin on it."
"It could be said that fraud is continuing regardless."
"A 36% rate of increase may well be desirable in other areas, but it is nothing more or less than a disaster in the anti-fraud field."
"It actually reveals that you have nothing to show for the four and a half years that you have served as a Commissioner."
"Let us remind ourselves how the Prodi Commission took office in the autumn of 1999 grandiosely committing itself to, and demanding, zero tolerance for fraud and irregularities."
"Everything was to be different after the fall of the Santer Commission – and what happened?"
"One might say that one scandal gave way to another."
"Let me remind you of the way you froze out the chief accountant after she said that the whole reform was not going as smoothly as you had told the outside world it was."
"You changed the Financial Regulation, but without, in my view, making it more transparent or any clearer; instead, you did it by way of a jungle of regulations that nobody, at the end of the day, knows their way around."
"Indeed, your cardinal error, in my view, was to do away with the independent position of Financial Controller, and to replace it with an internal audit service, one that is neither independent nor – it would appear – very appealing, in view of the fact that you will, in April, be losing its director, who is also making good his escape."
"An accounting system has come to light that is described quite rightly in the press as being ‘as full of holes as a Swiss cheese’ and ‘as open as a bank vault’."
"Finally, we have the Eurostat affair, with its secret accounts and losses acknowledged as totalling at least EUR 8 million."
"I do not mean it as praise, Commissioner, when I call that a fantastic result; only a cynic could congratulate you on it."
"As always, though, you are unaware of any wrongdoing."
"All the Commissioners responsible are simply wriggling out of it and hiding themselves in the regulatory jungle that they themselves have created."
"That none of this encourages any confidence on the part of the European public is evidently a matter of no concern to you; it would appear that the prevalent attitude is still that one can be more free and easy with Europe’s money than with that of the Member States."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Bösch, this report places due emphasis on the scandal of export refunds for live cattle intended for Lebanon, in 2002."
"It should be noted that this scandal is only the latest in a long line of scandals."
"Commissioner, you have mentioned here the reports provided by your colleague Commissioner Fischler on this matter."
"I would, perhaps, ask you to take a look at the 2001 press in order to see, in great detail, the whole scandal of the export refunds for Jordan – which had also taken place as regards other countries – with the sole purpose of breaching UN sanctions on Iraq."
"This has gone on for a number of years, involving various countries, and if the Commission has been unable to see what has been happening, I honestly think that this is because it did not wish to understand. After all, detailed reports have even appeared in the press."
"What I would like to say, however, is that we are not only dealing with the scandal of breaking the Iraq embargo with EU funds. This is one of many, such as the scandal of the holding group set up by the Naples Camorra – involving large dairy companies from France, Belgium and Germany – to adulterate butter with beef tallow and oils."
"The problem is that Commissioner Fischler, whose name has not been mentioned here – though his name ought to be the first to come up in these circumstances – cannot ignore the scale of these successive scandals concerning the agriculture budget."
"We have yet to receive any clarification whatsoever of the amount of money spent by the Community budget on disposing butter adulterated by this Camorra holding group between 1995 and 2000, and there has been a similar silence concerning the amount of money recovered."
"We still do not know which companies were involved, nor why the Commission has not imposed any sanction against any of them, not even sanctions relating to the functioning of milk quota mechanisms."
"We must discover why it is that the Commission treats the major agriculture and food companies with such indulgence and impunity, yet imposes harsh penalties on small-scale farmers or dairies for the slightest administrative lapse."
"These are the important questions that require answers."
"– Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur for an excellent report."
"The European Anti-fraud Office (OLAF) was set up under great pressure from Parliament to replace the former UCLAF."
"Its task obviously has to be clarified, but at the same time we must ensure that the European Union does not start to become a Community reminiscent of a police state."
"At this stage our group does not support point 39, which goes too far in its outline of OLAF’s future role."
"We still wish to keep our options open, and for that reason we have drafted Amendment No 8."
"This gives attention to the following: the competence of the OLAF Supervisory Committee in relation to the Director’s discretionary powers, the matter of where the secretariat is to be physically located, and the rights of the people whose actions OLAF is investigating."
"We should remember that it would be a very alarming situation if OLAF were to investigate an unfounded report."
"As points 1 and 2 imply that poor administration and fraud are due to the fact that the same Commissioner is responsible for both the budget and financial control, we cannot accept this conclusion, which oversimplifies the matter."
"At the same time we do not wish to belittle the determination and firmness with which the Commission has pushed for administrative reforms."
"– Mr President, just as the rapporteur did, I should like to refer to the raid on a German journalist’s house, carried out just recently by the Belgian police on the instructions of OLAF."
"OLAF’s breaking into a journalist’s house and seizing computers, notes, address registers and mobile telephones constitutes a very serious encroachment upon the freedom of the press."
"Following the raid, the Belgian police did not actually bring any specific charges."
"I therefore sincerely hope that OLAF has a very good explanation of why this course of action was taken."
"An explanation really is needed."
"If OLAF cannot provide such an explanation, I do not believe that OLAF’s director can remain in place."
"I should also like to ask the European Commission whether it knew about this in advance and, if so, who in the Commission was aware of the matter."
"Please answer this question here and now."
"OLAF has faced a lot of criticism in the wake of the Eurostat scandal."
"I think that this has, in the main, been justified."
"OLAF’s director chose not to inform the Commission in time."
"Obviously, there need to be fundamental reforms to the way in which information is passed on, something that is now in part also being proposed."
"The rapporteur’s report is a very thorough piece of work, and makes for fairly gloomy reading."
"It is a kind of balancing of the books following five years’ work since the Santer Commission was forced to go."
"What is evident is that the problems involving fraud and irregularities have not disappeared."
"The problems have even increased in the last year."
"What is also evident is the fact that the promises previously made to demand political accountability have not been fulfilled, above all where the Eurostat scandal is concerned."
"The problem does not only relate to control systems."
"It is also about system errors."
"A matter such as export refunds for live animals is an invitation to fraud."
"It also involves systematically organised cruelty to animals, funded by the taxpayers."
"The existence of such systems is in fact an invitation to misuse tax revenue in the European Union."
"In this case, increased control is not what is in the first place required."
"What is required is for the system to be done away with as quickly as possible."
"Mr President, I want to concentrate on live exports and export refunds, but before that I should like to point out that it is only right that Parliament should have a full report on the case of the German journalists who had property confiscated."
"As regards export refunds, a report is coming up in Parliament this week about the conditions under which animals can be transported."
"Export refunds should be abolished."
"Clearly the vast majority of European Union citizens do not approve of the idea that their money is being used to subsidise a trade which causes untold suffering to animals, regardless of how high standards are or how good the conditions are."
"It is undeniable that animals are being subjected to unnecessary suffering."
"To cap it all, European taxpayers are being forced to subsidise this."
"The time has come for us to end export refunds."
"There is a huge budget here which is wide open to abuse."
"Looking at this recent case I believe it should be fully investigated by OLAF."
"Regardless of whether we agree with export refunds or not – and I clearly do not – we need a full investigation as a result of recent reports regarding animals being transported to the Lebanon."
"What was their final destination?"
"In general, export refunds are completely unjustifiable."
"I do not believe that European taxpayers' money should go towards this kind of trade."
"If export refunds were abolished, that would solve the whole problem."
"There would be no more scandals in relation to abuse of taxpayers' money, but we need a full report on what has been mentioned in the media recently in relation to the scandals and the fraud involved."
"Commissioner, you should ensure that investigation takes place."
"It is essential that we have a commitment as soon as possible."
"Mr President, sound management of the budget is of crucial importance for confidence in the European Union."
"From the 2002 annual report, it appears that the number of reported cases of fraud has risen dramatically."
"Although this is, in itself, not such a good thing, this rise does mean that more attention is being paid to the fight against fraud and irregularities."
"More attention is a good thing, but it should also be translated into both punitive and preventive action."
"The Commission has some catching up to do where the improvement of direct management is concerned."
"A separate directorate general for financial control should be set up, independent of the present DG for the Budget."
"As long as those in charge intend to keep a grip on their inspectors, there is no room for a transparent climate, in which people accept responsibility and hold others to account."
"Our group is concerned that amendments have been tabled to delete paragraphs 1 and 2 from the resolution."
"Has this Parliament perhaps been created with a view to taking the Commission under its wing – even when it makes mistakes or remains in default?"
"An uncritical attitude of this kind instils distrust in the voter, and rightly so, because this Parliament primarily has a monitoring task, which it has to carry out meticulously by fighting irregularities and fraud, also in its own House, in a consistent manner."
"That is a first measure in order to increase the structurally low turnout in European elections."
"Finally, I should like to mention the inadequate recovery of excessive or incorrect amounts paid."
"Has a consistent register been finally set up in the accounting system?"
"Why is the Commission only claiming back a small proportion?"
"How do you explain this to the citizens in the Member States?"
"Is it in their interest that you recover so little?"
"Mr President, it is exceedingly rare for me to find myself in agreement with large parts of a report drawn up for this Parliament."
"However, the Bösch report contains a veritable litany of the failings of the Commission either to create an accounting system even approaching adequacy or to tackle the fraud that is inherent in everything the EU does."
"He quotes a colossal EUR 2.12 billion – or, in real money, something like GBP 1.5 billion – as the total amount of fraud listed in the Commission's annual report for 2002."
"From training seminars for senior civil servants that were never held, to mass defrauding of the CAP, this eye-opening record of failure is there for all to see."
"The report notes that, incredibly, in 50% of the cases of agricultural fraud, it was impossible to identify the products concerned."
"Under these circumstances, I also share the report's concern at the shortcomings of the work of OLAF."
"However, the Bösch report provides a list of blindingly obvious things that could and should have been done many years ago to make this leaking ship more sound."
"It is self-evident that a leaking ship will continue to leak and, indeed, eventually sink if it takes on new passengers."
"As the accession countries join the EU on 1 May, I put it to you that the EU's finances are in a huge mess and that the addition of ten new countries will simply make that mess even bigger and may well cause the ship to founder."
"This report very effectively demonstrates the failure of a European Union that is hopelessly mired in fraud and corruption and lacks the will to do anything about it."
"Any nation that continues to plough money into this black morass is very badly letting down the taxpayers who foot the bill."
". – Mr President, I would like to start with an observation for Mr Titford’s benefit; this is not a Tempus Phase project, but rather a Tempus project."
"My fellow-Commissioner with responsibility for enlargement has asked me to make this point clear."
"One thing I would like to do is to respond to the questions that Mrs Stauner raised, and the statements she made, about the claim that EUR 1.8 billion went missing in 2002."
"One simply cannot come to that conclusion on the basis of the figures in the report on the implementation of Article 280; the Member States are obliged to report any irregularities relating to the Structural Funds, the Agricultural Funds, or the own resources."
"Irregularities are taken to mean infringements of European regulations."
"Such an irregularity can be of a financial nature, but it can also be, for example, a breach of an environmental regulation, in which case no financial loss whatever is incurred."
"As these reports have to relate to the project in its entirety, it is impossible to conclude that the whole project is in some way tantamount to fraud."
"If, though, a financial irregularity has occurred, the money must be recovered, and it is the Member States themselves who must produce it."
"It follows that, at the very least, the funds reclaimed must be deducted from the sums to which you, Mrs Stauner, have referred."
"It is of course quite illusory to believe that you can have a budget made up of subsidies without any fraud whatever; the risk of fraud is inherent in it."
"This makes rigorous and universal controls all the more necessary, and in some areas it is the Member States that have to carry these out."
"Of course it is vexatious when reports either arrive late or are incomplete."
"You are quite right to say, Mr Bösch, that if there is a country somewhere that has had nothing to report, that does not indicate that everything is being done properly there, but rather that checks are not being carried out."
"Even in Member States that perhaps pride themselves on doing a good job of monitoring, we find, again and again, that they are not."
"Take a look at the Court of Auditors’ report for the year 2000."
"It shows, unfortunately, that it is in the country from which you and I come, the country we both know best, that paying agencies – including one in Bavaria, your own part of the country – have the highest margin of error."
"For that reason, offices everywhere must carry out checks, and as and when they find something, they have to take appropriate action – which may involve recovering the money."
"In that event, we have to be consistent, and the money must be collected."
"I have to tell Mrs Stauner that ‘zero tolerance’ does not mean that we stop carrying out checks, but that, if something is found, we draw the appropriate conclusions."
"I would like, by way of a brief response to what Mr van Dam said, to point out that the DG Budget is not the DG with responsibility for financial control."
"I will reiterate that point. Financial control has now been decentralised, and the position is the same in all the countries from which you come, where it is always the ministry responsible for a particular programme that is also responsible for monitoring it and for its proper implementation; it cannot hide behind another Directorate-General."
"That was our mistake in the past. The internal audit service is independent, something that I believe it did indeed demonstrate while Mr Muis was responsible for running it."
"I would like to return to the issue of the transport of live animals, export subsidies and the export of live cattle."
"The fact of the matter is that this is permitted."
"It is also stated, in a Council decision, that live exports are subsidised, albeit to a lesser extent than in the past, so I cannot categorise the export of live cattle as fraud; it is legal."
"I share your concern that questions should be asked about precisely what, in terms of animal protection, is ethically justifiable about this."
"I did mention that – as we saw in the case of Egypt – the Commission has tightened up the relevant regulations."
"If, then, the European Union stops these exports, and these animals are transported from Australia, then, as far as the protection of animals is concerned, nothing has been gained."
"This means that it is vital that we act in the interests of the welfare of animals not merely within the EU, but also seek out allies."
"I have taken note of your critical comments in this area and will be passing them on to my fellow-Commissioner Mr Fischler. I will be asking him to make available to you any further information you may wish to have."
"In any case, I will tell him about the critical tone your House has adopted on this issue."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (Α5-0160/2004), on behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, on promoting gender equality in development cooperation (Rapporteur: Mrs Zrihen)."
". Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer, ladies and gentlemen, here we are at the second reading of a report that should not pose any problems."
"Nonetheless, I want to stress some points that I feel are essential in this report and once again make a number of observations."
"A disproportionate majority of poor people in the world today are women."
"There is a close link between gender inequality and poverty, just as there is between the eradication of poverty, greater independence for women and gender equality."
"The four countries placed bottom on the United Nations index measuring gender equality also come last in terms of human poverty."
"If we want effectively to reduce poverty, then gender equality must be improved."
"Furthermore, if we take into account the important role played by women in society in developing countries, it is widely acknowledged that the full and complete participation of women is a prerequisite for sustainable development."
"Women have for many years, women have been recognised as actors who have an important role in the success of projects, in change and in development."
"It would be a mistake to undertake measures to promote development and sustainable development without taking into account the opinion of women and without genuinely involving them in projects."
"The development cooperation policy that we are pursuing must not boil down to simply funding projects in order to clear our consciences. It must rather be an investment for the future so that the people and the countries targeted will one day become partners and can promote their own development."
"Women play many and various roles in many societies."
"They are wives, mothers, and teachers at the same time."
"They start small businesses, they grow things, they sell things, they are genuine operators, and dare I say it, industrialists."
"Nevertheless, in many cases, they are also the victims of societies that are falling apart; they are the victims of wars, disease and patriarchal structures."
"Our action must consist of promoting and supporting the participation of women in economic, social, political and environmental fields."
"Similarly, we must strive to ensure better access for women of all ages to the entire range of resources and services, such as health, education, training and infrastructures."
"By strengthening the position and the power of women, we are allowing them to take charge of their own lives so that they can set their own objectives, so that they acquire the skills they need, so that they have more self-confidence, so that they can deal with their problems and learn to become independent."
"By acting in this way, we allow men and women to take part in social and political life and to thus obtain citizenship, which is a fundamental element in any democracy."
"This will also allow us to consolidate the rule of law and finally ensure that human rights, rights of the person and fundamental freedoms are respected in territories other than our own."
"For several years, gender equality has formed an integral part of the political framework which includes the European Union’s development cooperation."
"The priorities and the objectives have been defined but there is still a long way to go to achieve tangible results and to improve the situation of women in developing countries."
"The aim of the regulation that we are voting on this week is, therefore, to strengthen the implementation of measures aimed at promoting equality in the policies, strategies, and operations of the European Union’s development cooperation."
"Activities funded under this regulation must act as a catalyst for supplementing and strengthening existing policies and programmes in developing countries."
"Financing this regulation is the only stumbling block that we have come up against."
"Having found a solution, I hope that the sooner the projects are included, the more swiftly money will be released and actions taken on the ground together with NGOs and local women’s associations."
"We need something tangible; we need actions and not just talk and fine words."
"Finally, I dare to hope, Commissioner, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that the next time we renew this regulation we will finally obtain a substantial increase in the budget, as well as an impact assessment on the type of work carried out and a summary broken down by country and by area of actions."
"Working together towards the future is our only chance of ensuring that democracy will be achieved."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, speaking on behalf of my fellow-Commissioner Mr Nielson, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Zrihen, for the outstanding and constructive cooperation throughout the whole codecision procedure, and most of all after the vote at first reading last December."
"The Commission very much welcomes your recommendation that the Council’s Common Position should be approved, as also should budget funds totalling EUR 9 million for the purpose of promoting gender equality in the context of development cooperation."
"Parliament’s request for additional budget funds had been the only point on which the three institutions had been unable to reach agreement in December."
"As regards the others, we were or are in of one mind, as is evident from the fact that the Council and the Commission have taken on board 20 of the 21 amendments proposed by Parliament."
"As soon as the new Regulation is adopted, we will devote all our efforts to enhancing its function as a catalyst and its strategic role."
"All development measures funded by the Community should help to promote gender equality horizontally."
"It is in these areas that the ideal of gender mainstreaming is of the utmost importance."
"This Regulation provides us at last with a more broadly drawn concept, which will underpin the current implementation strategy in the best possible way."
"The Regulation needs to have teeth if we are to be able to step up the promotion of equality and thereby make further progress in combating poverty, which is one of the millennium development objectives."
"We are aware that some have expressed misgivings about the equality training that Commission staff receive, and so I am glad to be able to announce that we will shortly be mounting a comprehensive training programme intended not only for the Commission’s own staff at home and in the delegations, but also to our partner countries’ own workers."
"We have already started elaborating a guide setting out the most important principles of gender mainstreaming and guidelines on how to promote it, as well as a range of best practice methodologies."
"We will provide, in the annual report on development cooperation, detailed accounts of the measures funded under this Regulation; this will mainly consist of information on relevant experience with projects and on their outcomes."
"Moreover, and before the expiry of this Regulation, we will be initiating an independent assessment to arrive at recommendations as to how the measures in question can continue to be as efficient as they are now, or even more so, since we want to constantly improve the promotion of gender equality as part of development cooperation."
"I am persuaded that, by supporting this Regulation, Parliament will be helping to achieve the international development goals, to promote equality and to give women more rights and a greater role."
"This is an essential requirement if we are to successfully combat poverty."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating both the rapporteur from the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities and the rapporteur from the Committee on Development and Cooperation for the work they have done in connection with this report."
"I think that the 20 or 21 amendments tabled at first reading show very well the cooperation there has been between these two committees."
"They have been an inspiration to each other."
"The Commission has adopted 20 out of 21 proposals, which is to be welcomed."
"I naturally find it annoying that we have not been able to increase the budget from EUR 9 million to EUR 11 million but, in line with other rapporteurs, I accepted that, if we wanted to conclude matters now, we should have to conclude with a figure of EUR 9 million for the appropriation for the next three years."
"It was the only opportunity we had to complete things and get matters under way."
"In common with others, I attached greater importance to this than to having the budget increased, partly because the previous funds have not been used."
"That being said, I think, in a way, that EUR 9 million is too small an amount when we consider what it really is we are up against."
"We often talk about the EU being an economic superpower in the world, which is what it in fact is, but it can safely be said that we are positively prehistoric in the area of development."
"Overall, we are clearly the world’s biggest provider of aid, and it is therefore important, of course, that we debate the basic principles upon which development work is based."
"Gender equality is one of the areas concerned, and a very important area too."
"It is a that if we too do not combat female poverty, we shall simply not succeed in getting development under way."
"There is reason for hoping that what we have before us may be a stimulus to such development."
"In itself, it is not of course enough, but it can hopefully act as a catalyst, in the way described."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (Α5-0196/2004), on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the minimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents (Rapporteur: Mr Pérez Álvarez)."
". Mr President, Commissioner – whom I welcome – ladies and gentlemen, in 1994 the European Parliament approved at first reading the Commission’s proposal on the minimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents."
"The differing natures of the four physical agents – noise, vibration, optical radiation and electromagnetic fields – led to a new approach on the part of the Council in 1999, which advocated specific directives."
"Following the directives on vibration and noise, today we are examining the Directive on the minimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to electromagnetic fields."
"The proposal for a directive falls under the heading of measures to improve the working environment because, according to Article 31 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights under the heading ‘Fair and just working conditions’, every worker has the right to working conditions which respect his or her health, safety and dignity."
"To start with, we must make it clear that the new Directive is extremely careful about its potential socio-economic impact, since it does not impose new obligations which were not already contained in the framework directive; it simply sets out their specific details."
"The directive only deals with short- and medium-term adverse effects and not long-term adverse effects because of the lack of solid scientific data."
"It does not deal with risks involving contact with live conductors."
"Protection in this case is contained in the framework directive."
"The proposal’s scope does not provide for exceptions, because that would represent discrimination, within the meaning of Article 13 of the EC Treaty and Article 20 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Furthermore, this is a health and safety directive, which is intended to eliminate risks at origin, although a specific directive – 93/42/EEC, for example – obliges the manufacturer to comply with essential requirements."
"Use may be incorrect and therefore the sources of risk may be many and varied."
"In order to understand the preventive content, we must take account of two concepts."
"Firstly, the exposure limit value above which no one is permitted to work."
"Secondly, the action value which leads to an action in accordance with the terms laid down in the proposal."
"This Parliament’s contributions mainly focus on the obligations for employers in terms of evaluating and measuring the levels of the electromagnetic fields workers are exposed to, on the consultation and participation of those workers and on training and information."
"Another of Parliament’s contributions is to set out detailed requirements for containing and monitoring this power – Article 8 – with the aim of preventing and diagnosing as swiftly as possible any adverse effect on health due to exposure to electromagnetic fields."
"When exposure exceeding the limit values is detected, a medical examination is required and, in the event that any damage to health as a result of exposure is detected, the employer will be obliged to carry out a reassessment of the risks."
"Effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions are laid down, in accordance with national legislation – of course – in the event of infringement."
"If Parliament votes in favour of this report and the Council accepts Parliament’s amendments, the Directive will be the result of a form of social dialogue, of political dialogue, in this case, through the joint efforts of the PPE-DE Group and the PSE Group who, in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, have understood that, by means of this Directive, we could improve working conditions for European workers."
"We accepted the initial proposal by Mr Crowley of the UEN Group."
"In my capacity as rapporteur, I would like to thank him and all my fellow Members for their contributions and, in particular, the coordinator for the Socialist Group in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Mr Stephen Hughes."
"Without this agreement, the Directive would not be possible."
"If we achieve the necessary votes tomorrow, we will have a Directive which is the result of dialogue between the majority political groups in this House aimed at improving the living conditions of workers and protecting their dignity as human beings."
"Commissioner Dimas has the floor."
"Commissioner, I should like to take this opportunity to welcome you to the European Parliament, to congratulate you on your appointment and to wish you every success in your work."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, may I start by thanking you for your kind words and welcome."
"It really is an immense honour and joy to be here in the European Parliament this evening."
"I am sorry that I did not have the opportunity to meet the members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, but I shall meet them tomorrow, at the meeting we are to hold in the afternoon."
"I am especially glad that I shall have the opportunity in the future to work closely with the European Parliament and the relevant committees."
"The report by Mr Pérez Álvarez was perfect and I must also thank him on behalf of the Commission because, on such a difficult technical issue as that in the proposal on physical agents, especially electromagnetic fields, he spoke so well and his report was truly exceptional."
"The difficulty with this issue is exacerbated by the fact that, although the amended proposal was submitted to the Council back in 1994, the first part of the proposal – on vibration – was only approved in 2002 and the second part – on noise – was only approved in 2003."
"Now we have the third part on electromagnetic fields at the level of second reading."
"The Commission continues to attach the greatest importance to all measures which are designed to protect the health and safety of workers and which constitute an important factor in relation to the quality of life."
"The social agenda emphasised this issue, which was confirmed in the Commission communication on a new strategy for health and safety in the workplace."
"I am of the opinion that legislation on electromagnetic fields will be a fundamental step towards achieving better protection for the health and safety of workers exposed to risks from physical agents."
"The most recent scientific information available shows that overexposure to electromagnetic fields may have serious consequences on the health of workers and therefore merits special attention."
"The directive makes provision for precautions to protect the health and safety of workers, especially from induced electric currents in the body, shocks and burns and absorption of thermal energy produced by electromagnetic fields."
"It should be noted that it was not yet possible to examine the carcinogenic effect of electromagnetic fields, due to a lack of adequate scientific data or indication of a link of cause and effect between electromagnetic fields and cancer."
"For similar reasons, the directive does not set definitive values for exposure to static magnetic fields."
"Nonetheless, it should be noted that, within the framework of the Commission report on the practical application, the Commission will pay particular attention to these issues and will closely monitor developments in scientific data in these two sectors. If necessary, it will submit the necessary proposals at a later date."
"I should like to congratulate the Members of Parliament on the quality of their amendments expressing Parliament’s concern and interest as regards the risks and results of exposure of workers to electromagnetic fields."
"It should be noted that the Commission, throughout the highly technical and very difficult legislative procedure, made intensive and, on occasion, persistent efforts to preserve a high level of protection in the text, while at the same time ensuring that a final compromise solution could be reached."
"It should be noted that, in order to achieve an overall compromise, the Commission accepted the Council common position, even though it had reservations about the watering down of the provisions on health surveillance."
"I am particularly pleased to see that one of your amendments, Amendment No 3, corrects this shortcoming in the common position and restores the preventive nature of health surveillance."
"As far as your amendments are concerned, the Commission can accept them as they stand, in that they improve the quality of the text and clarify its meaning."
"Specifically, Amendment No 1 clarifies the procedure for assessing levels of exposure in accordance with the provisions of framework directive 89/391."
"Amendment No 2 improves the quality of the text, in that the content of the information which must be provided to workers is further supplemented."
"Amendment No 3 strengthens health surveillance in complete harmony with the Commission’s reservations on the common position."
"Amendment No 4 introduces a standardised provision governing sanctions, while Amendment No 5 stipulates the frequency of the Commission report, in keeping with the other health and safety directives."
"There is no need for me to tell you that this report will evaluate scientific developments concerning the long-term effects of exposure to electromagnetic waves and the effects of static electromagnetic fields."
"At the same time, any further initiatives will be examined in the light of new scientific knowledge."
"May I also remind you that the gradual approach taken to the examination of the Commission proposal, starting with vibration, followed by noise and now electromagnetic fields, does not obviate the need for further work to be undertaken on the remaining physical agent included in the Commission’s initial proposal, by which I mean optical radiation."
"– Mr President, I wish to tell the Commissioner that I am looking forward to meeting him tomorrow in order to exchange experiences and points of view concerning the social agenda."
"I shall then address the rapporteur, Mr Pérez Álvarez."
"I see that Mr Hughes is not here today."
"That is because it is sometimes difficult to make one’s way to Strasbourg because of the lack of air connections."
"Mr Hughes has got caught up on the way here."
"On behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists and of Mr Hughes, I wish to thank Mr Pérez Álvarez for his very constructive cooperation."
"The fact that we have obtained this result has a lot to do with the sound cooperation between the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"Mr Pérez Álvarez and Mr Hughes have been the leading figures in this cooperation."
"We have set out in pursuit of two objectives."
"The first is to produce a sound directive in this area that guarantees employees’ health and security."
"The second objective has been to reach an agreement before the end of the term of office so that we do not keep putting off the issue."
"It has already been said that this directive is part of the health and safety and physical agents package."
"We have previously dealt successfully with vibrations and noise and are now dealing with electromagnetic fields and workers’ exposure to these."
"This affects many people in the labour market."
"Let me take a few examples in the form of people within health-care, large-scale catering and the metal industry."
"It is an important directive on which we now have to adopt a position."
"A debate has taken place on the long-term effects and on the difficulties of finding scientific observations enabling the long-term effects to be evaluated."
"I think that, through the amendments we have produced in the committee and for which we hope to obtain a hearing, we are highlighting some important matters."
"Firstly, consultation and cooperation with employees is being debated."
"Another important subject is, of course, prevention: that is to say, when an employee suffers overexposure, he should have an automatic right to health checks."
"If, in the course of these health checks, it emerges that the employee has suffered overexposure and been harmed, a further risk evaluation should be carried out."
"I consider this perhaps to be the most important proposal among the amendments now being tabled by our committee."
"It is also important that there should be serious consequences for those employers who do not comply with these recommendations."
"I must also mention the last amendment to the effect that there is a deadline before which the Commission must respond."
"If new findings come to light, the initiative must be taken and Parliament consulted again."
"Finally, I wish to say a big thank you."
"This has been an example of constructive cooperation, and I hope the outcome will be successful."
"I am convinced it will be."
"Mr President, I join my colleagues in thanking the rapporteur for the tremendous work she has undertaken on this report."
"This report and the mechanism by which we are getting it through Parliament is the best example of cooperation that there is between the institutions."
"Because of the time-frame within which we are now working during the Irish presidency, in particular with regard to the upcoming elections in June, it was necessary to find a compromise and a consensus, which may not be suitable for everybody, and may not cover all the individual points that each Member wanted to see covered, but does allow for legislation to be put on the books to ensure that workers are protected in these new risks to which they are exposed."
"When we look at the advancing use of technology, in particular the dangers that may emanate from that technology, it is essential that this Parliament, and indeed the European Union as a whole, is seen to be able to respond quickly to those new innovations, as well as those new risks."
"What we have before us is a compromise package."
"In recent weeks the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs tabled five amendments which have been taken on board by Coreper and by the Council as a whole under the guidance of the Irish presidency."
"This will allow us to bring forward this legislation into the domain of workers' rights, following on from a very proud and strong tradition of this House in ensuring the protection of workers under health and safety legislation."
"I would like to welcome Commissioner Dimas to his new position."
"I know it is very difficult for someone coming into office in such a short space of time."
"I wish him well in his office and promise my cooperation and that of my Group in his work in the coming months."
"The health and safety of workers must be to the forefront of all our legislation."
"Of course it is important that we try to put in place rules and regulations with regard to competition and competitiveness to ensure that workers can have jobs, but as well as having jobs, they must be good jobs with real rewards and real protection."
"It is only when we meet all these criteria that we can truly say that we have worked properly on behalf of all the citizens of the European Union."
"I commend this report to the House."
"I would ask all Members to endorse it and to support it so that we can move forward in this era of cooperation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we have been looking forward to being able to put questions tomorrow in the committee."
"It is of course a great pleasure after so many years to be able to put the finishing touches to this directive. There is no doubt about that."
"The directive has been in preparation for an incredibly long time, and I am also delighted to commend it to the House tomorrow."
"It is also good that, unlike the other directives on physical agents, it is not full of transitional periods, possible dispensations and a host of exemptions."
"This is something I think we can learn from when preparing the future directives in this area."
"That being said, I must say how disappointed I am that the directive does not in any way mention the long-term effects of electromagnetic fields."
"I am aware that there are problems in showing the connection between exposure and the development of cancer."
"I think, however, that our legislation has to be influenced by the fact that we at present see a number of examples of people who worked with radar in the seventies and eighties and who now appear to be following a pattern of developing cancer."
"I find it disappointing that this is not mentioned at all in the directive."
"I think that, at some time or other, we must take account of the fact that there is also a precautionary principle in this area."
"If we begin to see a pattern in those cases whereby, after 20 or 30 years, people develop cancer, we should do something about the fact."
"I should therefore like to ask you directly, Commissioner, whether I heard you correctly and whether you do in fact interpret Article 11 of the directive as saying that the Commission undertakes to present a new proposal as soon as there is new knowledge of the long-term effects of electromagnetic fields."
"I should be very glad if the Commission could confirm this."
"I think it is very important for the next Parliament to have a practical basis on which to proceed further."
". – Mr President, I merely wished to say that, in the last point, I repeated that scientific developments on the long-term effects will be assessed and, of course, any further initiatives will be examined on the basis of this scientific knowledge."
"Thank you very much Commissioner."
"I too wish to take this opportunity to congratulate you on your appointment and to welcome you to this Chamber."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0161/2004) by Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, on the common position adopted by the Council on 6 February 2004 with a view to the adoption of a Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Community action programme to promote organisations active at European level in the field of equality between men and women."
". Mr President, Commissioner, I am sure we all welcome the fact that the Council, along with Parliament, has acknowledged that promoting equality between women and men requires, in practice, a range of measures, a structured programme, the involvement of civil society and, most importantly, the involvement of women’s organisations and financial support for these."
"As one of the founders of the European Women’s Lobby, I acknowledge that its primary role is to promote equality between women and men. I am pleased to see, however, that, as I have been advocating for many years, there are other women’s organisations outside the lobby, which are active at European level in the field of promoting equality between women and men and which are similarly worthy of support."
"Our rapporteur, Mrs Kratsa, for whom I am deputising today, did not have an easy task, either in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, or at first reading here, to persuade people that European women’s organisations outside the lobby should not suffer discrimination."
"Nonetheless, an agreement has finally been reached with the Council to ensure that the various women’s organisations active at European level are accorded equal treatment."
"The European Women’s Lobby does not have a monopoly on representing, or on coordinating, women’s NGOs."
"It is, therefore, only right and proper that other organisations should also receive an annual operating grant in the framework of the Community action programme, covering the period from 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2005."
"This Community action programme is open not only to the twenty-five Member States, but also to member countries of the European Free Trade Association, and to Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey, who are waiting in the wings to become EU Member States."
"In light of this, Mr President, I feel distinctly underwhelmed by the financial envelope for carrying out this programme – EUR 2.2 million over two years – especially given that in the financial provisions, there is a restriction that states, and I quote, that ‘annual appropriations shall be authorised by the Budgetary Authority within the limits of the financial perspective’."
"In order not to delay any further the adoption of this decision, which should have been adopted before 1 January 2004, when it came into force, I should like to ask you, on behalf of Mrs Kratsa, to endorse her position and adopt this text, which she negotiated so skilfully with the Council, without any amendments."
"I should like to recall the most important aspects of these texts: the transfer of the European Women’s Lobby from the first part to the annex; the setting of identical cofinancing rates for other organisations active at European level as for the European Women’s Lobby; the non-application of degressivity to the funding of women’s organisations that do not belong to the European Women’s Lobby; and an annual operating grant to support the implementation of the permanent work programme of the women’s organisations."
"This is a good thing and I welcome this agreement."
"I trust that the Members of this House, as Mrs Kratsa wishes, will give their approval to this text that she negotiated with the Council, as it is acceptable to everyone."
". – Mr President, I am delighted to see that progress has been made, within the framework both of the Council and the European Parliament, on the proposal in question and that we have now reached the final stage of its approval."
"The proposal is designed to provide a legal basis for continuing financial support for organisations working at European Union level to promote equality between men and women."
"It is designed to increase legal clarity and transparency when granting subsidies in accordance with the new financial regulation."
"The present proposal forms part of a package of seven decisions which provide specific legal bases, from 2004 onwards, for subsidies which are currently funded on the basis of administrative operating appropriations."
"I should like to congratulate Mrs Kratsa on her report and Mrs Lulling on her presentation of it and the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities for their work and proposals, most of which have been incorporated in the Commission’s amended proposal."
"We support the common position proposed by the Council in that it responds to the Commission’s main objectives and incorporates most of your amendments."
"It is very positive that the institutions worked closely together and arrived at a joint agreement on the basic issues of the duration of the programme and the level of central funding at the tripartite meeting in November 2003."
"We all agree that the organisations in question play a crucial role in promoting Community policies in the area of equality between men and women."
"It is important to safeguard the continuation of and avoid obstacles to Community support for the organisations in question."
"Due to the delay in approving this decision, the amendments relating to the transitional clauses need to be included in the final decision, as agreed at the conciliation meeting last November."
"Mr President, it may be said that, unlike everyone else, I have thought it important to take the floor at this second reading."
"It is quite simply because I want to take the opportunity to praise the work done by the European Women’s Lobby."
"It is of course important what the European political parties do to promote women in the decision-making processes and in all possible other areas."
"I believe, however, that it is also safe to say that, if the European Women’s Lobby were not active in this area, it would be much more difficult to push through a number of gender equality initiatives."
"In particular, I think there is good cause for emphasising the need that exists for the European Women’s Lobby in connection with enlargement to include the new Member States, which quite obviously have other gender equality traditions than ourselves in the current Member States."
"It is important for the Women’s Lobby, together with the organisations of MEPs in the individual nations, to be active so that we can continue to pursue the work concerning women, even though there are cultural differences between the new and old EU countries."
"I do not think that the Commission wishes to respond."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0155/2004) by Mrs Prets, on behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, on the proposal for a Council directive implementing the principle of equal treatment between women and men in the access to and supply of goods and services."
". – Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, the European Union has been fighting for equal treatment of men and women for nearly fifty years now and it has made a great deal of progress in the employment sector, with the introduction of legislation to safeguard equal pay and equal working conditions."
"Of course, legislation cannot resolve all the problems and a great deal still needs to be done in order to wipe out pay differentials between men and women."
"In 2000, the Commission announced in the social policy agenda that it would examine discrimination outside the labour market."
"This idea was supported by the European Council in Nice, which called on the Commission to strengthen rights relating to equality by approving a proposal for a directive on the basis of Article 13 of the Treaty."
"Before a detailed proposal was drafted, broad consultations were held with the Advisory Committee on Equal Opportunities for Men and Women, on which all the Members States and the social partners are represented, together with the insurance and other sectors, the European Parliament and civil society."
"You have this proposal before you."
"Following the example of the earlier directive on ethnic discrimination, the present directive focuses on the basic sector of access to goods and services, where there was evidence of unequal treatment of men and women and where it is known that legislation can change the situation."
"Consequently, the present directive will mainly cover financial services which often require women to have a guarantor in order to obtain a loan, but not men."
"Similarly housing, where single parent families, mainly women, face greater difficulties than men in renting accommodation and, of course, the insurance sector, mainly the car insurance, life assurance and pension sectors, as well as health insurance."
"The proposal to ban discrimination between men and women with regard to access to goods and services is equivocal to the Council, Parliament and society in general."
"It is equivocal because it questions established ideas in relation to the treatment of men and women, because it maintains that there are factors more important than gender when calculating premiums and because it implies that the approach which most insurance companies use today is basically unfair."
"This is, however, an important step for the principle of equal treatment and it will change the lives of both men and women throughout the whole of the European Union."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for what you have just said, which makes us very optimistic that we will be able to get rid of the unequal treatment that exists in the insurance sector."
"The preparatory work has been very hard work and very long, but it has brought us at last to the point where we can vote on the report."
"This proposal for a directive was announced as long ago as June 2000, when it featured in the Commission’s social policy agenda and was called for by the Heads of State or Government at the Nice European Council in December 2000."
"Four years on, the same gentlemen are still around and, now that the draft of such a directive is on the table, they are opposing it."
"It took three years before, in September last year, a proposal was submitted, and this, too, was given a very rough ride by the Commission."
"Then, in September 2003, I, as rapporteur, organised a public hearing in order to gain broad public support for our cause."
"This hearing was very interesting and gave rise to some exciting developments, including the discovery of how questionable are the often-quoted statistics on the basis of which it is possible to charge women higher insurance premiums."
"In the United Kingdom, for example, the lowest life expectancy for both men and women is in Manchester, while men’s life expectancy is highest in West Dorset and women’s highest in West Somerset."
"This exactly parallels the way in which men in the former East Germany live longer than men in the West, and the East-West divide, in terms of life expectancy, that exists in Austria."
"What this means is that gender is certainly not the only factor in this;"
"I believe that our approach to this equality directive cannot be based on economic factors to the exclusion of all others, and that this involves a purely political decision, the political will to declare ourselves in favour of equality or against it."
"We also found it very regrettable that the final Commission proposal for a directive took no account of education, decision-making processes, and the content of media and advertising."
"This leads me to agree with my colleague Mrs Swiebel’s view that, while a progressive approach is certainly not the best solution, it may well be the first manageable one."
"This directive is very feeble in comparison with the existing directive on the principle of equal treatment on grounds of race, which goes much further in its demands."
"So let me thank Commissioner Diamantopoulou for taking this important step, while, at the same time, encouraging the Commission – through you, Commissioner Dimas – to delay no longer in adopting further proposals on comprehensive measures to combat sexual discrimination and to guarantee de facto equality in areas other than employment."
"This directive is explicitly founded upon Article 13, inserted by the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1997, and I do not share the view of certain members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market that it should have Article 95 as its basis."
"Were that the case, I believe that it would have permitted access to the internal market in purely economic terms, and I am not sure that the Council would have allowed Parliament the power of codecision over it."
"What is crucial – it is indeed at the heart of this report – is the actuarial factor, on which the insurance lobby has based its arguments, and which is the starting point for most of our differences."
"Gender must not be used as an actuarial factor in calculating premiums and benefits."
"To use gender as an objective factor is discriminatory, as gender is not freely chosen; women and men are born as what they are."
"For example, I have learned from many discussions that women in the insurance sector, and not just insurance companies themselves, defend the idea that women alone should bear the costs of pregnancy, justifying this by saying that they too, use medical services."
"As all women pay the same amount, there is solidarity between women who have children and those who do not, but what about men, who do, after all, have some part in women becoming pregnant?"
"At the moment, family policy is a big thing; demands are made for families to be supported and we are told that we need more children to be born, economics ministers trumpet aloud improvements to family policy while, at the same volume, proclaiming their opposition to this directive."
"This goes to show that family policy, just as much as women’s policies, is very often no more than a way for our male politicians to get themselves off the hook, with their fine words left hanging in the air while none of the things that are promised actually materialise."
"I would like to clarify that the calculation of premiums on the basis of risk is to continue to be possible, but that gender must not be included as a factor in these calculations."
"Using gender or race – both of them factors outside the control of the individual – as a factor in calculating premiums amounts to discrimination."
". Mr President, as the rapporteur has already stated, this directive puts an end to the persistent form of sex discrimination, known as statistical discrimination."
"In statistical discrimination, the average differences, established at a given point in time, between groups, in this case groups of men and groups of women, are made absolute as permanent assessment criteria for individuals."
"Unfortunately, this statistical discrimination still occurs very frequently in the private insurance industry in a number of countries."
"However, the essence of insurance is about sharing the risks."
"Judging people on a characteristic over which they have no control must be considered discrimination."
"The apparent logic of taking into consideration the difference between men and women by the insurance industry is a remnant of times gone by – taking the easy option."
"We have to fight this as a matter of principle."
"The opponents are fighting a rearguard action."
"I am therefore pleased that such a large majority on the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities has approved Mrs Prets’ report, and I hope that the plenary will do likewise."
"We are, however, waiting for the next step, which will put a stop to the so-called hierarchy of equality."
"European anti-discrimination legislation is a patchwork which itself discriminates between the different grounds of discrimination."
"Consequently, different groups are given different levels of protection."
"Why is race discrimination prohibited by EU legislation in the areas of education and social services, while sex discrimination in those areas is not?"
"And why has in this area and that of social security no provision been made for discrimination on the basis of age, disability and social orientation?"
"We are looking forward to the Commission's promised Green Paper about the future of anti-discrimination legislation as a whole, and subsequently to new reparation legislation."
"After all, a hierarchy of equality is not acceptable in the European Union, which reportedly wants to be a community of values."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, warm thanks, first of all, to our rapporteur Mrs Prets;"
"I think we all agree on the basic premise that the fight against discrimination on the grounds of gender deserves our wholehearted support."
"We should not, however, allow this concern to deflect our gaze from the problems that this directive engenders."
"In essence, it has to do with the insurance sector."
"The Commission, along with many Members of this House, takes the view that gender should no longer be taken into account when calculating insurance premiums, claiming that this is intrinsically discriminatory."
"A majority on the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market disagrees with this approach; the fact is that calculating risks is what insurance companies do, and where there are different levels of risk, these may be taken into account."
"To take one example, in private old age pensions insurance, insurers take account, in their calculations, of the tendency of women to live longer than men can expect to do."
"I do not see that as intrinsically discriminatory; it is one of the factors that may be taken into account when working out the contributions."
"Another example is to be found in motor insurance; according to the statistics, it so happens that women cause fewer accidents than do men, and so insurers charge women lower rates."
"I do not think that is discriminatory; that is the application of mathematics, which cannot simply be abrogated by legislation."
"The one exception I would make is in the case of maternity and pregnancy, where I do not believe there should be any difference between men and women when it comes to the costs."
"This is an area where both sexes, of course, share responsibility, and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has therefore decided that they must be treated equally in this respect."
"What leads me to oppose this directive is the fact that it stands for massive interference in people’s private affairs."
"I am opposed to the introduction of unisex tariffs, and I hope that the amendments that our group has resubmitted will be supported by a majority of the plenary tomorrow."
"Commissioner, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express my support for Mrs Prets’ report, which is of major importance to women."
"Indeed, non-discrimination between persons is one of the common principles of the EU and its Member States."
"We are not asking for money, as many seem to suggest; what we want is respect for European values and for the treaties."
"Nor – contrary to certain people’s frequent apparent accusations – are we asking for special privileges."
"Parliament’s opinion must not be drawn along party political or partisan lines, but must be a political act in the cause of greater respect for gender equality."
"We had for a long time hoped for a more wide-ranging directive, encompassing numerous fields in which to promote gender equality."
"The directive before us, however, is somewhat limited, yet is very important for equality between persons, and in itself represents a step forward."
"We expect that this directive will bring greater solidarity and equality between the sexes."
"I should like to emphasise that we must oppose any discrimination based on criteria over which people have no control, such as sex, race, ethnic background and age."
"This proposal for a directive does not target the calculation of premiums according to risk, but is solely concerned with the inclusion of sex as a factor in this calculation by the insurance companies."
"Excuse me, but I am a woman and I do not believe that my gender constitutes a risk."
"Other factors connected with lifestyle, irrespective of gender, can be taken into account in the calculation of certain types of insurance."
"I should also like to underline that the right to equality between women and men is an individual right that belongs to both women and men as individuals and not as members of a group."
"There are those who put forward arguments designed to alarm our female citizens."
"Before I make a quick synopsis of the possible implications of the directive, I must emphasise that possible, not probable, reductions or increases in certain areas of insurance will only be applicable to new policies and not, as some would have us believe, to existing ones."
"Furthermore, not only does this directive concern women, it also concerns men."
"It will therefore affect insurance premium calculations for men, as well as other areas covered by this directive, namely access to and supply of goods and services."
"Equality in the access to and supply of goods and services is essential."
"Even today, in our civilised societies, discriminatory practices remain commonplace."
"It is normal to see posters specifying that an apartment can only be rented either by men or women; and to see places or services that are only accessible to one of the sexes."
"We have previously debated the subject of equal treatment between women and men in the field of cooperation and development."
"The report concerned, which was intended to make it possible to strengthen the role of women and to combat discrimination between men and women in third countries, is an example that we must follow here, in our own back yard."
"There are those whose amendments are aimed at removing all of the directive’s substance."
"I hope that this will not happen when it comes to the vote, and that we will approve this report."
"I also hope that the EU and the Member States will put this directive in place and enforce it."
"While EU law lays down the principle of equal treatment between women and men – and a directive has already been adopted to this end – this principle has always proved difficult to implement in practice."
"Good will is all very well, but there is still disparity between men and women in the job market."
"Such inequality, however, is now criticised as a hindrance to European competitiveness and to achieving the Lisbon objectives, as stated in the Commission’s latest report on equality between men and women."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I hope that during the coming legislature, the Commission will table a directive that plugs the gaps of non-discrimination between women and men in fields not yet covered."
"I especially hope that tomorrow Parliament will send a strong and clear signal affirming non-discrimination and the equality of women and men."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Prets on her report and to thank her for her cooperation in respect of the opinion from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"I can understand the concerns of the insurance industry."
"The proposal will bring considerable changes to its practices and at present it is uncertain as to how to go about implementing these changes."
"Understandably, industry never likes uncertainty."
"However, I do not understand industry's argument that the current use of gender to differentiate premiums and benefits is not discriminatory because it is based on objective factors."
"Even if it is the case that on average young men have more car accidents than young women, or that on average women live longer than men, this is not true of all individuals, and these individuals are disadvantaged accordingly."
"In any event, the existence of objective differences, whether between individuals or groups, is not of itself sufficient grounds for according them unequal treatment."
"There must be a sound political justification for doing so."
"I have to say that in the 21st century I do not believe that such a justification can be provided where the routine provision of goods and services to men and women is concerned, any more than it could be where other such socially constructed groupings were involved."
"If I speak with some feeling on the matter it is because, on several occasions in my own life, I have experienced the kind of discrimination that this directive is intended to prevent."
"I do not want to see new generations bearing the same scars."
"I would ask insurance companies to look to see whether the changes might not actually afford opportunities to them."
"I would not willingly purchase an annuity because I do not believe it would offer a financially advantageous way of arranging my affairs."
"Perhaps I am not the only woman who feels this way."
"Mr President, as long ago as the 1960s, I was fighting for equality between women and men and against any discrimination based on sex."
"I have been fighting since 1963 for equal treatment and opportunities between men and women, in women’s organisations, at national and at European level, and most of the time as president."
"I cannot, therefore, be accused of not promoting the implementation of the principle of equality between men and women by directives covering all fields."
"I also, therefore, believe that there is a real moral and legal obligation to support this proposal for a directive establishing equal treatment between women and men in the access to and supply of goods and services."
"In politics, however, nobody is forced to do what is impossible or absurd."
"Unfortunately, the Commission’s proposal does not take account of the fact that in the field of insurance there is a further directive that requires insurers set sufficiently prudent premiums, taking into account all future commitments."
"It is a fact that for certain risks, sex – I prefer to use the term gender – is an objective criterion that insurers must take into account in determining the level of liability that they are to accept."
"We cannot, therefore, prohibit insurers from taking sex into account on prudential grounds in the actuarial risk calculation, even if the premium does not eventually vary from one sex to the other."
"Given that all those insured, regardless of sex, are primarily interested in the financial viability of insurance, we have tabled amendments to take account of this concern."
"Like the Commission, we wish to lay down the principle that the use of sex as a determining and discriminatory factor in the calculation of premiums for insurance purposes must be prohibited for new contracts concluded after the directive has been adopted."
"We would not accept retroactive legislation to cover existing contracts."
"We would, however, allow sex to be taken into account according to objective, verifiable and transparent criteria, to be monitored by the Member States, for actuarial calculations."
"This makes sense and is in the interests of all insured parties, especially since, as the Commission says in its short justification, ‘there is little evidence of the existence of consistent discriminatory practices in the area of the access to or supply of goods and services’."
"The Commission says, in fact, that in the setting of rates, insurance companies should take into account criteria other than sex, such as lifestyle, behaviour or professional status."
"I doubt whether such practice would be compatible with respect for private life, quite apart from the fact that it would cause new and manifold forms of discrimination between men and women."
"Mr President, I do not see why we have to include provisions in this legislative text regarding sexual harassment."
"I really do not see how I could be harassed when buying a commodity or service."
"I do not believe, for example, that the chemist would harass me for buying condoms or Viagra for my husband or my boyfriend."
"I would not do this, as I do not have either, but let us drop all of these politically correct elements that are a waste of space in a legislative text."
"Mr President, if there had been any doubt that this proposal for a directive were also about men and money, there was, in any case, no longer any such doubt when a number of jacket-clad men appeared on the rows furthest to the back during the discussion of this subject by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities."
"It was quite legitimate that they should be there, but also very instructive because, when it boils down to it, the proposal is about rectifying a situation in which women pay more, and obtain less, than men when it comes to life assurance, pensions etc."
"When they came to my office with views opposed to the proposal, a number of insurance people said that they just wanted to see a fair system."
"It set me thinking about what is really meant by fairness."
"Their conception of fairness was obvious. It was quite fair that there should be solidarity among women and solidarity among men."
"This means, for example, that women who cannot have children have to pay for those who can, while, from this insurance point of view, the children’s fathers do not participate in any form of financial solidarity at all."
"I am of course in complete disagreement with the insurance industry."
"Equality is a fundamental principle in the EU."
"It is there in the existing Treaty and occurs again in the new draft constitutional treaty."
"It is also stated that the EU must take initiatives to remedy situations in which these principles are not being complied with."
"I should therefore like to thank the former Commissioner for the work she has done in this area, and I now hope that it will get through the European Parliament and, subsequently, the Council."
"I should like to say that, in my view, there is much more at stake than just this proposal, for it is in reality the future of the EU that is at issue."
"The proposal demonstrates whether there is a link between words and action."
"When women now look at the ‘family photo’, it is difficult for them to identify with the EU they see there."
"If – and this can perhaps be excused – we in the Commission, the Council and Parliament show that we cannot even remedy an area such as this, there is no chance of getting women also to vote in favour of the future EU."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to remind the House that we have been waiting a long time for this directive."
"The point has already been made that the directive to combat racism and discrimination based on ethnic origin was approved in the year 2000 – some four years ago."
"It could be that nobody is interested in this issue; it could also be that this is simply an extremely tricky one."
"It also appears to me that the Commission had a great deal of difficulty in reaching this agreement. The programme should have been much broader and should have encompassed education and the media, yet all of this is absent from the final draft."
"I regret this, given that we are not satisfied with the replies given regarding the media and discrimination in the media, which consisted of saying that self-regulation is sufficient, and that we have been told so by those who work in the sector."
"I feel that all of us here can confirm, with regard to our own countries, that self-regulation is not sufficient."
"The ‘Television without frontiers’ directive also contains provisions to combat sexism in the media. The reality of the situation, however, leaves something to be desired."
"The area before us – that of housing, insurance, goods and services – is important; having listened this evening and read this report and draft, we realise how difficult it is to combat these forms of discrimination."
"Against this backdrop, I do not wish to complain, but rather to take satisfaction from the fact that Europe is achieving more than each of our countries in terms of addressing an extremely tricky issue, namely, fighting against stereotypes in the criteria used to calculate premiums or in types of insurance."
"I think it is tremendous that Europe is able to devote its attention to problems such as these."
"Some speakers have suggested that, in actual fact, we are far from achieving our goal, that stereotypes still prevail, that we are content to use stereotypes rather than, as has been said time and again, to consider a range of contributory factors that would enable us to address more appropriately the difficulties that people have in the area of insurance."
"This is all too true. I feel that it is imperative that we combat stereotypes in the area of insurance underwriting and risk assessment."
"It has been said that women are the ones who lose out."
"Men might say, from their point of view, that they do not all wish to be seen as road hogs and bad drivers."
"It is, consequently, both men and women who will be affected if we manage to achieve equal representation in the area of insurance."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we, too, welcome the Commission proposal and the report that Mrs Prets has produced on behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, even though we do find it very much to be regretted that both fall far short of what had been expected, in that such important areas as education, the media and advertising have been left out."
"We nevertheless believe that this proposal puts plenty of wind in the sails of equality for women and men in the EU."
"The removal of these inequalities in services was long overdue, and, with this report, we have set up a landmark for equality policy."
"It is hypocritical and unfair for the private insurance sector to make threatening gestures; it is merely trying to promote panic among consumers and its customers."
"As has already been said, it is far better to include other risk factors in calculations."
"It is lifestyle that is crucial to life expectancy. We know from studies in the USA that 86% of us live for the same length of time."
"Just as nobody thinks in terms of discriminating on the grounds of ethnic origin, there must be no discrimination on the grounds of gender."
"Now of all times, when the adoption of a European constitution is about to be adopted, it would be a mockery for us to fail to push forward the equality that it – as has already been said – has as one of its core values."
"Although I see the Commission’s proposal for the progressive removal of discrimination as something of an admission of its inadequacy – we would have liked more than that – I do believe that, when we vote, we have to send a clear and unambiguous message in support of equality policy and against discrimination."
"The principle of equality must count for more; after all, even private insurance companies are bound by it, and it is intolerable that these should use unacceptable forms of discrimination as a means of securing themselves a competitive advantage over statutory insurance schemes."
"I would like us to be seen by the whole world as a beacon for equality policy; I want the EU, being such a great economic area, to set up a landmark, and our vote to carry a clear message."
"Mr President, this proposal is about the equal treatment of women and men in access to, and supply of, services, particularly about the actuarial problems in insurance services."
"It is therefore not logical for the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities to have been allocated this report."
"It has replaced the principle of equal treatment by equality of men and women, but that is not the issue."
"The consequence of this change is that the text lacks coherence."
"For example, Amendment No 19 stipulates that there shall be no sex discrimination, including less favourable treatment, also as a result of paternity."
"There should also be equal treatment in the insurance industry, so that life expectancy on the basis of sex alone should no longer play a role in calculating insurance premiums."
"The calculation of risks on the basis of life expectancy is based on outdated information and according to other male and female role models."
"The premiums should therefore be based on solidarity between men and women."
"The fact is that there is a greater variation within the group of men or women than there is between men and women."
"There is, admittedly, a significant difference between men and women statistically speaking, but this can be explained historically."
"In the future, the increasing similarity in lifestyle and occupational pursuits will mean that this statistically significant difference will not necessarily continue to exist."
"Mr President, as a woman, I have always been proud of what the European Community has achieved in the area of equal treatment of men and women."
"In that respect, we have played a pioneering role, certainly as regards the equal treatment in what – for the sake of convenience – I should like to call the working and professional environment."
"That has not always been the case."
"Now that we have a legal basis enabling us to go one step beyond the professional and working environment, I think we should do this."
"I do welcome the fact that, in terms of tax law, the Commission provides, at least at the moment, for temporary derogation."
"I believe that to be important, because where tax law is concerned, we move into the realms of family policy, and I think that we should continue to give the Member States free choices in that field."
"Understandably, the insurance industry has asked for a derogation to be put in place for them, because the proposal requires them to make huge adjustments."
"I would, however, ask them to understand that we nevertheless want to include insurance in the scope of this directive."
"I accept the legal argument that, strictly speaking, the unequal treatment of what is different does not amount to discrimination."
"This, however, should not stop us from taking positive steps in order to establish the equal treatment of men and women in the broad sense of the word, in society."
"That, therefore, means that we need to go beyond working and professional regulations and in that sense, I can also largely support the Commission's proposal."
"Mr President, in this debate, four key issues must be raised."
"The first is the delay in tabling a proposal for a directive, as has already been mentioned here, to prohibit discrimination based on sex in fields other than work. This was announced in the social policy agenda in June 2000 and we have repeatedly called for such a proposal in various reports approved by Parliament."
"We deplore the fact that pressure and resistance on the part of various interested parties, in particular the insurance and media sectors, have delayed its passage."
"The second issue concerns the vastly reduced scope of the proposal presented by the Commission, which covers only access to goods and services and the supply of these, and excludes other fields, such as media and advertising content, education and decision-making processes."
"This is an appalling state of affairs, particularly when one sees the discrimination that persists in the media, in advertising and in decision-making processes. Other areas, such as vocational training and social security, are covered by other directives, although we must look again at these areas in order to improve the content and to eliminate discrimination based on sex in all areas, particularly in occupational social security schemes."
"This principle has already been set out in previous directives, but is still not being implemented. We therefore support the inclusion of some practical measures that will ensure that this principle is applied more effectively."
"The fourth question concerns the need to eliminate discrimination in services that are essential to ensuring women to live on an equal footing with men on a day-to-day basis."
"Unequal treatment between women and men must be prohibited in all areas of the supply of goods and services."
"It is unacceptable that insurance companies include gender as a factor in risk calculations or that banks discriminate against women when granting credit."
"The rapporteur, whom I should like to congratulate on her work, states that the right to equal treatment belongs to the citizen as an individual and not as a member of a group."
"The ways in which insurance companies analyse risk, premiums and payment deadlines in terms of groups and of male and female averages, are, therefore, unacceptable."
"This does not mean, however, that we should not be proactive in eliminating inequality and in promoting equality between men and women."
"This is a tentative and incomplete step, which I hope will be approved tomorrow and will accordingly become a EU directive. We must strive to fully implement, at the earliest possible opportunity, the processes that are still lacking."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have followed these interventions with a great deal of interest and I should like to thank the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, as well as the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for their contributions to the report being debated."
"I should like to congratulate Mrs Prets on her excellent report, which proposes numerous improvements to our proposal and gives it greater clarity and greater cohesion with previous Community directives."
"In particular, we welcome the amendments which bring the Commission proposal into line with Directive 2000/43 on racial discrimination or Directive 2002/73 on equal treatment for men and women in employment."
"I refer to Amendments Nos 3, 4, 5 part three and part four, 6, 7, 8, 12, 17, 20, 23 part one, 25 part one, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33 and 43."
"I should also like to thank the Committee on Women’s Rights on its proposed Amendment No 15, which clarifies the dividing line between private pensions and occupational pensions, which are covered by existing directives on employment."
"The above amendments are also in keeping with the discussions held in the Council."
"We cannot support a number of other amendments, even though they are constructive, because they deviate from similar provisions in current directives and because we believe that it would be preferable to maintain the same approach for reasons of cohesion."
"I refer mainly to Amendments Nos 16, 19, 21, 24, 25, 28, 29, 34 and 40."
"Nor do we agree with the abolition of the exceptions for which provision is made in Article 1, paragraph 3, given that it is necessary to maintain a limited number of exceptions if the directive is to be applicable in practice."
"I refer to Amendments Nos 9 and 13."
"Nor can we support the amendments which extend the proposal to the education, mass media and advertising sectors."
"The Commission proposal focuses on a specific sector, the goods and services sector."
"As such, it is a step by step approach to a sector in which, as everyone knows, there is a great deal of gender-based discrimination which can be wiped out with a binding legislative act."
"We recognise that the representation of the sexes in the mass media and advertising raises serious questions regarding the protection of the dignity of men and women and that, in the education sector, girls and boys are often discouraged from following non-traditional paths, but other complicated issues also arise, such as the freedom of means of communication."
"Consequently, the Commission considers that, in order to deal with them, a binding legislative act is not appropriate at the present stage."
"I refer to Amendments Nos 38 and 39."
"Finally, as far as Amendments Nos 35 and 36 in Article 4 of the proposal are concerned, we cannot agree to amendments designed to allow the use of gender-based actuarial factors."
"The use of gender-based actuarial factors is not compatible with the principle of equal treatment and cannot therefore be justified objectively."
"Such actuarial factors make broad generalisations about all men and all women and cannot be justified."
"They reflect statistics on the average population, but these statistics are misleading because they conceal the fact that other factors relating to life style are more important than gender."
"In fact, studies have shown that 86% of men and women have the same life expectancy."
"In this group of 86%, a woman is treated differently from a man under the same conditions, purely and simply because an inaccurate generalisation is made about the life expectancy of all women."
"This practice infringes the principle of equal treatment and, as such, cannot be justified by a statistics-based generalisation."
"Nonetheless, we welcome the fact that the proposed amendment recognises that the cost of pregnancy in life assurance should be borne by men and women equally, in order for there to be compliance with the principle of equal treatment."
"As regards Amendments Nos 10, 22 and 41, which propose on the one hand, a reduction in the transitional period of six years provided for in Article 4 for gender-based actuarial factors and on the other, stricter monitoring requirements during that period, we do not agree with them because we believe that we cannot expect the insurance sector to adapt from one day to the next and because we consider that the additional six-year period provided for in Article 4 is needed in order to develop working methods for using other, more accurate factors than gender."
"Nonetheless, we hope that, at the end of this period, the insurance industry will have no problems applying the principle of equal treatment and European consumers will reap the relevant benefits."
"As regards the amendments which propose replacing the term ‘application of the principle of equal treatment of men and women’ with the term ‘application of equality between men and women’ throughout the proposal, we cannot support these amendments because this would go beyond the legal basis of Article 13 of the Treaty."
"Article 13 authorises the Community to take action to combat discrimination, in other words to safeguard the equal treatment of men and women."
"It does not grant it wider powers to promote equality or to guarantee full equality in practice."
"Although Article 3, paragraph 2 of the Treaty makes provision for the Community to aim to promote equality between men and women in all its activities, this provision cannot change the nature of the legal basis of Article 13 of the Treaty."
"I refer to Amendments Nos 1, 5 parts one and two, 11, 18, 23 part two and 42."
"Finally, Mr President, regarding the last proposed amendment, Amendment No 45, which proposes that the Member States engage in dialogue with non-governmental organisations working to combat discrimination and the social partners, we agree in principle but we believe that the wording should be broad enough to cover all the agencies involved, because there are other organisations which represent social agents, such as consumer associations, social organisations and so on."
"I am sorry I had to overrun my speaking time, but at least the good news is that we see that we men shall live approximately the same number of years as women."
"By all means, Commissioner."
"You have made full and wise use of your speaking time."
"Mr President, the Commissioner said that he could not accept our Amendments Nos 35 and 36."
"He is doubtlessly aware that there is an ‘insurance’ directive, specifically devoted to insurance, and that Article 18 of this directive requires that insurers calculate sufficiently prudent premiums taking account of future commitments."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner if the Commission has checked, with the legal service, whether the proposals before us are compatible with the ‘insurance’ directive."
". – Mr President, as far as these arguments are concerned, I should like to say that the objective of the directive is to apply the principle of equal treatment of men and women."
"The use of gender-based actuarial factors is not compatible with the principle of equal treatment and, consequently, must be abolished within the framework of the directive."
"That is why the present directive is based on Article 13 of the Treaty, in a bid to combat gender-based discrimination."
"The objective of the directive is not to legislate to regulate the operating terms of the internal market and, as such, Article 95 is not a suitable legal basis."
"Thank you for that clarification of the law, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"(1)"
"The Commission can accept the following amendments: 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 71, 72, 73, 74, 77, 78, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 90, 94, 95, 96, 97, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 106, 107, 108, 111, 112, 114, 115, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 128, 137, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 157, 158 and 164 to 209."
"The Commission cannot accept the following amendments: 1, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 22, 28, 30, 31, 43, 50, 51, 59, 67, 68, 69, 70, 75, 76, 79, 89, 91, 92, 93, 98, 105, 109, 110, 113, 116, 117, 127, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 138, 156, 159, 160, 161, 162 or 163."

"Mr President, today, and over the next few days, dozens of farmers from Karditsa, Trikala, Larissa and Magnisia in Thessalia and from other areas of Greece will stand in the dock accused of having taken part in rural demonstrations held in order to rebuff the all-out attack on them from the common agricultural policy and avoid being wiped out, so that they can stay on their land and in their villages."
"The previous government responded to the reasonable demands of the farmers with hundreds of rural tribunals, which were set up throughout the country and sentenced farmers in order to break their fighting spirit."
"Governments come and go but the rural tribunals stay."
"The criminalisation of rural demonstrations is designed to terrorise the fighters of poor and middle-class farming into stopping their fight to overturn this policy, which has brought such hardship to Mediterranean products and to their income and has resulted in the abandonment of the countryside."
"The new Greek Government which, when in opposition, said that it disagreed with these prosecutions, is keeping quiet like a new Pontius Pilate."
"From this tribune we condemn the pogrom continuing even today of the fighters of the rural movement and we demand an immediate end to it."
"It is certain that no trial or sentence will break their fighting spirit."
"The poor farmers will fight to stay in their villages and on their land, they will continue their productive activity, because it is a question of life for them and their families."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"– Report (A5-0120/2004) by Mr Obiols i Germà, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of a Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republics of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama"
"– Report (A5-0119/2004) by Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council decision on the signature of a Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Andean Community and its Member States, the Republics of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, of the other part."
". Mr President, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to take part in this debate and, looking at the speaking list, I am sure it will have been worth waiting for!"
"It is very important for us to have the opportunity once again to discuss the European Union's relations with Latin America, and I am particularly pleased that we have the views of two very distinguished colleagues who know so much about the subject and who have committed themselves so enthusiastically and knowledgeably to strengthening our relations over the last few years."
"The agreements which we are discussing today mark an extremely important step forward in our relations with Central America and with the Andean Community."
"I am therefore grateful for the strong support that the European Parliament gave to them."
"As the House knows, the commitment to negotiate new political dialogue and cooperation agreements with each region was made at the Madrid EU-Latin America and Caribbean summit in 2002."
"The European Union has delivered on this commitment."
"Negotiations were successfully and rapidly concluded after just two rounds in October 2003, and both agreements were signed on 15 December in Rome."
"These new agreements are ambitious."
"First of all, they institutionalise and strengthen the political dialogue: the San Jose dialogue with Central America that was initiated in 1984 and the ministerial political dialogue conducted with the Andean Community that goes back to the 1996 Rome Declaration."
"Secondly, they expand the scope of both the political dialogue and the European Union's existing cooperation with the two regions, for example, by including some new areas such as migration, conflict prevention, good governance and counter-terrorism activities."
"Obviously, having negotiated these agreements as rapidly as possible is not enough."
"We must also make sure that they enter into force quickly and I hope that ratification procedures on both sides will be speedy."
"This is important, because the new areas addressed by the agreements reflect the very real concerns of both regions."
"At the European Union-Latin America and Caribbean summit in Madrid it was agreed that the conditions were not right to launch negotiations for association agreements."
"These political dialogue and cooperation agreements were seen as an intermediate step: the aim of the agreements is to create the conditions which would allow the negotiation of association agreements, including free trade agreements, in the future."
"The Heads of State and Government also defined what the main requirements were for advancing towards an association agreement, notably the achievement of deeper regional integration and the completion of the Doha Round."
"I would like to take this opportunity to underline the importance of the recently negotiated agreements as an instrument towards our common goal of negotiating association agreements with these regions in the future."
"We are now two years beyond one summit, on the eve of another – the Guadalajara Summit – and we must re-assess our relationship with these regions."
"There are many questions we should ask ourselves."
"To what extent are the conditions we set out in Madrid still valid in the light of recent developments?"
"How should the absence of substantial progress in the multilateral trade negotiations affect our relations with these regions?"
"How can we ensure that we do not inadvertently in any way undermine our principal trade objective of promoting multilateral agreements and completing the Doha Development Round?"
"Otherwise, would we not risk the opening of such negotiations becoming a mere political gesture, as we want agreements with content that go beyond what can be agreed at multilateral level?"
"Is there an acceptable political formula to cover all these objectives?"
"Regional integration remains of key importance: it can contribute to fostering political stability, economic and social development and social cohesion within each sub-region."
"The Commission considers that further progress towards deepening integration is a sign of political and economic maturity."
"How can we measure progress in regional integration?"
"I believe the essential elements for measuring progress revolve around three fundamental elements: a fully operational institutional framework, the existence of a customs union and the reduction of obstacles to intra-regional trade."
"The next joint step should be to evaluate progress achieved by both regions with a view to preparing the ground for the opening of negotiations."
"I would underline that this process should be carried out in an objective manner and we should not set impossible standards that might only lead to frustration among our counterparts."
"The Commission has always supported regional integration."
"We are convinced that it should continue to do so."
"This support is not only one of words: under our regional programme for Central America, the Commission has approved one project in support of the Central American Customs Union worth EUR 8 million in 2001 and a second one in support of the regional integration institutions and the involvement of civil society in the process of regional integration worth EUR 15 million in 2003."
"A further project in support of the development and implementation of common policies to the value of EUR 10 million is currently under preparation."
"In the Andean Community, projects on statistics, customs, competition and trade-related technical assistance, together worth more than EUR 15 million, are being implemented and there are plans to strengthen this form of cooperation in the forthcoming revision of the regional strategy paper, adding another EUR 4 million to the economic regional integration objective."
"Central America, the Andean Community and Latin America as a whole are not suffering from a lack of interest from our side."
"In the current financial perspectives from 2000 to 2006, funds for Latin America are about 20% higher than in the former financial perspective."
"The Community budget spends about EUR 0.15 per capita in Asia, while three times that much per capita is spent in Latin America."
"Perhaps of the greatest significance, we are now actually spending the money we commit."
"In 2003, 100% of the payments, as well as 100% of commitments, were used."
"I want to emphasise once again that relations with Latin America are a geostrategic priority for the European Union."
"I have been particularly pleased in recent weeks to be able to discuss our relationship with representatives of Mercosur, with all the foreign ministers of the Andean Community and with representatives of Central America."
"I very much hope that we will be able to have a successful summit to follow up the one in Madrid, which will focus on regional integration and social inclusion."
"I also very much hope that the summit in Guadalajara will be able to see a further development in our relations with the two regions with which we have only recently negotiated sensible agreements."
". Mr President, I was pleased to hear the Commissioner’s words."
"They clearly demonstrate a concern and a sense of priority, and I would like to say to him that the assessment of this Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and the Central American region will essentially depend on one factor, and that is what prospects this period the Commissioner has described as transitional will open up."
"From our point of view, and on the basis of this Parliament’s Resolution of 15 November 2001, this type of political and cooperation agreement must open the way to preparing association agreements which include a free trade treaty, in accordance with the intense aspirations of our Central American partners and, in my view, fully in accordance with the political, economic and commercial interests of the European Union."
"In other words, the key question is whether a period of negotiations is really being opened up for an association agreement with the Central American countries, and also with those of the Andean Community, of a similar nature, to those reached with Mexico and Chile, and the one which is being negotiated with Mercosur, as a prelude to a more general strategic perspective which should lead to a global interregional agreement and the creation of a Euro-Latin American free trade area."
"We are now being offered an opportunity, at the third Summit to take place in May, to demonstrate a sense of anticipation and foresight, explicitly opening up this prospect."
"Changes are taking place in the region, a region – as we all know – plagued with difficult structural and economic situations, serious ones, but there are undoubtedly encouraging signs; there is a shared will amongst the Presidents of the region to move forward pragmatically in the field of economic integration; there is a new stage for the Central American Bank for Economic Integration, which I believe to be very hopeful; there are plans for the reform of the integration institutions, in particular fairly thorough reforms of the Central American Parliament and, in this regard, the European Union’s presence and voice must contribute to demonstrating clearly that we do not just indulge in diplomacy when there are situations of conflict, but that we apply the same effort and the same sense of priority which was put into decisively assisting the peace processes in the region, that we still have the will and the determination to aim at improving the political, economic and social situation in a region so devastated by historical and current problems."
"Commissioner, I would like the Guadalajara Summit in May to clearly open up a stage in which the implementation of this Agreement is handled with the greatest possible will, which also involves maintaining the commercial facilities enjoyed by the countries of that region, within the system of generalised preferences and the special ‘drugs’ system, and, above all, that there be a specific commitment made to negotiating a genuine association agreement."
"While we are on the subject of the Guadalajara Summit, I would like to mention to Mr Patten in particular an issue which does not strictly relate to Central America, but which could be a success story for the Summit in a specific field: there are several black holes in the current world situation, and one of them is called Haiti."
"And the commitment to prolonged and intense assistance from the European Union, in agreement with the Latin American partners and perfectly in agreement with Caricom, with the OAS and with the United Nations, could, I believe, be a success story for the Guadalajara Summit, which will be consolidated if good intentions are then followed by determined and sustained actions."
". Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Commissioner Patten for the efforts I know he has made to attend this debate, despite the difficulties with the agenda."
"In order to dispel any doubt, I would also like to congratulate the Commission on its diligence in presenting the guidelines for concluding these Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreements – and I am sure that Mr Patten will remember the meetings we held, with Mr Lamy as well, prior to the Madrid Summit."
"I would also like to congratulate the Commission on its diligence, efficiency and speed in negotiating these agreements which, as Mr Obiols i Germà has just pointed out, Parliament sees as forerunners to association agreements."
"With the discussion in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and the vote, which was unanimous, on these two agreements – something which does not happen very often – and with today’s debate in plenary and the subsequent vote, one stage is being closed and another opened up, marked, I would say, by the forthcoming Guadalajara Summit."
"As Mr Patten knows better than anyone, we live in a complex world, in which the European Union has both internal responsibilities, such as the birth of the Constitution or enlargement, and also external responsibilities: the new relationship with Russia, our continuing problems in the Balkans, our responsibilities in Central Asia, Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan, the Middle East problem and taking relations with the United States in a new direction."
"In summary, Mr President, the world is a big place and Latin America is just one part of it, but I believe it is very satisfactory that we are acknowledging, as the Commissioner has done, that Latin America continues to be a priority area for the European Union, amongst other things because we have common values and a shared history."
"On 19 March a meeting was held between a large delegation of Members of this Parliament and representatives of the Latin American Parliament and its President, representatives of the Andean Parliament and its President, representatives of the Central American Parliament and its President and representatives of the Parliamentary Commission of Mercosur and its President as well."
"That is to say, a meeting of parliamentarians which represented more than a billion citizens of Europe and Latin America."
"That meeting established conclusions on how to mark out the route towards the bi-regional strategic partnership which was established at the two previous summits."
"We Members of Parliament who attended it – Mr Obiols was there and other Members of this House who are attending this debate – concluded that we did not need a long catalogue of declarations and statements, but that, in order to realise that bi-regional strategic partnership, we simply needed a series of concrete proposals, which we set out in the form of a decalogue."
"That decalogue focuses fundamentally on three areas."
"On the area of political dialogue and will, because – let us make no mistake – it is political will which has driven these relations forward over recent years, and we are therefore proposing the creation of a Euro-Latin American parliamentary assembly, somewhat similar to the Assembly which has been established in the field of Euro-Mediterranean relations."
"We are proposing to renew and update the ministerial political dialogue, to agree in international fora and in the United Nations system between European and Latin American positions and also to sign a Euro-Latin American Charter for peace and security with a view to creating a forum in which we can deal seriously with issues relating to security and defence, which currently have no specific forum."
"Above all, we are proposing a renewal of the bi-regional political agenda in order to be able to discuss issues such as those relating to terrorism, the issue of the reform of the United Nations system, the threats to governability, a review of the fight against poverty and many other initiatives."
"Nevertheless, Commissioner, political dialogue, however thriving it is, will end and come to nothing unless we translate words into actions."
"It is clear that one very obvious field in which we must translate words into actions is that of commercial relations."
"We are therefore proposing that, at the Guadalajara Summit, specific dates be indicated for the association of the Andean and Central American countries, without subjecting them to discriminatory conditions which have not been imposed on other countries or groups of countries, and there are grounds for a debate here – you have referred to integration – on whether integration should be a prior condition or whether it would follow on from association."
"This Parliament believes that we must make real progress towards integration, but it is perfectly possible for integration to follow on from association agreements."
"We also understand and share the desire for the negotiation of a balanced agreement with Mercosur to be completed before the end of this year and this Parliament also believes that, whilst complying with bilateral and regional agreements that have been negotiated or which are in the process of being negotiated, we should promote a kind of Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) with soul, European-style, in which we provide an institutional dimension and complete geographical coverage for relations between the European Union and Latin America."
"We also believe, Commissioner, that we must have a cooperation policy which can in some way be adapted to this new concept, to this new idea of association."
"In this regard – and you know what Parliament’s thinking is – Parliament has insisted on having a differentiated legal framework and we also believe that we must promote an entire range of policies in the field of education, culture, vocational training and scientific and technological cooperation."
"As you know, Commissioner, Parliament has proposed the establishment of a bi-regional solidarity fund, an initiative in which we do not want to create additional bureaucratic structures."
"We believe that this must be interpreted flexibly and incorporated into the Commission’s initiatives, but we also believe that this initiative must take advantage of the financial opportunities offered by both the European Investment Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank."
"I would like to say finally, Commissioner, that, as you can see, Parliaments’ proposals are extremely ambitious."
"We hope that this ambition is shared by the Member States and by the Commission in the Communication it is preparing, so that a clear and well-defined message can be sent regarding Europe’s commitment to Latin America."
"I would also like to say that, in order for this message to be effective and have a multiplying effect – and I make this proposal on behalf of my political group – we must restore and consolidate the strategic alliance and harmonious partnership between the European Parliament and the Commission, which has resulted in so much progress between the European Union and Latin America, as soon as possible."
". Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for the words he has addressed to us, which open up more interesting perspectives for the future of relations between the European Union and Latin America."
"Perhaps for this very reason it may be interesting to relate a brief history of this relationship over recent years."
"Since being all but absent from the agenda during the seventies, it was enhanced during the following decade, coinciding with the disappearance of the dictatorships and the spread of democracy."
"Thus the first generation agreements were born and the economic contributions which improved cooperation were increased."
"In the following decade – the nineties – the third generation agreements were born with the inclusion of conditionality clauses and support and promotion for peace processes."
"These more committed policies gave the European Union great visibility, ending the century with the negotiation of an association agreement with Mexico, which was a milestone in the European Union's policy."
"All of this led to the expectation that we would continue along this path. Nevertheless, during the first half of this decade association has only been extended to Chile."
"The ambition for a new strategy appears to be paralysed and strangely this coincides with the enlargement of the Union."
"Meanwhile, the United States is extending and continuing bilateral negotiations aimed at consolidating its position in the region – which, furthermore, is nothing new – with the same countries from which the European Union is demanding the signature of a hypothetical association agreement as a prior condition for regional integration."
"Two very different approaches."
"In a few months’ time, the Heads of State or Government of the subcontinent and the European Union will meet in Mexico."
"This summit will be a great opportunity as the Commissioner has stated."
"The idea of this meeting is magnificent, provided that it produces more than a list of good intentions."
"Perhaps the Commissioner could give us more details so that we are better aware of the agenda."
"As has already been said, the city of Puebla has recently been the venue for the meeting between European Members of Parliament and the Parliaments of Latin American political integration."
"The debate gave rise to a series of agreements and objectives which are expressed in the final document and which can be summed up as greater bi-regional cooperation, greater integration, strengthening of parliamentary dialogue and the agenda for association."
"The agreements we are analysing today are undoubtedly more ambitious than those signed in 1993."
"Let us trust that they enter into force within more reasonable timescales."
"I would personally like to be optimistic and for these agreements to be a valid instrument for moving forward with association."
"It is the case that current commercial exchanges are very modest – and this is reflected in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy’s text – even with the facilities provided by the system of generalised preferences and, furthermore, these exports, which are not sufficiently diversified, are constantly subjected to reductions in international market prices."
"An association, however, is rather more than a commercial agreement, the implementation of an economic policy or a development cooperation project: at times like this, the era we are living in, in which nothing is immune to globalisation – including terrorism – association agreements must also be seen as instruments for collective security."
"We are talking about countries with difficulties, with levels of poverty which are so high that that poverty may come to threaten internal peace, but which, at the same time, have extraordinary potential, which are culturally close to us and which see us as a model of opportunity."
"Finally, Mr President, given that the texts of the agreements cannot be modified, this debate should at least serve to ensure that Parliament's opinion is taken into account if it is finally decided to take a more committed step and, as has been done with the southern Mediterranean countries, to make progress on association with the Andean countries, the Central American countries and – we should not forget – the countries of Mercosur."
". Mr President, the Commission's two proposals have to do with political dialogue and cooperation agreements rather than with an association agreement."
"That is why we regret the lack, in these proposals, of attention to an integrated economic and social development strategy, which, needless to say, is what that region deserves."
"First of all, a partnership-oriented agreement on cooperation with the Andes countries can help defuse the explosive political and social situation in the region. I would mention Columbia as a case in point."
"Over the past fifteen years, more than two million people have been driven out of their homes in that country, and there is an enormous humanitarian need."
"We need to step up our efforts in order to find a solution, with political means, for the armed conflicts, and to restore peace and social justice."
"The social situation in the Andes countries deserves more attention."
"Many of their inhabitants are still living in abject poverty."
"Two extremes: in Columbia, the so-called richest country, a quarter of the population has to manage on less than USD 2 a day."
"In Ecuador, the region's poorest country, this percentage is even higher than 50%."
"In the Central American countries, on average, a third of the population has to live on less than USD 2 a day."
"In Nicaragua, only four years ago, 10% of the poorest Nicaraguans accounted for less than 1% of total consumption, while 10% of that country's richest inhabitants took up more than half of total consumption."
"Malnutrition has been a serious problem for years in those countries, and it has got even worse in Guatemala."
"In the political dialogue, the Commission remains focused on the governments and their machinery."
"That is necessary, but it is, in fact, of huge importance also to involve the region's parliaments and civil society in the dialogue."
"This will benefit human rights, democracy and transparency more than if we focus only on diplomatic channels."
"Consequently, the EU should not only broaden the scope of the political dialogue by adding more partners, but should also complement it by integrating social and economic strategy as a priority."
"Mr President, Mr Patten has defined these agreements with two words: ‘strategy’ and ‘transitional’."
"I must thank him for his frankness, because in a way the two concepts are contradictory."
"The debate on the Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreements between the European Union and Central America and the Andean Community are a good example of the current situation of our relations with these countries, which I, in addition to the words you have used, would say is currently unsatisfactory."
"This is a Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement, but we are not making progress with our commercial relations."
"In reality, over recent years our relations with these areas of the world have not progressed in the way this Parliament would have liked."
"The crisis facing the Andean countries as a whole and in each one of them individually has not been helpful in terms of improving these relations."
"Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia are experiencing very difficult times which have hindered their processes of sub-regional integration, and this has not made it easy to make progress on our relations with them."
"The same can be said of Central America, where huge swathes of the population, young people in particular, who are increasingly marginalised and turning to crime as a result of their social marginalisation, are becoming an urgent problem for these small Central American States."
"I hope that the agreement with Mercosur, which is on the point of being signed, if things go ahead as planned, will be added to those in force with Chile and with Mexico and that these two regions can benefit from more ambitious agreements, the results of which will not be seen by the current Commission and Parliament, but by our successors."
"Mr President, Parliament cannot raise any objection to these agreements, and that is quite simply because they are two proposals entirely devoid of content."
"They are two agreements which I could define as heaven: a lot of good combined with no bad whatsoever."
"We are all in favour of cooperation, of exchanges, of the development of democracy etc., but there is nothing tangible in these agreements."
"There is no financial obligation, no commercial obligation and no institutional obligation."
"This is happening, furthermore, at a time when Latin America, despite its difficulties, is experiencing a period of stability, that is to say, there is some lack of stability but, despite the poverty – which Mr van den Berg referred to – Latin America today is generally speaking a peaceful and calm subcontinent."
"There are no international conflicts, there are internal conflicts, but they are on a very small scale compared to those during the eighties, and I have the impression that this is the time for us to effectively help the good people of Latin America to move forward."
"In order to do this, however, we firstly need a specific policy with regard to the region."
"I do not know whether this policy has to be strictly one of free trade or increasing exchanges with them, but one which at least helps them to form a differentiated entity."
"Because what characterises Latin America at the moment is that it is a region which is very different from the other regions of the planet."
"In this regard, the Commission's failure to adopt a specific financial regulation for Latin America seems to me to be an enormous error."
"I believe that the important thing from now on, rather than offering formulae or recommendations, is to listen to these Latin American countries and to work together to help them to develop and, perhaps, if that continent continues to develop, we may find in Latin America the necessary counterbalance which we are currently lacking in other parts of the world."
"Mr President, these reports deserve praise for confirming the position of the European Parliament on the important issue of cooperation and solidarity, but they also demonstrate the shortcoming of being simply answers to a consultation, without having the status of a parliamentary ‘opinion’."
"Despite this limitation, they very clearly express Parliament’s position on the need for the agreements to go beyond what is known as ‘political dialogue and cooperation’ and become genuine association agreements."
"As a matter of fact, these two reports and four opinions received only three votes against, with the opinions of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy preventing unanimity."
"Whilst we all know of Parliament’s unhappiness with simply creating the political conditions necessary and imposing a model and whilst it is a matter of regret that the Commission proposals do nothing more than pave the way for future negotiations, Parliament uses these reports to suggest that the agreements on which it has been consulted should constitute a stage of transition and of preparation."
"We feel that what is at stake is the concept of cooperation and we would, therefore, like to go further, as advocated in the opinions of the Committee on Development and Cooperation."
"It is indeed regrettable that these agreements are geared towards preparing a political framework that makes matters dependent on free trade agreements and that there is no understanding of these agreements as being part of an integrated strategy for economic and social development to combat poverty."
"Through these agreements – to use an expression favoured by Commissioner Lamy at the 7th Joint ACP-EU Parliamentary Assembly – it would allow clauses excluded from the WTO Cancun meeting to come in through the back door."
"The ACP countries are attempting to prevent this in the economic partnership agreements and, amongst other issues, to prevent various forms of liberalisation being imposed in areas for which they are attempting to find solutions that are best suited to their national situations, specific characteristics and processes."
"In particular, we are talking here about public services, the fields of health, education and water supply – particularly the latter, because this is crucial to many of these countries."
"It is significant that, amongst the various approaches, as these agreements illustrate, they are looking to achieve the same thing, which is to foist a single-society economic model on a market which is free but not fair."
"At the moment, the aforementioned cooperation does not cover economic and social development strategies to combat poverty, and everything is dependent on a market- and profit-driven ideology, thus widening the already shocking social disparities."
"Mr President, in supporting the political dialogue with the Andean Community, let us recall that only a month ago Colombian President Uribe was in this Chamber championing his so-called democratic security policy."
"However, this is a policy that is not democratic, with violent intimidation leading to the withdrawal of candidates in 100 municipalities at last October's elections."
"It cannot bring the much-needed security that the Colombian people deserve."
"Uribe's policies for mass arbitrary arrest have shot prison numbers up by more than 10 000 in the last year."
"The countryside is flooded with military personnel, and orders have gone out to kill people in groups of four or less in a sickening attempt to reduce the number of recorded massacres without any real diminution in the grisly death toll afflicting the country."
"Indeed, evidence from the Colombian Commission of Jurists, backed up by the University of Bogota, shows that there has been no reduction in deaths at all."
"Of course, we also condemn the murderous and brutal activities of the guerrillas, but two-thirds of the human rights abuses are perpetrated by the Colombian military or their paramilitary allies, which Uribe is now cynically seeking to legalise."
"That is why we should use the political dialogue to maintain Europe's opposition to the military solution represented by Plan Colombia, to condemn human rights abuses on all sides in the Colombian tragedy, to insist that Colombia abide by all the commitments made in the London Declaration of 2003 and to act as advocates for grassroots projects, such as the EU-funded peace laboratories, which truly point the way to a just and lasting peace for Colombia."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I will join with those who have expressed their congratulations and thanks in this House."
"Allow me, though, also – on the subject of the Association Agreements that we are discussing today – to point out a more general desire voiced by the European Parliament to achieve stronger, more voluntarist and more incisive agreements between the different stakeholders of the European Union and the Andean Community or the countries of Central America."
"These agreements stress and emphasise the institutionalisation of political dialogue and the improvement of governance."
"Can we talk about governance without linking it to the issue of the global development strategy, designed, for example, to combat poverty?"
"Can we talk about improving governance without talking about, and touching upon, the issue of economic and social integration?"
"These are elements that are, I believe, missing from our approach."
"It is imperative that three points are raised."
"The first is the question of the role of dialogue between the different parliament members and with the national parliaments."
"Today, the members of parliament from the different countries represented are pointing out their weak position and their marginalisation in the current type of political system."
"This was mentioned in the report on our meeting in Puebla at the beginning of the month. As was done in our final memorandum, it is up to us to once again give them the role to which they are entitled and to also grant a role to the different actors representative of civil society, whether they be unions, companies or organised civil society."
"The second point concerns the issue of regional integration, which is fundamental."
"Can we, however, be happy with free trade agreements whilst ignoring the social aspects, especially the issues concerning fundamental rights; in other words, without talking about the actual situation when it comes to the populations’ well-being?"
"Of course, we are faced with countries where poverty is extreme. That is what we are all saying."
"We should, however, have the political courage to know exactly what we are talking about when we talk about poverty."
"The poverty of the populations is extreme, but it is on the issue of unfair distribution of wealth that we must speak out and help our parliamentary colleagues to act …"
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at noon."
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"- Recommendation for second reading (A5-0131/2004) by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the common position of the Council with a view to adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the hygiene of foodstuffs (rapporteur: Horst Schnellhardt);"
"- Recommendation for second reading (A5-0129/2004) by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the common position of the Council with a view to adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (rapporteur: Horst Schnellhardt);"
"- Recommendation for second reading (A5-0130/2004) by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the common position of the Council with a view to adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council repealing certain directives concerning food hygiene and health conditions for the production and placing on the market of certain products of animal origin intended for human consumption and amending Council Directives 89/662/EEC and 92/118/EEC and Council Decision 95/408/EC (rapporteur: Horst Schnellhardt);"
"- Recommendation for second reading (A5-0138/2004) by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the common position of the Council with a view to adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption (rapporteur: Horst Schnellhardt)."
". – Mr President, Commission representatives, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by personally thanking the representatives of the Commission and Council for their excellent cooperation over the last two years."
"I had the opportunity to work on these dossiers with both the Italian and the Irish Presidencies, to which I am grateful for an outstanding and comradely piece of cooperation."
"What is it all about?"
"The four regulations we have before us are an important part of the measures to improve food safety in the European Union."
"They were drawn up with the aim of replacing 17 directives and making the law more coherent and more science- and risk-based."
"Do the texts produced by the Commission, Council and Parliament meet those requirements?"
"I believe they do."
"I believe we have created an excellent legal base."
"The effects may be described as follows:"
"Firstly, there is greater legal certainty."
"The proposals build on tried and tested practices with additional measures for greater food safety, but the crucial thing is that they are a new legislative concept."
"The choice of a regulation, which means that the same text applies everywhere in the European Union, was a decisive step for greater coherency and less bureaucracy."
"That the Commission, Council and Parliament have agreed to expand the mandatory parts of all requirements is very much to be welcomed."
"This will enable firms involved to act with greater legal certainty."
"When requirements are constantly changing, that is of immense importance."
"Parliament’s efforts to limit the scope for amending the annexes in the comitology procedure must also be seen as part of this approach for stability and legal certainty."
"We have found a more or less acceptable arrangement."
"I can, however, also assure you that we shall be watching the use of comitology for amending the annexes very critically."
"Legal certainty must be the main concern."
"We do of course need flexibility as well to be able to respond to new dangers and new situations."
"I believe we have that, too."
"The second principle behind the new food safety rules is in the interests of all concerned."
"The introduction of the ‘from farm to table’ principle, self-inspection by businesses with the use of the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) principle and of guides, and the greater attention paid to scientific findings are the essence of the new approach."
"Everyone concerned is brought into the system."
"However, the new system also takes account of the type of production process and the guarantees offered by the food business operator."
"That is why the new approach is also marked by greater flexibility."
"The fact that exemptions and variations are possible is not inconsistent with the aim of improving food safety."
"They are, however, only permitted for traditional production methods in difficult remote areas, that is, in places where remoteness of location or the mountainous nature of the region brings its own problems, and of course where local markets are supplied."
"The great variety of means of production in the European Union can be taken into account."
"I believe that making this dependent on the competent authority’s risk assessment was a wise approach."
"I will mention only in passing that the Council and Commission have slightly watered down the ‘from farm to table’ principle in as much as the HACCP procedure will not be mandatory in primary production."
"I believe we have managed to find a wise solution here, too, in leaving the arrangements to the Member States."
"In accordance with this ‘low requirements for low risk’ approach, however, we should give small businesses the assurance that evidence of the results of the HACCP principle can be provided in a form acceptable to the firm."
"I am referring here to recital 15 of Common Position No 1 on the food hygiene regulation, according to which good hygienic practices can replace monitoring of critical control points."
"I consider this arrangement especially suitable for artisanal small businesses."
"The official veterinarian is central to the proposed system of official supervision of meat production."
"He performs audits and inspections so that the requirements of the relevant provisions can be observed by all concerned."
"The official veterinarian must have the statutory means to enforce the requirements."
"This also means that the legal texts must lay down clear criteria for his decisions."
"That is why it is important that Parliament has included the basic tasks of official controls in Article 3."
"The veterinarian and official specialised assistants must also show evidence of a high level of expertise."
"I believe this is right."
"In some Member States, however – and that is already evident – this will require a change to veterinary training."
"The authorities in the Member States should also act quickly to ensure that enough personnel are available to be able to comply with the wide-ranging regulations."
"So far as I am aware, only a few countries currently have the staff to perform such tasks as the rule we have adopted about the conditional approval of establishments."
"Let me make this clear: with their current staffing levels the authorities will not be able to check three times in six months that an establishment meets the approval requirements."
"Another thing required of the competent authority is the integration of controls."
"It is no longer enough to concentrate on the enforcement of statutory provisions."
"The involvement of businesses in food safety matters also requires greater flexibility on the competent authority’s part."
"The business operator should see himself as a partner and be seen as one."
"That cannot be legislated for by statute, but the foundations for greater food safety through cooperation have been laid."
"One point was a matter of dispute for a long time: the involvement of slaughterhouse staff in official controls."
"I am aware – and I am speaking here as a parliamentary rapporteur – that the compromise that has been reached may not meet with this House’s approval."
"There are a number of reasons for this."
"Some say, for example, that this rule will not help us in what we have always been trying to do, that is, to improve food safety indeed, that it will have quite the opposite effect."
"The regulation on official controls of feed and foodstuffs requires those carrying out official controls to act independently."
"The establishment’s staff are dependent on the head of the establishment."
"Staff training restricts the veterinarian and therefore hampers his ability to make controls."
"There remains the question of costs."
"Does the operator really save inspection costs?"
"I do not believe so."
"All the calculations show the opposite."
"I think, gentlemen of the Council, that we should agree here to come back to this and try to clarify it in perhaps two or three years’ time."
"Since this regulation brings much that is new to the Member States and will require a lot of adjustment by all concerned, we should first apply it for two or three years and then concentrate on this question again."
"I think we should use the existing outcome and adopt these regulations in this legislative period without further discussion."
"They are an important foundation for food safety."
"As the Commissioner has now arrived, I would like to repeat what I said at the beginning: my sincere thanks to you and your colleagues for your extraordinarily close cooperation in working on the texts of these regulations."
"I think it is a good piece of work and we will come much closer to our objective of improving food safety in Europe."
". Mr President, may I first express my thanks for all the hard work done by members of the committees concerned with the proposals on food hygiene."
"Almost four years have gone by since the Commission presented this package."
"I would therefore like to remind you of the objectives that were envisaged when we put forward this recast of the hygiene rules."
"In summary, we are pursuing four objectives."
"The first objective is to adapt hygiene legislation to the general principles of food law set out in the White Paper on food safety."
"The second objective is to make the existing rules more science- and risk-based."
"The third objective is to define the role of the competent authorities; and the fourth objective is to consolidate and simplify the regulatory environment."
"The discussions on the package have taken a long time, both in Council and in Parliament."
"This is not surprising, taking into account the wide interests covered by the proposals and their highly technical nature."
"This long period gave ample time to reflect on the proposals and the time is now ripe to conclude the debate and adopt the legislation."
"The Council's common position is, in the Commission's view, a fair compromise that clearly reflects the views of Parliament."
"I was pleased to hear that the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs have recognised this fact."
"Nevertheless, a number of amendments were tabled for the second reading."
"With a view to addressing the points set out in these amendments, the Commission has contributed to the establishment of a compromise between the Council's position and that of Parliament."
"Discussions on such a compromise were successfully completed and Coreper has already endorsed it."
"Amendments reflecting this compromise package have also been tabled for the vote later today."
"I am concerned, however, lest there be a desire to cherry-pick the compromise negotiated with the Council."
"A compromise requires that all parties make concessions."
"This relates in particular to the involvement of slaughterhouse staff in meat inspection for veal and pigs."
"The common position, approved unanimously by the Council, foresees the possibility of slaughterhouse staff carrying out some inspection tasks."
"The Commission believes this is appropriate."
"It is not, as some say, a privatisation of meat inspection."
"It only allows the slaughterhouse staff to assist the official veterinarian."
"There is no general authorisation for involving slaughterhouse staff in meat inspection."
"Subsidiarity is the guiding principle here."
"The decision as to whether to apply the system will be taken by the Member States on a case-by-case basis."
"Moreover, the proposed regulation contains a number of very strict rules that guarantee the independence of the controls."
"These include in particular that the slaughterhouse staff involved in meat inspection must be independent from production staff and must report directly to the official veterinarian."
"Slaughterhouses that wish to involve their staff in meat inspection must be specifically authorised for that purpose by the competent authority."
"I would like to stress that the system has already functioned satisfactorily for more than ten years for poultry meat and rabbit meat in most Member States."
"No complaints have been registered and no misuse has been reported on this."
"Taking account of these elements, the proposal to extend the system to veal and fattening pigs is proportionate and fully in line with the objectives of the proposed legislation I outlined to you a couple of minutes ago."
"The Commission is willing to go along with the compromise proposal put forward by the Council that would defer the entry into force of the system for another three years."
"This is reflected in Amendment No 21 to the proposal on official controls."
"The Commission cannot, however, support Amendments Nos 9 and 14, which the rapporteur is recommending that Parliament support."
"Should these amendments be adopted, conciliation would appear inevitable."
"This would be a pity, particularly having regard to the length of time – since July 2000 – that these proposals have been under consideration."
"To conclude, I would like to reiterate my gratitude to all those who have contributed to reaching this stage."
"The Commission can accept all amendments to the common position that are part of the compromise package negotiated with the Council."
"The Commission cannot support amendments falling outside this package."
"A full listing setting out the details on this will be made available to Parliament's secretariat(1)."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Schnellhardt, who has negotiated tenaciously for many years."
"I believe that with the results before us today we have taken a step towards greater food safety in Europe."
"It is also important, when food comes over the border, that we should be able to tell the citizens they can rely on that food being safe and that there are no health risks."
"We have, however, also managed – at any rate better than in the Commission’s original proposal – to make the proposals practicable."
"I would like to draw attention to one particular point in the first Schnellhardt report on general food hygiene."
"The HACCP plan is a very good plan for large businesses."
"Large businesses that employ a large number of people, possibly in several Member States, have to keep accurate records of who has handled a product when."
"From the outset, I found it difficult to transfer this concept to very small businesses, because if a restaurant or confectioner’s employs only two or three people, we do not need any written documentation to know who has handled the product and where harm may have occurred."
"In such cases, verbal information is enough and that is why, in the negotiations, we pressed very hard for the documentation requirement for small businesses to be toned down in line with the risk associated with this type of production."
"We do not think documentation is necessary at all for very small businesses."
"It would be practicable then."
"It would not be detrimental to consumer protection, but we would ensure that small businesses in particular are able to apply the rules appropriately."
"The outcome is not exactly what we would have wanted."
"We have, however, reached compromises on many points, especially in the first report, and we are therefore able to back the reports with a clear conscience."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is customary at the beginning of our speeches for us to express gracious sentiments about the good working relationship with the rapporteur."
"Much as I, of course, appreciate Mr Schnellhardt’s work and efforts, I am, to be honest, somewhat disappointed with the way in which he has gone about things."
"It is not very upright to negotiate with the Council on your own initiative and to take only your own amendments into consideration."
"Personally, I think that it does not reflect well on Parliament to agree on a compromise with the Council and at the same time to want to adopt the original amendments."
"That is not a credible working method."
"Today, I should like to take a brief look at five years of food safety and on nearly three years of food hygiene."
"When it comes to general food legislation, we have jointly decided that food producers shoulder the main responsibility for the safety of their products and that the way in which they do this should be monitored by the government."
"We are now on the verge of turning back the clock."
"I do not agree with this, but this is where I am not speaking on behalf of my group."
"How did we get into this situation?"
"I think that first of all, we should search our own hearts."
"The food hygiene dossier is complex and contains hundreds of amendments about all kinds of details."
"As a result of this, only a few spokesmen are involved in this dossier and it is very easy for outsiders to spread misinformation."
"What is it all about?"
"What is crucial is who monitors the food producers."
"In the light of general food legislation, this question seems straightforward to answer."
"The producers ensure that their products are up to scratch and the government monitors the final inspection."
"The Commission, in agreement with the guiding principle that was established for meat producers, particularly pork and veal companies, under the watchful eye of the government, wants to offer the opportunity of accepting their responsibility and of carrying out the monitoring activities themselves."
"Part of the meat sector also wants to carry this responsibility and call an end to cases of abuse."
"There is much opposition to the idea that butchers should inspect their own meat, and rightly so, for the government should have a monitoring role and has a clear task in the inspection."
"However, giving butchers more responsibility is a positive step."
"A majority of our group has rejected the idea of the meat sector taking on the responsibility itself."
"According to them, the staff at meat companies are not capable of monitoring quality, or in a position, to do so."
"I have a different opinion personally."
"I think we should move away from authoritarian companies who do not tolerate any criticism from their staff with regard to the quality of their products."
"I do not think that Parliament should regard the workers in the meat sector as frightened and uninformed people incapable of forming their own opinions."
"As long as the government has its monitoring role, companies can carry the responsibility themselves."
"I therefore urge everyone to support the compromise that we have reached with the Council and to prevent us from adopting the amendments by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, for that is not the right way to go about things."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are now close to the end of almost five years of work on trying to obtain safer food in Europe."
"Mr Schnellhardt’s recommendations constitute a very important part of these efforts because they affect the issue of how matters should in practice look in restaurants, shops, abattoirs and cutting plants, irrespective of whether they are large or small."
"On behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I am not without certain views to the effect that the matter has taken an eternity."
"It has been tough."
"Mr Schnellhardt and I have, of course, had different views on certain technical issues when it comes to both his and my reports, which have a lot in common with each other in certain areas."
"Nonetheless, I have to say that, in the last analysis, Mr Schnellhardt has done a very constructive and skilful job."
"There is no doubt about that."
"I wish to thank him for his cooperation."
"We shall support the compromise, if not wholeheartedly."
"There are a couple of small aspects about which I am extremely concerned, for example when it comes to the definition of cutting plants."
"The definition does not expressly state that the rules in actual fact apply to all establishments that cut and otherwise deal with raw meat."
"I regret that, because we know how dangerous such plants are for, even if feed producers, farmers, hauliers and abattoirs behave perfectly correctly, hygiene can still be completely ruined at the very last stage."
"A compromise depends, however, upon both give and take by the parties concerned."
"The ELDR Group, to which I belong, will not get exactly what it wants, otherwise, we should of course be in a dictatorship rather than in a democratic assembly."
"I am concerned about the cutting plants."
"I hope that the European meat industry will go to court if the definition is not interpreted as best it can be."
"Otherwise, we support these recommendations and are very pleased that we have reached this agreement."
"I should like to state that those of us who have worked on it have, in general, done some skilful and persistent work to make food safer."
"I should also like to mention Mrs Corbey and Mr Whitehead."
"It is perhaps we who have been most industrious in these matters."
"Thank you for your cooperation."
"Mr President, this hygiene package consists of a number of elements, all of which are very important: a proposal on general food hygiene, a proposal on food and animal origin and a proposal on official controls mainly concerning slaughterhouses."
"The Council's common position has taken on board the majority of Parliament's amendments from first reading, but there remain differences mainly concerning the following points."
"How far can hazard analysis and critical control points – HACCP – be implemented in primary production on farms?"
"What flexibility is going to be granted to Member States?"
"Will it be a general clause for comitology, or a more specific rule which allows comitology only within a set of fixed aims, as it would appear the rapporteur prefers?"
"Will we see the self-control of the meat industry by employees working as meat inspectors?"
"Would the flexibility foreseen for small artisanal slaughterhouses be defined by marketing only regionally as a result of requiring the presence of official veterinarians during every slaughter process?"
"The key issues for my Group at the first reading were basically the direct marketing of food on the farm or at local retailers and flexibility for the processing of traditional products."
"These are mainly covered by the Council's common position which we very much welcome, because we feel it is important that there be some flexibility for the processing of traditional products and also in relation to artisanal production."
"The problem for my Group with the compromise package now proposed by the Council is where the latter insists on extending controls by slaughterhouse employees to include pigs and calves."
"My Group – and as far as I know the rapporteur – strongly objects to this self-control."
"It would allow self-policing and it could end up with a blind eye being turned in certain circumstances, depending on how productive some of the slaughterhouses are: so this is not a good idea."
"It is not in the interests of what we are trying to achieve."
"We do not want this point accepted."
"That is the key issue for us as regards this report."
"We are pleased that the issues of artisanal and local production of traditional products have been taken into account in the common position."
"– Commissioner Byrne, today Parliament is going to vote on a very important package, the one on hygiene, and I must say that the initiative started by the Commission White Paper on food safety to recast all food legislation has been one of the topics that have made this parliamentary term stand out, with its basic aim of assuring consumer health and safety, at least from a legislative point of view."
"This is an absolute priority, given the ‘poor hygiene’ episodes that have occurred in recent years and also in view of the backlash that many primary sector activities have suffered as a result."
"If we look at the compromise position proposed by the Commission, the Council’s response and Parliament’s own position, it is clear that, as with all compromise and mediation positions, everyone would always like something extra."
"I believe, however, that this is a very sensible compromise position because it is a compromise between the demands of producers and those of consumers, between good business and safeguarding the basic right of citizens to safe, healthy food and produce."
"There are three considerations I should like to make."
"We should have preferred it, of course, if the regulation on the hygiene of foodstuffs provided for a perhaps more forceful implementation of the HACCP system and probably referred more closely to the ."
"We should probably also have liked greater insistence on the ‘from farm to table’ principle, a principle that is very attractive to consumers but which needs to be made much clearer and involves additional costs to the farming sector."
"Lastly, we should have liked to underline more strongly the fact that we consider it essential that regulations approved in the Community should be equally valid in all the Member States; it would therefore be appropriate to restrict the possibility of approving changes and to authorise them only to give greater protection to an individual country’s traditional products, without ever relaxing food standards and safety."
"One final word on Amendments Nos 9 and 14, Commissioner: they are dear to us; they put us in the forefront, so to speak, as Parliament."
"Mr President, first, we should all congratulate Mr Schnellhardt on his work on these reports."
"It has been something of a marathon and a lot of hard work, but he has done a very good job."
"We now have a package of measures that is going to ensure the health and safety of the European public and the quality and safety of the European meat supply for the foreseeable future."
"These measures, when put in place, are ones in which we can have confidence."
"Some of the issues have been more difficult than others."
"We all recognise that the system should not be overburdened with too much bureaucracy, and we have acknowledged the need – certainly in some sectors – for self-inspection or inspection with a light touch."
"In the areas of poultry and rabbit production, there is clearly a demonstrable need for that and there is no serious problem of public health."
"However, there is a need for an independent inspectorate to keep a close eye on certain sectors, such as the work in abattoirs and slaughterhouses across Europe, where there is a lot of time pressure and pressure to perform and where there is evidence to suggest a potential public health risk – most notably in the red-meat sector."
"Whilst I do not know anyone who eats raw rabbit or raw poultry, I know many people – some are Members of the European Parliament – who eat red meat that is either raw or close to raw."
"Consequently, there is a greater and more serious health risk in that sector than in meats that are cooked before being consumed by the public."
"For that reason, I consider the compromise arrived at by the Council – regarding the possible extension of self-inspection to areas such as pork and veal – to be a dangerous one."
"I feel it is one that we should not be stepping into at this moment: it crosses the species barrier and it opens up the possibility of self-inspection in the red-meat sector in the future."
"I cannot support that."
"All of us realise the importance of these public health measures: we need only recall the terrible food poisoning incident that took place in Scotland owing to the contamination of red meat only a few years ago."
"We have got to protect public health."
"Mr President, I would like to echo the words of thanks that have been expressed not only to the rapporteurs, but also to the shadow rapporteurs."
"Today, we are presented with a good opportunity of completing the whole food legislation package, namely the assessment of safety right down to the last step."
"What we are discussing today makes possible the repeal of a huge number of directives."
"We will be able to tie up all the loose ends with regard to the issue of the verifiability of food production, the integral chain approach, or in other words the stable-to-table approach."
"There are quite a few snags in the compromise package that the Council and the Commission have tabled and which was rubberstamped by Parliament."
"However, everything is at risk of falling somewhat into disarray at the last minute because there seem to be a few misunderstandings."
"I am also addressing Mr Bowe when saying this."
"What is it about?"
"It is about defending the compromise that the Council has tabled. What is at issue is that it should be possible for companies where food is produced to take on some additional responsibility, that a thorough check is carried out into what is wrong with the meat and that we subsequently, under the final responsibility of the official veterinary and the government that has appointed the veterinary, state whether we think the meat is up to scratch or not."
"In the Netherlands, this system has been functioning to everyone's satisfaction for some years now."
"Mr Bowe stated a moment ago that a few years ago, there was a problem in Scotland involving red meat, but I should like to point out that a different system is used over there."
"What we have to do is to ensure that the responsibility is laid on those shoulders that can unreservedly carry it."
"That means that the system needs flexibility and that red tape should be reduced to a minimum, but that, however, guarantees must be in place such that the consumer can count on being given food that is safe."
"I would therefore urge the House to support the Council's compromise."
"Mr President, I would like to concentrate on the threat posed by the Commission's proposals in terms of the privatisation of the independent meat inspectorate in the United Kingdom."
"This issue has been raised, not only by the Consumers' Association, but also by the UK trade union Unison, which represents meat inspectors."
"The feeling is that the Commission's proposal would allow privatisation through the back door by placing the responsibility for hygiene in abattoirs on the meat plants themselves."
"Therefore the independence of meat inspectors would be compromised, as those paying their wages would then be the companies they are in charge of inspecting."
"Consumer protection should be our Number One priority and no consumer should be put at risk of consuming unsafe meat."
"Just last week we saw the issue of chicken on sale which, according to the Consumers' Association, had incorrect sell-by dates on the packets."
"On top of this we have the backdrop of BSE, the tragedy of foot-and-mouth, and E.coli scares."
"In fact, the situation that happened many years ago to which Mr Bowe referred involved the butchers my family used in Wishaw in Scotland."
"There has never been such a need to reassure consumers that the meat they are consuming is safe to eat."
"It is in the interest of the consumer, but it should also be in the interest of the industry."
"When visiting a meat plant some months ago I was reassured that the quality of meat was of the highest standard and that the meat inspectors played an important role in securing quality and safety."
"We should not put at risk the independence of the meat inspectorate. There are 1200 independent meat inspectors in the United Kingdom and I hope they will be able to continue the work that reassures us as consumers that the meat we eat is safe."
"Mr President, this is part of the health package put together with the food law legislation, and I salute Mr Schnellhardt for what he has done over many years in this regard."
"I support him in his urge that we should limit the degree to which the annexes here can be altered by comitology."
"The devil is in the details."
"We do not want the disease to be in the details as well."
"We have cause for concern in all circumstances where food of animal origin is being packaged and identified."
"The Commissioner knows from my own correspondence with him of the difficulties we have had in the East Midlands with the Denby scandal and others where meat was wrongly identified and sold when it should not have been."
"The extension of inspection by ancillary staff in the case of red meat causes us special concern."
"We do not want to see this extended to fattening pigs and calves."
"The Commissioner said that this is perfectly safe and it has worked very well with white meat."
"I am not so sure it has, and if he sees the Consumers' Association survey of the conditions in which chicken is being packaged and sold, he will see that there is room for doubt and concern even here."
"It is not a reflection on the hard work and dedication of the staff who are employed in slaughterhouses."
"It is only to establish that they are not put under intolerable pressure and that every possible safety means is employed."
"I personally salute Unison, the trade union, for campaigning on this issue."
"On this and this alone I believe that we have reason to go beyond the common position for safety's sake."
"I thank all colleagues who have contributed to this very pleasant debate."
"Obviously Parliament and the Commission are making a lot of progress."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will be at noon."
"Consumers are entitled to demand that the food they buy and eat is as safe as it can be, and I fully support that principle but, in our anxiety to put in place regulations which will work, giving consumers the guarantees they require, we should not throw out existing measures which are already proving effective."
"I find it unbelievable that the present independent meat inspection system in the UK could be bettered by adopting the same style of controls currently operating in the poultry sector."
"To anyone who has visited a modern poultry processor, it will be obvious that the process is entirely different from that which applies in an abattoir."
"Of course I accept that controls are put in place from farm to plate, but surely it makes sense to retain those parts of the chain which are successful, and to add in controls in areas where improvement is seen to be required."
"For that reason I will be opposing the parts of this package which would dismantle or privatise the independent meat inspection service."
"The next item is the report (A5-0197/2004) by Albert Jan Maat, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the protection of animals during transport and related operations and amending Directives 64/432/EEC and 93/119/EEC."
". Mr President, may I first express my thanks for all the hard work that has been done by members of the committees in respect of the Commission's proposal for a regulation on the protection of animals during transport."
"Let me acknowledge, in particular, the efforts made by Mr Maat on this important initiative."
"Animal welfare is an emotive subject."
"This is reflected by the wide participation in the debate and in part by the large number of amendments tabled."
"The Commission proposal aims to achieve significant improvement in the welfare of transported animals."
"It focuses in particular on long journeys, as it is these journeys that are most likely to cause problems."
"It seeks to introduce clearer and upgraded standards, as well as stronger enforcement rules."
"This proposal has been the result of extensive analysis, scientific advice and stakeholder consultation."
"I am sure it does not fulfil the wishes of the ardent proponents of both sides of the animal welfare debate, but I am quite sure that if introduced now it would implement major improvements in the transport conditions of animals that have been the dream of animal welfare enthusiasts for years."
"I make really sure that any amendment which either seeks unduly to liberalise transport conditions or restrict them is doomed to failure."
"I have indicated that I am willing to participate in constructive dialogue with a view to reaching a speedy agreement and an early improvement of transport conditions."
"One of the major political aspects of the dossier concerns travelling times."
"The Commission proposes to replace the current rules by a simple scheme for all species involving a nine-hour maximum travelling time, to be followed by a minimum of twelve hours' rest if the journey is to be continued."
"It is no accident that these times coincide with the travel and rest rules applicable to drivers."
"Hence, enforcement should be much more straightforward – a crucially important aspect of this legislation as far as I am concerned."
"I am prepared to consider variations on the theme proposed by the Commission in order to reach a durable compromise."
"However, let me be very frank: I cannot accept amendments which have as their practical effect a ban on the transport of live animals whether for slaughter, further rearing or breeding purposes."
"I believe such a move would be illegal and of the Treaty."
"It would be liable to be struck down by the Court."
"In all events, there is no chance of such an initiative being supported in the Council."
"That is why I have been suggesting the adoption of an intelligent and sophisticated approach to the improvement of animal welfare."
"Putting it bluntly, tilting at windmills will be poor consolation if the greatest opportunity in a decade to improve welfare arrangements is not to be grasped."
". Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for his initial contribution."
"However, before I add my own comment to the new animal transport directive, I should like to dwell briefly on an event in my own country, namely the departure of our Queen Mother, Princess Juliana."
"During her reign, she always showed a special interest in the agricultural sector and cattle farming in my country."
"To her, each and every human being and animal mattered."
"I would like to commemorate her today at the start of this debate and commiserate with her family and with all those who will miss her."
"The review of Directives 64/432/EEC and 93/119/EC on the transport of animals has been rather a long time coming."
"I appreciate Commissioner Byrne's contribution, because after our debate on the resolution of 2001, he took up the gauntlet after all."
"In addition to animal welfare, it was mainly the FMD crisis and the outbreaks of swine fever that were reasons for me as rapporteur to subject legislation to a thorough overhaul."
"I have to say, though, that the Commission's proposal does not offer a real choice."
"Given the proposed time limits of nine hours in transit and twelve hours rest, with unlimited repeats of this cycle, and the very generous expansion of space allowance per animal, one can confidently conclude that transport in excess of nine hours would become unaffordable."
"As rapporteur, however, I distance myself somewhat from that approach, because it does not do any justice to the already difficult income situation in cattle farming and because the limitation of the risks of animal diseases and the regularisation of the slaughter practice are insufficiently addressed."
"Moreover, too much space per animal leads to an unnecessary risk of injury during transport, so let me now set out the line I have decided to take."
"First of all, transport up to 100 kilometres should be kept outside of the scope of the directive, to avoid the so-called farmers' transport for slaughter and productive cattle from becoming unnecessarily expensive."
"Moreover, this transport mainly involves regional cattle farm systems and during these transports, there are hardly ever, if any, problems involving animal welfare."
"Secondly, space allowance requirements for cattle for slaughter should not be considerably altered."
"The restriction in the transport of cattle for slaughter to nine hours or 500 kilometres, the time and distance covered by 97% of cattle transported for slaughter, already applies."
"Transitional provisions should be put in place, though, for regions that have few slaughterhouses or special market problems."
"In addition, I should like to argue in favour of specifically promoting the establishment of slaughterhouses in regions where animals are kept."
"Why, when milk and sugar are generally processed in the regions where they are produced, would this not be possible in the case of animals for slaughter?"
"Thirdly, with regard to productive cattle and traditional systems for fattening animals, I suggest a transport limit of 30 hours, including eight hours rest, but no unloading at staging places."
"I would also argue in favour of a separate regulation for cattle for breeding and racehorses, with a strict rest and feed regime."
"In general, however, the transport conditions for this group are already excellent."
"Fourthly, I am in favour of more, and also more specific, controls of international transport."
"This point, in particular, is the Achilles' heel of current EU practice."
"Fifthly, I would like to see rest periods and driving times in existing EU directives for the transport sector coupled to fresh legislation."
"Furthermore, the GPS system should be introduced for international transport, so that unnecessary bureaucracy is prevented and controls can be carried out much more effectively."
"The fact that especially this latter point is no unnecessary luxury has, , been demonstrated in unannounced road checks in Austria, where no less than 50% of the animal hauliers appeared to break the law."
"It also raises questions when no fewer than 221 000 live cattle are exported to Lebanon every year, which translates into an entire cow for every two families in Lebanon on an annual basis!"
"As far as I am concerned, there is every reason to adapt legislation, particularly with regard to the transport of animals for slaughter."
"I would therefore urge my fellow MEPs to support Amendments Nos 1 to 97 inclusive, Amendments Nos 109, 110, 111, 112 and 115."
"This strikes the best balance between animal welfare and what cattle farmers would find economically acceptable."
"If the Council adopts this proposal, cattle farming in Europe will not be squeezed out of the market and animal welfare will enjoy a structural improvement."
"I would ask the Commission and Council to adopt a preliminary position at this stage."
"Finally, I should like to thank the different groups for the excellent cooperation during the preparation and discussion of this report."
"."
"Mr President, the Environment Committee's opinion on this issue was very positive: it was clear that the committee wanted to stand by the position taken by many Members of this Parliament – over 400 Members signed a resolution calling for 8 hours as a maximum overall journey time."
"In relation to the Commission's proposal, many of the amendments tabled by the Environment Committee were not taken on board in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, but I hope the amendments that have been tabled will be supported when the vote takes place."
"The rest period on the vehicles, for example, is completely impractical."
"A rest period on a vehicle cannot be considered as a rest period for a number of reasons."
"Firstly, conditions do not change at all for the animals."
"It would be very difficult to water and feed those animals unless the vehicle is equipped to make that possible."
"If that were the case, it would be economically unviable for transporters to have such a vehicle."
"It is going to be very difficult to look after the animals if the rest period is on the vehicle."
"How are dead animals going to be removed from the vehicle?"
"There was a recent case in Ireland in relation to Pandora, which said it did not want to transport live animals any more, presumably for economic reasons."
"They can see it coming in the future."
"Also, in relation to the continued cycle, the idea of a period of rest on a journey that can continue indefinitely is completely unacceptable."
"Even the industry does not agree with the rest period on the vehicle."
"This is one of the key issues that have to be addressed in Parliament this week."
"In relation to fraud in export refunds – an issue that came up during last night's sitting and in the media recently – one of the ways to avoid that would be to get rid of export refunds."
"The vast majority of European citizens do not want their money used to subsidise the inhumane transport of animals, which causes untold and unnecessary suffering."
"I agree with Mr Maat about the provision of local abattoirs."
"In some places in Germany, mobile abattoirs are provided to slaughter animals if no abattoir is available locally."
"We must ensure that animals are not subjected to unnecessary suffering, and this is clearly unnecessary."
"The Environment Committee is strongly of that opinion."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to thank Mr Maat for bringing forward a very practical report on animal transport, because it is absolutely sure that we all want to see animal transport tightened up."
"It is a very emotive issue, nowhere more so than in the UK."
"I would also like to thank him straight away for co-sponsoring my amendments to ask the Commission and the UK Government to look for an opt-out, especially on the transport of live horses to the continent for slaughter."
"This is something that has not happened in the UK for over 70 years, and we want to make sure it does not start to happen again."
"I thank Mr Maat very much for that."
"One of the good things about Mr Maat's report is that he has differentiated between animals going for slaughter and those going for further fattening."
"There is no justification for taking animals on huge journeys for slaughter – whenever possible they must be slaughtered in the country where they are reared."
"We have also heard that at the moment about EUR 52 million is still being paid out on export subsidies."
"A lot of these cattle are going to Lebanon, and their journeys do not end there: they continue for a great many hours after that."
"We have to make sure we put an end to that."
"As we put this legislation in place, one of the keys to this whole process is proper enforcement: to ensure that we have the right type of lorries and the proper rest periods."
"We must also ensure that if these international transporters do not meet the requirements, they have their licences taken away."
"This would send a very clear message to the industry that you cannot abuse the system."
"What we are trying to do is good, and we need to get the right type of transport in place."
"I disagree with the Commission proposal on the idea of a 12-hour rest on a lorry, especially if it concerns sheep."
"This is not practical and we must have an overall end to the journey."
"That is what Mr Maat is proposing in this report."
"I very much recommend the report to the House."
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank my esteemed fellow MEP, Mr Maat for his outstanding work on the report and also for the very constructive cooperation we have enjoyed."
"Only because of the rapporteur’s persistence and huge efforts have we got so far as to have the report on the agenda for this part-session."
"Animals will benefit from the fact, and it should be to the delight of the many Europeans who are concerned about animal welfare."
"On behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I have tabled an amendment that limits the journey time for animals for slaughter to eight hours."
"There was no majority for this in the committee, but hopefully there will be a majority for it during the vote."
"I am genuinely pleased that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development adopted my amendment concerning differentiated places in the case of journey times of less than four hours, for this will contribute to still more journeys taking place over short distances and, thus, to animals remaining in their countries of origin and being slaughtered there."
"In addition to journey times, there must be a lot of focus upon the conditions under which animals are transported, for even a journey time of two hours can be too long if the conditions are not as they should be."
"I am therefore delighted that the proposal on the table contains so many good decisions about ventilation, temperature and gradients of loading ramps."
"In that connection, it is definitely also worth mentioning that certificates are now being demanded of haulage contractors and that there is a demand for drivers and others who have dealings with animals to be trained to recognise and respond to issues concerning the animals’ welfare."
"Mr President, we are dealing with an important issue which, like many other issues, faces scientific uncertainties."
"What is peculiar about this issue is the erratic nature of the Commission’s proposals."
"Faced with the difficulties of defining animal welfare in an objective manner, the Commission has been making proposals by trial and error."
"Having tried to apply the inapplicable rest centres, it is now making the current proposal which is just as extraordinary, in my view."
"How can we imagine that an extended stop during the journey can benefit animal welfare?"
"Looked at in this way, it seems to me to be extremely simple-minded."
"We can imagine the effects of such a proposal if applied to ourselves."
"Allow me to offer this comparison: if on a car journey, just before reaching our destination, we were obliged to stop for a considerable length of time, without getting out of the car, our nerves would naturally suffer considerably."
"While the Commission's proposal poses serious problems in terms of rigour, we must acknowledge that the draft report, despite the efforts of Mr Maat, represents little more than ‘every man for himself’."
"Firstly, a distinction is established between animals intended for slaughter and animals intended for fattening."
"Why should animals intended for slaughter have more right to well-being than those intended for fattening?"
"As far as I am aware, according to the Treaties, all men are equal, and animals as well."
"It is clear that the draft report guarantees that 40% of Dutch exports of pigs go to their farthest destination: the Spanish market."
"Alright: 1 400 000 pigs will be able to travel for 30 hours, while the poor pigs intended for slaughter will have the right to a final wish and will not be able to travel for more than nine hours."
"What a wonderful achievement for the welfare of animals!"
"It is true that, with the nine hours, pigs originating from Poland, for example, will be able to be sacrificed in certain nearby countries, leaving the added value there and not exactly promoting compliance by Polish slaughterhouses with Community legislation."
"In my opinion, this draft report addresses many issues and not simply animal welfare."
"We must recognise that nobody transports animals for the fun of it."
"The transportation of live animals is expensive and complicated, and is only done when necessary."
"I believe that the essential thing as far as the welfare of animals is concerned is to reduce the total travelling time for all animals."
"Mr President, it is nothing short of a tragedy that the Commission proposal before us is not proposing an end to the long-distance transport of farm animals and a ban on live exports."
"Huge numbers of people oppose live exports; they are unnecessary, cruel and unjustifiable."
"My Amendment No 114 would enable Member States to ban them, and I urge colleagues to vote for it."
"This is not 'tilting at windmills', as Commissioner Byrne put it."
"It reflects public opinion, it respects much scientific opinion and it is the only humane and acceptable approach."
"That the EU can continue to allow animals to be transported across Europe for many hours – sometimes over 40 or 50 hours, sometimes up to 90 hours – is completely unacceptable, both from an animal welfare point of view and from the point of view of trying to prevent the spread of disease."
"It is therefore crucial that Parliament accepts our amendments, particularly Amendment No 123, for an overall, final maximum journey time of eight hours for slaughter and for fattening."
"Although it now seems that the United Kingdom Government is apparently – at the last minute – supporting the amendments for an overall eight-hour limit, I fear that this can only be a cynical PR stunt, since for the last six months it has been wrecking just such an outcome in the Council of Ministers."
"Not only that, but the United Kingdom Government has also completely failed to guarantee to protect our horses from being exported to the continent for slaughter."
"These are hugely important issues and we must make sure that our parliamentary response addresses them properly."
"Mr President, the EU is the reason for the long journey times for animals."
"The implementation of the internal market has required the elimination of the veterinary borders."
"Systematic veterinary controls at the borders are viewed as technical obstacles to trade."
"It must be possible to transport livestock freely around the whole of the EU like any other goods."
"Effective border controls on the transportation of animals are being made unlawful."
"The Commission’s proposal is a consistent implementation of this idea."
"The Commission’s proposal ensures that the fullest possible use can be made of all the economic advantages."
"A small pig born in Sweden can be fattened in Portugal and slaughtered in Poland, as long as savings are thereby made."
"That is the heart of the Commission’s proposal."
"Animal welfare has nothing to do with it."
"Long journeys amount to cruelty to animals, and livestock diseases are becoming more widespread."
"Veterinary safety is threatened, with animal and human health suffering as a result."
"For example, we now have the multi-resistant salmonella DT104 in Denmark."
"This must be stopped."
"There must be legislation in relation to the internal market."
"Amendment No 100 exempts livestock from the rules governing the internal market."
"It must be possible to devise more far-reaching national rules governing the transport of animals and the equipping of vehicles."
"It must be possible to introduce veterinary inspections at the borders with attendant quarantine arrangements."
"This will be effective in limiting livestock diseases, and it will decisively reduce the number of long journeys so that, as a minimum, the longest journeys will be of eight hours. Moreover, this will apply to all animals, both those that are going to slaughter and those that are for fattening."
"In another amendment, I propose that, for journeys of over eight hours, there should be systematic veterinary checks at the beginning of the journey and on the unloading platform at delivery."
"That is necessary in order constantly to evaluate whether the journeys have been defensible in terms of the animals’ welfare."
"At present, it is only the driver who provides feedback on the schedule, and this feedback contains no information about the condition of the animals."
"In the amendment, I also propose that animal transport exceeding eight hours should be subject to a levy towards the funding of checks and supervision."
"If the controls are to be effective, they will involve costs."
"The expenses linked to this aspect of livestock production must be defrayed in the form of a charge paid by the haulage contractors to the local authorities."
"There is no question of an EU tax."
"Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, the incredibly detailed draft regulation that we are debating this morning is a perfect example of a useless text."
"There are already sensible provisions regulating the transport of animals and favouring their well-being, which is one of the characteristics of the European agricultural model."
"The only problem is that these provisions are not adequately applied everywhere and are not monitored enough."
"Rather than, however, ensuring that there is better application and control – too difficult a task – the Commission decided that it was more rewarding for it to once again rush headlong into regulation by presenting us with this hefty new tome which concedes to the most radical demands of the ideological lobbies whose influence it is under."
"The major repercussions that its wording could have on our transporters and breeders are of little importance to the Commission."
"It is not visibly the problem of the European Commission which, as is its wont, does not even think about providing, alongside the legislative project, a study of the impact of the measures that it is proposing on the activity of the professionals concerned."
"We had lengthy discussions in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development about how steep access ramps to livestock trucks should be."
"Should they be no steeper than 33.3% in relation to the horizontal, or 30% for pigs, calves and horses, and no steeper than 50% or 30% for sheep and cattle other than calves, provided that the ramps are equipped with cleats at intervals of no more than 30 centimetres?"
"All that remains to be taken into account is the friction coefficient of the hooves on the ramp."
"This gap will certainly be filled in the next draft regulation submitted to us by the Commission."
"Frankly, is it really our role to overburden our producers, breeders, transporters and wealth and employment creators with such meticulous instructions and to force them into such a tight straightjacket?"
"Is it not downright suicidal to establish such heavy burdens and such costly constraints only upon European economic operators in a context of free trade where we ourselves are managing without regulatory instruments?"
"Is that not working to benefit third countries, discourage our producers and encourage imports?"
"Despite the few common-sense remarks inserted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, such as the need to slaughter livestock as close as possible to the place of rearing, the structure and the spirit of the Commission regulation basically remain intact."
"This is why, Mr President, we will vote against this damaging text."
"– Mr President, animals in the past, apart from those traditionally involved in transhumance, did not travel long distances and so throughout their lives they only made the journey to the slaughterhouse. Today, however, the problem of regulating the various aspects of transport has become a major component of legislation in the animal production sector."
"The first requirement that has arisen concerns health, especially the spread of transmissible diseases."
"Added to this is the increasingly important question of animal protection and stress factors."
"Animal welfare during transport more directly involves operators other than farmers, even though the latter often suffer its consequences, both upstream, when they receive the animals to be added to their holdings, and downstream, because of the effects that transport can have on quality and hence on the return they get for their products."
"Legislation protecting livestock during transport, in particular the regulation on which we are preparing to vote, is based on scientific and technical evidence."
"In this specific instance, we recall the studies following the report by the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare, which took into account over 300 sources and drew up 55 recommendations."
"If we consider the five freedoms mentioned in the Bremmer report in 1995, we realise that the unloading, loading and moving operations will have a profound effect on each of these five freedoms."
"Indeed, it has been proved that this set of operations causes the animals greater stress and suffering than any other farming practice."
"I therefore think that the maximum hours proposed and the system of rest periods are too reductionist, and the reasoning adopted in support of shorter travelling times cannot be justified from a scientific point of view: the Scientific Committee itself did not set this limit when it drew up its report."
"There is no doubt that transport can have a great many adverse effects on animals, but the whole situation must be analysed in technical terms for the good of both the animals themselves and the operators."
"Mr President, the objective of this Directive, which is to ensure that animals are transported in dignified conditions, deserves all our support, but we want all decisions we adopt in this regard to be based on scientific and technical criteria."
"Furthermore, we must not forget that the transport of animals is subject to the rules and standards of the internal market and that we cannot legislate without taking account of economic reality, because surrounding the transport of animals there is economic activity for many areas of the European Union."
"We cannot agree with the rapporteur’s proposal with regard to the difference between animals intended for slaughter and animals intended to live."
"Dignified transportation affects both equally."
"With regard to the duration of transportation, from the outset the Commission has maintained its desire to bring the permitted duration of transportation into line with social legislation, but the truth is, Commissioner, that the best thing for the animal’s welfare is to reach its destination as quickly as possible."
"A rest of 12 hours for animals in the vehicle blatantly violates the welfare and dignity of the animals being transported, but the restriction of nine hours’ transportation also blatantly violates the principle of the internal market."
"We therefore believe that the coherent and correct solution or proposal will be to establish the obligation for two drivers, with a cycle of nine hours which would allow for a brief rest in order to be able to continue another cycle of nine hours in the transportation."
"Finally, I would like to say that we believe that all our efforts on this proposal to guarantee the dignity of animals in transport must focus on good conditions for the vehicles which transport them, good preparation of the people responsible for the transportation and, above all, ensuring that the rules we decide on here are complied with throughout the territory of the European Union."
"Mr President, I thank Mr Maat for the skilful and sensitive way in which he has handled a complex dossier."
"I am particularly grateful that both the Commission proposal and the report recognise the practicalities of transporting animals in remote and island regions, such as the Highlands and Islands of Scotland."
"The distinction between journeys for slaughter and for other purposes is an important one."
"Other than in the most exceptional circumstances, eight hours on the road should be sufficient for slaughter and the recommendation in the report to promote the use of local slaughterhouses should make these circumstances less likely."
"Movements of animals for other purposes – such as bringing on, breeding or restocking – may genuinely require longer journey times."
"However, both the Commission proposal and the report seem to allow too great a repetition of travel time sequences."
"Our Amendment No 105 seeks to place a limit on these, but one that is still consonant with reasonable farming practices."
"– Mr President, it is good that greater attention is to be paid to animal welfare requirements in future by shortening transport times and improving transport conditions."
"It is far more important, however, that there should be a marked reduction in animal transports themselves."
"That really would be in the animals’ interests, and it would also make it more difficult for dangerous animal diseases to spread and reduce environmental pollution from carbon dioxide emissions."
"Most people think it is uncivilised to drive animals hundreds or even thousands of kilometres across Europe and the world for slaughter."
"They rightly demand that animals be transported to the nearest abattoirs and be marketed from there."
"It is after all much easier to deliver frozen meat to remote areas."
"Transports of slaughter animals should be limited to four hours."
"That is long enough to reach an abattoir from almost any farm anywhere in Europe."
"The report says the cross-border transport of animals is necessary because of the unequal distribution of resources and demand, owing to geographical and historical factors."
"I cannot support that view."
"EU subsidies have nevertheless been widely used to encourage concentration of abattoir capacities."
"The main reason is the policy of liberalisation and concentration, which is destroying regional trade patterns."
"So long as this policy is applied, everything that is to be done to protect animals during transport will be treating the symptoms and not the cause."
"What the report says about giving priority to slaughter close to place of rearing, financial support for local slaughterhouses or the use of mobile slaughterhouses will be impossible to achieve in a European Union of 25 Member States."
"The reality is different."
"The merger trend in the slaughtering industry is continuing."
"The distances over which animals are transported are growing."
"Monitoring animal transports from space by satellite positioning may be a very interesting technology, but it is just one method of surveillance, of which in my view we have too many."
"The effectiveness of all methods should be looked at again."
"This report ought to be promoting regional business cycles."
"That is why I can and must say that it needs to be completely revised to that effect."
"Mr President, every day, animals are transported for appallingly long distances across our continent."
"Dutch pigs spend 30 to 40 hours being transported to Spain and Italy;"
"Irish sheep travel to Greece and even the Middle East."
"Transport times of 90 hours are not uncommon."
"That is cruel."
"Horses from Eastern Europe are taken to Italy and Greece."
"That should stop, but the Commission has not proposed anything to that effect, and unfortunately, Mr Maat's report does not call an end to appallingly long transports of this kind either."
"More than one million Dutch pigs travel over the Alps and Pyrenees to Italy and Spain in order to be fattened there."
"My group, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, wants to put a stop to this."
"Although Mr Maat has joined 333 MEPs in signing the written declaration to call an end to all animal transports lasting over eight hours, he is now sadly backtracking."
"This is, regrettably, typical of the Christian Democrats, for whom economic interests take precedence over animal welfare."
"For my group, precisely the opposite is the case, and a huge number of Dutch people and Europeans are on our side."
"The discussion in the Council, it has to be said, is even worse."
"Nobody in the Council is calling a halt to anything anymore."
"We have to stand firm on our views, give a clear message and not give in at this stage, for otherwise, alas, the Council will make an even worse job of it."
"Mr President, I should like to comment on the Commission recommendation concerning staging posts when live animals are being transported from one Member State to another within the Union."
"Whilst the welfare of animals being transported from one jurisdiction to the next must be of paramount importance, I do not believe the policy direction proposed by the Commission to Parliament with regard to this measure is correct."
"Staging posts were originally introduced as a disease-control measure when the problems concerning BSE were first discovered."
"A lot of research has been carried out in Ireland on the merits or demerits of staging posts in general, and studies by leading agricultural research institutes have shown that it is better for animal welfare on long journeys between Ireland and the continent that staging posts remain."
"Staging posts allow animals to be unloaded, watered and rested, and also the essential cleaning and rebedding of trucks."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development recently approved an amendment which stated that the competent authorities in each Member State shall identify a sufficient number of suitable unloading premises and notify the European Commission at regular intervals."
"This is a wise approach by the Committee on Agriculture."
"We all want to see the welfare of animals being transported long distances protected."
"The provision of proper conditions for live animals moving from one Member State to another must be guaranteed."
"However, how do we ensure that this is the case?"
"I for one believe that the retention of staging posts is of key importance in this regard, and I am certainly not alone in this view."
"Mr President, as long as people eat meat the treatment of farm animals will be the subject of lively debate."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development wisely chose Mr Maat to prepare this report, which largely succeeds in reconciling animal welfare with the economics of farming."
"The fact that over 450 amendments were tabled showed the extent of interest and the wide range of opinion as to detail."
"Mr Maat handled this with skill, but on such a high-profile issue the amendments tabled before Parliament calling for even tighter conditions were to be expected."
"The committee's report achieved a number of important objectives: a reduction in travelling times; upgraded transport conditions, including provisions for rest periods, feeding and watering; additional training for drivers and animal handlers; improved enforcement of the rules; stronger rules relating to journey planning and registration; satellite monitoring of vehicle movement; the ability of Member States to ban export of animals for slaughter is included; there is a preference for slaughter near to the farm and encouragement for mobile slaughterhouses."
"Looking ahead, we must ensure that the rules are properly implemented, that transport as meat increasingly becomes the norm, and that the rules are driven more by science than by emotion."
"I shall support the report and look forward to early adoption of the revised rules."
"The provision of a review clause would be helpful and I trust the Council will introduce this."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 95% of live animal transports are by road and we are all familiar with the images of tormented animals confined in a very narrow space for days on end as they are transported across Europe and beyond."
"There can be no doubt that something needs to be done."
"I support the proposals made in this report that will help to improve standards in live animal transports, such as setting minimum standards for the vehicles used, but above all the introduction of additional supervisory measures, because however good the rules may be, they will not work if there are no controls."
"There are already plenty of rules, but enforcement and controls are lacking."
"Amendment No 2, of which I am a co-signatory, is designed to clarify the term ‘journey’ in order to prevent the maximum duration of transport being exceeded by the back door, so to speak."
"Transport times must be reduced in any case."
"The vote has been brought forward to today."
"Amendment No 81 states, and I quote: ‘sequences of travel times may be repeated during a journey’, which means there can be repeated journeys and the time limits can be avoided."
"As a block vote has been applied for, it is no longer possible to vote against Amendment No 81 on its own."
"I consider that unacceptable."
"The best thing would be for animals to be transported as little as possible."
"That is probably pie in the sky."
"We must be clear that sales-based support for live animal exports is an incentive and that we are therefore deceiving ourselves if we want to cut animal transports to a minimum so long as such support continues."
"– Mr President,I too would like to thank the rapporteur for producing an excellent report."
"Animal welfare must be ensured during transport."
"This is an important issue."
"Most consignments are of course undertaken in the proper manner."
"We have nevertheless seen horrendous instances of problems occurring."
"They have to be eliminated by means of clear regulations and effective monitoring."
"Circumstances vary from Member State to Member State and region to region."
"The circumstances in Finland are the ones I know best, especially in the sparsely populated areas of the north."
"Distances there are long, farms are few and far between, and slaughtering is concentrated in just a few large units, partly owing to stringent EU regulations."
"Animal transport is nevertheless handled excellently."
"Vehicles have camera surveillance and air-conditioning, and the animals are loaded using lifts."
"The proposed maximum transport time, however, is not totally adequate."
"It is necessary for the welfare of the animals that a derogation is granted in the case of sparsely populated areas, mountains and islands and that this time limit is extended."
"A derogation is also required for the transport of breeding calves."
"Keeping animals on vehicles during long breaks or unloading them periodically is impossible."
"If this derogation is not granted, agriculture in the peripheral regions of the Union will become impossible, which surely is not the purpose of the report."
"The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism agreed to the derogation, and it is also contained in Mr Maat’s report."
"I hope that Parliament will also agree to this derogation and that agriculture may also be able to continue in thinly populated areas."
"Mr President, for us, the European Commission’s proposal in this area is completely unacceptable."
"It seems as if the starting point for the proposal was that it should be about goods being transported as efficiently as possible in an internal market."
"This is a mistaken point of departure."
"We should instead be proceeding on the basis that what is at issue here are animals, that is to say sentient creatures."
"It is this insight that is the very basis of the rules to be adopted."
"We in the Nordic Green Left welcome the fact that the committee has made this progress."
"We believe, however, that still further progress can be made in several areas."
"We shall vote in favour of the Member States being entitled both to introduce and to retain national rules that are stricter than the EU rules in this area."
"That applies not only to journey times."
"We recommend that an absolute maximum of eight hours be introduced for journeys and that it should not be possible to circumvent this time regulation with reference to rest time in the vehicles that are being used for transportation."
"The rules in the Commission’s proposal relating to space in the vehicles used for transportation are inadequate and need to be improved."
"We believe that the same rules should apply to all types of transport, irrespective of whether it is transport to slaughter or transport for fattening elsewhere."
"Strict rules regarding this point are positive above all in terms of the animals’ well-being, but also because they will favour local abattoirs and the development of mobile abattoirs."
"I wish to add a few words about the EU’s export refunds in connection with the export of livestock from the EU."
"Large sums are at present used for these export refunds."
"This practice is completely indefensible."
"It means direct support for comprehensive cruelty to animals, with very long journey times."
"It is entirely obvious that there are large problems involving the misuse and direct misappropriation of money within this sector."
"Budgetary control is very deficient in this area."
"It is not reforms that are needed where this issue is concerned."
"Refunds for the export of livestock from the EU should instead be completely abolished as quickly as possible."
"Mr President, I welcome Mr Maat's attempt to tackle this very difficult subject."
"Animal welfare is a very emotive issue in many ways, so any new legislation must be based on sound veterinary and scientific information."
"To judge from the amount of lobbying on this issue, this is clearly a very important issue for the citizens of the European Union."
"I particularly welcome amendments acknowledging difficulties facing remote and peripheral areas for the transportation of animals – including Wales and the Western Isles of Scotland."
"That is an important inclusion within the body of the report."
"I hope we do not get bogged down, for example, in whether it is to be eight or nine hours."
"Rather, we should focus on what in my view is the far more important issue of proper policing of the regulations and ensuring that the rules are as practical and as workable as they can be."
"I would like to see the live trade ultimately replaced by a carcass trade, with animals slaughtered locally."
"We know of the dangers of not slaughtering locally in the wake of the epidemics of foot-and-mouth and other diseases, where because of transportation of animals, those kinds of diseases spread across the country far more easily."
"Where the transport of live animals is necessary, I hope we will end up with legislation that is both firm and fair for the industry."
"– Mr President, I have always held that the degree of civilisation of a people can also be measured by how much they respect animals."
"In this regard, I should like to thank Mr Maat for his excellent report, which is a move in this direction, and for the improvements made in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which, in relation to the Commission proposal, help to give a more civilised image of our continent in the field of protecting animal rights."
"Of course, it is not just a matter of image – of projecting a more humane image outside the confines of the European Union – but it is also, and I might say above all, a matter of substance."
"Some aspects of the problem involve animal health, as has already been mentioned."
"Let me underline a few of them."
"First of all, the maximum length of time spent on the road: given that livestock should be moved as little as possible, it would be appropriate to limit transport to eight hours or 500 km per day at most."
"That would apply both to slaughter animals and to those intended for fattening."
"As regards the transport of animals for breeding, shows and competitions, however, transport for more than eight hours should require the use of special vehicles."
"What does ‘special’ mean?"
"It means that these vehicles should be fitted with equipment to measure the temperature and humidity in the livestock compartment, and there should be a forced ventilation system that operates when the vehicle is stationary."
"Finally, in addition to the quite reasonable requirement of special training for drivers of vehicles intended for the transport of livestock, because we know that inappropriate driving inevitably causes the animals serious and unnecessary damage and suffering, I should also like to underline the need for an official veterinarian to be present while the animals are being loaded. This is to ensure that the rules for transport – the fitness of the animals to travel, and the minimum space allowances – are observed."
"For this reason we particularly support Amendments Nos 121, 122, 123 and 124."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Maat, most sincerely for his report because he really has tried to reconcile the very contrary positions of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy in a document that we can live with."
"I would also like to support what has already been said today."
"Animal welfare must be dealt with scientifically and not just emotionally."
"The avoidance of unnecessary animal transports and the protection of animals during transport are fundamental concerns of agriculture, especially of farmers and producers."
"It must be ensured, however, that the statutory provisions are realistic and that their enforcement will not place our European farmers at a competitive disadvantage."
"It must all remain within a sensible economic context and it must also comply with the European Union’s laws."
"That was also something that Commissioner Byrne mentioned."
"It is of course in everyone’s interest – farmers, animal welfare and the animals themselves – that animals should arrive at their destination safe and sound and in the best possible condition."
"This is particularly the case of animals for slaughter because the quality of the meat depends on it."
"Let me make one observation here, Mr President: once the animals leave the farm, they are in fact no longer the producer’s, the farmer’s responsibility, but the responsibility of the carrier or buyer."
"I am also very grateful to the rapporteur for paying attention to traditional pasturing and transhumance, which is absolutely essential in mountain regions."
"One last thing."
"An international organisation called PETA is currently mounting a large-scale campaign in Austria, and I believe in other Member States as well, about the keeping and slaughter of farm animals."
"The treatment of animals is being compared with the horrors of the Nazi regime."
"That is an insult to all those who perished in the Holocaust, and I ask you to protest against it."
"Mr President, the Commission has given its proposal for a regulation the title ‘Protection of animals during transport’."
"I should probably say that, in my view, there is a considerable disparity between the title of the proposal and its content."
"With the Commission’s proposal, it is still possible to transport animals thousands of kilometres throughout Europe under wretched conditions and, moreover, without the animals being allowed at any time to leave the lorries."
"In my view, that cannot be called protection of animals during transport."
"Nor do I think that the report by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development remedies the Commission’s proposal, and I therefore hope that, in the vote, Parliament will stick to the position it has, moreover, held for two years that the transport of animals to slaughter or for fattening should not be for periods in excess of eight hours or for distances in excess of 500 kilometres."
"Because it is defensible in terms of animal protection, that would be the proposal to implement."
"I am, moreover, also able to support our obtaining better conditions for animals during transport."
"There is a long list of amendments that I think would remedy some of the shortcomings in the Commission’s proposal, so that animal welfare is given precedence over the financial considerations that otherwise govern the transports."
"I also think it important that we implement tighter controls, including random checks on the roads."
"I believe that these would be some of the most effective measures that could be implemented."
"As others too have mentioned, I think that export refunds for livestock should be abolished."
"It cannot be right that, under the EU system, we give direct transport subsidies to these long transports of livestock."
"Finally, I also think that individual countries must be entitled to give higher priority to animal welfare and so to lay down more restrictive rules than those proposed by the Commission."
"I hope that the majority of Parliament will show that it is considerations of animal welfare that are crucial in connection with the transports."
"Mr President, the problem here is that Member States fail to enforce the rules in far too many instances."
"Therefore, there are horrific cases of animal cruelty and far too many cases of animals – living creatures – simply being treated like so many nuts and bolts on a manufacturing production line."
"The Commission does not have a police force, and I recognise the attempts being made by the Commissioner to try and introduce a system that is more capable of being enforced."
"However, that is no way near enough."
"Inevitably horrific practices will continue to occur."
"We will find many instances of dead animals being left amongst live animals on journeys taking many days."
"It is now some 150 years since refrigeration was introduced, which allowed beef from Argentina to be imported into Europe."
"It is simply incredible that all this time later we are still transporting live animals huge distances within our continent."
"The time is going to come when we will impose a ban on this, when carcasses only will be permitted."
"Refrigeration permits this."
"We should introduce a ban on the transport of live animals at the earliest possible moment."
"Mr President, I congratulate Mr Maat on his efforts because he tried hard to reach consensus."
"I want to put on the record the total commitment of farmers to animal welfare."
"Animal welfare is central to the ethos and the profession of farming, and I am amazed that there are always people in this House who would like to convey an alternative impression."
"Animal transport is central to Ireland's agricultural economy."
"We export 90% of our entire production, be it processed or live."
"Much of the discussion in committee centred around transport of mature animals for slaughter on mainland Europe."
"In the case of Ireland, we export young animals for finishing; so live transport is essential and central to the agricultural economy."
"The retention of staging posts is important and the question of density also has an impact on the economics of transport."
"The provision of staging posts, therefore, is a central requirement."
"Finally, decisions must be made on scientific findings and I draw the attention of the House to the findings of the recent report prepared by Dr Bernadette Earley, which presented a very coherent, balanced and objective view of live animal transport to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, every year, millions of animals are hauled across Europe, quite often under dire circumstances."
"This should stop."
"The Commission has come up with a plan that definitely improves the transport of animals, and, in its opinion, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has imposed strict conditions with regard to the way in which this is done by road."
"Animals’ welfare should be improved, control should be stepped up and enforceable, and the personnel should be better trained."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has tabled an opinion to the same effect, but unfortunately, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has not adopted all recommendations."
"Do not get me wrong;"
"Mr Maat's report is sound and considerably improves the Commission's plan."
"For this, the rapporteur deserves all credit, but a number of important issues remain outstanding, and I should like to ask you to put this situation right."
"Transport should be of a high quality, so that the welfare of the animals is optimal and stress during transport is minimal."
"I think we are accommodating these requirements with this report, but the driving times should also be restricted."
"There is no reasonable explanation for the fact that transport of slaughter animals is being restricted, while that of animals destined for fattening is not."
"We must apply one rule for all and restrict transport in both categories."
"The hauling of animals should stop."
"We in this House said this years ago and underlined this once again by a large majority in a written declaration in 2003."
"We now have the opportunity to translate our requirements into legislation."
"Let us seize this opportunity with both hands."
"I should therefore ask you to support the amendments in which driving times are restricted, the beginning and end of journeys are defined effectively, the presence of a veterinarian is made obligatory and animals in lorries are given sufficient space."
"These are Amendments Nos 121, 122, 123 and 124."
"Mr President, at this stage of the debate we have said practically everything in favour and against the Commission’s proposal, which, as Mr Jové said – and I entirely agree with what he said – is being made by trial and error, with no technical or scientific rigour, and without taking account of the fact that, according to the legislation in force in the European Union, we must promote the free movement of goods, persons and capital between all the Members States of the European Union, including the outlying and accession countries, which from 1 May will be full Members."
"This is not a proposal for the welfare of animals – the welfare of which I support entirely."
"How can we try to justify this being applied to animals for slaughter and not to all other animals?"
"Transport and welfare affects all animals, not just those intended for slaughter, or is this perhaps a commercial measure, a commercial restriction?"
"What do we want?"
"For the peripheral countries to be left out of the market?"
"What is the technical and scientific basis for laying down this differentiation in European legislation?"
"Why are we justifying four hours, eight hours, nine hours?"
"Why increase spaces?"
"In order to increase costs?"
"Whom does this benefit?"
"The animals are seriously harmed, because of the risk of the friction, rubbing, injuries and fights which may arise."
"What is the justification?"
"This is demonstrated by scientific and technical studies carried out at European level by the association of transporters."
"Nor do I want to go into loading and unloading operations, temperature, etc. This is not justified either, which is what the report attempts to do in technical terms."
"We call for support for the amendments we have presented so that specific treatment is given to peripheral areas – Sweden, Finland, Portugal, Italy, Spain, etc. – so that we are not left out of the market."
"With proposals of four hours, in my region I cannot even get from one part to another, let alone participate in other international markets, which is my right."
"– The many opinions and different arguments show what a sensitive subject this is and what a sense of responsibility we need to show here."
"We are talking about transports of living creatures with which people work and in which they trade and which, in the end, are also eaten."
"Everyone who is not a vegetarian must acknowledge that."
"The question is: how do we treat those animals?"
"The question is also: why do animals have to be transported so far?"
"Is it necessary for animals to be transported across half of Europe to be slaughtered?"
"No, it is not."
"That is why this report clearly calls for slaughter animals to be slaughtered within a 500 km radius."
"I believe we must insist on their being able to be slaughtered within that radius."
"It must be no excuse to say there are not enough slaughterhouses; we must ensure that there are."
"That will stimulate the region’s economy and be of particular help to the animals."
"That is one of the most important points and also one of the trickiest: how far should animals be transported?"
"Animals for fattening are counted as animals for slaughter, but I believe we should nevertheless make a distinction here."
"Animals for fattening should not be lumped together with slaughter animals, but they should be taken to a farm within the same short distance."
"Another important point that seems to have been overlooked is that controls are carried out."
"There is a directive; there used to be one."
"If anything went wrong, it was because the system was not working."
"It was the failure to implement the directive properly in the Member States and the inefficient control system that caused and still causes animals to suffer."
"I believe that needs to be said."
"The best rules and the best directive are useless if there are no controls and they are not enforced."
"In the end, that is the decisive factor and that is what will benefit the animals."
"Mr President, I welcome this report and congratulate the rapporteur on the tremendous work he has done."
"This topic has been the subject of debate for a long time: sometimes heated, sometimes misrepresented, sometimes taken in the wrong way."
"I believe we need this, but it has to be realistic and it has to be workable."
"If it is not, then it will not work."
"Nine hours is about right."
"I do not think it makes much difference if we made it eight or ten hours, but we have to decide something."
"I think nine hours is right, but if it is not right, then we will revisit this at some stage in the future."
"But let us start somewhere!"
"There is a difference between animals that are going for slaughter and animals that are continuing their journey, and there is a difference between cattle, sheep and pigs."
"Cattle travel long distances to go to agricultural shows, but these animals are well cared for by their owners."
"The problems start when the animal leaves the farm, goes to a haulier and moves onward."
"I know there are lots of differences between Member States and indeed between regions and I understand the concerns in remote areas, but we must address that."
"It has to be left to some extent to individual countries and indeed regions as to how they work their way through this."
"Animals should not be transported for long periods where at all possible, and the standards and the quality of lorries must be monitored very closely, especially the ventilation."
"Animals should always be slaughtered close to the place where they were reared."
"We should export on the hook and not the hoof."
"That is the reality of this."
"We should be limiting export on the hoof."
"I know there is a difference, but animals must be respected and they must be protected."
"Mr President, I regret to say that, although the Commission very often surprises us with the immense quality of its documents and the time it has dedicated to analysing the reality, this Regulation presents numerous technical problems and is practically devoid of scientific basis."
"Evidence of this is that it was initially proposed that animals should be unloaded to rest in open spaces and subsequently it has been demonstrated that that is also prejudicial to their health and contributes to the spread of diseases."
"These are reprehensible aspects indicating the lack of maturity of a document which is being presented for other reasons."
"And what do I believe are the main reasons for this document?"
"Firstly, there is no scientific certainty and, therefore, there is no willingness to wait for it."
"That is why we have introduced an amendment which states that we must continue to carry out acute-phase protein research, which defines the stress suffered by animals."
"There is no knowledge of many of the aspects indicated and therefore certain measures, for example, such as excessive separation of animals, is going to harm them, or in other words, things are going to be worse than before."
"The second hidden intention in this document is clearly to create a glass barrier, a new border for the countries of the East."
"In other words, on the one hand we integrate them and, on the other, we create a glass barrier, an invisible one, that is, a new form of customs, which will prevent them from crossing from one end of Europe to the other."
"This concept is furthermore entirely in opposition to the general policies we are implementing on other points."
"Above all, however, the intention is to dress everybody in the same suit: all animals in the same suit, like Chairman Mao’s suit."
"We have therefore also tabled an amendment calling for the exclusion of certain animals, such as, for example, those for repopulation, wild animals, circus animals, because there is no doubt that a measure for animals for slaughter cannot be applied to all the others."
"This is an impoverishment, a shackling, and goes against the ideas of sustainability, which are to adapt to reality and make things viable."
"Mr President, I do not find the arguments advocating a restriction of the transport of animals to a certain number of hours to be appropriate."
"It is in fashion, as the Commission just acknowledged in its intervention, but they are not based on any proven scientific basis."
"The possible effects on the economy of regions and even whole countries could be very serious."
"The current legislation is more than sufficient to safeguard the welfare of animals during transport."
"The problem is not the existence of gaps in the legislation, which already covers all the requirements necessary to ensure comfort, but rather compliance with that legislation."
"The new rules should be directed towards improving controls in order to ensure respect for the legislation, rather than taking advantage of a debate such as this one on the welfare of cattle in order to introduce stringent restrictions on the free movement of goods, particularly restrictions which will not have the same effect in all countries."
"The amendments presented by certain Members of this House clearly represent a step backwards in the achievements made in the creation of the single market and could lead to the isolation of many regions, especially the European Union's peripheral and outermost regions."
"A restriction of the duration of journeys, without having made a prior in-depth impact study, is a measure which I would describe as clumsy and disproportionate, particularly if we bear in mind the harm that will be caused."
"I would finally like to draw attention to another element of this debate whose effects could be entirely contrary to those pursued: the reduction of maximum densities, which are already laid down in the legislation."
"This measure promotes aggressive behaviour amongst animals, as well as injuries due to the greater mobility of the cattle within the compartments of lorries."
"We should consider very carefully our decisions on all the points of the legislation which are equally incongruous, and thereby prevent our work from simply causing greater burdens for the sector and isolating economic sectors of entire regions."
"– Mr President, it is not the first time that this argument has caused lively debate and equally lively and difficult decisions in this Parliament."
"It is our job once again to attempt a real balancing act in reconciling as far as possible two opposing demands: the demand to limit the effects of transport, by those who mainly see an environmental cost in this and are therefore primarily concerned with the animals’ health, and the demand to take financial costs into account as well, by those who want to keep transport costs down, but without ever neglecting the physical wellbeing of the livestock being transported."
"In short, the matter deserves our full attention, but in these difficult judgments it is a relief to note the great advances made by technology, which today provides hauliers – that hard-working, industrious group – with increasingly comfortable vehicles, fitted with fans, mangers and drinking systems with water for rehydration."
"With these new devices, more comfortable and especially longer journeys may be possible, although there must still be rest periods, which should in turn be increased to up to two hours."
"Then there is a debate on the problem of unloading and reloading the animals, an operation which does not always achieve its intended aim, which is to help the animals rest."
"Farmers and hauliers, and also environmentalists, tend to think that this type of operation, especially for small animals – I am thinking of calves – may cause even greater stress than remaining on board, especially on those vehicles that I have mentioned, with air-conditioning, water for rehydration and a ready supply of feed."
"This too is a proposal that should not be ignored, so as not to make the wrong decision or repeat problems that have already been debated."
"One would, of course, have to be inside the head or the mind of a calf to be sure of reaching the right decision, but unfortunately a calf does not think and, most of all, it does not vote."
"– Mr President, first a brief word on a point of order."
"The vote has been brought forward to today, but Members have not been made aware of it."
"I think it is a little undemocratic that it is not possible to hold single separate votes or to ask for roll-call votes."
"The public will be very surprised and will say yet again how undemocratic this European Union is."
"I want to thank Mrs Schierhuber."
"She has made a clear distinction between humans and animals and I, too, would like to reject the disgusting comparison with the Holocaust."
"I would like to say something to Mr Adam."
"It is not correct to say that anyone who eats meat is a torturer of animals."
"You see, in Austria we have a national dish, , and if you come to Austria I can tell you precisely where the meat for it comes from, from the forest area of Lower Austria or from Styria."
"In most cases, that is only two or three hours away."
"In Austria, animals are allowed to be transported only for six hours."
"It is not necessary to torture animals if you want to eat them later."
"That is a change of thinking, and thinking is of course painful."
"You see, Christian Democrats naturally have a perhaps rather different relationship with animals."
"For me, animals are God’s creatures and capable of suffering."
"I do not know whether you have saints, Mr Adam."
"My favourite saint is Francis of Assisi, and he did not only love people, he loved animals as well."
". Mr President, the purpose of this debate is to formulate an opinion for the guidance of the Council and the Commission in coming to a final conclusion in relation to this issue."
"Certainly we have had a very wide expression of views and opinions from one side and the other on the issue, and I hope and expect that the Council can draw some guidance from what has been said."
"Allow me to express the Commission’s opinion in relation to the main points of concern."
"On travelling times, the European Parliament wants to introduce a fixed and final time limit of nine hours for slaughter animals, while allowing the others to travel with fewer restrictions."
"As I said at the outset, we cannot adopt measures which would effectively ban a trade, particularly in circumstances where there is insufficient scientific information to support such a move."
"In order to limit the transport of animals for slaughter, the European Parliament advocates the use of mobile slaughterhouses."
"At present there is not enough expertise or practical experience to support this solution and the animal welfare advantages have not been clearly demonstrated."
"Regarding the scope of the regulation, the European Parliament suggests a derogation for journeys of less than 100 km, as well as for certain categories of animals such as animals transported for sporting events and shows."
"The Commission could support retaining the current derogation for journeys of less than 50 km, but there is no reason to exclude from the scope of the regulation other animals that are at risk of suffering poor standards of welfare."
"The Commission supports the proposal to open up the possibility for Member States to adopt stricter national rules, provided that they are compatible with the general rules of the Treaty."
"I am pleased that this would effectively maintain the UK’s restriction on the export of horses destined for human consumption."
"I have consistently said that I would look at this matter with a view to supporting a legally sustainable text."
"In relation to the authorisation of transporters and the pre-approval of vehicles, the European Parliament proposes having a single system for short and long journeys."
"One of the major objectives of the proposal is to focus checks on long journeys – these are the most critical for the welfare of animals."
"I believe that by removing the distinction between long and short journeys, the efforts of inspection and the administrative burdens would be diluted and animals transported over long journeys would not benefit from a higher degree of attention from the competent authorities."
"The European Parliament suggests introducing the use of a satellite navigation system."
"This idea is most innovative and the Commission fully supports it in principle."
"I should add that the Commission proposal already includes a requirement to check the vehicles’ tachographs as a new enforcement tool."
"As regards sanctions, a number of amendments have been proposed."
"Most of the suggestions are already covered by the Commission proposal through a stricter system of authorisation for transporters."
"A number of other amendments on sanctions need to be examined with regard to their compatibility with the principle of proportionality."
"A full listing of the Commission’s position on each of the amendments is being made available to Parliament and I trust that this will be included in the verbatim report of proceedings for this part-session(1)."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon."
"The next item is the vote."
"Mr President, please be patient, I have the floor."
"I have two reports, but you may be reassured to know that I shall be speaking only once."
"As rapporteur for all regulations on the basis of which Eurostat has to quickly compile the best of statistics for us, I would again like to recommend here and now that you approve my two reports with the usual enthusiasm."
"The first is about a regulation under which we and everyone concerned – primarily the European Central Bank – will now receive quarterly information on Member States’ debt."
"That is very important, even if the blue letters for the deficit procedure continue to be issued on the basis of the annual figures – and even if they do not."
"As you know, Member States are not treated equally in this respect."
"Mr Eichel and Mr Mer might, however, discover the scale of their budget problems sooner."
"They might even find out sooner what their efforts at consolidation have achieved, if they have made any."
"The second report is concerned with a regulation that is to provide us with quarterly national accounts data, specifically on the contribution made by the individual sectors ‘households’, ‘companies’ and ‘government’."
"The United States have had that for a long time now, because it is important for monetary policy and economic analysis to know how the various players are behaving."
"The Ecofin Council recognised a year ago that the lack of information on the behaviour of households and companies in the business cycle was a major deficiency of EMU statistics."
"However, all countries whose gross domestic product is lower than 1% of the EU25 total will not have to report data on transactions in the households and companies sectors."
"Mr President, I have twice two minutes’ speaking time and I will keep to that – you can make as much noise as you want."
"Those excluded are Luxembourg and all the new Member States except Poland."
"They, too, however, must supply the quarterly data on transactions in the ‘general government’ and ‘rest of the world’ sectors."
"Now you know what is involved and, as in the past, you can vote in favour of my two reports with a clear conscience."
"They are my last reports for this legislative period, in which, counting today, I have spoken nine times on statistical reports."
"I do not know whether I will be able to take care of these statistics regulations after the 13 June elections; they are much drier than wine and honey."
"However that may be, I thank you for the confidence and enthusiasm you have always shown for my reports."
"Mrs Lulling, never before have European statistics been presented so elegantly in this House!"
"."
"Mr President, on a technical matter, I want to add the words 'and to the Commission' to Article 4 of the Schulz immunity report."
"I would make the same request in relation to the Lehne report."
"To explain, as Members of the House will know, Article 9 of the Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of Parliament confers an immunity on Members of Parliament for expressions of opinion and votes cast in the exercise of their office."
"We believe that part of the German MEPs' Statute is incompatible with that."
"We request, in paragraph 3, that the Commission should verify whether clause 5 of the second sentence of that Statute is compatible with Community law."
"However, in Article 4, we omitted to refer the matter to the Commission in the properly formal way."
"Members will also wish to know that this concerns a case in which two Members of this House have been subjected to an injunction at the instance of to prevent them holding press conferences in this House criticising the conduct of in relation to the Members' Statute."
"Mr President, as you will be aware, the debate on this report only concluded just before the vote."
"This is a very complex and important report."
"There have been a number of problems regarding amendments such as the order of the amendments and how they have been grouped together."
"Because of this complexity and because of the importance of the report, I would like to propose that the vote be delayed until tomorrow to give people more time to gather their thoughts and to take into account what the Commissioner and others have said this morning."
"I am asking for the vote to be postponed until tomorrow."
"Thirty-two Members support Mr Evans' proposal."
"Does anyone wish to speak against it?"
". Mr President, Mr Evans' argument does not hold good."
"This morning, we already voted on two other reports – four, in fact – which were also discussed this morning."
"In that respect, the debate is finished."
"There was, however, a chance that we had to vote on my report tomorrow, Wednesday, had the debate not been concluded."
"As it happens, the debate is finished, all nominal lists were available last night, and there is no problem at all about the order of the amendments, because given the contributions of the various groups, I cannot imagine that the voting list would look any different."
"I cannot therefore see any formal, or other, argument to postpone the vote."
"– That concludes the vote."
". This report addresses the Commission proposal for a regulation that has arisen following the Court of Justice ruling on bilateral ‘open skies’ agreements between EU Member States and the United States of America."
"The relevant part of the ruling states the opinion that these agreements contravened Community law, since the Member States did not have the right or competence to conclude agreements of this nature."
"With this proposal, the Commission has proposed three measures: to provide a legal basis for relations between the Community and the United States in the field of air transport, to create a legal framework for ongoing negotiations and for all other agreements and to ensure an appropriate division of competences between the Community and the Member States."
"From the legal point of view, the Commission proposal has a very solid basis, given that it manages to plug a legal loophole created by the Court of Justice ruling."
"With the measures adopted in the Council common position, which were supported by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, the political limitation imposed on the Member States to negotiate and conclude bilateral air service agreements with third countries becomes much less harsh and I therefore felt able to vote in favour."
". This proposal for a Regulation follows on from a Court of Justice ruling arising from an action brought by the Commission against Member States that had signed bilateral ‘open sky’ agreements, for having infringed the Community’s external competence and the freedom of establishment."
"The Commission proposed that the Member States should initiate procedures to terminate the agreements that they had concluded and asked the Council for permission to open Community negotiations with all the bilateral partners."
"As regards matters lying partly within Community competence and partly within the competence of the Member States, the Commission proposed a common approach, in other words, close cooperation."
"In its Common Position, the Council accepted the positions of the EP."
"The Member States will thus still have the right to negotiate and conclude bilateral air service agreements, without need for prior authorisation from the Commission, even if the subject matter of these lies partly within Community competence, provided that they include certain types of clause defined jointly by the Commission and by the Member States."
"This approach will continue to guarantee the Member States freedom of action, and so we voted in favour."
". The Commission proposal for a regulation follows on from the Court of Justice’s ruling on the bilateral ‘open skies’ agreements between Member States of the EU and the United States of America, concluded in the 1990s by some Member States and deemed to contravene Community law."
"The Commission proposes a set of rules that the Member States must adhere to when negotiating and implementing air service agreements for this category of joint agreements requiring the participation of Member State governments."
"Specifically, these must support the Community’s negotiating strategies and aims and must not enter into negotiations that lie within the exclusive competence of the Community."
"The Council common position incorporated Parliament’s basic request for the Member States to maintain the right to negotiate and conclude bilateral air service agreements, without needing the prior agreement of the Commission, even if the subject matter falls within Community competence."
"The proviso is established that ‘standard clauses’ laid down jointly by the Commission and the Member States must be incorporated in any agreements concluded."
"With the measures adopted in the Council common position, supported by the Committee on Transport, Regional Policy, Health and Tourism, the restrictions on the action undertaken by States become less stringent and I consequently voted in favour."
". The interinstitutional agreement of 7 November 2002 provided for the creation of a Solidarity Fund to support the population of regions struck by disasters."
"The Fund can be mobilised within the annual ceiling of EUR one billion."
"This is a proposal that took several years to be adopted, following our parliamentary group’s insistence in the annual budgetary proceedings prior to 2002."
"This fund helped, last year, by providing emergency aid as a follow up to the major forest fires that devastated around 5% of Portuguese territory."
"Bearing in mind the urgent nature of the situation, we supported this proposal to mobilise around EUR 22 million from the Fund to cover the damage caused by the storms and floods that occurred in Malta (September 2003), the forest fires in Spain (in the summer of 2003) and the floods in France (December 2003)."
"The inadequacy of the sums involved, however, in light of the damage that has been suffered – and Portugal last year is a case in point – raises the issue of the scale of Community solidarity and of the criteria for eligibility for this Fund."
". I voted in favour of Preliminary Draft Amending Budget No 5/2004 in order to allocate the budgetary resources mobilised from the EU Solidarity Fund as swiftly as possible, to ensure the necessary Community assistance for communities affected by natural disasters in Spain, in France and in Malta in 2003, thereby helping to ensure that this assistance is provided as quickly as possible."
"To this end, it is also crucial that this amending budget is adopted at first reading, as has happened in the past, specifically in the case of the forest fires that occurred in Portugal in the summer of 2003."
"The EU must demonstrate full and prompt solidarity with regions in the Member States or candidate countries that are affected by natural disasters and alleviate the serious consequences of these disasters for people’s living conditions, the environment and for the economy."
"For this reason, aid must be not only swift, but also visible in the appropriations provided."
"I therefore believe that the criteria for eligibility to the Solidarity Fund must be amended to provide for this."
". This regulation is intended to respond to the action plan on Economic and Monetary Union, adopted by the Ecofin Council on 18 February 2003, with a view to remedying the shortcomings in EU statistics on the economic behaviour of families and businesses and will make it possible, in particular, to monitor households' saving and consumption and the profitability of financial and non-financial businesses."
"Breaking the statistics down by economic sector will undoubtedly improve the information provided by the quarterly financial accounts, clearly ‘imitating’ the way things are done for the US Federal Reserve."
"We find nothing to object to in the proposal itself."
"Nevertheless, what could be considered to be a purely technical issue, which serves information purposes only, is closely linked to the support and direction given to economic policy and above all, to monetary policy in the European Union."
"These are tools for adjusting economic policy decisions, since these policies prop up the single Economic and Monetary Union, which lacks precise statistical instruments."
"To put it clearly, these are also tools that help to strengthen the Union’s right-wing and anti-social policies, although they do provide some useful information."
". On 1 January 2004, we saw the entry into force of Directive 2003/96/EC, restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity."
"This amendment seeks to ensure that the new Member States have longer exemption periods given the risk they face of a sudden increase in the cost of living."
"We believe, however, that the issue goes deeper and we object to the directive on three grounds:"
"Firstly, harmonised energy taxation is not a fundamental prerequisite for a well-functioning Internal Market."
"Tax competition does have its benefits but, more importantly, this is an issue of tax sovereignty, with far-reaching implications for a State’s social and environmental choices and tax structure."
"This is why the Member States have submitted many requests for exemptions."
"Secondly, increasing the lowest rates will lead to higher costs of living, especially for workers and for the least well-off members of society."
"It will introduce factors for injustice and fail to penalise those who consume most heavily."
"This is the nature of fixed rates and direct taxation."
"Thirdly, what is needed is not to shift tax from labour towards environmental ‘use’, the price for which is always passed on to the consumer."
"The burden does need to be shifted but to the ‘use’ of capital, otherwise, taxation will remain unfair."
". Council Directive 2003/96/EC, restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity has become the main legal base in the field of energy taxation, guaranteeing all the current Member States transitional arrangements that will enable them to adjust their national legislation."
"Indeed, harmonised taxation is a fundamental prerequisite for a well-functioning Internal Market."
"The rapporteur takes the view that ‘in order to avoid harmful tax competition, the acceding countries have to align their tax rates of excise duties with the minimum levels set within the European Union’."
"This explains the report’s call to ‘all Member States, including the current ones’ to ensure compliance with ‘the deadlines set by the Directive and, as such, contribute to the development of the environment-friendly internal market’."
"Despite the fact that this report addresses a delicate matter – energy taxation – on environmental grounds in particular, and the fact that taxation still requires unanimity of votes in Council, I voted in favour of the text."
". Although I harbour fundamental reservations about the process of tax harmonisation, I believe we must establish forms of coordination, in particular as regards avoiding tax on cross-border flows of capital and I am, therefore, a firm advocate of abolishing banking secrecy and of putting an end to tax havens."
"The ultimate aim of Directive 2003/48/EC is to enable savings income in the form of interest payments made in one Member State to beneficial owners to be made subject to effective taxation, thus guaranteeing an equitable tax treatment of savings and Member States’ rights to tax their residents’ income, at European level, whilst at the same time removing artificial incentives to the flow of capital in the EU and beyond."
"The desire of some Member States, particularly those with direct links to tax havens, to erode the tax base is at variance, however, with their desire to attract capital savings."
"The most effective way of collecting savings income is to ensure the automatic exchange of information between tax administrations."
"In order to prevent capital flight, other countries must comply with the arrangements made and in this case, we are talking specifically about Switzerland."
"Unfortunately, difficulties remain in negotiations with other countries."
"We must, however, go further."
"We must work on ways of coordinating taxation in order to tax capital movements and cross-border stock transfers at Community level."
"My abstention in this vote is based on the opinion that I have always expressed on the agreement reached on 19 and 20 June 2000 at the Santa Maria da Feira European Council which, in my opinion, can only lead to deadlock."
"The continued difficulties with Switzerland, despite the conclusion of the agreement that is being submitted to us here, and the difficult pursuit of negotiations with the other third countries, back me up in this assessment and in my vote today."
"I voted in favour of the agreement between Switzerland and the European Union on taxation of savings income, but I would like to make it clear that I am doing so subject to Parliament being consulted, before this agreement is implemented, about those agreements negotiated with the other third countries: the United States, Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco and San Marino."
"At the same time, I would stress that its application also depends on the adoption and implementation by the dependent or associated territories of the Member States of measures that conform with those contained in the directive of 3 June 2003."
"Switzerland, like some Member States that opted within the framework of the directive for a withholding tax at source, still sets great store by banking secrecy, the aim of which is to guarantee that the private sphere is respected and that depositors have greater trust in their banks."
"Some people constantly claim that abolishing banking secrecy is necessary to combat tax fraud and harmful tax competition."
"Alongside banking secrecy, Switzerland, like my country, Luxembourg, has laid down very strict clauses on money laundering and financing of criminal activities."
"In accordance with Article 10 of this agreement, Switzerland, and every Member State of the European Union, exchanges information on behaviour constituting tax fraud according to the legislation of the Member State concerned."
"The draft legislative resolution presented in the report renders meaningless the agreement reached at the Santa Maria de Feira European Council in June 2000."
"This agreement makes the entry into force of the directive dependent upon the application of equivalent measures by Switzerland as well as by a number of other countries and dependent territories."
"Since this condition has not been fulfilled, I voted against the resolution."
". On 16 October 2001, the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate an agreement with the Swiss Confederation providing for measures equivalent to those that must be implemented in the Community, with a view to ensuring the effective taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments."
"Implementing the provisions of Council Directive 2003/48/EC of 3 June 2003, on the taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments, will depend on the Swiss Confederation’s implementation of measures equivalent to those laid down in the aforementioned directive, in line with an agreement concluded between that country and the European Community."
"Consequently, it is proposed that we should adopt the agreement between the Community and the Swiss Confederation, which provides for measures equivalent to those laid down in Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments and the accompanying Memorandum of Understanding."
"I voted in favour."
". This proposal for a directive forms part of the original Monti package of 1998, which paved the way for greater tax harmonisation within the European Union."
"Regardless of what one might think of the proposals as a whole and given that we are seeking to create an internal market, one can understand the need to establish a degree of tax harmonisation to combat tax evasion and double taxation."
"We do, however, have one fundamental objection to the approach that has been outlined, because the concept of tax harmonisation is federalist in nature and touches on one of the fundamental pillars of state sovereignty: a state’s ability to tax families and businesses, thus ensuring its autonomy."
"Furthermore, we are not convinced of the economic advantages of tax harmonisation as opposed to the advantages of maintaining healthy tax competition."
"For this very reason, this directive and the remainder of the package were only approved in June 2003."
"The directive relates to interest payments and royalties transferred between associated companies with the aim of abolishing deductions from these payments at source."
"This amendment seeks to extend the list of companies covered and to take account of the directive on parent companies and subsidiaries and the directive on mergers."
"Our concern is that the directive must not make tax evasion easier or deprive Member States of the appropriate means with which to combat fraud and abuse."
". The proposal for a Council decision aimed at establishing a court of first instance specialising in civil service disputes is one aspect of the judicial reform enshrined in the Treaty of Nice, which seeks to solve the growing problem of workload in the Community courts."
"It answers the call made in the Nice Summit, under the terms of which ‘The Conference asks the Court of Justice and the Commission to prepare as swiftly as possible a draft decision establishing a judicial panel which has jurisdiction to deliver judgments at first instance on disputes between the Community and its servants.’"
"Establishing this court will enable these disputes, which account for around one-third of the Court of First Instance’s current workload, to be removed from that court."
"This will confine itself, in future, to the role of a court of second instance relating to judgments delivered by the new court of first instance, with the Court of Justice intervening only in exceptional circumstances, in reviewing the judgments of the Court of First Instance."
"Despite the staffing and operational costs of this new court, estimated to total EUR 2 453 000 per year, I voted in favour of establishing it, given the added swiftness it will bring to Community court proceedings."
". Under the terms of Article 245(2) of the EC Treaty and Article 160(2) of the European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC) Treaty, the Court calls on the Council to add the following amendments to the Protocol on the Statute of the Court of Justice: under the terms of Article 17 of the Protocol, Decisions of the full Court shall be valid only if 11 Judges are sitting."
"With the increase in the number of judges – from 15 to 25 – following enlargement, it is proposed that this quorum should be set at 15."
"Pursuant to Article 16 of the Protocol, the Grand Chamber, which sits in particular when a Member State or an institution of the Communities that is party to the proceedings so requests, consists of 11 judges."
"It is proposed to increase the number of judges forming part of the Grand Chamber to 13, as well as maintaining the current quorum of nine judges."
"According to the rapporteur and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, the proposal on which the EP is consulted ‘appears to have obtained a consensus both in the Council and the Court and is well-founded, and can therefore be approved without amendment(explanatory statement)’."
"We see no reason not to endorse this conclusion and therefore voted in favour."
". This draft Council decision seeks, further to the enlargement process, to amend Articles 16 and 17 of the Protocol on the Statute of the Court of Justice with regard to increasing the number of judges in what are known as the Grand Chamber and the full Court."
"Under the terms of this proposal, the Court would increase the number of judges in the Grand Chamber to thirteen, with the minimum number of judges required to be sitting remaining at nine."
"As regards the full Court, with the increase in judges from fifteen to twenty-five, it is proposed that this quorum should be raised from eleven to fifteen judges."
"I share the rapporteur’s view that this is a well-founded proposal, which obtained a consensus both in the Council and the Court and I therefore voted in favour."
". This report could be said to be unimportant and largely technical, but it takes on greater significance when we consider that its aim is to include, following on from the enlargement of the European Union on 1 May to encompass ten countries from Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean, the nine official languages of these countries – unless they are already used – in the Court of Justice of the European Communities."
"Why does this need to be emphasised?"
"Because in other processes – such as the important example of the ‘Community patent’ – some people are looking for ‘solutions’ that do not entail full respect for the various languages of the EU’s countries but which seek to impose the languages of the countries with the largest populations and discriminate against the Union’s other official languages."
". The draft Council decision seeks to include, in light of the new division of jurisdiction in direct actions and the enlargement of the EU, Estonian, Hungarian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Slovak, Slovene and Czech amongst the working languages established under Article 35 of the Court’s Rules of Procedure."
"Following on from the new division of jurisdictional powers between the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance set out by the Treaty of Nice, it is also appropriate to establish a rule for deciding on the working language of proceedings in the court, provided that the requesting party is an institution."
"As for the similar proposal for the ECJ, the rapporteur and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market consider that the proposal ‘would seem properly founded and is the logical consequence of enlargement of the Union."
"It can therefore be approved without amendment(explanatory statement)’."
"Our statement on the new linguistic arrangements in the ECJ holds true on this matter too and we consequently voted in favour."
". With the accession of the new Member States, Estonian, Hungarian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Slovak, Slovene and Czech will become official languages of the European Union."
"The draft Council decision on which the European Parliament is being consulted seeks, therefore, to add these languages to the list contained in Article 29(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice."
"Because I have always fought for multilingualism in every aspect of the process of European integration, I have called for it to be accorded equal treatment in Community actions and institutions and for its equal dignity and use to be recognised."
"I could only vote in favour."
". At times, substantial issues can be resolved in a single paragraph and this report is a case in point."
"Its aim is to include, as a consequence of EU enlargement to encompass ten countries from Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean on 1 May, the nine official languages of these countries – if not they are not already used – as working languages of the Court of First Instance."
"Confirming and effectively implementing the principle of establishing all the languages of the European Union as official and working languages – as enshrined in the Treaties – is all the more important because, in the current context, we are seeing trends for the real and increasingly obvious dominance of some languages – those of the most populous countries – the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Spain, Italy – to the detriment of the languages of the other countries that are members of the European Union."
"We should, therefore, always give consideration to protecting the language of each EU Member State."
". With the accession of the new Member States, Estonian, Hungarian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Slovak, Slovene and Czech will become official languages of the European Union."
"The draft Council decision on which the European Parliament is being consulted seeks, therefore, to add these languages to the list contained in Article 29(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice."
"According to the rapporteur and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, ‘the proposal is properly founded and is the logical consequence of enlargement of the Union."
"It can therefore be approved without amendment’ (explanatory statement)."
"We also share this view, because it implies support for the fundamental principle of preserving the languages of the Member States as official languages of the Union."
"This is the type of development that will ensure equality between Member States, which is a key value for preserving the European Union as an area of freedom and diversity."
". The draft Council decision seeks to include, with a view to the new division of jurisdiction in direct actions and the enlargement of the Union, Estonian, Hungarian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Slovak, Slovene and Czech amongst the working languages established by Article 35 of the Court’s Rules of Procedure."
"Following on from the new division of jurisdiction in direct actions between the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance set out by the Treaty of Nice, it is also appropriate to establish a rule to decide on the court’s language of proceedings, provided that the requesting party is an institution."
"I voted in favour."
". This proposal is part of an ongoing review of the legislation to prevent and combat future outbreaks of Foot-and-Mouth Disease and Classical Swine Fever."
"It updates Directive 90/426/EEC on the import of equidae and Directive 92/65/EEC on animal health requirements governing trade in imports into the Community of animals, semen, ova and embryos."
"It aims to rationalise, strengthen and update the legislation governing the importation into the Community of wild and domestic animals susceptible to either FMD or CSF."
"For the purposes of the Directive, ungulates are those animals listed in Annex I. Many of these species are not indigenous and are likely to be passing through the Community as part of circuses or zoo exchanges."
"To take account of this, I have added a clarification to include transit whenever importation is mentioned in the Directive."
"I welcome the flexibility provided for in the derogations."
"However, derogations should only be made on a case-by-case basis so the risk of importing diseases is not increased."
"Given the vital importance of proper information sources to facilitate a rapid response to any outbreak of a disease in the crucial early stages, I propose an amendment to Directive 90/426 on equidae which would arm us for such a coherent response by providing for the establishment of a Community Reference Laboratory for equine diseases."
"Effective coordination requires a reliable and comprehensive store of knowledge on diagnosis and treatment of infectious equine diseases."
". The recent outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) and classical swine fever (CSF) have prompted a thorough review of Community measures to prevent and combat these diseases, as part of the response to possible future outbreaks."
"This proposal for a directive from the Commission seeks to strengthen and update the legislation governing the importation into the Community of wild and domestic animals susceptible to either FMD or CSF and, therefore, warrants our agreement in principle."
"The proposal consolidates, in a single legal act, the requirements in the field of animal health for importing live ungulate animals and provides for a list to be laid down of third countries from which Member States may import such animals as well as the health requirements to be met."
"We have no objections to the amendments that the rapporteur has tabled and therefore voted in favour."
". The aim of the proposal for a directive before us is to lay down animal health rules for the importation into the Community of certain live ungulate animals, in other words, hoofed mammals."
"The outbreaks of diseases in the European Union in recent years, in particular foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) and classical swine fever (CSF), have prompted a thorough review of the Community measures to prevent and combat these diseases."
"As part of the response to possible future outbreaks, the Commission proposes to streamline, strengthen and update the legislation governing the importation into the Community of wild and domestic animals of species at risk either of FMD or CSF."
"By consolidating into one single act the rules governing imports of both wild and domestic ungulate animals, this proposal for a directive meets the food safety expectations of European consumers, thereby moving a step closer to the high level of health protection in the EU that we wish to see."
". This proposal for a regulation is intended to be a vital tool in implementing Article 104 of the Treaty – under the excessive deficit procedure."
"It seeks to establish a requirement that Member States must provide data on government debt (Maastricht government debt) on a quarterly basis, forming part of a general trend of switching towards quarterly compilation of statistical data, although the formal excessive deficit procedure will continue to be based on annual statistics."
"According to the rapporteur, this will enable the budgetary situation of Member States to be monitored more closely, emerging budgetary problems to be pinpointed earlier and a better understanding to be gained of the impact of efforts made by Member States."
"The rapporteur could not have made herself clearer."
"Here is a further example of a policy – in this case the Stability Pact – that requires an accurate statistical instrument."
"Nevertheless, yet again, a statistical amendment has had a significant political impact, thereby increasing peer pressure on a Member State that has strayed from the aims of budgetary consolidation set out in its stability programme, and from fulfilling the aims of the Stability Pact."
"The major concern over this instrument is, therefore, political, especially with regard to its purpose."
"This is much more important than other concerns over the costs of compiling the statistics, of complying with the annual indicator or of having to compile statistics retroactively."
"The radical Members abstained in the vote on the Lehne report concerning the request for defence of the immunity of Mr Pannella because, even though we do not question the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market’s statement of its opinion, we believe that we should not be complacent about the need to affirm at every appropriate stage, Parliament’s prerogatives vis-à-vis Member States."
"Indeed, it seems neither appropriate nor useful to be able to take action to limit the personal freedom of a Member of the European Parliament, even if on the basis of a judgment that has the force of without Parliament being informed of this and thus being able, if necessary, to take the necessary steps to express its opinion on reviewing the limits on its Members’ prerogatives."
"Although in this case Parliament’s decision might appear to be justified – and we must also consider that the measures to restrict Mr Pannella’s freedom have meanwhile been dropped – we must not in any way interpret this as a precedent, should a similar case arise in the future."
". Every year in the EU, some five million people have accidents at work, leading to absences of more than three days, and this amounts to 146 million working days lost."
"Some of these accidents have lasting consequences and affect both the victim’s ability to work and his or her life outside work."
"I therefore welcome Mr Perez Alvarez’s report, which illustrates the importance of adopting this directive aimed at raising health and safety standards."
"In spite of the introduction, in the Council common position, of amendments approved at first reading by Parliament, certain elements still need to be strengthened:"
"- preventive measures must be established to reduce risk."
"Employers must determine and assess risks and inform the workers of these risks."
"The participation, consultation and training of workers must also be encouraged."
"- where exposure above the limit values is detected, workers must have the right to a medical examination and to access their health records."
"Should workers’ health be adversely affected as a result of such exposure, the employer must take steps to reassess the risks."
"- this directive must provide dissuasive sanctions to be applied by the Member States in the event of infringement of national legislation."
"In order to make Europe a better place in which to work, this directive must be adopted without delay."
". The Council common position lays down exposure limit values on the basis of the biological health effects."
"The possible long-term adverse effects of exposure are not being taken into account, because the scientific data are not beyond challenge."
"The common position also sets action values, measurable parameters which, if observed, will ensure that exposure limit values are not exceeded."
"In addition, it sets out preventive measures to reduce the risks to which workers are exposed."
"These rest primarily on the obligation incumbent on employers to determine and assess risks."
"The common position likewise makes provision for workers to be informed and trained."
"On the whole the common position allows for the main aims and for a number of amendments adopted by Parliament at first reading, while some aspects fall short of what is required."
"The rapporteur therefore considers that it would be desirable to reinstate the right to a medical examination in the event of overexposure and to strengthen the prevention system set up by the directive."
"This directive must also contain a provision relating to the penalties to be enforced under national legislation pursuant to the directive."
". I welcome this proposal for a directive, which falls under the heading of measures to improve the working environment and is intended to protect the health and safety of each worker individually as well as to form part of a bedrock of minimum protection designed to avert possible distortions of competition."
"The ‘more and better jobs’ element of the Lisbon Strategy requires the EU to draw up and establish stringent demands with regard to the quality of working conditions across EU territory, which entails improving the dignity of labour and the quality of life of our citizens."
"Lastly, as I said in my explanation of vote on Mr Gargani’s report, on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to carcinogens and mutagens at work (2 September 2003), we must eliminate dangers that are so often hidden, such as those addressed in this report."
"In other words, prevention is much better than cure and is, similarly, much better than compensation."
"I therefore endorse Mr Alvarez’s final suggestion, which states that it would be desirable to reinstate the right to a medical examination in the event of overexposure – as proposed by Parliament – and to strengthen the prevention system set up by the directive."
". The task of achieving equality between men and women is a vital one for the EU, which has an obligation to be proactive in promoting all actions to this end."
"This excellent report seeks to establish a Community action programme to promote organisations active at European level in the field of equality between men and women."
"This programme for the period 2004-2005 will have at its disposal some EUR 2.2 million to support such organisations by means of operating grants."
"The activities of these organisations will make it possible to carry out:"
"– awareness-raising activities and dissemination of information,"
"– actions to promote the reconciliation of private and professional life, and the participation of women in decision-making processes; as well as actions to combat violence against women, gender stereotyping and discrimination in the workplace,"
"– and, lastly, measures to encourage cooperation with women’s organisations in third countries and to raise awareness of women’s issues around the world."
"I voted in favour of this recommendation for second reading, which is the fruit of a compromise between the Council and Parliament."
"This provides, on an exceptional basis, for transitional clauses concerning the period of eligibility of expenditure to be introduced in this programme."
". The purpose of this proposal is to establish a basic act for operating grants to be awarded to the European Women’s Lobby and to other organisations active at European level in the field of equality."
"This act is necessary to ensure compliance with the current Financial Regulation applicable to the EU’s general budget."
"The following will thus receive support:"
"Part 1 – the European Women’s Lobby;"
"Part 2 – the ongoing activities of an organisation pursuing an objective of general European interest in the field of gender equality or an objective forming part of EU policy in this area;"
"Part 3 – any specific actions."
"The Council accepted various proposals by Parliament, but rejected the proposal to extend the deadline for the 2004-2005 programme until 2008 and to increase the budget from EUR 2.222 million to EUR 5.5 million."
"The budget for 2004-2005 remained at EUR 2.2 million and the request to specify more clearly the activities of the lobby to be supported, replacing ‘etc’ with ‘gender mainstreaming in the areas of education, sport, health and social security’ and ‘cooperation with women’s associations from third countries’ was not granted."
"This is something that we regret."
"The rapporteur proposes that the common position be approved, with just one additional article on the ‘transitional clauses’, already agreed with the Council."
". It is certainly laudable to create a Community action programme to promote organisations active at European level in the field of equality between men and women."
"This is all the more important because of the mechanisms of exclusivity that have led to situations of privilege and discrimination in favour of women’s organisations associated with the European Women’s Lobby."
"Such mechanisms violate human rights and run counter to the basic principles of free and pluralistic social organisation."
"At first reading, the rapporteur’s proposals sought to redress this imbalance, but the leftist dogma of the committee concerned saw to it that, once again, unequal treatment and opportunities in favour of women’s organisations prevailed."
"Quite apart from the concerns surrounding this injustice itself, it is grotesque that this situation has been brought about by a committee whose very is to defend women’s rights and equal opportunities."
"The Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities should have a duty to provide a voice and a clear vision for the majority of women, for diversity and a plurality of opinions and interests."
"The second reading managed to avoid watering down the initial proposals and to prevent a disastrous and unjust outcome."
"There is hope, therefore, of a real improvement in the situation."
". The overall aim of EU policy on development cooperation should be to combat poverty and to eradicate it once and for all."
"In order to combat poverty effectively – in addition to combating neo-liberalism – equal opportunities between men and women must be established, and women must also play a more active role in the field of politics."
"At the 4th World Conference on Women, which took place in Beijing in 1995, a clear agenda was drawn up, aimed at promoting equal rights between men and women, for the first time."
"This led the EU to draw up Council Regulation (EC) No 2836/98 on integrating gender issues in development cooperation."
"In 2001, an action programme on the mainstreaming of gender equality was adopted in Community development cooperation, which expires in 2006."
"Regulation (EC) No 2836/98 is the legal base for budget heading B7-6220 (21.02.06) on Integrating Gender issues in Development Cooperation."
"Having expired on 31 December 2003, it must be replaced by the proposal before us."
"As joint legislator, Parliament must state that the Commission was very late in tabling the proposal for a new regulation."
"The Commission accepted the overwhelming majority of Parliament’s amendments, but ..."
". As I stated at first reading, measures must be funded in the area of development cooperation to combat poverty and disease and to develop solutions for education, within a culture of safeguarding basic human rights."
"I am, of course, unreservedly in favour of adopting measures that may contribute towards implementing the aims of helping the poorest people."
"At first reading, I voted in favour of the report, because I was convinced that the rapporteur’s suggestions would help to fulfil these objectives."
"Given that 20 of the 21 amendments tabled by Parliament were accepted by the Council and the Commission, I support this report."
"I should like to pinpoint one concern, which I fear has not been properly addressed, and that is the definition of ‘sexual and reproductive health’."
"This is a legitimate concern, but it must not be twisted, and turned into a catch-all term covering the development of international programmes to promote abortion, which I would condemn in the strongest terms."
"It must be specified that the term ‘sexual and reproductive health’ refers to the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, and to the provision of decent conditions for pregnancy, labour, childbirth and post-natal care."
". I do not have any objections to the rapporteur’s amendments to the Council common position."
"In light of the succession of food crises and of factors in food contamination, such as the presence of dioxins, regulatory frameworks must be created to enhance food safety, of which the hygiene of food for human consumption is an essential component."
"The ‘farm-to-table’ principle should be the central theme of the proposed regulation."
"A range of measures should be created for the hygiene of all food products in circulation in the Community, including imported goods, along with measures to increase the responsibility of food business operators."
"While regulations should aim towards equal application across all Member States, there must be some degree of flexibility to take account of local variations."
"Lastly, I should like to express my agreement with Amendment No 6, which is intended to ensure that the Commission does not have the general power to amend Annexes I and II, adopted under codecision by Parliament and the Council."
". Given the importance of ensuring the protection and conservation of the diversity of high-quality traditional and regional foodstuffs, it is only fair to small farmers and producers of small quantities of primary products that Amendment No 3 of this report should be adopted."
"Accordingly, hygiene rules must not compromise ‘traditional production methods or raw materials, which can be proven on the basis of scientific findings, established practice or tradition, to form part of the manufacturing process and not to compromise the hygienic quality of foodstuffs’."
"Member States must, therefore, in conjunction with the Commission, be allowed to adopt amendments to the provisions in Annexes II and III, to accommodate the needs of food businesses situated in regions that are subject to special constraints."
"This is true of Portuguese cheeses, such as cheese from the Serra da Estrela, given that changes in production conditions may adversely affect the flavour and quality of the product."
"Nor do we have any objections to the remaining amendments, which seek, as the rapporteur states, to clarify the structure of this legislative text."
"As the rapporteur himself says, this proposal for a regulation is an integral part of the overall endeavour to improve food safety within the EU, product quality in third countries exporting to the EU and Community legislation in the area, in this case concerning products of animal origin."
"The central figure in the proposed system of official controls is the official veterinarian, who should be provided with both the legal and the technical means to carry out his duties, and this entails public funding."
"Foot-and-mouth disease is a good example of the lack of investment in the area of food product inspections."
"I should like to express my agreement with Amendment No 2, aimed at removing from the scope of the regulation the primary production of foodstuffs for private domestic use and the direct supply by the producer of small quantities of primary products to the final consumer or to local shops and restaurants, which are to be subject to national rules."
"I also endorse the special treatment accorded to ‘artisanal small businesses’ producing exclusively for a limited local market."
"I also agree with the inclusion, with respect to fishery products, of products derived from aquaculture, without which fishery product controls would be incomplete."
". The four reports by Mr Schnellhardt adopted today deal with the various aspects of ensuring proper hygiene in the production of foodstuffs as well as rigorous checks and controls."
"I fully support the objectives of this regulation."
"It is essential that we as regulators ensure a high degree of protection for human life and health."
"I believe that the farm-to-table principle has now become a core principle which underpins all regulation in the food and feed area."
"In the life of the current Parliament we have agreed a whole new regulatory environment for the sector, and that is something of which this House, and of course Commissioner Byrne, can be justly proud."
"I certainly hope that the end result of all this legislation is to increase the responsibility of food business operators both in primary production and in subsequent stages of production."
"In conclusion, our overriding aim in all of this must be to decide on the policy that best protects our consumers."
"We have an obligation as legislators to create a legal framework that bolsters the confidence of our consumers in the food they buy and eat."
". These four recommendations for a second reading on food hygiene and the organisation of official controls form part of a process of legislative reform – the current system is spread across 17 directives, some of which date from 1964 – and adhere to the principle that producers are entirely responsible for the foodstuffs that they produce."
"The intention is, therefore, to enforce hygiene rules at all stages, from the farm to the table."
"The new legislative package is based on the HACCP system (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point)."
"I agree with the rapporteur that primary production for private domestic use and the direct supply of small quantities of primary products to the final consumer or to local shops and restaurants should not be subject to the same rules as large-scale production."
"I also endorse his suggestion that account should be taken of traditional production methods."
"The creation of the concept of ‘artisanal small business’ is also a positive step in this regard."
"I voted in favour of these recommendations."
". The Transparency Directive is one of those needed to complete the financial services action plan, which aims to establish an internal market for financial services in 2005."
"The last Spring Council notified Parliament of its wish to complete this process before the forthcoming European elections."
"Our opposition to this process, which forms part of the Lisbon Strategy, revolves not solely around federalist issues relating to legislative harmonisation and to the effective loss of sovereignty over monitoring financial services markets and those operating in these markets, it is also based on economic considerations, given that the unchecked movement of capital and the speculative nature of a market focused on the short term and on accruing capital gains are responsible for increased volatility and for the likelihood of financial crises, which affect economic growth and jobs."
"The issue of information made available to investors is crucial, not in order to appease investors, but to ensure transparency and truth, which were both absent from the recent financial scandals involving Enron and Worldcom, along with Parmalat in Europe."
"While we are purporting to protect small investors and small undertakings, efforts are being made to deregulate and reduce the cost of capital for, of course, the large multinational corporations."
"The June Movement has voted in favour of Amendment No 39."
"We did not want to see the clause on education removed but, in our judgment, the ability of the Member States to take further steps is a consideration that must weigh more heavily than our position that the EU must not interfere in issues of education."
". This proposal for a directive is based on Article 13 of the Treaty, which authorises the EU to take action to combat discrimination, in this case discrimination based on sex."
"We have waited for a long time to adopt a directive on promoting equality between the sexes in areas other than work."
"Discrimination based on sex is rife in the access to and supply of goods and services, both in the public and private sectors."
"This proposal for a directive provides for prohibiting the use of gender as a factor in calculating insurance premiums and other financial services."
"In the insurance sector, the ‘gender’ factor is used arbitrarily for calculating risk, simply because it is a quick and cheap method."
"There is a further form of discrimination that must stop: women should not be penalised because they live longer, and certainly not because they have children and look after them."
"The insurance sector must adapt its methods of calculating premiums to the principle of equal treatment and those calculations must be based on strictly objective criteria."
"I consequently voted in favour of this proposal for a directive."
"By voting in favour of this report, I want to emphasise the need for a directive – based on Article 13 of the EC Treaty – on the equality of women and men in areas other than employment."
"Vigilance does, however, remain appropriate, and fighting for genuine equality, actual equality between women and men in all areas of economic, social and political life, is a constant battle that must be continued."
"I will take the example of the scope of the directive."
"Following significant misgivings and strong resistance on the part of several interest groups, in particular the media sector, the scope of this directive has been ‘watered down’ to only now cover access to, and supply of, goods and services, thus leaving aside other areas such as media and advertising content, education and the decision-making process."
"At any rate, this proposal must be welcomed as a logical and necessary step towards implementing a policy that will enable sexual discrimination to be fully combated and equality in areas other than employment to be guaranteed."
". This is an important report dealing with the issue of gender equality regarding access to, and supply of, services."
"I agree with the Commission proposal as to the scope of the Directive."
"While social protection, social security and social advantages are important areas, they cannot be considered 'services' and are best dealt with elsewhere."
"I welcome the general thrust of the proposal and share the aims which underpin it."
"I believe that it will serve to reinforce values and norms which are already well established in many Member States."
"Ireland, for example, adopted the 'Equal Status Act' in 2000, and our legislation outlaws direct and indirect discrimination, including discrimination on grounds of gender, marital status and family status."
"This applies not only to the workplace and job market but also to access to, and supply of, goods and services."
"In general the EU has made a very positive contribution to establishing gender equality right across a range of areas."
"This is something that should be highlighted, particularly at election time."
"There is too much criticism of EU regulation and the onus is on us legislators to demonstrate the host of valuable measures that have originated here which improve the status and condition of women."
". I should like to congratulate Mrs Prets on her report on the proposal for a Council directive implementing the principle of equal treatment between women and men in the access to and supply of goods and services."
"I support this report, especially as to the adoption of a proactive approach, in line with the approach already adopted in the Treaty."
"Equality between men and women, which is a core value of European civil society, is a right that belongs to all European citizens."
"It is therefore incumbent on EU institutions to protect that right in all fields."
"We therefore urge the Commission to submit new proposals aimed at effectively combating discrimination based on sex and at ensuring genuine equality in areas other than work."
". This directive on equal treatment between men and women in the access to and supply of goods and services has been in the pipeline for a long time – it was first included on the Commission’s social policy agenda in June 2000."
"It is worth stating that, fortunately, equality between men and women is, today, a reality that is legally enshrined and widely enjoyed, apart from a few specific problems that still need to be ironed out."
"The aim of the proposal before us is to combat discrimination in areas such as private pensions and insurance."
"Recent studies have shown that insurance companies calculate premiums differently according to sex."
"With types of cover in which greater life expectancy works against the interests of the insurers, women are penalised for living longer."
"Car insurance, however, functions in exactly the opposite way, as statistics show that women have fewer accidents."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the use of gender – a factor that is beyond the control of individuals – as a criterion for calculation is wrong and, since it does not stand up to objective scrutiny, constitutes discrimination."
"I abstained from the final vote, however, as I feel that many aspects have not been given due consideration and that the vote in plenary on the amendments did not enable ..."
"Mr President, the long-distance transport of live animals is a barbaric practice, and it should stop."
"Every year, three million animals are still being transported within Europe and to third countries."
"If animals are to be slaughtered, this should be done as close to their place of rearing and fattening as possible."
"Animals are not commodities that can simply be transported; meat, on the other hand, is a product, and it be."
"The transport of animals that are not intended for slaughter must meet all animal welfare rules."
"Although it may be necessary to provide for exemptions in sparsely populated and remote areas, the transport of slaughter animals over long distances must be banned."
"Subsidies for transport of this kind, which currently still amount to EUR 60 million per annum, must be abolished."
"Mr Maat's report is a praiseworthy attempt to regulate transport more effectively, but it fails to accommodate our principles and our expectations."
"Despite the efforts by Mr Maat, a Member of the European Parliament, to improve the Council position, I feel that the rejection of almost all of the amendments seeking to further strengthen the protection of animals during transportation justified my vote against the report."
"Unfortunately, we have not achieved what I feel is correct and respectful transportation of animals."
". I abstained in the vote on the proposal for a regulation on the protection of animals during transport because of the lack of integrity in the overall report."
"On the one hand, I feel it was politically motivated rather than scientifically based."
"It is unacceptable to legislate on the basis of making science fit regulation."
"The welfare of our animals deserves regulation that is based on best scientific practice."
"On the other hand, it has to be questionable whether a nine-hour cap on the transport of animals is legally possible in the single market."
". I voted against the Maat report because it does not do enough to protect the welfare of animals."
"It is a disgrace that animals are transported alive to be slaughtered."
"Even if this is to happen journeys must be a maximum of eight hours and then it must be in properly maintained vehicles, with food and water."
"This report as voted is a bitter disappointment, as is the Commission's original ill-prepared proposal."
". This regulation concerns animal welfare, but is underpinned by various economic and national interests, with the meat sector generating many millions of euros, and the Commission’s apparent confusion and the changes in legislation are symptomatic of this."
"Compulsory unloading for rest causes the animals stress and can spread diseases, such as foot-and-mouth."
"Long journeys for animals must be reduced as far as possible, especially for transport to the slaughterhouse, for veterinary and animal welfare reasons, on the one hand, and for reasons of economic development, on the other."
"It makes no sense to export or import live animals for slaughter, when the meat or the carcass could be exported, which would ensure that much of the added value would stay in the region in which they were reared, thereby generating jobs and improving product quality."
"This policy has been undermined, both by the systematic closure of local slaughterhouses and their replacement by larger, centralised facilities, and by the lack of support for mobile abattoirs."
"Travelling times to the slaughterhouse must be reduced as far as possible and international transport for slaughter must be banned completely."
"We must also implement a harmonised framework, with travelling time limits for transporting animals for other purposes."
"We are not satisfied with the report before us."
". I voted against the Maat report and the majority of the amendments because I am against any excessive regulation that only spurs on the bureaucrats."
"The road to hell is paved with good intentions."
". Farm animals bred for human consumption have become the victim of the introduction of cheap, long-distance lorry transport."
"Before fattening or slaughtering, injured, starving and dehydrated animals are transported from one country to another."
"For years, such abuses were hardly open for discussion in this Parliament, despite the petitions that have been submitted about them."
"It is a step forward that a regulation is now being accepted in which requirements are stipulated for the means of transport, duration of transport and treatment."
"An upper limit of eight hours or 500 kilometres is backed as a standard by tens of thousands of signatures in the Netherlands, but, to many in North-Western Europe, myself included, it does not go far enough."
"There are, however, organisations of those with economic interests that consider such standards to create too much work and expense."
"This opinion is held not only by those on the Right, but also, unfortunately, those on the Left, in southern Europe, where national public opinion is not yet geared towards priority to better animal welfare."
"Animal welfare organisations have a long way to go in order to convince the public and politicians over there."
"My party, the Dutch Socialist Party, takes the view that economic benefit should be secondary to more important things, such as the decent treatment of animals."
"I support all amendments which provide for the most far-reaching protection, even if today, regrettably, they do not yet receive a majority."
". The MEPs of the VVD, the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy, have voted in favour of the Maat report, even though the amendments that it regards as essential have only partly been adopted in the compromises."
"We are of the opinion, though, that not only travelling times are determining factors in the quality of animal transport."
"The quality of transport conditions is vital."
"Longer transport times for slaughter animals must be possible if the quality of transport allows for this."
"Certified hauliers must be given this option."
"This position is partly reflected in Amendments Nos 64 and 81."
"I voted in favour of the Bösch report on the protection of the financial interests of the Communities because it makes a useful contribution to the fight against fraud at European level."
"The report also shows that there is still a lot to do."
"In 1999, the Commission came into office promising a policy of zero tolerance as regards fraud and corruption, but today it is bequeathing to its successors half-suppressed scandals (Eurostat) and ‘an unprecedented welter of sometimes contradictory rules and newly established units and bodies, making turf wars and mutual buck-passing inevitable’ (paragraph 2)."
"This is why I added my name to the proposed motion of censure on this matter which will, I hope, be put to the vote at the next part-session."
"Moreover, the Bösch report points out the extraordinarily high number of live cattle exported in 2002 to Lebanon (121 027 tonnes) that benefited from financial export refunds."
"Of course, all that smacks of fraud."
"This is an opportunity to draw attention to the fact that export refunds have helped cause unfair criticism to be heaped onto the entire common agricultural policy, and that this rotten branch really should be cut off to save the rest."
". The Commission has asked for 50% more money for the budget, but the richest Member States want to restrict expenditure to 1% of GNP."
"Some of the money needed for solidarity with the poorest regions within the current EU and the future enlargement regions can be found by actually putting a stop to persistent fraud."
"The Commission's annual report for 2002 reports irregularities and fraud cases amounting to EUR 2.12 billion, only EUR 80.6 million of which could be claimed back."
"In that selfsame year, OLAF, the anti-fraud office, completed 652 inquiries, involving a total loss of EUR 937 million."
"The Eurostat fraud has been excluded from these inquiries, and the Commission has not learnt from past experience that it is preferable for the responsibility for budget and accounts on the one hand and financial inspection and fraud control on the other hand not to be in the hands of one and the same Commissioner."
"Deceit is probably involved in the enormous subsidies – to the tune of EUR 52 million – paid for the export of live cattle to Lebanon."
"OLAF is accusing journalists of having paid money in order to be able to publish secret fraud information, but cannot substantiate these accusations."
"External advisory offices, in which former officials are involved, have received EUR 115 million."
"Consequently, the theme of the 2004 elections will once again have to be the fight against the European Fraud Union."
". This annual report follows up Article 280 of the Treaty, relating to the policy of preventing and fighting fraud in the EU."
"Firstly, it is regrettable that the Eurostat affair was not included, which highlighted the risks inherent in the Commission’s outsourcing policy and the fact that outsourcing should only be used as a last resort."
"Secondly, the report shows that the number of cases of fraud and irregularities reported in 2002 has risen by 13% to over EUR two billion, most of these under the Structural Funds."
"It should be noted that the year in question was an unusual year due to the conclusion of the programmes for the period 1994-1999."
"Germany and the Netherlands accounted for almost two-thirds of irregularities, and for 55% of fraud and irregularities in traditional own resources, namely unpaid customs duties and unpaid duties on goods moving within the EU."
"It is therefore essential that we implement measures effectively to coordinate the fight against smuggling, particularly of tobacco and alcohol."
"Lastly, I agree with the rapporteur on the need for a Commissioner to be exclusively responsible for budgetary control and that the European Central Bank should report all cases of fraud since 1999 to OLAF."
"That concludes the explanations of vote(1)."
"(2)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the joint initiative for peace, stability and democracy throughout the Middle East."
". Mr President, as we meet to discuss the situation throughout the Middle East today, tensions in the region are high – and understandably so."
"The killing of the Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and seven other Palestinians by Israeli forces last week has resulted in outrage across the region."
"The European Union condemned this extrajudicial killing as contrary to international law."
"In an already inflamed situation, it is vital that all sides exercise restraint and refrain from acts of violence which will only lead to more deaths and which will put a peaceful settlement further beyond reach."
"Against this backdrop, the Arab League Summit scheduled for this week in Tunis has been cancelled."
"Now, more than ever before, there is a need for the countries of the region to choose the path of peace and to turn away from the path of violence and recrimination."
"There is a need for governments to show leadership for peace, and to turn away from the politics of the last atrocity, which serve no one’s interest."
"Elsewhere in the region, in Iraq the security situation remains a cause of grave concern."
"It is disturbing that recent attacks have aimed at maximising civilian casualties and have been intended to promote sectarian violence."
"A secure, democratic and peaceful Iraq, within its present borders, can exert a positive influence for peace and stability across the entire region."
"The European Union looks forward to the transition to a representative Iraqi administration and is committed to working with the people of Iraq in securing a peaceful and stable future for that country."
"There is a pressing need for action to address the various problems and challenges to peace and prosperity throughout the Middle East."
"I believe that the European Union is ideally placed to make a contribution in support of this objective."
"Historically, the European Union has enjoyed a close relationship with the countries of the southern Mediterranean and the Middle East, built up through centuries of intertwined history, commerce and exchange."
"We are not strangers to each other."
"Indeed, through Euromed and the Barcelona Process, the Union has enjoyed a structured relationship with countries of the southern and eastern Mediterranean for ten years."
"The Barcelona framework is comprehensive in scope – covering political, economic, social and security issues of mutual interest."
"It commits us to working towards a shared zone of peace, prosperity and progress."
"In the economic sphere we are working towards the establishment of a free trade zone with a market of 700 million people by 2010."
"The possibilities offered by this vast market will lead to a growth in employment, prosperity and stability right across the partnership."
"The Union has also concluded Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreements with all but one of the Euromed countries, and I hope that the negotiations with the remaining country will be concluded soon so that the grid of arrangements can be completed."
"I would urge all partners to expedite ratification of these agreements, which are an important instrument in developing economic relationships between the European Union and the Mediterranean countries."
"An important element of our engagement has also been to promote democracy, good governance and the rule of law."
"This is in line with the conclusions drawn by the 2002 UNDP Arab Human Development Report."
"Significant funding has already been made available by the Commission in support of programmes which promote these objectives."
"The Union has also developed a framework of cooperation and dialogue with the countries of the Gulf through the Gulf Cooperation Council."
"At present we are working with our partners in the GCC to achieve a free trade agreement."
"Although negotiations have been long, and at times difficult, they are now moving in the right direction."
"In addition we are considering ways to develop relationships with Yemen and Libya, and reflecting on our relationship with Iran."
"It is clear that the Union already has a deep and close relationship with the countries of the Mediterranean and the Middle East."
"It is one based on partnership and dialogue, and on a willingness to work together to address the challenges facing the region."
"It is also a relationship that is based on the recognition of the strategic importance which each represents to the other."
"We are their neighbours just as they are our neighbours, and it is in our shared interest to see a zone of security, prosperity and progress develop across the wider region."
"In recognition of the importance of the region to Europe, the European Union is currently working to develop a Strategic Partnership with the Middle East and the Mediterranean following a mandate from the European Council in December 2003."
"This is also a key objective of the European Security Strategy, again adopted in December 2003."
"Security and stability is a shared interest of the countries of the region and of the European Union."
"We need to do more to address the causes of instability which afflict the region – causes which include lack of economic development, under-developed educational opportunities and the need to promote open societies and economies."
"Our primary objective is to promote the development, through partnership, of a common zone of peace, prosperity and progress across the Mediterranean and into the Middle East."
"The goal is to enjoy close and cooperative relations with all the countries of the region, responding as far as possible to initiatives from within the region itself."
"Resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict is a strategic priority."
"However, reform in the region should not be conditional on progress in the Middle East Peace Process – or vice versa – but both objects should be pursued in tandem."
"This is the context that informed the adoption of the interim report presented to last week’s General Affairs and External Relations Council and endorsed by the European Council."
"The interim report proposes an EU Strategic Partnership with the Mediterranean and the Middle East."
"It sets out a series of shared understandings held by the members of the Union with regard to relations with the region, proposes key principles and objectives which might inform our strategic partnership and proposes these together with work programmes for the Mediterranean and the Gulf as a means to implement our partnership."
"It is also essential that the impetus for reform comes from within."
"There is already much being done, both at governmental level and by civil society."
"It is for the region itself to work out an appropriate way forward."
"Equally, there can be no 'one-size-fits-all' solution to the challenges facing the region."
"We are actively consulting with partners in the region who are our key interlocutors."
"This will be an essential element in preparing our final report for the European Council in June."
"In this spirit, the Taoiseach, Mr Ahern, in his capacity as President of the European Council, had planned to address the Arab League Summit in Tunis yesterday, as a further step in our intensified consultations with the region."
"But, as I have already noted, that meeting was cancelled."
"Foreign Minister Cowen is currently in the region, holding a series of meetings with key interlocutors."
"The presidency's commitment to consultation and dialogue remains absolute."
"We will continue this process at the forthcoming Euro-Mediterranean Partnership Mid-Term Ministerial Meeting to be held in Dublin and at the Ministerial Meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council."
"I have already commented on the need for progress in the Middle East Peace Process."
"There can be no long-term solution in the region without the resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict which has cost so many lives on all sides."
"Implementation of the Quartet Roadmap remains the basis for reaching a lasting comprehensive settlement resulting in two viable, sovereign and independent states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security."
"As members of the Quartet, we will continue to work towards this end."
"Acts of violence by either side cannot contribute to advancing the political process necessary to reach such a settlement, and such acts, therefore, must be rejected."
"The countries of the Mediterranean and the Middle East are facing a broad range of challenges politically, economically and socially."
"Equally, those countries possess enormous potential which, if fulfilled, would result in benefits for all the peoples of the region."
"Progress in all areas – economics, commerce, education, democracy and civil society – is essential if the conditions for lasting peace and stability across the region are to be achieved."
"The European Union is committed to working as good neighbours with the governments and peoples of the region towards this end, which is in all our shared interests."
". Mr President, may I first thank Parliament for making time for this debate."
"There are so many other things which Parliament has to discuss, but it is exceptionally important that today we should have a chance to discuss the Mediterranean and the Middle East because the directions we set for our policies in this region in the coming months should be thoroughly discussed and debated here; they involve fundamental decisions on how we are going to develop our relationship with our neighbours; and they involve fundamental decisions which will affect the whole relationship for the first part of this century between Europe and the Islamic world."
"My friend and colleague from the presidency has explained very clearly the principles in the interim report adopted by the Foreign Ministers of the European Union last week and he explained how, through a series of intensive consultations with the region, they will form the basis of a concrete work programme to be presented to the European Council in June."
"I would like, however, to underline that we are not starting from scratch: rather, we are building on a comprehensive partnership with the Mediterranean countries and a set of bilateral relations with the countries east of Jordan."
"We will continue to develop our partnership on the basis of these existing instruments."
"I would add here that Europe is the most significant player in the region."
"The Community now spends close to EUR 1 billion a year in the region in promoting economic reforms, sectoral reform, institutional and political reform and in supporting sustainable development across the region, including our specific funds for supporting the Palestinians and for the reconstruction of Iraq."
"If one adds in the lending from the European Investment Bank, it makes a total of around EUR 2.5 billion a year."
"Furthermore, the European Union is the biggest trading partner for every country in the region except Jordan."
"So with this level of involvement, why has economic development and political reform been so slow to take off around the Mediterranean?"
"Why is the human development gap still so great?"
"The answer is two-fold: first of all, our approach is a long-term one which bears fruit incrementally, but I would venture that working on the basis of partnership, consultation and ownership of the reform process by reformers in the region will give us more solid and sustainable results than any attempts to impose democracy from the outside, whether through lectures or through the barrel of a gun."
"But secondly, and crucially, it is important to remember that the Barcelona process was formulated in an atmosphere of optimism, in the aftermath of the Oslo agreements."
"Stalemate in the peace process in the Middle East has time and again stymied progress on reform."
"Recent events are another sad but powerful confirmation that, as our report put it, it will not be possible to build a common zone of peace, prosperity and progress unless a just and lasting settlement of the conflict is in place."
"Once again – and I am afraid I have had to say this all too often in speeches in this Chamber – we stand before the smoking ruins of the peace process."
"And this at a time when we had some hope of movement: the cancelled Arab League Summit was expected to provide a positive impetus to the peace process by relaunching its Beirut peace initiative."
"How, I wonder – and I expect this question comes to the minds of many honourable Members – has Sheikh Yassin's assassination helped to improve the security of the Israeli people?"
"How has it contributed to even the stated goal of a peaceful and consensual withdrawal from Gaza?"
"I thought, and I still hope, that we had already seen the worst of the atrocities carried out by suicide bombers."
"But what we have witnessed lately is wickedness beyond imagination: for example, a frightened adolescent, explosives strapped to his body, is told that he will go to heaven and is sent out to kill himself and others at a military checkpoint."
"It is despicable and it is cowardly."
"What kind of world have we created when 12-year-olds are out on murder missions like that rather than playing football or doing their homework?"
"And what are the circumstances?"
"What is the environment that creates this culture of death and murderous recrimination?"
"My broader point is that if we are serious about wanting reform in the Arab World then, as the European Security Strategy states, resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict remains a strategic priority."
"It is what philosophers would call a necessary but not sufficient condition."
"Progress cannot be a pre-condition for confronting the challenges of reform, nor vice versa."
"But to attempt one without the other is, in my view, only too likely to prove a recipe for failure on both counts."
"I regret, then, that the Arab League summit could not take place as planned, not least because it was expected to adopt a common declaration on domestic reform which would have been an important staging post in developing our common agenda."
"But working in this part of the world means, almost by definition, that one has to remain hopeful, so I hope that our Arab partners will be able to come together again soon."
"We are certainly prepared to do what we can to help."
"I also believe that we now have a European Union position which we can take into consultations with the region with some confidence of generating new momentum in our relations with our Mediterranean and Middle Eastern neighbours."
"Insofar as that is true, we are very grateful to the Irish presidency for the creative work it has done, both intellectually and diplomatically."
"I also hope that our friends across the Atlantic are recognising that our long-term, consensus-building approach has some value, based, as it is, on building common agendas that respect differences of approach in different countries and regions."
"The Greater Middle East initiative from the United States generated controversy in the region, mainly because the objectives appeared to have been set without any real consultation process with the region."
"In the furore surrounding this, few paid attention to the substance."
"In content, what they are suggesting could involve the development of American policy towards the region based on the kind of comprehensive and long-term engagement which we have been advocating and trying to implement for many years."
"We have much to talk about with officials in Washington if they are prepared to match this commitment with appropriate levels of resources."
"Time will tell, but whatever the results, the European Union should focus on developing its own strategic partnership with the region."
"If we are successful, I believe we can make a significant contribution to fighting terrorism in Europe and in the region, one that is as important as the proposals to strengthen the European Union's internal security that I know will be discussed by Parliament tomorrow."
"It will take us another step down the road towards a central objective of the EU’s Security Strategy, namely: 'to promote a ring of well-governed countries … on the borders of the Mediterranean with whom we can enjoy close and cooperative relations'."
"I make one final point which builds on what I have just said. We spent last Thursday and Friday in the Council discussing what this extraordinary circle of democracies in Europe can do to protect our way of life, our prosperity, our values, our belief in the rule of law and in civil liberties and the lives of our citizens; and what we can do in Europe to prevent more of the terrorist atrocities which have driven daggers into the hearts of many European families."
"There are many things we have to do internally."
"There are many things we have to do in the areas of police and judicial cooperation."
"I have no doubt whatsoever that one of the most important things we have to do is to work more energetically, more creatively, day and night, to try to bring peace to the Middle East."
"The conflict does not justify anything any terrorist ever does and a number of terrorists and those who support terrorists use the plight of Palestinians and use the position in the Middle East as a wicked justification for the misery and mayhem they create."
"That is true."
"It is also true that one should not appease terrorism."
"It is true that there are important security aspects involved."
"But we all recognise as well that to bring peace to the Middle East would remove one of the causes of alienation in country after country which helps to provide a breeding ground for terrorism and for the murderous ideas that terrorists espouse."
"So I hope that we will be able to work more enthusiastically and more successfully to bring peace to the Middle East, and that the beneficiaries of that peace will not only be the people of Israel and the people of Palestine, but the people of Europe and the wider world as well."
"It might be useful for me to point out to colleagues – as I did last week to the Conference of Presidents – that last week in Athens we successfully co-launched a partnership: the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly."
"Indeed, it builds precisely on the long-term perspective mentioned in the last two speeches."
"It is a partnership of 240 Members of Parliament: 120 from the partner states and the southern shore of the Mediterranean, 120 from the EU national parliaments and the European Parliament."
"We have still to fill in the personnel, but we have established the outline of the bureaux and the composition of three working committees which will prepare future parliamentary assembly work – a Political Affairs Committee, an Economic Affairs Committee and a Social Affairs and Cultural Exchange Committee."
"It is an important parliamentary aspect and a good platform to build on."
"Unfortunately, the timing was such that both of the speakers here today – the Council and the Commission – were tied up with the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Brussels preparing the summit meeting and were unable to participate."
"Both institutions acknowledged the launch of this Assembly and both wished it well."
"We need as a Parliament to ensure that future meetings are arranged at a time to enable the Council and the Commission to participate, because the parliamentary part is, and can be, an invaluable long-term development and communications platform."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, last Monday 22 March, there took place in Athens the inaugural session of this Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, of whose future importance in relations on both sides of the Mediterranean President Cox just reminded us."
"This session marked the culmination of the efforts made immediately after 11 September 2001 to reach, on both sides of the Mediterranean, a better mutual understanding and to dispel the spectre of war between civilisations, which is a potential consequence of the downward spiral of blood and vengeance into which the barbaric supporters of indiscriminate terrorism are attempting to drag us."
"Still reeling from the shock of the images of 11 March in Madrid, it was on the morning of 22 March that we learned, President Cox, of the assassination of Sheikh Yassin, with all the consequences this could have."
"This gave us another reason to reiterate, in the presence of the official delegations from Israel and Palestine, the urgent need to find a fair and lasting solution to the conflict in which they are embroiled and to emphasise how important it is for the European Council, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to launch that strategic partnership for a common future with the Middle East on the subject of which you have just addressed us."
"Let us be aware on our side of the Mediterranean that our future and that of our children and grandchildren will depend on the way in which we have been able to extend to Africa in general and to the Middle East in particular, that area of peace and stability that our founding fathers were able to establish on our continent."
"Let us therefore resolve to have more influence in the negotiations in progress within the Quartet, since we well know – as you said, Commissioner Patten – that Europe can and must now play a decisive role there."
"Whether or not we wanted it to be, the United States is considered, rightly or wrongly, to have taken Israel’s side."
"Russia does not have the same interests as ourselves, stemming from our geographical proximity to the region, and the United Nations does not have our means to act."
"If we Europeans were finally to speak with the powerful voice expected of us, there is no doubt it would be heard."
"I am sure that the will to do so exists in our Parliament, as this debate will once again prove, quite simply because it reflects the will of a very large majority of our fellow European citizens."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Commissioner, can we begin to hope that this will might finally manifest itself other than through pious wishes?"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is a grave hour at which we must work even harder to break the infernal spiral of violence in the Middle East."
"Although Sheikh Ahmed Yassin was not one of our best friends, his assassination is a clear and flagrant violation of international law."
"They could have arrested him and tried him."
"I would also point out that we have created an International Criminal Court which must have a role to play, although it is not supported by some States, including Israel."
"We roundly condemn the assassination of the Hamas leader and other Palestinians, on the direct orders of a government, the government of Israel."
"We also roundly condemn the murders and terrorist acts aimed against the civilian populations of both parties to the conflict and I believe we must appeal to the Palestinians not to respond with a murderous increase in terrorist acts and more bloodshed."
"This assassination has already had very grave consequences, including the suspension of the Arab League Summit."
"In this regard, I would like to express my agreement with the severe judgment of Shimon Peres in the Knesset when he said that this action would bring even more serious consequences."
"There must therefore be an end to this policy of continuing to build the wall within the occupied territories, of ordering extra-judicial executions and, furthermore, there must be a withdrawal from Gaza, to which the current Israeli Government has clearly committed itself."
"I would like to say on behalf of my group that the repeated violations of human rights, non-compliance with the latest United Nations resolutions on the part of the Israeli Government and, above all, Ariel Sharon’s insistence on renewing executions outside the framework of international law, will leave us with no other option than to reiterate the positions adopted by this House in its Resolution of 10 April 2002 and to call on the Commission and the Council to strictly apply the second article of our Association Agreement."
"We do not want to go that far, but we believe that we must issue a solemn and severe warning."
"In this regard, I would like to make three requests: the first is to urge Israeli civil society, that vibrant Israeli society, and all its political parties, while defending its right to its own security, to demand that its government act in accordance with international law."
"Secondly, I would call on the Presidency-in-Office of the Council to urge those Member States of the European Union which sit on the United Nations Security Council to immediately present a proposal to establish an international intervention force on the 1967 borders, with the mandate of protecting both sides."
"Thirdly, that the Commission continue with its aid, with the European Union’s aid, to assist the Palestinian National Authority to be strengthened and reformed, because a strong interlocutor is required if we are to argue that there must be a Palestinian State."
"I believe that the whole of this process must come within the framework of the proposals being made to resolve the problem of the Middle East."
"It is clear that in order to resolve such a bitter and profound conflict, it is better to propose peace than to begin new wars and increase the cycle of violence, above all in a situation in which the stability of those regimes which could contribute to supporting a process of reform is being broken."
"I therefore believe that we must restart and reinforce a process in which the European Union, the United States – which also has a serious responsibility – the Arab League and all the countries of the region can continue along the lines of the statement on a common future for the Middle East recently proposed by the German Foreign Affairs Minister, Mr Fischer, and in which the European Union, the region’s main partner, as the Commissioner has said quite rightly, could contribute many elements in relation to peace treaties, security, arms control, disarmament, respect for human rights and democracy and economic cooperation."
"I will end, Mr President, by saying that the European Parliament has done its bit with the creation, at last, of the Athens Parliamentary Assembly, and we have a duty, not only political but also moral, to continue the European Union's efforts in line with the Barcelona process in order to overcome such a bitter and profound crisis which calls on us to show political, economic and moral responsibility."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Patten, the nightmare in the Middle East seems never to end."
"Like everyone else, my group feels extremely frustrated and powerless at our not being able to do more to solve this bloody conflict that is the cause of so much suffering."
"In the last few days, we have been talking a lot about terrorism and, clearly, nothing would mean more in the fight against terrorism than peace in the Middle East."
"The situation there is the source of huge frustration and fanaticism, and it inculcates into young people a feeling of hopelessness and despair that creates a breeding ground for recruiting suicide bombers who are themselves also very young."
"Two states – recognised by one another, democratic and existing side by side – would naturally have an enormously positive effect on stability throughout the region."
"Plans, projects, conferences and new initiatives – it feels as though we have tried everything."
"There is no lack of creativity when it comes to the Middle East."
"We need no more initiatives."
"We need political will, a desire really to sit down, negotiate and achieve peace."
"Unfortunately, there is nothing to suggest that today’s leaders, whether in Israel or Palestine, have this will."
"The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party condemns the murder of Sheik Yassin."
"It was contrary to international law."
"Assassination may appear logical from a military point of view, but it is the worst of diplomatic means."
"Yassin had odious crimes on his conscience."
"He has never recognised Israel’s right to exist."
"In all respects, he was a loathsome terrorist."
"Nonetheless, we cannot accept this type of killing."
"It must be possible to make higher demands of a democratic state such as Israel."
"Hamas has now been given a new martyr and thousands of people burning with the desire for revenge."
"The Palestinian leadership must therefore show unprecedented strength and leadership in order to prevent a new spiral of violence."
"Arafat must emphasise that it is not Hamas that is setting the agenda."
"The ELDR Group cannot be too emphatic in its condemnation of the suicide bombers."
"This senseless killing of civilians, innocent children, women and men is paralysing the Israeli people and making the slightest errand or social excursion fraught with mortal danger."
"The fact that ever younger teenagers and children are now being recruited as suicide bombers is the most repellent form of terrorism of all and can never ever be explained or excused."
"Israel and Palestine must return to the negotiating table and to the Quartet’s Road Map."
"I wish to thank the President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Patten for their work to bring this about."
"We must obtain an end to the violence, and the Palestinian Authority must once and for all recognise Israel’s right to exist."
"For its part, Israel must stop building the Security Wall, which is condemned by the whole world."
"Walls can never be the solution."
"The previously promised and announced withdrawal from Gaza must also begin."
"Peace in the Middle East and a peaceful Iraq in which I hope that the UN can be given a greater role would be very great progress and would have huge significance for the process of reform throughout the region."
"If, in the way that has been sketched out in the proposal now adopted, we succeed in incorporating these countries into a close and extensive network of trade and cooperation, it would constitute huge progress for the EU."
"The collapse of the Arab League summit is tragic, but there is yet hope that reference will still be made to human rights and democracy, which are the places from which we have to begin."
"Finally, Mr President, I just want to raise another issue about which the ELDR Group feels uneasy, and that is the riots in Syria in which hundreds of Kurds have recently been killed."
"Many are imprisoned, and there are reports of members of this group being tortured following riots a week ago."
"I hope that the Council and the Commission can step up the pressure on Syria to put a stop to this killing."
"– There is no doubt – and it is an obvious thing to say – that the conflicts in the Middle East are becoming more tragic by the day."
"I truly believe, and I am not just copying what others have said, that we must have the courage to admit that much of the responsibility for these unresolved conflicts lies with the international community and, most of all, with the military policy of President Bush and anyone who has stood up for that policy alongside President Bush."
"We cannot evade this problem, and I agree with the President-in-Office of the Council and with Commissioner Patten, that the Palestine-Israel question is central and essential to it."
"I also think we should abandon our conformist position and stop saying that the Palestinians do not recognise the State of Israel: they recognised it in 1988."
"It is not true that the Palestinian Authority does not want to negotiate: it is continually saying that it is prepared to negotiate."
"The one who is rejecting negotiation, the one who really is following a different policy is Ariel Sharon."
"I believe we should assess the matter objectively."
"There is no doubt that the Palestinian Authority bears responsibility for its own inability to stop terrorist acts, but I also think we should clearly assess to what extent Ariel Sharon’s policy has brought on the growth in terrorism."
"Mr Patten is right: it does not mean that terrorist acts in themselves, irrespective of the policies that are being implemented, should be condemned and suppressed."
"Let us stop telling ourselves that they are all birds of a feather."
"There are differences, and these differences are the ban on and the failure to implement any international rights for the Palestinians."
"Let us now think about that great plan, rather than a working paper, that the United States has prepared for the G8 Summit in June."
"In fact it is an arrogant, imperialist project and, although it provides for the development of democracy, democratic processes, preambles, aid and support, it does so without any discussion with anybody."
"We cannot export democracy – apart from the fact that we should begin to think about our own democracies – since democracy is a continuous process in which we too are inadequate, in which we too sometimes have gaps and differences."
"As it has been put forward, the Greater Middle East initiative is a plan that will certainly not help the growth of democracy."
"It will probably help some accomplice or subservient regimes, but it will not contribute to the reconstruction of Arab countries that do in fact need to free themselves from oppressive regimes and really need democracy."
"Not with arrogance and imperialism, however, please!"
"I think the European Union’s decision to opt for the long term and not to aim for immediate results by cutting the Gordian knot of old is the right one."
"We therefore need time to reflect and to build relationships."
"In this sense, the Parliamentary Assembly organised in Athens is important: we have seen the differences and the diversity of the Arab world as well, and not just its weaknesses."
"I should like to return for a moment to Ariel Sharon’s policy."
"In 1973, when Winston Churchill’s grandson asked him what was to become of the Palestinians, he answered that there was no need to worry: ‘We’ll make a pastrami sandwich of them.’"
"He would crush them in a sandwich."
"That is what he is doing by building the wall and preventing freedom of movement."
"Sheikh Yassin’s assassination was not the first: there have been 250 extrajudicial executions, and the first victim was Tabet Tabet, an Al Fatah pacifist who was working with Peace Now."
"I sometimes get tired of repeating myself and feeling that everyone bears the same responsibility."
"There are various types of responsibility, and I think that, with this decision, Ariel Sharon did not just kill a leader, something that – for heaven’s sake – I as a woman regard as the utmost in evil, but his intention was in fact to transform a national conflict into a religious conflict."
"That is what is so terrible."
"Four days ago I was in the mountains of Kurdistan and saw demonstrations in Van for Sheikh Yassin."
"That is the risk we are running; that is what President Bush has done."
"Finally, I also agree with the proposals put forward by Mr Barón Crespo on Article 2 and the other items."
"Mr President, it is of course only right that the European Council should condemn Israel’s unlawful execution of the Hamas leader, Sheik Yassin."
"Why, as General Morillon said, are there, however, only words and pious wishes?"
"Why not back our words with action?"
"The EU has, of course, practical and unique opportunities to punish Israel through the Association Agreement."
"As early as May 2002, we considered, here in the European Parliament, that it was the last straw when it came to Israeli human rights violations, and we demanded then that the Association Agreement be suspended."
"Why does the Council not listen to Parliament?"
"Moreover, the European Commission has expressed itself along the same lines as Parliament."
"At the most recent meeting of the Association Council, the Commission produced a long list of Israel’s infringements of human rights and of UN decisions."
"At that time, the Commission warned that the EU would subsequently have to review its position if there were no improvement."
"Moreover, we are concerned here with trade policy pure and simple."
"In a memo aimed at all importers of Israeli goods to the EU, the Commission has observed that Israel is being fraudulent in identifying the origin of its goods, so that goods from illegal Jewish settlements on occupied Palestinian land are being sent to the EU with ‘Israel’ stated on the certificate of origin."
"Fraud of this kind, involving the rules of the trade agreement, is on its own enough to justify suspending the Association Agreement."
"Why all these words? Why no action?"
"What is more, we know that Israel has nuclear weapons and, according to the experts, probably still more weapons of mass destruction."
"Clearly, Israel is allowed to have them but, when others acquire them too, they are bombed back into the Stone Age."
"Why is action not taken against Israel?"
"How are we to have a peaceful world order, based upon law and justice, if tough punishment is meted out to certain lawbreakers – especially if they are Arab Muslims – while another lawbreaker, Israel, appears to be able to do whatever it likes, and all that occurs is that we repeat the same debate year after year after year without anything happening?"
"The least that can be asked is that we repeal and suspend the Association Agreement, just as the European Parliament has requested."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that what is currently happening in the Middle East is very different from what we might have thought until a few days ago."
"In fact, I believe that the Middle East is gradually getting closer and is even right on our doorstep."
"We can see this in speeches with which, in some cases, I could not disagree more, such as Mrs Morgantini’s speech, but not just hers."
"Indeed, I believe that the terrorist attacks that we are witnessing within Europe must be taken into account."
"We cannot suddenly just consider the issue of the murder of Sheikh Yassin."
"As a Catholic, I reject any idea of one day hitting someone: not killing them, but just hitting them."
"In my opinion, this is not, however, the point."
"I believe that if we want to guarantee our citizens peace, tranquillity and serenity in the future, we need to draw up a very different proposal and follow very different lines of thinking."
"Europe, as such, cannot just be a mouthpiece for a message in terms of European funding for the Middle East area."
"Europe must put forward a genuine and specific proposal."
"I believe that this can be done, and in this case I appeal to Commissioner Patten and the Irish Council Presidency to call for an end to the conflicts."
"I believe that this could once again give politics a real voice and not just an issue on which to speculate in this Chamber."
"For those who, like me, have experienced terrorism – a different type of terrorism, ‘red terrorism’ – and have seen a bomb in the house and a brother get out through a window, political words meant nothing at the time, in the eighties."
"The answer that we found – as a young person at the time – was unique and truly incredible: there was a unity in purpose to achieve a single objective: to combat terrorism."
"I believe that this can only be done if we, as Europe, are aware of this and at the very least now compile a list of terrorist associations to be assessed at an international level."
"I believe that everything else is just idle chitchat."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what the Council has told us does not, in my opinion, add much that is new to a European position which, beyond endlessly recited hollow phrases such as ‘Mediterranean cooperation with a view to peace and prosperity in the region’, is totally inconsistent."
"In reality, the Union plays no role at all in the Middle East, apart from as a provider of funds and, more often than not, one acting in the dark, too."
"Politically, we do nothing, however."
"We could, however, play a role if we left behind our European divisions, something that is no doubt impossible, and if we had the courage clearly to take a side."
"It is not a matter of taking one of the two obvious, and old, sides in the Middle East conflict, with the Israelis on the one hand and the Palestinians on the other."
"This debate is outdated."
"The choice we must make concerns the current real divide, which pits the moderates against the extremists on both sides."
"The United States does not make this choice."
"It even does the exact opposite and sides with the moderates and extremists by turns."
"Furthermore, it very often sides with the extremists, whether they be the fundamentalist Muslims or Israeli religious extremists."
"It does this in accordance with the interest it has in dividing the region in order to rule it better."
"Now, Europe’s interest lies specifically in reuniting the region in order better to make a success of the forms of Mediterranean cooperation that will make the Mediterranean what it always was, that is to say the geopolitical centre of the world."
"France’s policy is the exact opposite of that of the United States. France resolutely sides with moderate Palestinians and Israelis on both sides."
"This is why, alone in the face of the United States, it is the other major power present in the Middle East."
"Alas, apart from France, Europe is too divided, so that we are reduced to the feeble words we have just heard from the Council."
"It is a shame, but it is not surprising."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Patten, the European Union has, then, rediscovered its ‘sacred union’ by condemning the killing of Sheikh Yassin, and some have even presented him as a venerable old man and an almost saintly person."
"Today, in this Parliament, we have heard the party chairman Mr Barón Crespo authoritatively, and others I believe somewhat less authoritatively, remind us of the possibility of calling for Article 2 to be applied, that is to say the suspension of the Association Agreement with Israel because of the death of Sheikh Yassin."
"His death is certainly a violation of international legality; there is no doubt about it."
"The European Council dedicated five paragraphs to condemning Israel for this, but I do not recall having read anything in the text about employing handicapped children for just a few euros to turn them into human bombs with 10 kg of explosives."
"We Radical Members have called for the suspension of the Association Agreements – as Commissioner Patten knows only too well – under Article 2, which unfortunately we have never, or almost never, put into practice, for scores of countries, many of them also in the region."
"I believe that it is important not to lose sight of this fact."
"If we consider it right to condemn Israel, a democratic country – having awarded it, so to speak, the title of democratic country – which means we can expect it to respect international law, assuming, on the other hand, that it is pointless to ask for respect, for example, from the other Arab countries, we are making a huge mistake and we are continuing to rant on without having an effective role in the region."
"As regards the issue of the Greater Middle East, for example, it is true that the Americans have been over-ingenuous, putting forward this proposal without allowing it to be scrutinised and assessed perhaps more attentively and being put first and foremost to the governments of the Middle East."
"The idea in itself is a good one – not the idea of exporting democracy, which just makes the concept appear ridiculous and trivial, rather like the one that we too tried to develop, to some extent artificially, long before the US proposal, with the infamous Sana’a Conference on Democracy and Human Rights in the Middle East."
"Either we lay the foundations for political democracy or, as Europe, we go along with the American idea, independently, of course, but put forward a strong proposal in the months to come, in consultation with Arab countries, taking an approach that seeks to involve them – not just at a governmental level but also at a civil society level – in a solid and strong proposal to promote the kind of societies and democracy called for by these countries in order to achieve development, as the UNDP told us."
"This is, therefore, the way to resolve – or to include – the Israel-Palestine issue too in a more overall solution."
"To conclude, I applaud the fact that the major leaders of the European left finally recognise, as we have been saying for 30 years, that the accession of Israel and Palestine to the European Union is another important path towards reaching a lasting solution to the Middle East issue."
"– It is perfectly fine by me, Mr President, for me to be the first to keep exactly to his allotted time."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I do not think we should play the same narrow-minded game here at every sitting, raising again the supply of goods from the West Bank to the European Union."
"There is nothing wrong in discussing the matter, and last time we had a full debate about it."
"If those goods were supplied by the Palestinians, they would enjoy the same European Union preferences and it is therefore pointless to always encumber such a serious question as this conflict with such banalities."
"Secondly, everyone in this Parliament condemns the illegal executions that Israel is carrying out."
"They are incompatible with international law and there is no need at all to discuss the matter."
"It is good that we as a European Union are making that absolutely clear."
"Many Americans are also saying that it is wrong."
"That is why we should not always be setting France against the USA in the matter."
"Henry Kissinger, too, said that quite clearly at the weekend."
"What we must do, however, is something that demands rather more: we must now engage in dialogue with the Arab world."
"It is of course far from reassuring that the Arab summit has recently been cancelled, that it cannot take place because it has been impossible to agree on a declaration containing the words democracy, parliament and civil society and speaking of women’s rights and democratic reform."
"We must also be clearer in reminding our partners south of the Mediterranean of our fundamental convictions if we want to reach a comprehensive solution."
"Those who are normally always very vociferous about these things in this House should also be vociferous in addressing the Arab world about them."
"We do that with Israel."
"It is a democracy."
"We can expect a lot of it, and I believe we are right to do so."
"We should, however, develop a broader perspective on the Middle East."
"That also requires a dialogue with the Arab world about our fundamental principles."
"Otherwise, we will never find a solution."
"Mr President, the most detailed and in-depth analysis of the limits to the development of democracy in the Arab world and of its consequences on development in those societies came from the first report of the United Nations Development Programme that was drawn up in 2002."
"The second report was published recently and goes into more depth as regards the lack of education and training, the severe limits in terms of cultural production, technology and research."
"The most revealing fact is that the team that is working on this project is made up entirely – and I repeat, entirely – of Arab researchers."
"The strategy for the Greater Middle East, drawn up by the Bush administration, is based largely on these analyses, with a limitation that I would say is fatal: that of prescribing changes and reforms without establishing any relationship with the Arab and Islamic world."
"There is the risk that this approach will fuel the notion that so-called Western civilisation thinks itself superior to all the religious and cultural traditions of the Arab world."
"This notion lies at the root of the feeling of humiliation that is so widespread in these countries and which terrorist groups exploit, hoping in turn to fuel hatred towards the West."
"The second comment that I would like to make concerns relations between the Bush administration and the Sharon government."
"In the eyes of the Arab world, the principle of double standards is intolerable."
"Can Sharon’s Israel still be defined as a country under the rule of law despite the extrajudicial executions, collective punishments, the construction of a wall in Palestinian territory, the settlements and the lack of access to fundamental resources such as water for the Palestinian people?"
"The US administration, so inflexible that it inflicted two wars on Iraq and ten years of embargo, today is not budging an inch on what was once again defined as a humanitarian disaster by the rapporteur of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva yesterday."
"The concern is that the method chosen by the US administration and its indifference to the Middle East conflict could have the opposite effect, that is to say for it to seem, in the eyes of the public in these countries, that even greater credit is given to non-democratic governments and political classes that are responsible for the unfair use of resources, for widespread corruption, for the lack of democracy and fundamental freedoms of women for a start – and in short those responsible for the crisis and the decline of these societies."
"Europe has a role and a responsibility in all of this, but also a solid history of relations in the Mediterranean area, based on a different method, that of partnership."
"Recently this strategy was stepped up, as a response to enlargement to the East, with the neighbourhood policy."
"Today is therefore not about challenging all this, but rather about establishing a relationship with the Bush administration, with the Arab League and in collaboration with the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO), which makes Europe’s point of view heard as an alternative to the initiatives from the US Administration."
"Mr President, Europe is strongly committed to peace but is deeply frustrated by the latest terrorist attacks."
"For Europe, the Mediterranean is a crucial area, an historic challenge and until it is transformed into an area of peace, development, democracy and stability, Europe will not, I am sorry to say, be able to fulfil its potential."
"Today the conflict between Israel and Palestine is erasing any glimmer of hope and the worsening of the conflict is certainly not helping to combat international terrorism, indeed in ideological terms it is fuelling it."
"In order to ensure a future of peace in this area, however, greater responsibility is needed and all our efforts, our political authority and our financial and human resources must be used to ensure that we get back on the road to negotiations."
"The Athens Forum was therefore an important step, but this is not about supporting one side or the other."
"The route that we must take, even now that hopes for peace seem almost dead, remains that of working towards a clear objective: two states, one alongside the other, Israel and Palestine, that live in peace and security without discrimination and with respect for human rights."
"To this end, Europe must hold constant and open dialogue with the whole of the Arab world."
"Mr President, as the whole world has affirmed, the assassination of Sheikh Yassin by the Israeli army is a totally irresponsible provocation."
"Having participated in the establishment and development of Hamas with, at the time, the intention of weakening the PLO, the Israeli powers today seek to torpedo any idea of a peaceful solution."
"This brute-force approach has but one aim: that of destroying any hope of a negotiated peace with, as a consequence, the construction of the Wall imposed as the only acceptable solution."
"This shameful wall imprisons an entire nation, goes on annexing its land and resources and is overwhelmingly condemned by world opinion, as witnessed to by the debates of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights."
"Faced with this policy that is suicidal for both the Palestinians and the Israelis, the call by sixty key Palestinian figures to refrain from avenging the death of the Hamas leader is extremely dignified and courageous."
"It is high time the European Union supported them by clearly identifying Sharon as the main obstacle to peace; by specifically entering into official talks with those opposed to this policy of adopting the worst possible line, notably the pioneers of the Geneva Accord; by officially requesting the immediate deployment of an international force to protect the population of the Palestinian territories; and by suspending the agreement with Israel, as demanded by our Parliament two years ago."
"In short, by matching words with action in the interests of respect for international law."
"Any other approach is bound to fail and cannot be taken seriously under any circumstances, especially by Arab countries."
"While the American president continues to encourage Sharon, welcoming him in a few days’ time, the Union can no longer hide behind words."
"In a totally different spirit to the American plans for a Greater Middle East serving only their economic and strategic interests, Europe must finally take action if it wants to realise the ambition declared in Barcelona of bringing about a region of peace and prosperity."
"The proven lies concerning the reasons for armed intervention in Iraq and the new boost given to terrorism extending also into Europe drive us to take initiatives much bolder than those implied by what the Council and the Commission have told us today."
"An end to the occupation and the recognition of a sovereign and viable Palestinian State would also deprive the terrorists of a fertile breeding ground."
"It is peace in the region and throughout the world that is at stake."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after Madrid, the threat of a clash between the Western and Islamic worlds is drawing nearer."
"Will we simply let this happen?"
"Both in Israel and among the Palestinians, there are forces pursuing mutual destruction."
"After all, what else can a so-called military solution amount to?"
"Sheikh Yassin did not want peace on the basis of negotiations, but does Sharon?"
"On several occasions, Sharon provoked Palestinian violence, most recently with the military occupation of Palestine, the erection of the wall and the assassination of Yassin."
"This violence was continuously breeding more violence."
"It is a source of frustration, so much so that the export of the conflict to other areas is moving ever closer and is becoming a threat to world peace and to safety in our cities."
"That is why we are asking you to shift your peace efforts up a gear, to cancel the association agreement and not to delay starting the debate on an international peace force in Israel."
"Only the right to self-determination can really provide a peaceful outcome."
"Mr President, the best conflict prevention measure is respect for human rights."
"Unfortunately, Sharon does not even remotely live up to this respect."
"It is detrimental to every peace effort that the international community is allowing Sharon constantly to violate international rules."
"To condemn Israel is not enough: measures need to be taken."
"The EU could begin by suspending the trade agreements."
"Clearly Israel is entitled to protect its citizens against terror attacks, but Sharon's persisting violations of human rights, including extrajudicial killings, are not protecting but endangering its citizens."
"It is contrary to international law; it totally undermines the very concept of the rule of law, which is a key element in the fight against terrorism."
"Israel could easily arrest suspected terrorists, instead of killing innocent passers-by, of whom many are women and children, using exactly the same despicable means as suicide bombers."
"The Palestinian Authority cannot stop suicide bombings when Israel deliberately fuels everything that leads to them, thus sharing the responsibility for them."
"In many cases, Israel has used extrajudicial killings against exactly those Palestinian leaders who have been strong advocates for peace and for stopping the suicide bombings."
"Sharon's state terrorism is no substitute for political negotiations such as the Geneva Accord and the roadmap, which Israel is now abandoning."
"Mr President, the Middle East is the spiritual home of the three great revealed religions of the world, but sadly also the inspiration for those misguided few who invoke Islam as a justification for terrorist killings, invoking in particular the bloodthirsty traditions of Salafism and Wahhabism."
"The Middle East is a source of vital oil supplies to the West and the location of one of the longest and bloodiest disputes between the Arab world and Israel."
"It is also the location of some of the most ruthless regimes, ranging from the old Iraq of Saddam to the current government of Iran."
"Saudi Arabia is also brutal in its decapitations for misdemeanours, like alcohol consumption."
"The Middle East is a source of many of the EU's refugees, particularly from Kurdistan, and if we allow Turkey into the EU, the EU's borders will stretch into the Middle East to face Syria, Iraq and Iran directly."
"Therefore stabilising this region in peace, democracy, good governance with the rule of law and respect for human rights is essential to the EU's interest, as well as the people there who have suffered under tyrannical governments for so long."
"That is why I support the roadmap for peace, for a two-state solution in Israel and in Palestine, for a democratic Palestine alongside the State of Israel."
"But I remain critical of the fact that EU money was given in direct budgetary assistance without adequate safeguards to prevent diversion of funds to corrupt practice and possibly even terrorism in a theatre of war and in a zone where such practice is commonplace: this, I believe, was wrong."
"Tomorrow, Parliament's working group looking at this will regrettably be publishing two separate reports."
"I have always supported and continue to support the liberation of Iraq from Ba'athist tyranny and remain optimistic that eventually we will see a new Iraq emerge which will serve as a catalyst for democratic change elsewhere in the region."
"Lastly, I hope to see more dialogue between moderate Muslim leaders and the EU's political classes if we are to avoid the much feared clash of civilisations as a scenario."
"Mr President, referring to the Mediterranean and the Middle East, the Council has just indicated – and I quote – ‘the Union’s willingness to work with the United States for the purposes of cooperation in the region’."
"It would be no bad thing, in my view, if Washington did the same and expressed its fervent desire to cooperate with the Union."
"I believe that this would involve the following: a sensitive, rather than blunt and brutal, drawing up and presentation of its proposed plan for the democratisation of the Middle East."
"It would also involve objectives in line with reality and common sense, bearing in mind, in my opinion, that excessive ambitions, since we are talking about an area from Morocco to Pakistan, may lead to looking foolish, firstly, and then failure."
"And, above all, I believe the United States should accept that it is impossible to confront such a vast enterprise, without treating the resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict as a priority and prior objective."
"Israel rejected the Saudi peace proposal, ratified in Beirut by the plenum of the Arab League, and has blocked – and let there be no mistake, it has blocked – the road map and decided to continue along its own unilateral course, which includes extra-judicial assassinations."
"In my opinion – I would insist – these circumstances, together with the assassination of Sheikh Yassin, have led to the suspension of the new Arab Summit, scheduled for yesterday in Tunisia, and I believe that no possible initiative for a so-called ‘Greater Middle East’ can succeed in any way in this context."
"We simply have to look at what King Abdullah of Jordan, who we all know to be a clearly moderate leader, said the day before yesterday – and I quote, ‘the assassination of Sheikh Yassin, a week before the Arab League Summit, demonstrates that the Israelis wanted the meeting to fail and for the Arabs not to be able to relaunch their dialogue initiative, because Israel does not want peace’."
"If a moderate leader says what I have just quoted, the Union must take note of what this implies and take action as a consequence."
"I will end, Mr President, by saying to Mr Laschet, who has just spoken – although I regret that he is not here – that I agree with him when he says that we must talk less about the extra-judicial assassinations violating international law, because we all condemn them."
"The problem is that these assassinations take place, we all condemn them, but none of us act to put an end to them."
"Mr President, I have two points."
"While legally debatable, the execution of Sheikh Yassin must not cause us to forget who he was: the instigator of the worst suicide attacks and the head of a movement whose charter still calls for the destruction of Israel and, beyond that – let us not forget – the physical elimination of Jews throughout the world."
"Do we mourn this man?"
"Secondly, the American plan deserves some consideration since it invites us to move beyond the illusion in which European action is currently mired, the illusion whereby resolution of the conflict would precede the democratisation of the Middle East."
"As we know, democracies do not wage war against each other, so there will be no lasting solution to the conflict without democratisation and modernisation of the Middle East."
"Without such a Copernican revolution, Mr President, we will forever have the spectacle of a sententious but powerless Europe, which Commissioner Patten embodies with the perfection of an old Shakespearean actor."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the day after the creation of the EMPA, the European Union has, as everyone has said, a duty to become involved in peace building within the logic of the Barcelona process."
"The Union bears a historic and political responsibility, and it can no longer content itself only with issuing condemnations when the region is ablaze or weeping when terrorism strikes."
"Now, the United States tells us that it has a plan for the Middle East."
"How, though, can we talk in terms of plans when we know that Syria has a presence in Lebanon, when the occupation in Iraq is ongoing and when a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has still not been found?"
"This plan is, indeed, disputed and disputable."
"It is disputed because the United States has not bothered to discuss it with the countries concerned."
"This clearly reveals America’s mistrust and their unilateral practices, just as the pre-emptive war in Iraq did."
"It also reflects the geopolitical ignorance of the United States and the generalisations it makes by including Maghreb in the Middle East, and Pakistan and Afghanistan among the Arab countries."
"Finally, what does this plan advocate?"
"The fight against terrorism?"
"Yes, but with the installation of American bases in the region."
"Has not this been the case since 1990-1991?"
"Resolution of the conflict?"
"Yes, but to be credible, it would be necessary to fight all forms of terrorism, including the state terrorism conducted by Israel, which is doggedly trying to exterminate the Palestinian people, yet with total impunity."
"Lastly, democratic reforms?"
"Certainly, yes, they are inevitable and essential, because the people are today suffering an economic, political and democratic deficit."
"These reforms are needed, but so is economic development."
"Finally, and in conclusion, only by reducing the gap between the ruling classes and the people will these reforms be possible."
"Civil society must be involved."
"It is for this reason that we in Europe must support the forces of progress or internal forces for peace and strengthen dialogue in order to dispel fears, to finally put an end to this violence and to let our common values govern us."
"Mr President, Commissioner, anyone who fails to recognise that the State of Israel has the duty to protect its citizens against terror loses their credibility."
"Ever since the Palestinian leadership started the second , two and a half years ago, in order to achieve their goals by violent means, nearly one thousand Israeli men, women and children have been killed by poisoned minds with shrapnel grenades around their waists."
"Where is the Europe-wide indignation about the Palestinian leaders, who drape bombs around their children and, if they are detained by soldiers, are prepared to blow them up in cold blood?"
"The biggest obstacle to peace in the Middle East is the Palestinians' unwillingness to recognise the State of Israel."
"There is no other explanation for Arafat's refusal at Camp David."
"The State of Israel accounts for only 0.6% of Arab territory."
"For a long time, Arab nations thought they could drive the Jews into the sea by using the Palestinian refugees as a means of putting Israel under international pressure."
"The Arab countries have never allowed their Palestinian brothers to lead a dignified existence."
"The UN, too, kept the refugee status of the Palestinians artificially in place for 50 years."
"King Abdullah's first reaction to a possible retreat of Israel from the Gaza was the fear that Palestinians would be looking for jobs in Jordan."
"Peace is inextricably linked with justice, and that is where the problem lies."
"On its own continent, Europe has placed democracy on a pedestal, but ignores democracy in Israel, in a region which consists of nothing but dictatorships – enlightened or not, as the case may be."
"Mr President, the assassination of the Hamas chief had one effect, which was that the Arab League summit, which was to have taken place yesterday and today, was cancelled."
"That is a tragedy because the summit was to have considered a number of proposals for reform in the Arab region."
"I want to focus on this question of reform because that is fundamental to our security in the European Union."
"The Irish Foreign Minister spoke about the Arab-Israeli conflict."
"He also spoke about the evolution of democracy and civil society in these lands."
"My question is, what can do?"
"While Commissioner Patten spoke about the Barcelona process – a highly desirable process established a long time before the Americans' idea of a greater Middle East process – that process is not having the sort of effect that it should have."
"As some of you may know, I have spent some time in the last few months, as rapporteur on the democracy initiative, going to the conference in Sana'a, Yemen, to Cairo, Alexandria, Damascus, to the Arab Parliamentary Union conference and to Athens last week with you, Mr President."
"This sort of democratic odyssey is trying to establish one thing: the appetite of the peoples of the Arab countries for democracy, the rule of law, civil society and so on."
"But in this arc of instability on our rim, while the EU is spending EUR 700 million plus in MEDA funds, only EUR 7 million of that is being spent on democracy."
"I find myself caught between the Scylla of bureaucratic obstructionism in the Council and the Charybdis of bureaucratic obstructionism in the Commission."
"We need a programme that works: we have the means to do it and we have the will to do it in this Parliament."
"The question is, do the Commission and Council accept their political priorities?"
"I address my remarks to two senior politicians who both occupy positions of responsibility at a very sensitive time for Europe."
"Mr President, the negative spiral of violence in the Middle East does not seem to be going into reverse, and plunged to another depth last week, when the hatred-sowing Hamas leader Yassin was cold-bloodedly murdered at the behest of the Israeli Prime Minister Sharon."
"I call on the Palestinians not to use violence to avenge Sharon’s illegal act."
"Now is the time to break the cycle and opt for peaceful resistance in a dignified manner."
"I would echo the appeal by a group of Palestinian academics not to commit any new suicide attacks."
"Prime Minister Sharon violates human rights, ignores UN resolutions by building a wall in the Occupied Territories, by building new settlements and by the extrajudicial executions of Palestinians."
"I would therefore call for a suspension of the EU's association agreement with Israel in accordance with Article 2, the human rights clause, until such time as the Israeli Government has withdrawn its call for attacks, which are in contravention of international law, and mean that the Sharon Government constitutes a threat to safety and to the constitutional state of Israel."
"The Israeli-Palestinian situation is a seriously disturbing factor in the entire region."
"What the Middle East needs is a broad democratic initiative for dialogue and cooperation between all countries in it, and Europe possesses the appropriate instruments to bring one about."
"We must organise the partnerships between the EU and the Mediterranean countries in the framework of the Barcelona process, in which we strategically promote political and economic, but also social, reforms, in order to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
"I am convinced that there is a great political need for this among the citizens of both Israel and Palestine."
"Finally, I would call on the EU Member States in the UN Security Council to submit a proposal for a UN intervention force based on the boundaries of 1967, in a bid to protect the Israeli and Palestinian citizens against terrorist attacks."
"Working for peace in the Middle East is a huge contribution in the fight against terrorism."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as regular as clockwork, we make high-flown statements and condemn the violence in the Middle East."
"Is that really all we can manage to do?"
"Why can the European Union not play a more active role in this conflict?"
"Right now, there are various reasons why the European Union should be playing a pioneering role in the peace process."
"Sadly, recent events have made a further radicalisation between Israel and the Palestinians more than likely."
"The status of the United States as a good international negotiator has been dealt a few serious blows after Afghanistan and Iraq."
"The implementation of the international step-by-step plan appears a long way off, so the European Union should act."
"Peace and stability are entirely in its interest."
"After all, we are the region's largest trading partner and the largest donor of humanitarian and financial aid."
"When will our words at last be followed by deeds?"
"Mr President, I recently attended a conference of Arab women in Beirut."
"The women were from 22 different Arab countries."
"What struck me was that they all speak a common language, which gave them a unity that perhaps we still aspire to here in Europe."
"Regardless of what they spoke about at that conference – and they were all highly educated, sophisticated women – the issue of Palestine was mentioned by every single person."
"Clearly, this issue is a hugely unifying factor throughout all the Arab countries."
"We in Ireland have learned – tragically and dreadfully over a thirty-year period – what it is to live with terrorism."
"We have also seen some of the bitterest enemies in the world take a leap of faith that led to peace in Northern Ireland – to the great relief of all of us."
"Commissioner Patten clearly had a part in that as well."
"I do not want to repeat many of the things colleagues have said here this afternoon, but we have to recognise that at the heart of the tragedy is another generation of little people living in those squalid camps in Palestine who are growing up, and the first game they play is throwing stones at soldiers – just as they did in Northern Ireland."
"There is also another generation of children on the other side of the border who are too terrified to go to school in case the bus they are riding in is blown up."
"These are the children who 20 years from now will be the leaders, or perhaps the victims, or the suicide bombers."
"We all condemn unreservedly the dreadful events in both Palestine and Israel."
"But there has to be that leap of faith, that moment in which, as a friend of mine said, we have to smile weakly and have a strong stomach and forget about the awful things we have done to each other and start to try and address the dreadful issues in the Middle East which are central to practically every single major political issue in the world today."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, there is talk these days of a new Middle East policy, of a greater Middle East."
"If it is not all going to be hot air, then in my opinion two things in particular must remain at the heart of such a policy."
"Firstly, resolution of the main conflict in the Middle East."
"I wish the US would devote as much energy – by which I do not mean military manpower – to solving the actual Middle East problem as it is doing to Iraq."
"I would also like Europe to expend as much energy solving the Middle East problem as some European Union Member States are doing in the case of Iraq, because there would then be fewer terrorist attacks and there would be fewer illegal killings like that of Sheikh Yassin."
"As Commissioner Patten said, the culture of death must be defeated and destroyed."
"Secondly, yes, the Arab world does indeed need reforms."
"Unlike many of my fellow Members here, however, I have not seen much evidence of the Americans supporting the reform movements in Jordan, Egypt or Saudi Arabia in recent years."
"I have not noticed them supporting democracy and human rights in those countries very much."
"If the United States of America is now taking up that cause, I am very much in favour of joining them in supporting the reform efforts inside the Arab countries."
"There are enough women who are dissatisfied with the continuing severe discrimination against women."
"There are enough minorities who are dissatisfied with the discrimination against minorities."
"There are enough people in the Arab countries who are dissatisfied with discrimination and disregard for human rights and the rights of minorities."
"Not long ago, we welcomed to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy people who had recently written a report showing where the obstacles lie, obstacles to modernisation and democratisation recognised by the Arab countries themselves."
"I believe the only practical way forward for a new Middle East policy is not to threaten outside military intervention but for Europe, in particular, to support the reform forces in the Arab countries."
"We should be doing more, spending more money and of course also using much more energy to drive those important reforms in the Arab countries forward."
"Mr President, ten years after the Rabin/Arafat agreements, a neutral observer taking stock of the Blair/Gaddafi civilities would say that a miracle has taken place."
"However, if he looked into it further, he would say that we have a greater tragedy."
"Where is the balance?"
"The balance is quite clearly worse today than it was ten years ago when there were events and political choices."
"When it became clear from various quarters that the official government line was to murder people, we did not react."
"When the new wall of shame started to be built, again we did not react."
"A particular peculiarity distinguishes the shape of our policy."
"Yes!"
"We are the biggest financiers of the area, but to finance someone without intervening politically is basically like pouring water into a pitcher full of holes, into a bucket full of holes, which cannot hold the water."
"What are we doing now?"
"Quite clearly we have to take initiatives."
"In a few days, as is our custom, the presiding country will meet the president of the United States of America in order to raise the imperative question of the joint approach to this issue."
"It would, of course, be better if this meeting were held in Brussels at long last."
"We are also talking about the Euro-Mediterranean conference and we all welcome the meeting in Athens at parliamentary level."
"However, there must also be a corresponding initiative at government level."
"In other words, if we cannot get to the heart of the problem, we must confine the problem."
"It would not be a bad thing, for example, if we set up a special office in the area, based in Cyprus, to take account of all the irritations and take the corresponding initiatives."
"Politics are not neutral."
"Politics mean initiative, pro-action, proposals and results."
"If the European Union wants to demonstrate its ability, including for its own interests, it is an area which has matured to the point at which it will have the general acceptance of mankind if it makes a positive contribution to resolving the Palestinian problem, which is the tip of a broader problem, but if the tip is solved, it will also be resolved at the base."
"Mr President, a sustainable peace in the Middle East can only be achieved through serious negotiations and by complying with international law."
"Building walls and new settlements on occupied territory does not contribute to peace."
"Peace is never achieved through terrorist acts, on the part either of Israel or of the Palestinians."
"No terrorist acts can be approved."
"The murder of Sheik Yassin, ordered by Israel, is an act of terrorism and a crime under international law."
"It must be condemned."
"It is obvious that Israel has broken the Association Agreement."
"The EU must not accept this."
"A solution to the conflict demands increased active participation by the EU and also by the UN in the form not only of peacekeeping forces and increased support for the Palestinian people but also in the form of a clear political line."
"Sharon has made it clear that he intends to order executions of more Palestinian leaders."
"If the Israeli Government does not immediately abandon such plans, the agreement with Israel must be cancelled."
"Agreements must be complied with by both parties."
"Further indulgence of Israel and the Israeli Government does not help Israel."
"Mr President, the assassination of Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and the seven other Palestinians was a clear breach of international law."
"I totally condemn all terrorism, whatever its source, and I also call on Palestinians not to respond violently to this most recent provocation."
"If we are to begin to bring an end to this spiral of violence, then someone has to take the first leap."
"I abhor in particular the use of children as proxy bombers and the targeting of civilians by Palestinian terror groups."
"The government of Ariel Sharon has once again adopted bully-boy tactics which can only block the peace process and obstruct any chance for constructive negotiations."
"The continuing occupation of Palestinian territory and the construction of the so-called security wall, mostly on Palestinian territory, is ghettoising Palestinians, destroying their livelihoods, imprisoning and impoverishing them and driving them to despair."
"The European Union, on the other hand, has all carrot and no stick."
"It is not that the European Union does not have a stick, it simply refuses to even wave the stick, never mind use it."
"I would call on the Commission and the Council to demand that Israel take immediate steps to comply with the human rights obligations it entered into in the association agreement."
"It is not doing so and unless we take action to insist that they do, we will reap a terrible harvest in the future."
"Mr President, peace in the Middle East hinges on a solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and on the entire European policy concerning strategic partnership."
"When Cyprus joins on 1 May, Tel Aviv will be half an hour's flight away from the European Union, and we will be direct neighbours."
"During the recent visit by Parliament's delegation, we noticed that many Israelis have high expectations of the European Union."
"They are expecting us to take a leading role in the region."
"Israel is being ruled by a man who rides roughshod over international law and who, in the present conflict, continues to pour oil upon the flames."
"He is doing a great deal of damage to his country and gives international terrorists an excellent excuse for their actions."
"According to the Council's declaration, the European Union is consistently opposed to extrajudicial executions."
"In my view, the only consistent stance would be to review the trade relations and use our economic power as a carrot and a stick – but not only on Israel."
". Mr President, I will be very brief."
"I should like to thank the Members who have participated."
"This has been a useful discussion, and it has also made clear that there exists a fundamental consensus amongst us on the need for the European Union to exert maximum effort on the issues that have been raised."
"We all agree that the European Union needs to raise the level of its engagement within the region."
"I agree particularly with Members as to the importance of intensive consultation with the countries involved in the region."
"The drive and the initiative to address these challenges and to implement the necessary reforms must come from the region itself."
"It is easy to be in despair when you see, as we have seen, horror heaped on horror, misery on top of misery."
"However, the reality is that the Union must be involved in pushing forward where it can to try and create at least a space in which peace can be created."
"The Union must work in partnership with the region to this end, to help to meet all of these challenges."
"A lasting and comprehensive settlement is set out in the roadmap, and the roadmap is the only way forward."
"It was mentioned that the suspension of the Association Agreement is a way forward in the region."
"I think that discussion and pressure would produce some progress."
"In the interim report on the strategic partnership endorsed by the Council last week, the European Union has established a set of guiding principles for its engagement in the region."
"The presidency is committed to developing the strategic partnership on the basis of partnership and dialogue with all the countries in the region."
"Once again, I should like to thank Members for their thoughtful and incisive contributions."
"Thank you, Mr Roche, despite the authoritative calls and the quotes from Shakespeare, Homer and Ulysses, Commissioner Patten has informed me that he does not intend to reply."
"The debate is closed."
". The murder by Israel of the spiritual leader of Hamas confirms once again the murderous/terrorist nature of the policy followed by the Sharon government in order to subjugate the heroic Palestinian people."
"It comes in the wake of a cluster of similar murders, which some people are justifying in the name of protection from terrorism."
"The Sharon government would not dare to commit crimes if it did not have direct support and encouragement from the USA."
"For its part, the ΕU is continuing its policy of tolerance and support for Israel which puts the slaughterers and the slaughtered on an equal footing."
"The summit in Brussels confined itself to expressing its opposition to ‘extra-judicial killings’ (as it calls the murders), but recognised ‘Israel’s right to protect its citizens against terrorist attacks’."
"The Communist Party of Greece has repeatedly expressed its solidarity with the heroic Palestinian people and its support for its just fight and its absolute condemnation of Israel's policy of genocide, its regret at the loss of life and its conviction that the source of all the violence is the occupation of the Palestinian territories."
"It also expresses its support for the pacifist forces in Israel and for all those who refuse to serve in the army and the occupied territories."
"There will be no peace in the area until the people of Palestine have a homeland."
". The situation in the Middle East has been with us for decades."
"We have shown solidarity, in various ways, with the Palestinian people, and with those individuals and groups in Israel who are fighting for peace in the region."
"A joint initiative for peace, stability and democracy throughout the Middle East, in the words of the title of this Council and Commission declaration, would be worthy of our support if it were indeed a joint initiative for peace."
"What we cannot accept is that fine titles or headings disguise the imbalances inherent in the situation and even suggest misleading interpretations of events."
"Terrorism cannot be justified by attacks on terrorism; nor can terrorism be glossed over by giving it a euphemistic label such as ‘extra-judicial killing’ or something that uses a similar degree of linguistic imagination."
"The assassination of the Hamas leader, irrespective of what we think of that organisation, has contributed nothing towards peace in the Middle East; quite the opposite, in fact."
"Similarly, the fact that Ariel Sharon’s fascistic government is not being held to account for the escalation of violence and terror contributes nothing towards peace in the Middle East."
"Parliament and the European Union must adopt clear and unequivocal positions to condemn terrorism, but such positions will only have credibility when they condemn the terrorist policies of the Israeli Government and when those positions lead to concrete political and diplomatic measures, such as suspending the association agreement with Israel."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Kosovo."
". Mr President, we were all shocked at the eruption of ethnically motivated violence in Kosovo on 17 and 18 March."
"The latest outbreak resulted in death and injury and the displacement of 3000 people."
"It also resulted in the destruction of places of worship, hospitals and schools which were deliberately targeted in an attack on our shared vision of a multi-ethnic Kosovo."
"While the situation in Kosovo has stabilised since 18 March, it remains very tense."
"The KFOR international peacekeeping force has been strengthened significantly in response to the violence."
"I pay tribute to the efforts of all who worked hard to stabilise the situation and to restore calm in Kosovo."
"I would also like to offer my condolences and those of the Council to all who have once again suffered loss of life, injury and loss of loved ones."
"The General Affairs and External Relations Council, on 22 March, and the European Council, on 26 March, condemned the violence, loss of life, the damage to property and the destruction of religious and cultural heritage in Kosovo. The full commitment of the European Union to the development of a secure, democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo, in line with UN Security Council Resolution 1244 has been reaffirmed once again."
"The European Union strongly supports the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General in Kosovo, Harri Holkeri, the United Nations mission in Kosovo and KFOR in their determined efforts to stabilise the situation and to ensure the full implementation of Security Council resolution 1244."
"I would like to underscore the strong support of the European Union for the United Nations policy of Standards before Status. That policy, together with Security Council resolution 1244, remains the foundation of the international community’s commitment to Kosovo."
"The European Union is considering how it can strengthen its role in support of the UN Standards before Status policy."
"The recent violent events have risked undermining the painstakingly achieved progress that has been made to date."
"It is important now that we assert the primacy of politics in Kosovo and ensure that there is no further descent into ethnic violence."
"The explosion of sectarianism would be to the detriment of all in Kosovo."
"It is clear that the future of the people of that country lies in the eventual integration of the countries of the Western Balkans into the European Union structures, as agreed at the EU-Western Balkans summit in June 2003."
"The implementation of the UN Standards before Status policy is the key to achieving that goal."
"However, the issue of final status in Kosovo can only be addressed once sufficient progress has been made on the implementation and review of standards."
"Despite the recent violence and the continuing tensions, this will have to include the resumption of the process of dialogue on practical matters between Belgrade and Pristina."
"As this House is aware, at the request of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, High Representative Solana visited Kosovo on 24 March. Commissioner Patten accompanied him on the visit."
"They took with them a clear message. Political leaders in Kosovo, especially the Kosovo Albanian leadership, need to take responsibility for the situation and ensure that there is no repeat of ethnically motivated violence, or of threats of such violence."
"Those responsible for the violence must be brought to justice."
"Kosovo’s Provisional Institutions of Self-Government must demonstrate their commitment to a multi-ethnic Kosovo."
"Last week’s European Council called on them to take an immediate step in this direction by allocating resources for the urgent reconstruction of damaged property, including places of worship, to ensure that internally displaced persons can return safely to their homes."
"I welcome the allocation by the Provisional Institutions of EUR 5 million to assist with reconstruction, and the unanimous declaration of the Kosovo Assembly on 26 March to condemn the recent violence."
"Welcome as they are, words are not enough."
"It is time to see real efforts to reach across ethnic divisions so that a Kosovo in which all can live peaceably and in security is created."
"To this end, political leaders in Kosovo must now work more closely with the United Nations mission in Kosovo and with KFOR for the protection of the rights of all sections of the population, including members of minority communities."
"What has happened in Kosovo over the past few weeks is a reminder to us all of the importance of the role that the European Union plays, not just in Kosovo, but in the wider region."
"The European Union has taken the lead role in working with the countries of the Western Balkans to consolidate peace and stability in the region, and to promote economic development and the respect for human rights and the rule of law."
"European Union assistance in the region in support of those objectives will amount to EUR 4.65 billion over the period 2000-2006."
"The Union, including its Member States, continues to be the most important source of funding for the international efforts in Kosovo."
"Moreover, European Union Member States make the largest troop contributions to KFOR."
"The development of ever closer relations with the Western Balkans is a priority for the European Union."
"Since last year’s Thessaloniki Summit, the European Union and the countries of the Western Balkans have a shared agenda for progress."
"The objective of eventual integration will be pursued through the Stabilisation and Association Process and through implementation of the series of agreements which brought an end to the tragic conflicts of the past 13 years."
"In the case of Kosovo, the Stabilisation and Association Process tracking mechanism initiated by the European Commission in the spring of 2003 is designed to facilitate Kosovo’s progress within the Stabilisation and Association Process, bringing Kosovo within the embrace of the European family."
"Our efforts to promote the European perspective of Kosovo and the United Nations policy of implementing standards are mutually reinforcing policies."
"The Stabilisation and Association Process challenges the democratically elected governments of the region to adopt and implement difficult and wide-ranging economic and political reforms, and to continue to strengthen regional cooperation."
"The rate of progress of the countries of the region towards European integration is to a great extent in their own hands, although the European Union will support them fully in this endeavour."
"Both sides of the relationship made commitments at Thessaloniki which must be implemented fully."
"Those responsible for the recent violence in Kosovo must be brought to justice."
"There should be no wall of silence, there should be no culture of impunity."
"It is time to move forward, away from the hurt and the anger which have blighted Kosovo’s politics for so long."
"The path to take has been mapped out by the United Nations, in its Standards before Status policy."
"I would like to repeat the Council’s support for Special Representative Holkeri, for his United Nations colleagues, and for KFOR, in their determination to stabilise the situation and to ensure the implementation of Security Council resolution 1244 in full."
"It is the responsibility of all, but particularly of Kosovo’s leaders, to support the work already in train to ensure a stable future for a secure, democratic, prosperous and multi-ethnic Kosovo, with its place in Europe."
"The European Union is ready to help in the achievement of this goal."
"It is up to the people in Kosovo now to take up the offers made."
". Mr President, I am extremely glad to have the opportunity to speak to the House today about Kosovo."
"As the presidency noted, I went with Mr Javier Solana to Kosovo last week, because of our concern about the recent upsurge in violence."
"During those terrible days and nights, a very large number of homes were destroyed, together with schools, medical facilities and a large number of churches."
"The latest reports suggest that 22 people were killed and more than 850 injured, including police and KFOR members."
"There is little doubt that although there may have been an initial trigger for the violence, it quickly became organised."
"I also have no doubt that elements within the main Albanian political parties were involved."
"We should remember that Europe rightly took a stand against the disgraceful ethnic cleansing by Milosevic in 1999."
"Since then, the international community has spent EUR 2 billion – not including defence costs – to try to rebuild Kosovo."
"We did not do that in order to see Kosovar Serbs being ethnically cleansed in their turn."
"Let me share with the House my reflections on my visit to Kosovo."
"I have to say that the High Representative and I were extremely disappointed."
"We saw at first hand the anger and upset of Serbs in a suburb of Pristina called Kosovo Polje."
"We were looking for evidence that Kosovar Albanian leaders understood those feelings."
"There was precious little sign of it."
"On the contrary, there was an attempt to blame everyone but themselves for what had happened."
"There was one exception to this. The Prime Minister, Mr Rexhepi, rose to the occasion."
"He showed considerable courage in visiting trouble spots to try to defuse tensions."
"He also immediately understood the responsibility of the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government to put right the terrible wrongs that were done to Kosovar Serbs."
"Before we arrived, he had decided to set up a reconstruction fund with an initial budget of EUR 5 million."
"He understood that it was the duty of his government to put things right, not the responsibility of the international community."
"I did not go to Pristina to promise that European taxpayers’ money would be used instead."
"That would be completely unacceptable."
"Mr Rexhepi promised that rapid action would be taken to repair damaged property so that people could get back to their homes as quickly as possible."
"Mr Solana and I promised to go back through the summer so that we could see for ourselves that progress on reconstruction is actually occurring."
"What are the priorities now?"
"NATO has reacted swiftly to increase troop numbers in order to provide better security."
"This has had an immediate effect on calming tensions in Kosovo, although we have to remain extremely vigilant about the situation."
"Next, UNMIK police are trying as quickly as possible to identify those responsible for these attacks so that they can be taken out of circulation and punished. It is incumbent on the leaders of the Albanian political parties to purge their ranks of such people."
"Next, there needs to be an investigation of the role played by the Kosovo police service in the disturbances."
"There were reports that some members of the police service did their duty well, but there have also been reports of police service members either taking no action to prevent these attacks or, worse still, participating in them."
"UNMIK is determined to get to the bottom of what actually happened."
"Next, we have to be quite clear that we stand fully behind UNMIK."
"There were clear signs of organised attacks on UNMIK property and staff."
"That is completely unacceptable."
"The European Union strongly supports the UN as an institution."
"We cannot tolerate attacks on the UN, whether in Kosovo or anywhere else."
"We also need to work very closely with our United States partners."
"Mr Solana and I had a very constructive meeting with Marcie Ries, the American Representative in Pristina."
"We all agreed that we needed to make it absolutely clear to the Kosovars that we are at one in our reaction to these events."
"Finally, it is absolutely essential that the political leaderships in Belgrade and Pristina refrain from provocative statements which can only serve to exacerbate tensions."
"Final status discussions are for another day."
"Last week’s declaration by the Serbian Parliament insisting on permanent sovereignty for Serbia and a system of cantons inside Kosovo was extremely unhelpful, to say the least."
"So were statements by Kosovar Albanian leaders in the immediate aftermath of the violence that they would not accept anything short of independence."
"It is always tempting after horrible events like these to conclude that we should rip up our strategy and come up with a new plan."
"I must be absolutely clear with the House on this: I do not believe that we can give up on our insistence on a multi-ethnic Kosovo in which all ethnic groups can live freely and without fear."
"Nor do I believe that we should abandon the idea of standards before status."
"On the other hand, we should not send a signal that final status discussions will be delayed indefinitely."
"That would risk a grave worsening of tension."
"Nothing that happened earlier this month can change the geography of Kosovo."
"We all have a shared interest in making sure that Kosovo does not become a black hole in the middle of south-east Europe, where organised crime flourishes and ethnic division is entrenched."
"We have to go on working patiently for the long-term future. Whatever Kosovo’s final status, its future lies in Europe."
"However, the standards we insist that Kosovo should implement and live up to do not include the speed at which you can burn down your neighbours' home, or how quickly you can trash the school or the hospital that your neighbours go to."
"We have to make it absolutely clear that violence is not a shortcut to anything, and that if people follow leaders who espouse violence they are following those leaders into a future of poverty and criminality – not a future with the rest of Europe."
"I hope that point will be understood and that the community will turn its back on violence and move towards stability, prosperity, multi-ethnicity, pluralism and democracy."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, if I am honest, the situation in Kosovo makes me feel both sad and helpless."
"In 1999, we went to war to stop the expulsion and repression of the Albanians in Kosovo."
"I was in favour of that; after all, I had visited the country and its people since 1990 and had experienced terrible things, including torture, experienced the apartheid regime for myself."
"I naively believed that everything would then improve."
"I could not imagine that the same Albanians who had suffered all that would now do the same wrongs to their fellow human beings of other nationalities – Serbs, Roma, Ashkali."
"They did, in the end with obviously planned and criminal acts of violence."
"Many people died or became refugees and cultural heritage was desecrated."
"What is more, they then attacked hospitals and schools, which we had probably helped to pay for, KFOR and UNMIK."
"It is clear who was behind it."
"I believe the ordinary Albanian people know, too."
"The Albanian leadership’s protest and distancing of itself was not loud enough or convincing enough for me."
"This terrible act of violence has set Kosovo back a long way."
"Is that how it wants to join the EU, as Mr Patten said?"
"The criminals there do not want to join the EU; they do not want to live together in a civilised manner."
"They want strife because strife gives them scope for corruption and crime."
"Everything is now in ruins."
"I do not believe that the international community has pressed hard enough for those Serbs who want to return to do so; it has not provided all the necessary accompanying measures."
"I would not want to return to an enclave either, neither would I want always to have to be protected by KFOR."
"That is why not enough has been done here."
"We need to think about that."
"The government in Belgrade has deliberately prevented the local Serbs from being actively involved in shaping Kosovo."
"It has established parallel structures, fearing that Serb involvement in Kosovo would be the seal of Kosovo’s independence."
"I do not believe that ‘Standards before Status’ is the only way; so far, it has led us astray."
"It should be ‘Standards and Status’."
"We must now set about solving the questions of status."
"The powder keg of Kosovo will not be kept under control without a trustworthy vision for the future."
"Sixty per cent of the population are young people and 50% of them have no work."
"How are we to deal with that when leaders come along who are always stirring things up because Kosovo’s future is not clear?"
"We should give some thought to whether we should not press on more with privatisation and support for businesses, offering financial assistance for jobs that are open to both Albanians and Serbs like in Serbia under Milosevic – similar to the ‘oil for democracy’ plan."
"So let there be financial assistance for that;"
"I believe this is where the EU could prove useful."
"The UN must relinquish more of its responsibility to the government in Kosovo and Belgrade must put an end to its parallel structures."
"Then Albanians and Serbs will at last have to see that they can only govern the country together and that they will only be able to join Europe together, in a country where they have made peace and live together peacefully."
"Otherwise, any aid from us will really be pointless."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, three things struck me after our last visit to Pristina."
"Firstly, quite considerable progress has been made in the material situation."
"Not least, I am pleased to say, because of the good work done by the Reconstruction Agency."
"Secondly, the United Nations is doing a good job there, albeit hampered not least by excessive bureaucracy."
"Hardly anything has changed, however, in the heads of the political representatives of the various ethnic groups in Kosovo."
"That is true of the Serbs, as becomes clear when you look at how little real cooperation there is between the ministers in the Rexhepi government and when you consider that there is still a parallel structure for the Serbs."
"It is true above all, however, of the representatives of the Albanian majority in Kosovo."
"With perhaps a few exceptions, which the Commissioner has mentioned, they are unfortunately not yet prepared to agree to a multi-ethnic state, and not only to agree to it verbally but also to make it reality."
"If you are saying, Commissioner, that we must start negotiating soon, and if Mrs Pack is saying that we must actually negotiate about status and standards simultaneously, then I have to ask you, what are we in the European Union doing to persuade the Albanian leadership in Kosovo that they really must accept a multi-ethnic state?"
"The President-in-Office of the Council has said that we are the biggest donor, we have the largest military presence."
"Why should I have to persuade a European taxpayer to continue providing money for a state whose only aim, or whose political leadership’s only aim is to create an ethnically pure state in Europe?"
"Why should we, equally, subsidise and support Belgrade if Belgrade is not prepared to accept a joint multi-ethnic entity (let us say) or a multi-ethnic state?"
"I have always advocated moving towards independence for Kosovo, but is the Albanian leadership in Kosovo doing its part for that independence, namely creating the conditions for it?"
"After all the things you have rightly said, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, we must draw the obvious conclusion."
"If the worst comes to the worst, we must withdraw our support if we find things are going the wrong way."
"We will not help things here with fine words."
"They may be hearing the fine words, but the leadership is not taking any notice."
"That is why, however much I agree with what you said, Commissioner, and you were perfectly right, I believe we must now look to the Council and the Commission – but in the end chiefly to the Council – not simply for words, but for action if the Albanian leadership in Kosovo and also the Serbs are not prepared to work on a joint project for Kosovo."
"I still do not see that happening."
"I am really looking to the Council and Commission to act accordingly."
"– Mr President, the latest events in Kosovo show once again how fragile the peace in the Balkans is, and we must ask ourselves what the reasons are for that."
"Let us remind ourselves."
"Almost exactly five years ago, NATO began bombing Yugoslavia without declaring war."
"Although all the parties to the Helsinki Final Act had committed themselves to recognising the territorial status quo in Europe, the country was systematically dismembered by internal and external forces along ethnic lines; the Federal Republic of Germany led the way with its early recognition of Slovenia and Croatia."
"The rapid disintegration of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia did not bring an end to the conflicts, but gave rise to new tensions, which are now again exploding in bloody clashes in Kosovo."
"What was proclaimed five years ago as the remedy for ethnic cleansing has proved to be the opposite."
"Thousands of Serbian families have been driven out of a province that is still legally part of Serbia, mainly by paramilitary forces of the Kosovo Liberation Army (UCK), once classed by the US as a terrorist organisation."
"It also sounds very strange when Mr Solana, our High Representative, tells the remaining Serbs that they should be brave and have the courage to overcome these difficulties."
"Crimes are being committed, and they must be treated as such."
"The EU must have the courage to speak out more resolutely for a long-term, complex political solution for Kosovo and for the whole of the Balkans."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us not beat about the bush."
"The possibility of this happening was known to anyone who has followed the situation in Kosovo over the past year."
"From the huge mountain of reports and media reports, the same old image emerges: no real prospects, increasing hopelessness, growing social-economic problems and the UNMIK, which is considered increasingly less as a liberator and more as an occupier, being part of the problem and not part of the solution."
"I too find it far too easy only to point at the extremists."
"Of course, they are behind the attacks – which are also in my opinion sickening – on Serbs, their villages and their churches, but feelings of disappointment and distrust, but also aggression, are widely spread among the population."
"That is why I would like to repeat here the appeal Parliament made in its last report on this region, and addressed to the Commission and Council: give an outline of what the options for the future are and make it clear what, according to the European Union, the different scenarios are, but do not take too long about it."
"I have to admit that I myself am in favour of the proposals of the so-called independent Kosovo Committee of more than two years ago, in which a case was made for conditional independence."
"In that respect, the Kosovars who are behind those attacks have done their people a huge disservice."
"If the Kosovars themselves are unable to keep their own extremists under control, there is no hope of fulfilling the most important condition for independence, which is respect for minorities."
"I am sorry to have to say this, Mr Roche, but what you are saying is more of the same and the policy you advocate has led to these problems."
"As I see it, the status quo – doing what we are doing now – is no longer an option at present."
"However, the message of this Parliament to the Kosovars and the Kosovan authorities should also be clear: let your people not be taken hostage by a few criminal troublemakers."
"Be brave in your rejection; say much more clearly than you have done to date that this is unacceptable, but also take this one brave message to your people: Kosovo must be tolerant, or else Kosovo will cease to be."
"Mr President, as we have maintained and pointed out to this Parliament and the Council on many occasions, the latest tragedies that have taken place in Kosovo show that peace and democracy are not things that are obtained for ever, not even in Europe, but objectives that must be reconfirmed every day."
"Not only peace and democracy are being challenged but also the dignity of the person and respect for a common cultural heritage."
"The destruction of monasteries in Kosovo, carried out with the sole aim of destroying the symbols of a culture that has the same roots as the European Union, shows how there is a set political agenda at the basis of international terrorism and the resulting guerrilla warfare in some countries, against which our inertia is not just a sign of dangerous weakness but also a harbinger of further tragedies."
"The Union must step up its presence in Kosovo and call on the Albanian, Serbian and Montenegrin authorities to defend the rights of the minorities and protect Serbian Orthodox cultural sites."
"It does not make sense to have quite rightly protested against the Buddha being destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan if then the politicians and intellectuals remain shamefully silent about the destruction of so many Orthodox churches and monuments, which belong to a culture that embodies the values that we are endeavouring to protect."
"The valuable frescoes that have for centuries adorned the Orthodox temples and monasteries in the Balkan region are the heritage of humankind as a whole and must be safeguarded and protected from any risk of destructive folly, as we have stressed in our resolution."
"The Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs did well to make more men available to NATO to strengthen the contingent charged with keeping the peace and guaranteeing safety."
"For its part, the United Nations should provide for a programme to reconstruct the destroyed resources and to outline Kosovo’s final statute. What we also want, however, is a stronger presence for Europe, and this is why we would point out that a European army, as called for by the Convention, is an objective that cannot be put off any longer."
"Mr President, in 1999, Serbia, crushed by NATO bombing, had to give up exercising sovereignty over part of its territory, Kosovo."
"At the time, our governments justified this violation of international law by invoking the need to avoid ethnic cleansing of the Albanian population and the plan to turn Kosovo into a peaceful, multicultural society."
"This was, in particular, Dr Kouchner's ambition."
"Five years later, reality has brutally shattered this Utopian dream."
"The billions spent by our countries, as Mr Patten mentioned just now, and the thousands of soldiers we are deploying there are not preventing the Muslims from ethnically cleansing the 200 000 Serbs still living in Kosovo."
"Rather than issuing soothing statements dismissing both the victims and the culprits without pronouncing in favour of either, our leaders should think about their responsibility."
"Above all, they should put an end to this violation of international law, which Serbia has a right to see respected, as do the other states in the region."
"This is all the more true because our people are not safe from the tragedy now afflicting the Kosovar Serbs."
"Sixty years ago, Albanian Muslims were still in the minority in this province, which is the historic heart of Serbia."
"A few decades of socialism, Albanian immigration and a falling birth rate among the Serbs reversed the proportions: the Serbs became a minority in their own land and are finally being driven out of their homes, their fields and their churches."
"Many regions in our countries are undergoing the start of this process."
"Some districts, like here in Strasbourg, or even whole towns now have a Muslim majority and are gradually escaping from our laws and being taken over by gangs that will be succeeded by Sharia law."
"The tragedy in Kosovo is sounding a warning."
"We must change policy."
"European comrades, do not ask for whom the bell tolls: it tolls for thee."
"Mr President, I think that everyone was pretty shocked at the images we saw of the recent violence in Kosovo, which aroused memories of the situation we experienced in the 1990s."
"What was actually positive was the speed of the response from the international community, and the European Union in particular, but also from various EU Member States who quickly reinforced the military forces on the ground there and managed to stop the violence from escalating any further."
"Many people here have already said that we must continue to encourage those responsible in Kosovo itself, but also the people in Serbia and possibly in Albania as well, to participate in finding an achievable solution."
"I subscribe to the comments made by fellow MEPs pointing out the stalemate that has arisen in Kosovo."
"As a result, many people can no longer see a way out; this situation also gives those who want to cause trouble and who have created the recent problems the opportunity to do so."
"I think that we need to pay particular attention to the socio-economic situation."
"The high levels of unemployment in the country are severely hampering the chance of finding a solution to the problems."
"I remain, however, convinced that we must continue to work towards a society in which the two ethnic groups can cooperate and live together, and I am also of the opinion that the ethnic groups can be called to account about their responsibilities."
"An answer to the question as to what the definitive status of Kosovo should be, can, however, only be given once we have achieved a kind of internal stability that engenders trust and once there is a conviction that the two ethnic groups can live together peacefully."
"Until such time as this happens, I fear that the international community, we ourselves in other words, will have to stay on there and that we will regularly have to take action in the way we have done over the past few weeks."
"I fully agree with Mr Patten that this is a European risk which requires a European answer."
"We cannot allow a black hole to develop in that part of Europe, and that is why it is also so important for us to have responded the way we did."
"We should also, however, think about what might have to be a harder line in the future in order to ensure that we achieve a breakthrough in the stalemate I was talking about earlier."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, may I first state clearly that I condemn all forms of violence."
"May I also state clearly that I am absolutely in favour of a multiethnic Kosovo."
"I would prefer to call it Kosova, which is the Albanian term for Kosovo."
"I agree with Mr Joost Lagendijk when he said that it was inevitable that violence would break out sooner or later in Kosova."
"Anyone who has ever visited the divided city of Mitrovica knew that it would take little to trigger an uprising."
"The riots and lynch mobs were easy to anticipate."
"It is therefore necessary to take the wind out of the sails of the hard-liners among the Kosovar Albanians."
"To do this, we must eliminate the traumas."
"Traumas from the past, traumas from the exodus of 1999, the traumas that still haunt the Albanian Kosovars concerning their almost 4 000 missing friends, acquaintances, brothers, sisters, fathers and mothers."
"Four thousand people are still missing."
"They have either disappeared or they are still locked up in Serbian prisons on very vague charges."
"Traumas from the present as well."
"Is it not true that in the north the international community is in fact applying the secret pact between Milosevic and the Russian generals in which the north of Kosova actually becomes Serbian territory?"
"Whichever way you look at it, the Albanian Kosovars in Mitrovica, 85% of the population, are still being held hostage by the Serbs."
"Unemployment in the Albanian part is two-and-a-half times higher than in the Serbian part."
"The Albanian Kosovars in Mitrovica in the southern part earn two-and-a-half times less than the Serbs in the northern part."
"The international community’s official standpoint is still before status."
"I would therefore like to call for a ‘both-and’ approach."
"We must aim for both and status."
"Only an independent Kosova will bring true peace to the region."
"At least, as long as multi-ethnicity is also respected by the Albanian Kosovars."
"I have received five motions for resolution to wind up this debate in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.(1)"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday."
". – Recent events in Kosovo have completed the ethnic cleansing, with the expulsion of the remaining Serbs and gypsies and the seizure of their property."
"Kosovo's separation from Serbia and the creation of an independent state are being promoted, as pursued by the autonomist organisations of Albanian Kosovars from the beginning, by safeguarding the purity of the Albanian-speaking population."
"The abettor of and main accessory to this crime against hundreds of thousands of Serbs and gypsies is ΝΑΤΟ, together with the ΕU, which agreed with the intervention and the bombings."
"The international NATO force set up in Kosovo in order to apply Security Council Resolution 1441, instead of disarming the criminal gangs of the KLA, as it should have done, proclaimed them the Kosovo Protection Corps."
"The current situation in Kosovo and the tragedy of Yugoslavia in general highlight the extent of the crime committed during the 1990s against the Yugoslavian people and the hypocrisy of the proclamations about protecting human rights from the elected government of President Milosevic made by the invaders when they intervened, preventing it from maintaining order and protecting the inhabitants of Kosovo (of all nationalities) against the action of the KLA."
"We MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece condemn those responsible for this tragedy and express our solidarity with the fight of the Yugoslav people to expel the invaders."
"The next item is the report (Α5-0133/2004) by Mrs Keppelhoff, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on requirements for feed hygiene."
". Mr President, I am very glad that the European Parliament was able to deliver an opinion on the Commission's proposal on feed hygiene for this part-session."
"Despite the fact that the Commission's proposal was adopted in April 2003, I know that the work in Parliament only began last autumn and therefore I want to congratulate Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert for her hard work on this report in such a short period of time."
"The absence of clear, enforceable rules for feed hygiene is one of the final major 'missing links' to complete our 'farm to fork' food safety approach."
"I shall briefly refer to three main points of the proposal."
"First, it provided for the compulsory registration of all feed business establishments by the competent authorities within the Member States."
"Secondly, it aimed to raise hygiene standards through the introduction of Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points – HACCP – principles for feed business operators at all levels other than that of primary production."
"The proposal also envisaged that feed business operators would provide financial guarantees to cover business-related risks such as the costs arising from withdrawing products from the market."
"I am pleased that there has been close cooperation between Parliament, Council and Commission to seek a workable compromise with a view to reaching a first reading agreement in relation to this proposal."
". – Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur on the subject of feedingstuffs and hygiene, I closely followed the debate in two committees, not only in the lead committee – the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, but also in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which is advising it, and I would like to tell the House that, as rapporteur on feed hygiene, I basically welcome the Commission’s efforts to further improve food safety in the EU across the board."
"From farm to table, the criteria for the production of our food should be very clearly defined."
"Quite apart from the harm to food, the food scandals over recent years – BSE, dioxin or nitrophene, for example – cost the European taxpayer a very great deal of money in terms of products recalled."
"That is why I very much welcome the fact that – as Commissioner Byrne has said – the cost of recalls will not, under the Regulation as submitted, be borne by the European Budget as a whole, but, and far more stringently, by the feed business operator, that it is to say the tax payers do not have to pay but the wrongdoers themselves."
"That, I believe, is a reason why the regulation has to very precisely define what a ‘feed business operator’ is."
"I do not think there is any contention about the need for the requirement to take out insurance not to be imposed on farmers who produce cereals or other primary feedingstuffs."
"The recipients in the feed manufacturing industry are already able to analyse and categorise the barley, rye, maize, and so on with which they are supplied."
"On the basis of what I am constantly being told, I believe that the smallest growers of feedingstuffs, whether this be for supply to others or to feed their own farm animals, should be exempted from this Regulation, which would, however, come into effect if additives were to be mixed in, be it by the farmer himself, by the feed manufacturer, or by a mobile mill that comes to farms for that purpose."
"It cannot be acceptable for rules to be made, for the purpose of precautionary insurance cover, some of which it is in fact impossible to comply with."
"I still believe that what we demand politically should not ignore the realities of life, and that applies in particular to threshold values for undesirable substances when compounded, or transferred, and so on, which are increasingly based on what is analytically feasible."
"Let me reiterate that you have lost touch with the protection of health if you go about finding a lump of sugar in Lake Constance."
"To an increasing extent, threshold values are being determined by reference to what modern analysis can do rather than to the potential risk, and we should concentrate on the actual danger posed to the consumers."
"Insurance companies have made it clear to a hearing with the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development that, in the absence of any clear definition of what is meant by ‘risk’, the costs involved in financial guarantees would become quite incalculable, and they would find it very difficult to estimate them."
"My appeal to the producers is that they should start with voluntary insurance."
"That is why, Commissioner, I, as rapporteur, have called in Article 8 for a feasibility study on binding and non-binding guarantees, and if we get one in 12 months’ time, then I am sure we will be able to look further ahead."
"This feasibility study should not only examine the national regulations currently in force, and the systems and practices relating to liability in the feed sector and similar areas at the national level, but should also set out recommendations for such a feasible and practicable guarantee system at EU level."
"So let me say once again, that we should demand politically only those things that are practically feasible."
"Let me take this opportunity to extend warm thanks to all the Members of this House who have joined us in doing serious and constructive work on this topic, particularly, too, the representatives of the Commission, with whom we had really good discussions, and the Irish Presidency of the Council for its good cooperation and especially for its very realistic assessment of what is and is not feasible."
"I am on tenterhooks to see what happens next, and whether we will indeed be able to come to an agreement following first reading."
". Mr President, I thank Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert for her report and also for listening to the ideas that I put forward in the opinion from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"We all recognise the need for feed to be safe."
"If animal feed is safe, then consumers feel safe when eating animal products."
"While we recognise the need to be able to identify and isolate all those producers and feed businesses involved in the food production chain, I believe this should be done without adding another tier of registration."
"We recognise the need for a complete identification of all feed business operators, including farms, by adapting existing regulation systems in order to enable the competent authorities to inspect operators."
"However, national regulation systems which are already in place and functioning for other purposes should be utilised wherever possible to avoid unnecessary duplication and regulation."
"Currently, the majority of farms can be identified through their participation in these schemes."
"I welcome the Commission's proposals whereby feed businesses, except those involved solely in primary production, will be required to adopt the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points principles."
"HACCP is a method of identifying potential hazards and ensuring that proper control strategies are in place, and I welcome that."
"As Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert mentioned, the area of most serious concern in the Commission's proposals is the use of financial guarantees."
"All feed businesses, including farms, would need to fulfil a new requirement of having financial guarantees in place to cover the cost of withdrawn products in the event of a feed safety incident."
"This would be restricted to the withdrawal, treatment and possible destruction of products."
"Having consulted with the farming industry, feed manufacturers and the insurance sector, we find that the consequences of introducing financial guarantees have not been sufficiently analysed."
"The feasibility of financial guarantees or insurance policies has not been properly developed with the industry and it is unclear whether such guarantees would be available from the insurance sector."
"The cost implications for feed manufacturers and farmers from such a guarantee scheme are also unclear."
"Therefore, we would like the Commission to look at this in more detail before bringing this in."
"Finally, we are very concerned that feed coming in from outside the European Union also meets these very strict criteria."
"Mr President, I apologise to Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert for having missed her remarks."
"A mass meeting of the railway workers who have recently been dismissed is taking place outside, and that was where I was."
"I am sorry that we were unable to reach a full compromise agreement on the central issue here – the only one which I have time to address."
"Like Mr Parish, I have listened to, and paid reasonable attention to, the fears that we have not really made a market or tested out a market in terms of the provision of insurance."
"Nevertheless, I believe that at the last meeting of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, with reasonable compromises on both sides, we arrived at a position where a 12-month study could lead – and I believe will lead – to a proper assessment of how insurance provision is made."
"I know that pushes the Commission further than in an ideal world it would like to go."
"However, given that the vast majority of Member States and the Council take this view or a stronger one in terms of the proposals, if we are to achieve any kind of agreement at first reading here there has to be an indication – perhaps there already has been – that we will follow that line."
"I am not personally in favour of a system that shifts to one of voluntarism on an ad hoc basis state by state, nor is my Group."
"We know all our lessons from the history of food problems."
"The provision of food and feed over the years since we first began to introduce a general food and feed law suggests that we need to have measures that apply right across the Community."
"It is no good saying that anyone can opt out of those measures."
"I hope the rapporteur will see that after a proper study and a reasonable length of time – and to me that means 12 months – we will arrive at that position."
"I hope, for its part, the Commission can also accept that."
". Mr President, may I again thank the rapporteur, Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert, and all of those involved in taking this important dossier forward."
"Based on the excellent work done and the informal trialogue between Parliament, Council and Commission, there is, I hope, sufficient agreement between the three institutions to reach resolution in first reading."
"I understand the view expressed in the House in favour of financial guarantees."
"However, I have also to take into account the view of the Council, where there is a qualified majority in favour of deleting the provision on guarantees."
"It is clear to me that if first reading agreement is to be reached, this House will need to support the amendment to delete the guarantees in line with the compromise proposed."
"The Commission could then come forward with a report on all aspects of the situation."
"This would enable full consultation of all economic actors and stakeholders."
"I have to say that a very persuasive factor is the fact that the insurance industry across the Community, including the enlarged Community, is not ready for mandatory financial guarantees across the board."
"There is little point in legislating if we cannot be assured of effective compliance. So I would strongly urge the House to support the amendment in relation to guarantees; otherwise a golden opportunity for first reading agreement will be lost."
"Based on the compromise reached, I understand that the rapporteur has tabled amendments which the Commission can accept and thereby facilitate closure in first reading."
"Finally, I would like to state that a full listing of the Commission's position on the amendments is being provided to Parliament."
"I trust that this will be included in the verbatim report of proceedings of this part-session(1)."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (Α5-0147/2004) by Mrs Thors, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on materials and articles intended to come into contact with food."
