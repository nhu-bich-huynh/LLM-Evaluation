"I want to add that particular piece of information to the answer I gave the other day which included the fact that, on the following day, the issue was brought before the Commission promptly."
"It may be an opportunity for Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf to correct the suggestion he made about the delay, not for my sake but for the sake of the officials who work hard in my Directorate-General and who did an excellent job in this instance."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"Your clarification will be noted in the Minutes."
"Do you wish to speak again, Mr Fischler?"
"Commission. (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am going to make this brief because I said what I had to say at the start of the debate."
"I would like to thank you all very much for your committed contributions but I must also remind you that the task the Commission took on was to investigate the impact the ban on bone and animal meal in feedingstuffs would have on supply and demand."
"It was not to examine the policy of oilseed production in the European Union."
"These are two separate issues."
"We must therefore separate the current additional protein deficit from the situation we already had in the Community."
"It is a fact that approximately 30 million tonnes of soya and soya equivalents are imported every year."
"It is not possible to make up for this deficit, at least using currently available options."
"There is one thing we must not forget: soya beans cannot be planted throughout the Community, but only in regions with a favourable climate."
"We cannot compensate for this on the basis of a policy of subsidies."
"Secondly, I must remind you that the implementation of this policy is subject to the precondition that no distinction is made between promoting protein crops, cereals or other crops."
"This is simply not possible, unless we offer appropriate compensation."
"But what argument can we use to persuade the Americans to renounce the Blair House agreement if we have nothing to offer in return?"
"Please tell me what we can offer to make the Americans agree to our introducing a specific subsidy for protein crops to enable us to produce more proteins."
"This brings me back to the current protein deficit."
"The Commission is criticised for looking at things purely from an economic angle."
"I must ask Parliament whether it is justifiable to pay six times as much in additional subsidies for a kilo of extra soya production than a kilo of soya would cost on the market."
"There is no way round this issue, as we also have a responsibility to the taxpayer."
"By way of conclusion, I would like to point out that the comments I have made here have nothing to do with the report we discussed yesterday evening."
"Naturally, the Commission will continue to ensure that organic farmers will still be able to plant clover and clover grass and other protein crops on their set-aside land as we proposed."
"I only mentioned that this morning because clover and clover grass have only been introduced to a limited extent in pigswill and poultry feed and are used primarily in feedingstuffs for ruminants."
". (DE) Mr President, I could refer to Article 122 but I would rather save time."
"Mr Byrne, thank you for your comment and your answer."
"Once again let me make myself clear."
"It was not my intention to criticise you personally or Mr van Goethem, whom I respect for his good work."
"What is at issue is whether the Commission worked out a disease plan in consultation with the Member States which made clear what had to happen if the disease broke out."
"My view is that not enough preparation was made."
"My comment was not aimed at individuals but rather at the Commission, as an institution, and at the Council, which did not do any preparatory work at all. This mess, which we had to go through in the public gaze, was scandalous."
"My criticism was also levelled at the culling strategy, which had not been properly thought out, and the fact that vaccination and vaccination plus assessment had not been incorporated into the strategy. This has now been conceded by the Commission, which is a step in the right direction."
"Commissioner Fischler, I would like to put another question to you. Assuming, hypothetically speaking, that we did not have this agreement with the Americans and that you were to calculate the cost of planting beans, peas, lupins and so on on set-aside land, would the economic calculation be entirely different?"
"Am I right in thinking that it would?"
"Commission. (DE) Mr President, I do not want to prolong the discussion."
"I would simply like to make the following point clear. If we are dealing exclusively with planting protein crops on set-aside land, then I have to point out that this is not covered by the Blair House agreement but comes under the WTO provisions."
"Accordingly, for a measure to come under the blue box arrangement, appropriate supply reduction measures would have to be adopted."
"Our supply reduction measure is set aside. So it has nothing to do with the Blair House agreement."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"Deadlock in negotiations on the EU/Morocco Fisheries Agreement"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the deadlock in negotiations on the fishing agreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco."
"Mr Fischler has the floor."
"Commission. (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on the issue of the Morocco Fisheries Agreement, I have been very committed from the outset, that is, since I assumed responsibility for the fisheries sector."
"Before the previous agreement came to an end, I made contact with Morocco with a view to concluding a new fisheries agreement."
"However, that was roundly rejected by Morocco for many months. Concrete talks of a new agreement only became possible following a meeting with King Mohammed VI in Casablanca in October last year."
"Since then, seven political rounds of talks and thirteen technical rounds of talks have taken place."
"From the very beginning, the European Union was at pains to show the greatest possible flexibility so as to comply with Moroccan wishes and interests."
"Following my visit to Rabat in February this year, I had to conclude that the gulf between the two positions could not be bridged, in particular, because of the compensation demands by Morocco for the catch facilities that were being offered."
"As regards fishing facilities, especially under the technical framework conditions of the fisheries sector, in other words, in which zones, at what times, and in what vessels, fishing could take place in Morocco, there were, in some cases, major differences of opinion."
"Following my return in February, I immediately apprised the Council of the situation so as to sound out alternatives with the Fisheries Ministers."
"The Council requested me to make a final attempt to reach an agreement on the basis of the existing negotiation mandate."
"On that basis, on 26 March, I met Minister Chbaatou in Brussels."
"Unfortunately, however, this meeting too was a total failure."
"During the course of the negotiations, the Commission put forward a number of proposals to promote the development of the Moroccan fisheries sector, for example, to provide resources to develop the port infrastructure and services sector in Morocco, to promote and develop coastal fisheries, to promote training and research and to develop aquaculture."
"We would have accepted very extensive landing obligations in Moroccan ports, which would have meant a radical change in the traditional fishing activities of many Spanish and Portuguese fishermen, but would also have contributed to the development of the Moroccan sector."
"Moreover, we agreed to increase the proportion of Moroccan crewmembers on board vessels so as to improve the employment situation and the level of training in the Moroccan fishing sector."
"In addition, we would have accepted further extensive reductions in catches in order to maintain resources in Moroccan waters."
"For example, in the first year we would have accepted a drastic reduction in the presence of the European Union in Moroccan waters compared with under the previous agreement. The following two years would have seen a phasing out of cephalopod and shrimp fishing."
"We would also have accepted new technical conditions which would have been less advantageous for the Community fleet and would have reduced fishing costs."
"Despite this raft of concessions and despite the progress the Moroccan side has made following the negotiations, the following basic differences of opinion remain."
"Firstly, the fishing conditions proposed by Morocco would have meant that the economic benefit for our fishermen would have been lost as we would have had to fish with considerably fewer ships in fewer fishing zones, and we would have had to accept longer periods in which fishing was banned."
"Secondly, the European Union is of the view that financial compensation must be reasonably proportionate to the offered catch facilities."
"Not only is this our general political guideline, it is also stated in the negotiation mandate of October 1999."
"In any case, we evaluated the financial part not only in purely economic terms; we also took political considerations into account, such as the need to have good political relations with Morocco."
"In return for our proposal for a fisheries agreement we offered Morocco compensation of EUR 70 million for the first year, 60 million for the second year and 40 million for the third year."
"This offer was very advantageous to Morocco for a number of reasons. Firstly, we calculated our financial compensation package on the basis of the fishing facilities in the final year of the previous agreement and not on the basis of the average of the last agreement."
"That alone means a price advantage of 15% for Morocco."
"Secondly, in our calculation we made no distinction between types of fish, even though we would have accepted greater reductions in the case of more expensive and, for the European Union, more interesting types of fish such as cephalopods and shrimp."
"This also gives a price advantage for Morocco."
"Thirdly, we did not take the landing obligations in Morocco into account in our calculation."
"Fourthly, in the end I increased the compensation resulting from the calculation by 20% in order to demonstrate that we understood Morocco' s concerns about the development of its own sector."
"On top of all that, at the last meeting with the Moroccan Fisheries Minister, Mr Chbaatou, I once again made it clear that our offer, which I have described above, was a more than fair price for the catch facility. I also told him that we were once again prepared to fork out EUR 5 million a year to prove our good intention for the conclusion of an agreement."
"However, the Moroccan Minister stressed that Morocco had no room for manoeuvre."
"Given the stance taken by Morocco, I do not see any possibility of concluding an agreement on the basis of our mandate."
"That is the message I will be taking to the Fisheries Council on 25 April."
"But the question of what will happen to the affected ship owners and fishermen, who have now been condemned to idleness for more than a year, is becoming increasingly pressing."
"As you know, since 1 December 1999, we have made compensation payments to ship owners and fishermen out of the Fisheries Fund."
"We have made all our preparations in line with the conclusions of the Nice Summit."
"There is currently a Commission proposal with Parliament and also with the Council, whereby compensation payments will be extended to 30 June of this year."
"We have also proposed leaving the 4% limit out of consideration for compensation payments."
"We estimate that, so far, a total of approximately EUR 80 million have been paid out to affected fishermen and ship owners, 20 million of which were raised by the Member States themselves. This equates to a Community share of EUR 60 million, some 51 million of which have gone to Spain and 9 million to Portugal."
"One thing is clear, however, additional measures and funds are necessary to secure the future of the Spanish and Portuguese fishing sectors."
"In my view, we must act in three key areas."
"Firstly, we should try to find alternative fishing facilities in other third countries, at least to a certain extent."
"Secondly, we must help to develop alternative employment opportunities for the affected populations, perhaps in aquaculture, or in tourism, or in the service sector, or wherever an opportunity arises."
"Thirdly, as we do in other cases, we must also support the breaking up of vessels for which no alternative use can be found."
"To this end we will exploit all the room for negotiation at the disposal of the Commission."
"However, we will have to approach the budgetary authority in this connection regarding the 2002 budget."
"The next step must be for us to report back to the Fisheries Council."
"Finally, I would like to stress that I very much regret the unbending stance adopted by Morocco, which has made an agreement which is advantageous to both sides impossible."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Fischler, we know that you have done everything you can."
"Others left you a veritable time bomb preventing you from reaching another agreement: the promise and the agreement in the previous one not to renew it."
"We all knew that it was difficult for you."
"Even so, after seventeen months, thirteen technical meetings, your personal involvement on seven occasions and that of the President of the Commission himself on one occasion, which is unprecedented, Morocco was persuaded to sit down and negotiate."
"It was little more than that, however."
"Morocco never wanted the agreement and showed it by imposing its intransigence and its unfair and unacceptable conditions, which the sector itself rejected as uneconomical and impossible to take on."
"We always said that we would prefer no agreement to a bad agreement; and this is what Morocco is proposing, despite the generous, reasonable offers from the European Union, which are beneficial to both parties."
"Morocco is within its rights but, having got to this point, should we carry on?"
"I think that if Morocco wants an agreement with the European Union, it knows perfectly well what it has to offer."
"However, if it has not been reached in seventeen months, I think it unlikely that it will be reached now."
"Therefore, Mr Fischler, you should take note of this and inform the College of Commissioners of Morocco' s intransigence in co-operating with the European Union."
"We will be watching the development of bilateral relations between the European Union and Morocco very carefully, both in political terms, as you mentioned, and in economic, financial and trade terms."
"Why is Morocco rejecting more than EUR 200 million in three years, investment from European ship owners, the possible creation of joint ventures to develop its sector, the wealth that the catches could generate in its ports?"
"Why is it rejecting a gradual reduction of the European fleet over three years, while in private it authorises private Asian companies to use its fishing grounds?"
"This is quite legitimate, but can the European Union not guarantee better than anyone that its resources will be rationally preserved and fished responsibly?"
"Who in Morocco is really going to benefit from the lack of an agreement?"
"These are the key points."
"I stress, Mr Fischler, that you should take careful note of all this but, following this upset with Morocco, I think that we must look to the future."
"The situation is of course difficult, serious, and unprecedented."
"It is not impossible to solve, however."
"I therefore ask everyone for generosity and solidarity, employers and fishermen, unions and political parties."
"And we need to ask the European Union to make a special effort."
"The Nice European Council, incidentally at the request of the Spanish Government and José María Aznar, agreed - another unprecedented thing - to support the demands and, if they failed, the negotiations and, if these did not succeed either, asked the Commission for a specific action programme, as set out in No 59 of the Nice conclusions."
"I ask you, Mr Fischler, for your commitment and understanding."
"Fishing in the European Union asks for it now more than ever."
"I ask for your personal political commitment to get involved in the pending fishing negotiations with third countries, Senegal and Mauritania first of all, and to open up new negotiations and explore new fishing grounds."
"This is the future for redeploying the fleet, which is the priority aim; and at the same time, with the funds not used for Morocco, I ask you to support a broad social programme for fishermen and for the most affected areas, with alternative economic projects to restart their economies."
"Your experience with the CAP should be useful to us so that, for the first time, programmes of this type can be adopted in fisheries."
"I will conclude by saying that Morocco dealt a hard blow to the European fisheries sector and therefore to the European Union."
"Now, however, we have to adopt a realistic, constructive and responsible attitude."
"It has the support of Parliament, which will actively defend the sector."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I think that the time bomb is the one that we have here, now, as we are talking about an unprecedented failure of negotiations, which is not your failure, Mr Fischler, but that of many people, which leaves 4 400 Community fishermen and 415 vessels unemployed."
"Those affected in my country feel that they have been deceived by their political leaders, who have always denied the problems in the negotiations, and the fact that there were deadlines for concluding them."
"This is not the case for you, Mr Fischler."
"How are they are going to believe in relocation to other fishing grounds if we all know that increasing the fishing effort would put resources at risk or would make the activity unprofitable?"
"Why did the negotiations fail?"
"Despite your efforts as Commissioner, which I recognise, a common strategy was lacking, not on your part, but on the part of the Commission, and above all, the Council."
"You reminded me of the responsibility of ministers, whom you said were informed at all times and had taken part in the most recent rounds of negotiations."
"Although the formal responsibility for negotiating lies with the Commission, the governments can and should prepare the way for agreement."
"You said that what the European Union was offering was not bad; the attitude of the Moroccan Government was not that of a loyal partner."
"We think, however, that the framework for negotiation was the association agreement with Morocco."
"Maybe eleven months ago it was not right to mix fisheries and agriculture, but we have to remember that Morocco is still benefiting from agricultural concessions obtained in parallel with the fishery negotiations in 1992 and 1995, and that the European Union is the main importer of Moroccan fisheries, agricultural and industrial products."
"You said to me at the time that no good would come of such a mix and that it was better to trust our partners."
"We have trusted them and we have seen that on the same day that the negotiations broke down, Morocco was signing a fishing co-operation agreement with Japan, and while it was giving us the reasons of preserving resources, it was granting licences to Community and other vessels and fleets."
"The sector and the public want to know what measures the Commission is going to take following the collapse of these negotiations."
"In your speech you talked again about another mandate."
"Is another mandate possible?"
"Do you think that we would change anything with another mandate?"
"Do you think that the negotiations have finished for good, or is it possible to restart them with a new mandate?"
"Mr President, today more than ever, I wish to speak on behalf of the fishermen and ship owners of Andalusia, the Canary Islands, Galicia, Barbanza, Morrazo, of La Guardia, and of the people of Spain and Portugal who need and who continue to call for a fisheries agreement to be signed between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco."
"They are calling for fair agreements which will be of mutual benefit, in line with the whole range of economic, social, political and human relations established in 1995, defining the neighbourly relationship between our countries and the Maghreb State."
"They are calling for an agreement on appropriate terms, which has been repeatedly approved by this Parliament and they do not accept the negotiations undertaken without faith or conviction by the Commission over the last 16 months to be valid or fitting. Nor do they accept the failure that has been announced."
"For the same reason, I cannot accept the dismantling of the European fleet in Canary-Saharan waters and nor is it feasible to relocate or transfer them safely to other fishing banks where, furthermore, it would compete with other European boats."
"Nor can we leave 4400 fishermen redundant and the coastal communities that live mainly from fishing are not in a position to find new ways of earning a living overnight."
"We must not accept that their future lies in early retirement for the older people or in emigration for the younger ones."
"The communities I represent demand that the Commission returns to the negotiating table to conclude the fishing agreement with Morocco."
"They demand that the Member States, specifically the Spanish Government, abandon their passive or complicit attitude and bring into play the political and economic resources necessary to conclude new negotiations."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, we are facing a European problem that is affecting European citizens and which is undermining the very credibility of the Union' s institutions and their ability to address a critical aspect of international relations for which they have responsibility, such as fisheries."
"There is no reason to consider the agreement to be in conflict with preserving Morocco' s fish stocks. I am convinced that this will benefit the collective interests of the Moroccan people."
"Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, my group would like to thank you for all the efforts that you have made in these negotiations, even more so when we think that what was lacking was not a fishery negotiation strategy, but an overall strategy."
"In 1995 my group maintained that the fisheries agreement with Morocco should be included as part of the text of the European association agreement with Morocco."
"The reason was obvious: between partners facilities need to be established in both directions."
"Morocco needs access to the Community market, and the Community fisheries sector needs access to fishing grounds that it has traditionally worked in."
"Morocco' s reasons cannot be found in preservation of resources."
"Due to a lack of time, I am not going to give examples."
"The association agreement took an unambiguous stand on Community concessions to Morocco and today we find ourselves without a fisheries agreement."
"The consequences of the lack of an agreement are the loss of 4 000 direct jobs and 20 000 on land."
"There may be a solution in seeking other fishing grounds for part of the fleet, but it is very difficult for the small-scale and inshore fleets."
"If Morocco is intending to act as a partner, it should open up its waters to the Community small-scale fleet immediately."
"Commissioner, among your measures, you yourself talked about increasing the European Union' s room for manoeuvre."
"Soon the association agreement will have to be revised and Morocco will surely once again make demands for trade concessions that will even affect the same Community regions that are currently being seriously affected by the lack of a fisheries agreement."
"Commissioner, I hope that the European Union finds this room for manoeuvre when the time comes to revise the association agreement."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, as you know, this matter is of particular concern to Portugal and to Portuguese fishermen, particularly in the Sesimbra and Algarve regions."
"We have been, to a certain extent, surprised, after the last debate that we held in this House, in which we were informed that an agreement was possible, at the sudden news that the whole thing has collapsed."
"I understand the complexity of the problem and I am shocked at the intransigence of Morocco' s position."
"Nevertheless, I wish to ask the following questions: with regard to the difference in financial compensation between the European Union' s proposal and Morocco' s and according to the information I have, it has been more than compensated for by the sum of Community aid allocated to Morocco under various headings and also by the trade compensations or advantages it has gained under other agreements."
"The question is whether the Commission is able to produce an overall strategy with Morocco."
"I understand a country deciding to sell its resources to the highest bidder - it has political freedom to do so - but I also consider that any country that does so will have less need for international cooperation aid."
"I should also like to remind you, on this subject, of what the resolution adopted in this Parliament in 1999 said: ever-closer cooperation between the European Union and Morocco cannot exclude existing relations in the field of fisheries, I should also like to know what support measures for converting the fishing fleet are being put in place."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are three observations we can make about these negotiations, which have ended in failure: the first concerns Morocco' s great unwillingness to show flexibility in their negotiations."
"I understand Morocco' s wishing to place a high value on its fish stocks but the lives of communities and of their economic relationships are founded on compromise."
"The European Union has made concessions to Morocco, by opening up its markets to many of that country' s products, including agricultural produce, and by opening up its doors to several million Moroccan citizens who have adopted the European Union as their homeland."
"This is why it is so difficult to understand this absence of any reciprocal attitude on the part of Morocco."
"I hope that the European Union will draw conclusions from this episode, both for its future cooperation with Morocco and for its own common fisheries policy."
"My second observation is that the effort made by the Commission and especially by Commissioner Fischler, have stood in stark contrast with the passive approach of the Council and of the various presidencies of the European Union, including that of my own country."
"Can this be because the agreement directly served the interests of only two countries?"
"Or can it be that the governments of those two countries were not sufficiently forceful to protect their own interests?"
"These are questions that require answers."
"My third observation is that we need to lay the ground for the future, but this cannot be done with financial compensation alone, when fisherman are standing idle and when we are compensated for ships to be scrapped."
"The failure of these negotiations must give the European Union food for thought with regard to the future of its common fisheries policy."
"I see three main routes here."
"Firstly there is the need to create new political and financial instruments for facilitating new methods of cooperation and business partnership with countries that are rich in fishing resources."
"Secondly, the next agreements with third countries must demonstrate serious political commitment."
"Thirdly, there is a need for a genuine revolution in the management of fish stocks."
"Lastly, Morocco' s refusal is a mystery to me."
"Is it possible to find out the real reasons for this refusal?"
"If we can discover the reasons, why can we then not consider a possible new negotiating mandate?"
"Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, we are neither in a North African bazaar nor in a European marketplace."
"We are in a political assembly."
"We are not market traders; we are politicians."
"This is the viewpoint we should adopt when considering the failure of this agreement with Morocco."
"It seems that Morocco has behaved arrogantly towards Europe and the Union must really not forget this."
"I personally shall not."
"It is also worth asking, however, and in fact it has been asked, whether the Council may have adopted a somewhat aloof or passive attitude."
"This question remains to be answered."
"We might also ask whether the fact that this issue only affects two of the Union' s countries may have had some influence."
"This is undoubtedly true, and the Union has lost credibility in the eyes of the Portuguese people - and of the Spanish people too, I presume - and this is the main political concern that I wish to highlight."
"Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance regrets the fact that an agreement could not be reached."
"Our position has always been that we hoped an agreement would be reached, but with one extremely important proviso, namely that the agreement had to be mutually acceptable and beneficial to both sides."
"It turns out that such an agreement is not possible."
"That is unfortunate, but we must respect the right of Morocco to determine how to exploit its resources in its own waters."
"It has the right to self-determination and it has the right to look for the best deal possible for itself."
"In its Green Paper, the Commission sets very great store by the legitimate aspirations of developing states to develop their fishing industry, and the Greens very much agree with this principle."
"Another issue in the Green Paper is the commitment of the European Community to the precautionary principle and the conservation of stocks."
"The April 2000 report by the Scientific, Technical Economic Committee for Fisheries reviews the status of the stocks off Morocco, as well as other countries in west Africa."
"They do not paint a very optimistic picture for anchovy, cuttlefish, demersal fish, black hake and sardinella."
"The report says that there is no information on the status of these stocks."
"The report also notes that octopus and hake fisheries are over-exploited and reductions in effort are needed."
"It was also pointed out that there was a huge ignorance of the amount of fishing actually being conducted by EU vessels and this is a really important and very worrying point."
"There was also the lack of guarantee for the protection of small-scale coastal fisheries."
"Finally, we are pleased that compensation and funds for restructuring of fleets has been made available, but we also have to look at the overall fisheries policy within the European Union."
"We cannot keep searching around the world for more and more places to transfer our over-capacity to."
"We have to be realistic and realise that we must solve the problem from within."
"Mr President, taking account of the statements made by Commissioner Fischler, we seemed to have reached the end of a process that has been dragging on since November 1999, with damaging socio-economic consequences for the Community fleet operating in that area and for the fishing communities that have traditionally depended on those fishing grounds."
"The question I would like to put is whether it is still possible to begin the negotiation of a new fisheries agreement with Morocco, with acceptable conditions."
"The Moroccan proposals on reformulating the previous agreement were unacceptable and some people in the sector even wondered whether a bad agreement was really better than no agreement."
"In any event, as a result, Portugal now has around 30 boats and over 600 fishermen without any visible future."
"In addition to extending aid, it is becoming crucial that the European Union guarantees compensation support for the fleet, to the fishermen and the areas affected, by supporting a programme of converting the boats that fished in Moroccan waters, guaranteeing the relocation to other fishing grounds covered by Community fisheries agreements and, of course, by considering changing the common fisheries policy."
"Commission. (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to react just briefly to the very enthusiastic debate we are witnessing here today."
"To begin with, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the start of a new agreement, or the start of negotiations for a new agreement, was always going to be difficult because no agreement had been reached in the previous agreement that there would be a successor agreement."
"That naturally meant that, for months, the Moroccan side put forward the argument that, so to speak, there was an agreement that no new agreement would be concluded at all and that the Commission and the negotiators of the previous agreement had promised this."
"Secondly, we must be clear about one thing. I do not believe we are sending out the right signal, if we say that there must be an agreement at all costs."
"I have drawn your attention to the fact that the Moroccan side has said that it is not prepared to grant us more or better fishing facilities than they did last time or to back away from its financial demands."
"If we accept, however, the financial demands for the fishing facilities that are being offered, then we will be creating a precedent for all the other third country agreements that we have."
"We will drive up the cost for all these other agreements to an extent that would simply be irresponsible."
"Naturally, the Moroccan side is at liberty to send us an improved proposal."
"I told the Minister as much."
"It would be a good thing, however, if that were to happen before the Council of Fisheries Ministers is held."
"Given the current circumstances, I do not believe it makes any sense. You must bear one thing in mind, however."
"If we conclude this agreement as it stands, there will be no economic benefit for the fishermen of Spain and Portugal, which means we will have to restructure the fleet from scratch."
"That, however, would take place under conditions whereby very few resources would be available to us because most would be bound up for the next three years in a bad agreement."
"I would once again like to stress just how important it is that we set about supporting the sector in question as well as we can."
"We are all called upon to do that: the Commission, the budgetary authorities, Parliament and the Council."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"Expenditure on CFP control, inspection and surveillance systems"
"The next item is the report (A5­0098/2001) by Mr Jové Peres, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council decision on a financial contribution by the Community to certain expenditure incurred by the Member States in implementing the control, inspection and surveillance systems applicable to the common fisheries policy [COM(2000) 684 - C5­0583/2000 - 2000/0273(CNS)]"
", rapporteur."
"(ES) Mr President, the proposal for a Council decision represents the continuation of a policy of providing Member States with financial support to fund infrastructure required by this fundamental pillar of the common fisheries policy."
"The proposal establishes the priority of implementing new technologies, using IT networks, possibly making satellite monitoring systems standard practice, training officials responsible for policing and the intervention systems which need to be introduced in order to meet the Union' s obligations to regional fisheries organisations."
"Although in general the Commission' s proposal is acceptable, there are two aspects that conflict with the line adopted by the Committee on Fisheries and the European Parliament in other matters closely related with the one that we are dealing with."
"Parliament has highlighted in recent reports on regional fisheries organisations that responsibility for control and surveillance within them should be solely that of the Community, and that it should be up to the institutions of the European Union, and particularly the Commission, to adopt the necessary measures to meet these obligations. As a result, it is logical that the action should be funded from the Community budget."
"Given that the regional fisheries organisations are going to increase in importance in the future of the common fisheries policy, it is appropriate to follow the line defined by previous reports adopted by Parliament."
"From the Commission proposal it can be understood that in the future the contribution to the work of the regional fisheries organisations would also be entrusted, at least partly, to the Member States, as would the tasks of inspection and monitoring."
"While there is a common fisheries policy and the Community has powers in the area of fisheries, it should act as such and equip itself with the human and financial resources to deal with its obligations, as required by the principle of sufficient resources for the common fisheries policy."
"Applying this principle has financial implications and requires legal developments and perhaps giving up some sovereignty, but, if a certain model of political construction is accepted, the resources need to be put in place so that the model can be put into practice."
"The current situation does not exactly square with this model, as core responsibility for control lies with the Member States, and there is a need for a reasonable period for adapting the structures to the aforementioned model."
"It is up to the Member States, on a transitional basis, perhaps for the three years covered by the programme contained in this decision, to continue to exercise these responsibilities as representatives of the Union."
"However, this is no obstacle to reimbursing the Member States immediately for the full amount of the expenditure arising from these Community obligations, and for that reason, instead of co-funding, 100% of that expenditure should be reimbursed."
"This is the aim of Amendment No 1 of the draft report."
"The reference in the Explanatory Memorandum to the decision to establishing a reduction of EUR 41 to 35 million per year in spending on control operations is surprising, since it is very likely that the establishment of an adequate infrastructure for the control and surveillance programmes will require that today' s financial burden be increased rather than reduced in the future."
"Amendment No 2 raises the percentage of Community funding for acquiring and modernising inspection and control equipment from 30% to 35%."
"The majority of investment has already been made in this respect and the majority of future action will be in terms of modernisation."
"In any case, as the investment is costly and - we should not forget this - we are talking about control of a common policy, the percentage of Community funding should be slightly increased."
"To conclude, I must confess that I was tempted to begin a more detailed discussion about the future of the control system after the reform."
"However, the experiences of recent reports which, by looking into the future, have lost some of their effectiveness, led me to take a more modest and immediate approach."
"Mr President, once again what most stands out to me about the Commission proposal is the imbalance between the importance that it says it attaches to certain issues and the means that it then puts in place in order to resolve them."
"If we believed solely in the declarations of intent, it would seem that the Commission really does see the fisheries control policy as a top priority."
"The Explanatory Memorandum to this proposal commends the importance of this policy as part of the common fisheries policy, which it describes as crucial, a description that with which we all agree."
"The Green Paper that was recently presented goes even further, saying that either the system must be improved, or a fatal blow will be dealt to the credibility of the CFP."
"However, when the moment of truth comes, we are once again seeing that, following great declarations, two of the three essential elements are missing, and neither are the sufficient resources provided to carry out the measures, nor is the essential policy of transparency followed in order to make them credible."
"It is impossible to understand how, when this policy is such a priority, and it is so essential to reinforce it, the budget allocated to it on this occasion is not only not being increased, but is being decreased from EUR 41 to 35 million per year."
"Also, this being the third decision from the Commission going the same way, this time the Commission has not made the report on the results of previous measures public, so that we do not know, aside from whether the choice of the measures to be funded was more or less correct, whether they achieved practical results, including the highly desirable results of linking the sector to this policy, which until now was described as discriminatory and confused in Community waters and weak and lacking credibility outside them."
"We therefore support the more than pertinent comments from the rapporteur in this respect, and all of his amendments and, more specifically, those that stress to the Commission that this House believes that, if the Commission has the powers regarding the regional fisheries organisations, it also has the political and financial responsibility for implementing the appropriate measures. This of course includes control measures, in which the European Union is putting the credibility of its supposed commitment to sustainability of resources on the line in the eyes of the world."
"Mr President, as we have heard this morning, Morocco is currently eclipsing the EU' s fisheries policy."
"I can well understand this as the consequences of the failure to conclude a fisheries agreement for the Iberian Peninsula are enormous for all of us."
"I had the opportunity to convince myself of that just a short time ago."
"Nevertheless, we must not remain paralysed; we must look at other important aspects of the CFP which were covered by the report tabled by Jové Peres."
"Let me get straight to the point. Surveillance of fisheries is not everything, but without surveillance everything else is pointless."
"We know from our day-to-day experience that, without real and effective controls, the European fisheries policy would be nothing but a bubble of air."
"We need to make progress and adapt ourselves to modern developments."
"At a conference organised by the Commission last October in Brussels, reference was made to the international aspects of control."
"We need a global approach."
"The proposals tabled to this effect by the Commission are just as important as the provisions in the new Green Paper on the reform of the CFP."
"Responsibility for the carrying out of controls is clearly regulated."
"It lies with the Member States."
"Financial support from the Community is of course imperative, particularly if we are talking about an equal, across-the-board level of control."
"We need the support of the Community to bring about efficient modern controls in the future."
"I am using the word 'modern' quite deliberately and here the Commission has set the right priorities: the introduction of modern technologies, the use of information networks, the use of satellite surveillance systems and better training of surveillance staff."
"We must, however, think carefully about whether reducing the resources for the implementation of control measures is the right approach."
"I think that, in implementing these controls, we should be sending other signals, namely in terms of the priorities of the CFP."
"So an appropriate budget is of paramount importance."
"Commission. (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Peres, I am very pleased that you have accepted the Commission proposal so positively and I would like to thank you very warmly for the work you have done."
"Your report shows that, by and large, we are in agreement."
"The financial involvement of the Community in the surveillance expenditure of the Member States has so far yielded very positive results."
"Since, however, there are still many shortcomings to rectify in the area of surveillance, it must continue."
"Indeed the new measures must be adapted to current circumstances, as you called for in your report."
"Now I will come to the amendments. The Commission is able to accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 5 and 6 as they stand."
"Amendment No 3 seeks to add an additional recital, Recital 12, on the budgetary mechanism."
"We agree with you on the merits of the issue. There is no problem with that."
"But we do not think it is necessary to present the entire budgetary mechanism in the form of a recital."
"Moreover, it is also superfluous, because there is no equivalent in the procedural part of the decision."
"The Commission is unable to accept Amendment No 4, which calls for the reimbursement of up to 100% of the expenditure of Member States by the Community, as this would mean that the Community would not only take on 100% sole financial responsibility but also the accompanying sole political responsibility."
"As far as Amendment No 7 is concerned, the Commission is unfortunately unable to keep to the proposed date of 30 June to take a decision on the choice of surveillance expenditure which will be co-financed by the Community."
"The reason for this is that the Member States are to be given time up to this date to send us their reports on their surveillance expenditure."
"And we can only take a decision afterwards."
"But in future years we will be able to take our decision by 30 June."
"A change to the comitology procedure in this case, as you propose, is unfortunately not impossible."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today, at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was suspended at 11.55 a.m. until voting time)"
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"I have just heard the news that one of the assistants from my office in Brussels has been robbed at knifepoint, at the edge of the woods which are only yards away from the Parliament building."
"Apart from that incident, I have also had reports from my staff that they have been threatened on previous occasions near the building, both on that side and on the section between the building and the railway station, particularly in the early evening."
"I would like investigations to take place to improve the security for Members of the European Parliament and their staff in the area around our building in Brussels."
"I will certainly pass your request to the security service, Mr Kirkhope."
"I think the Quaestors should probably get involved too."
"Mr President, I do not know whether Mr Wim van Velzen is present in the Chamber."
"I would like him to hear my speech, but, in any case, I feel it necessary to inform you and all the Members that the comments made by Mr van Velzen about myself were unfounded."
"Mr van Velzen has criticised me twice in this House, in my absence."
"According to him, I was not consistent and correct in upholding human rights while I was in Cuba with Mr Wiebenga and Mrs Eriksson for a meeting of the Interparliamentary Union."
"I would like to say that, at the very moment when Mr van Velzen was making this point in this House - at about 5 p.m. on Monday in Strasbourg, which was 11 a.m. in Cuba - I was talking to Mr Elizardo Sánchez, the director of the Cuban Committee for Human Rights and National Reconciliation, who, in the hall of his house, was showing me the photographs he had taken with José Maria Aznar, Felipe González and our fellow Member, Mário Soares."
"Moreover, together with Mr Sánchez were all the representatives of the Cuban opposition."
"Now, this is a fact, not empty words."
"The delegation of the European Parliament represented this institution correctly, meeting with all the organisations of the Cuban democratic opposition even though we were not bound to do so by duty."
"I am not asking Mr van Velzen to apologise because there is no need."
"I would like to thank all the Members, my group Chairman and Mr Seguro for what they said, but I am sure that there will be no need next time."
"Should I be criticised over human rights in the future, there will be no need for Mr Barón Crespo or Mr Seguro to take the floor because Mr Wim van Velzen will be the first to rise in this House."
"I repeat - he does not need to apologise - next time, he will be the one to defend me against any totally unfounded accusations or criticism."
"Parliament takes note of your statement, Mr Imbeni, as a personal statement pursuant to Rule 122 of the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, there will be no debate."
"Mr Wim van Velzen, who is my deputy and a distinguished colleague, cannot be here today because he has to be in Sofia on behalf of our political group."
"I would like to say to you Mr Imbeni, as Vice-President of the European Parliament that, despite all our political differences, you are also a distinguished colleague and Vice-President."
"I suggest that you get together with Mr Imbeni, with my participation if you like, to discuss the background, which I and most of us here know nothing about."
"We must be united, Mr Imbeni, when we are dealing with defending human rights. All of us in this House must be united."
"Thank you for that felicitous proposal, Mr Poettering."
"Welcome"
"VOTE"

"Before the vote on Amendment No 3"
"- (DE) Mr President, I would very much like to ask those who proposed Amendment No 9 to withdraw it."
"I will explain why."
"Many of us in this House, probably all of us, want the neighbouring countries of Macedonia and Greece to reach agreement on the name - whether it is going to be FYROM or Macedonia."
"If a vote on this takes place today, I am afraid that it will not turn out positively, or at least with a very small majority, which would not be in line with what the proposers intended."
"I would therefore like to ask that this proposed amendment be withdrawn."
"The proposers' feelings have been expressed, and these are the feelings of many of us in this House, but I believe that the amendment as it stands should not be presented today, especially since Greece and Macedonia/FYROM are on the brink of an agreement."
"Mr President, over the past few weeks, we have seen how important a stable Macedonia is which is able to solve its internal disagreements."
"Moreover, Macedonia has been declaring for the past ten years that it has no desire whatsoever to change its national borders."
"I therefore see no reason whatsoever why Macedonia could not choose its own name. In all honesty, I do not welcome the fact that the Greek Members of the large groups have, in my view, once again managed to hold their groups hostage."
"Having said that, it would be even worse if a majority of this Parliament were to declare that Macedonia should be denied this right."
"That is why I am prepared to withdraw the amendment now, but I would call on the Greek Members finally to face the truth and grant Macedonia the right to choose its own name."
"If I have understood you correctly, Mr Lagendijk, you are withdrawing this amendment and appealing to the good sense of Parliament."
"Mr President, all I want to say is that state called FYROM exists only because of Greek support at the moment."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Motion for a resolution (B5-0246/2001) by Mr Miranda, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation on the third UN Conference on the Least Developed Countries to be held in Brussels from 14 to 20 May 2001"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, could you please check whether Amendment No 2 of the Liberal Group on the resolution on foot-and-mouth disease has actually been voted on?"
"I myself have my doubts."
"Could you also inform me of what would happen if that appeared not to be the case?"
"I can in any event assure you that this amendment still reflects the liberal group' s position, and perhaps you could record this as such in the declaration of vote."
"However, I have the strong suspicion that this amendment was not voted on at all."
"Piecyk Report (A5-0111/2001)"
"The Piecyk report from the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism approves the conciliation agreement between the European Parliament and the Council on the criteria to be applied to seaports, inland ports and intermodal terminals so that they can become eligible for funding under the heading of the trans-European networks (TEN)."
"We can support the rapporteur' s determination to pursue the development of the infrastructure needed by port installations at European level."
"European public finance for the development of public facilities, in order to achieve better land use, balance the means of transport more effectively, and fight pollution, is undoubtedly a priority."
"Public funding, however, must be for public facilities and public services."
"Now the ambiguity facing the European Union, which recurs in this report, revolves specifically around the future status, public or private, of port installations."
"On the one hand, the Council is promoting the trans-European networks, while on the other, it is planning privatisations in these sectors, as in the directive presented on 14 February on opening up competition for port services, for example."
"Europe never thinks about the needs of peoples and societies, only about opening up and competition."
"Mr President, as I am sure you are aware, for you listen avidly to all my explanations of vote, I was born in Genoa, a coastal city, and I have worked as a sailor in the past."
"Therefore, there is nothing so important to me as this document, which seeks to help and improve Europe's sea- and inland ports, as Mr Piecyk's report outlines so well."
"This is why I voted for this document, in the hope that Europe will continue to concern itself with issues relating to sailors, the sea and ports."
"Lehne recommendation for second reading (A5-0090/2001)"
"Mr President, Mr Lehne's highly competent report on this subject includes an amendment proposed by Parliament - Amendment No 18 - which provides for an anti-money laundering check to take effect for premium amounts exceeding EUR 10 000, whereas the Commission proposed to perform checks on these payments when the premiums exceeded just EUR 2 500."
"I feel that the European Parliament's amendment is timely, and that is what convinced me to vote for the report."
"Indeed, I feel that we must not exaggerate with our checks on money transfers, although checks are necessary, or we will exacerbate the situation by overburdening these transfers with excessively heavy regulations that can only make things worse."
"Unlike what usually happens, with the European Parliament calling for stricter measures than the Council, in the case of Directive 91/308/EC on legalising the proceeds from illegal activities, or money laundering, the European Parliament is basically annulling and retracting the new measures proposed."
"Where they apply to new lawyers and the confidentiality which has to govern their activities, the European Parliament is entitled to call for an exemption."
"However, the same does not apply to professions such as accountants, tax advisers, brokers, notaries, auction houses etc., which must report any suspicion of money laundering to the authorities."
"That is why these categories should not be approved and why I voted against the amendments in question."
"The little war of amendments between Parliament and the Council throws light on the contradictions tying them both up in knots as they claim to be combating money laundering without daring to get to the heart of the matter."
"If the laundering of money earned from drugs or illegal trafficking is to be effectively combated, banking confidentiality and business confidentiality have to be eliminated, not just suspended in a restricted way, and not just in court."
"That would mean, however, revealing to public opinion the multitude of ways of accumulating capital and using it that are legal but still criminal in terms of the elementary interests of society."
"That would be unacceptable to those who champion profit and the right of those who benefit from it to make what use of it they like."
"They should not be surprised at their own powerlessness against those who push the logic of profit to the point of criminality."
"We have no intention of endorsing these ineffective measures with our vote, any more than the laundering of capital, which is legal certainly, but acquired at the price of exploitation and used to the detriment of society."
"The directive on combating money laundering is a step in the right direction and responds, at least in part, to the aspirations of citizens' movements and the proposals made by the judges most concerned about the issue."
"Unfortunately, apart from one amendment, Amendment No 2, which extends the obligations of the directive to chartered accountants, and one other, Amendment No 27, which mentions OLAF and a possible European public prosecutor, Mr Lehne' s report does its best to reduce the scope of the directive."
"As he, himself, puts it: 'the right of clients to confidentiality must not be undermined, even when the aim is to fight money laundering' ."
"Absurd pretexts are then added to that argument (complicated and completely useless obligations), and escape clauses which allow the professional associations to establish the necessary rules themselves."
"For our part, we are in favour of total transparency in capital operations."
"We recognise the absolute need to maintain the right to be defended but in no case should this mean impunity for anyone committing a crime."
"So we are voting against certain utterly deplorable amendments, which represent so many obstacles to a vigorous fight against money laundering."
"I am sure that I speak for all Members of this House when I say that I support greater coordination and cooperation to combat criminality and cross-border crime."
"In particular I recognise the importance of common standards and rules in helping to overcome the legal obstacles that can be put in place of successful prosecution."
"In Ireland, in order to combat the types of crime mentioned in the debate, we established the 'Criminal Assets Bureau' (CAB) which is a multi-agency organisation, headed by a legal officer and a chief superintendent of the police."
"These have been very successful in seizing the assets of drug dealers and other criminals as well as gathering evidence for further prosecutions."
"This has worked to bring a lot of criminals to justice and to follow the money trail to seize the proceeds of those criminal activities."
"However great our desire may be to prosecute criminals, we must ensure that the normal rules of procedure and justice are not ignored."
"In the present report, the desire to put accountants and auditors on the same level as lawyers is important to maintain this right of defence."
"The move within the common position to allow information gathered in a 'money laundering case' to be put to other uses for prosecution goes too far I believe."
"Finally I am against the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor's Office as we already have OLAF, the Court of Auditors as well as the national agencies with responsibility for prosecution. ."
"The issue we are dealing with today is of capital importance for the future of our democracies."
"The war against money laundering can no longer be waged by an isolated government."
"For it to be effective, cooperation between the Member States must be organised."
"It is essential to extend the definition of money laundering, because restricting it to drug-trafficking no longer corresponds to today' s reality."
"Account must be taken of every type of crime that generates major financial flows, fraud against the financial interests of the Communities, and any kind of corruption."
"It has become absolutely necessary to involve the legal professions in the operation against money laundering, otherwise the European system of preventing and combating dirty money will be ineffective."
"There is no question, however, of lawyers accepting any threat to professional secrecy or the confidentiality of their relationship with their clients."
"So those amendments are unacceptable."
"Indeed, professional secrecy remains the fundamental rule in the exercise of the profession of lawyer."
"It is incompatible with the expression of suspicion, worse still, the expression of possible suspicion."
"What is more, restricting professional secrecy amounts to restricting citizens' fundamental rights."
"Lawyers are officers of the courts, not police officers."
". (PT) The position adopted in this report constitutes a step backwards from the previous position."
"Attacking organised crime is simply one part of the issue."
"It is equally important that we adopt practical measures on crime against the economy, which results, specifically, from money laundering."
"It is also significant that no practical measures have been proposed on the 'offshore' issue, the breaking of banking confidentiality during a judicial inquiry or even on the situation of assets acquired through money laundering, which is a criminal act, to prevent the use of financial funds created by such activity, at the inquiry stage."
"Finally, it is important to note that the report contains some confusion about the concepts of consultancy and accountancy, by creating get-out clauses and opportunities to escape providing information."
"Unfortunately, the Council of Ministers has presented us with a text which will lead to a further delay in amending the Directive of 1991."
"We had hoped that this new version would be pushed through in first reading."
"It now seems likely we will have to go through a mediation process, because we simply cannot accept the academic and impractical position adopted by the Finance Ministers, which Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs do not agree with either."
"It is impossible to impose the transfer of existing money laundering rules for financial service providers lock, stock and barrel to all other professional groups such as lawyers and tax consultants and then insinuate that we simply wanted to protect the guild of lawyers."
"This is just not the case."
"It makes no sense that lawyers cannot settle an insurance claim or that brokers cannot draw up a plan until they have established their credentials."
"It makes just as little sense to demand that cash only be handed over from person to person."
"Such a demand would mean that bank night safe-deposit boxes would have to be set up immediately."
"This would cause problems, however, for business people, especially from small and medium-sized businesses, who, for obvious reasons of security, deposit their day' s takings in the safe-deposit box of their bank after the banks have closed."
"That, however, has absolutely nothing to do with the laundering of money from criminal activity."
"I fully endorse the reasonable position adopted by the rapporteur, which the Finance Ministers could also live with. They at least should know that any further delay in amending the money-laundering Directive is irresponsible, especially since the money-laundering mafia is becoming increasingly adept."
"As a Member of the European Parliament who comes from Luxembourg, the effectiveness of the fight against the laundering of money from criminal activity lies very close to my heart, as the Grand Duchy has some of the strictest laws on money laundering."
"These laws and their application as well as the cooperation resulting from the 1991 Directive must not be undermined by a too broadly interpreted definition of 'criminal activity' , which is what is called for under the common position adopted by the Council."
"For reasons of efficiency, the directive should essentially be limited to combating the laundering of money from organised crime, which was its original objective."
"Money flows which remain invisible to taxation and government statistics are still what many in business aim for."
"Their view is that the government should not interfere in their profits and possessions."
"Attempts are once again being made, rightly so, to get a tighter grip on money-laundering practices."
"On the one hand, that requires the proposed measures to be as fool proof as possible, without escape routes for profiteers who refuse to meet the legal requirements."
"I have the impression that the Council' s proposals are still too weak in this respect, and even the adjustments proposed by the rapporteur at second reading still leave something to be desired."
"On the other hand, there is the fear that lawyers have been required to act as investigation officials at the expense of their clients."
"In this case, this may be justified."
"Nonetheless, this sets an undesired precedent."
"Lawyers should not be required to act against those whom they have to protect."
"By, however, drawing a distinction in recital 16a between the actual role of lawyers and this profession' s other activities, it might be possible to avoid this precedent."
"I will therefore give the proposal the benefit of the doubt."
"I support measures to tighten controls in the fight against money laundering by obliging banks and professionals to report clients under suspicion to the authorities."
"Billions of pounds are lost every year across the European Union due to money laundering and fraud."
"When we think of crime, an image of burglaries, violent muggings and knife attacks by gangs of youths on our streets often springs to mind."
"Money laundering is an unseen crime, but it costs the taxpayer dearly and those found guilty should pay the price."
"Those misusing the financial system should be caught and punished."
"Moreover, money laundering is responsible for financing the evil trade in drugs, trafficking in humans and other horrific crimes."
"We should not turn a blind eye to crimes of this kind."
"We must crack down on banks and professionals, encouraging them to report clients under suspicion to the authorities."
"We should even extend the scope of this proposal to include high-spending gamblers and auctioneers at the top end of the market."
"Madam President, this issue is an important one at a European level."
"Money laundering is not simply restricted to Manchester or to Madrid."
"It knows no borders, and tainted money changes hands across regions and countries."
"It is not enough to enforce purely British legislation, but measures must be taken across the EU."
"We must work together to tackle this challenge."
"Therefore, I applaud the efforts of this House to curb the use of the financial system for money laundering."
"Graefe zu Baringdorf Report (A5-0079/2001)"
"We have voted for the recommendation for the sole reason that it advocates some sensible measures, like, for example, 'the positive definition of permissible feed materials' ."
"Even if the Council and the Commission were to end up accepting the amendments tabled, however, and at the moment they are rejecting them and dithering, that would not acquit the leaders of the European institutions of the massive responsibility for the propagation of BSE they incurred by refusing to take precautionary measures as soon as the threat represented by that endemic disease became tangible."
"That was not even mere negligence or carelessness, it was a deliberate choice, under pressure from the agrifood lobbies."
"It is yet another tragic demonstration that the vocation of protecting the profits of capitalist groups is incompatible with effective defence of the interests of the majority of the population."
"Mr President, I voted for the report presented so well by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf."
"'Why is that?' you may ask, Mr President."
"I listened very carefully to both Commissioner Fischler's words and Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf's report."
"This report tells us that the maximum quantity for guaranteed dried feedingstuffs is being increased and that the rate of yield for peas is being increased by EUR 6."
"Well then, the fact that these amendments have been included makes me particularly happy to have voted for the report, for I feel that they will be very useful for the progress of European common agriculture."
"As the rapporteur states, it is important that the manufacturer of compound feedingstuffs, or whoever is responsible for labelling, provides a detailed list of all the raw materials used. The compulsory definition of acceptable raw materials in compound feedingstuffs for animals is also crucial, bearing the BSE and dioxin crises in mind."
"We must also ensure that all materials that put human and animal health at risk are banned."
"Nevertheless, this report was framed during a broader discussion of animal feedingstuffs, on which the Commission made a statement regarding the options for encouraging the planting of protein crops in the EU, taking account of the Agricultural Council of December 2000, which bans the use of animal meal in feedingstuffs for breeding animals, and insists on the need to replace animal protein with vegetable protein."
"The Commission' s proposal is based mainly on budgetary consequences, forgetting the basic principle of the sovereignty of food, when it states that the best and cheapest solution is to increase Community soya imports by 5%. This will make the EU more dependent for its vegetable protein, particularly soya meal, which could threaten food safety, on imports of genetically modified soya from the USA."
"Using the pretext of WTO rules and costs, the Commission is refusing to increase aid for growing oilseed crops because they contravene the Blair House agreement. Similarly it refuses to support the use of fallow land under the set-aside system, because this would be in conflict with the WTO' s blue box that requires agricultural aid to be conditional upon production-limiting measures."
"In this way, the Commission is refusing to encourage production within the EU. This is an unacceptable position, which we should reject, although we support the report, for which we have voted."
"Politics is like drilling through thick planks of wood and, far too often, the only way forward is bit by bit."
"We all know that, in times like these, it is a political imperative that we give people a feeling of security."
"We need openness, labelling and transparency."
"Politically mature citizens want to decide for themselves what to eat."
"It is clear that this demand cannot relate solely to the end product."
"So we have a fundamental interest in documenting the history of our food and making it transparent."
"Farmers on the ground are responsible for animal protection and food safety."
"They must be held accountable for what they feed to their animals, not only to secure their own economic success (though this is a factor we should not lose sight of) but also to satisfy consumers."
"When I look at individual actions, I sometimes get the impression that time is running away from us."
"My own land in Germany, Rheinland-Pfalz, has introduced a seal of approval for beef which aims to guarantee not only the origin of the animal but its history and what it has been fed."
"The feedingstuffs industry has come on board of its own free will and offers an open declaration of feed materials and stronger controls."
"Farmers would otherwise buy their feed elsewhere: only with this information can they get the seal of approval."
"I hope in future there will be more such self-imposed obligations."
"This would set the wheel in motion and feedingstuff manufacturers would be practically forced to make an open declaration out of economic necessity."
"In the here and now, however, it is a question of taking a political decision and establishing the legal bases, which must be the same for everybody."
"That is why we need the open declaration."
"We need traceability and we also need controls. I hope that the report by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf will set the wheel turning."
"I do not understand the Commission' s position in opposing a positive list at all."
"Sanders-ten Holte Report (A5-0093/2001)"
"Mr President, like many of the Members, including yourself, I am sure, in two hours' time I will be on a plane."
"I have read Mrs Sanders-ten Holte's report, which is rightly concerned that compensation should be provided in the unfortunate event - excuse me a moment while I touch wood - of a plane crash."
"However, I call upon Mrs Sanders-Ten Holte to ensure, in the future, the application of more effective control measures to avoid aeroplane accidents, so that, whenever I take a plane, I can think of Mrs Sanders-Ten Holte, whose photo I will stick to the seat in front of me, not just as the rapporteur of a document providing for our compensation in the case of an accident, but, above all, as the rapporteur of a document which will reduce the number of aeroplane accidents."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to point out how important it is that the Regulation is implemented in conformity with the provisions of the Montreal Convention."
"A uniform Regulation on liability in air transport creates transparency."
"It protects the interests not only of passengers but also of carriers which can maintain the generally recognised standards in international air transport."
"The competitiveness of European air carriers must not be impaired through liability rules which are not covered by the Montreal Convention."
"In order to create a uniform Regulation in conformity with the provisions of the Montreal Convention, I call on the Member States to ratify this Convention as soon as possible."
"Camisón Asensio Report (A5-0096/2001)"
"Mr President, this document coordinates rail, road and inland waterway transport."
"How delightful, Mr President, for me, the representative of the Pensioners' Party in Italy, to be able to vote for this document."
"You might think, Mr President, that it has nothing to do with pensions and pensioners, but that is not the case."
"It does concern pensioners."
"If these measures are implemented, then, indeed, transport will be heavier on railways, inland waterways and roads, freight will be moved more quickly and the level of toxic emissions emanating from congested motorways and badly organised communications, toxins which, when inhaled by our citizens, cause serious diseases, will be reduced."
"In actual fact, there are many pensioners who have been made ill by this bad road circulation, and that increases social security costs in our States, which is not a good thing for pensioners."
"That is the connection, Mr President."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report aims to divert goods transport from the road to rail, inland waterways and combined transport with the aid of subsidies."
"I find this fundamentally questionable. For one thing, Article 87 of the EC Treaty quite clearly states that subsidies in this form are not permissible."
"For another, we have guaranteed a situation whereby subsidies will have a diverting function."
"I find this fundamentally questionable."
"I also wonder why, ten years after liberalising the transport markets, we are now starting to use taxes and subsidies to divert and control."
"In principle, this cannot be positive for the future of the transport market."
"Kessler Report (A5-0094/2001)"
"I concur with the gist of Mr Costa' s opinion."
"However, there is one element which I am struggling with."
"Recital 14 and Article 4 provide for the possibility of government aid being deployed for the use of infrastructure."
"This is also possible pursuant to the amendments."
"In my opinion, this exemption from the ban of government aid is undesirable."
"First of all because the starting premise is wrong, for transport by road already pays the lion' s share of the external costs."
"Secondly, it is not judicious to grant extra support for the use of infrastructure."
"Take rail, for example: the costs are not the most important reason why transporters do not opt for rail."
"We need an increase in quality and reliability, and market discipline is then the best incentive."
"I fear that this incentive for a modal shift, of which we are of course in favour, is counterproductive, brings about distortion of competition and undermines the work that has been done in the framework of the rail liberalisation package."
"I will therefore be voting against recital 14 and Article 4."
"They do not belong in this Regulation."
"The first part of the report by Mrs Kessler - a name that, in the minds of us Italians, invokes two beautiful, excellent, very famous German ballerinas and which therefore lifts my spirits, despite the fact that the subject of the document is somewhat tedious - states, with regard to Grotius II, that there are funds for training, work experience placement exchanges, studies, research, meetings and seminars in the field of judicial cooperation, money which will go to judges, public prosecutors, lawyers, law officials, experts and interpreters."
"I hope that the next document will stipulate that these funds are also to go to pensioners from these professions, who will certainly be able to give expert opinions on judicial cooperation."
". Given the seriousness of problems concerning crime, no one can doubt the need for greater cross-border cooperation, networking and mutual recognition in criminal matters."
"However, I had a certain reservation in supporting the report because at present there is an alarmingly one-sided quality in our approach."
"Too little attention is given in our debates or in the instruments upon which we vote to vital issues of civil liberty."
"These concern the rights of persons accused of crimes who are entitled in all our systems to the presumption of innocence until guilt is proved."
"These rights are guaranteed under Articles 5 and 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights."
"Experience shows, however, that interpretation of the rights in question is variable throughout the Union."
"Sometimes prosecuting authorities ignore them with apparent impunity."
"I call for greater and better attention to these points."
"For example, when are we to see proposals for a EuroBail system?"
"Mutual recognition should facilitate common provision for conditional release pending trial."
"It is a scandal that in many Member States people awaiting trial may spend many months needlessly in detention prior to trial."
"This requires the most urgent attention of everyone in this Parliament."
"Kessler Report (A5-0091/2001)"
"Mr President, I supported this document on the establishment of a European Judicial Network in civil and commercial matters, particularly because it lays down that information sheets - vade-mecum - are to be issued so that those who are involved in this European Judicial Network know how to apply it practically."
"I therefore hope that this vade-mecum, this instruction sheet, will also include the procedures that European citizens who have pension issues to resolve can follow in order to contact the European judicial authorities established in a network in civil and commercial matters, for civil matters include pension issues as well."
"I wish to state briefly the reasons why I am supporting the Kessler report."
"With the expansion of the single market and with the introduction of the euro currency, there are now greater opportunities for cross-border trade and commerce in Europe."
"Also, with the wider globalisation of the marketplace, there is a necessity for a greater co-operation and understanding of different legal systems."
"In any democratic system, the arm of justice must not only operate effectively but must be seen to do so and it must command the respect of the people."
"The quicker and easier it is for the resolution of legal conflicts, then the better it is for the protection of legal rights and also to guarantee the conditions concerning the certainty of trade."
"Therefore, the setting up of the EUROJUST programme with the co-operation of the judiciaries within the various EU Member States is a very important movement towards building a greater understanding of justice."
"However, this should not be seen as an attempt to subvert or subjugate the systems operating within the various Member States of the EU."
"Rather, it should be seen as an enhancement to implementing a speedy resolution of disputes by introducing a greater clarity in legal judgements."
"I particularly recommend the point in relation to the establishment of a centralised electronic European Union judgment registry, which has been initiated by an Irish lawyer Twinkle Egan."
"This will make it easier to understand differing judgements and to help build a greater consistency in how precedents operate."
"May I congratulate my Socialist colleague Margot Kessler on her report which extends the existing European judicial network in criminal matters to civil and commercial law."
"I fully support this common-sense strategy which broadens the system of cooperation between national authorities."
"This will not only simplify judicial cooperation between the Member States, but it will also facilitate cross-border legal procedures."
"Increased judicial cooperation is an important step forward for my constituents in the North-West who are sometimes desperate for help with a case in another EU country."
"For example, a young parent whose children have been abducted by the other parent from the UK to France, will certainly be assisted by greater understanding between the British and French legal services."
"So would the elderly couple who have exchanged their hard-earned cash for a holiday home in the south of Spain and have faced legal battles with the purchase."
"It is significant that this network becomes part of the existing trans-European network for the electronic exchange of data."
"In light of enlargement, the applicant countries should also be allowed to participate in the contact meetings."
"Data will therefore be exchanged on the European judicial network from England to Estonia, making life remarkably easier for the authorities."
"Madam President, I very much welcome increased judicial cooperation which will be of tremendous benefit to all our citizens seeking legal advice or bringing forward cases across the European Union."
"Jové Peres Report (A5-0098/2001)"
"Auroi Report (A5-0117/2001)"
". (PT) I welcome the rapporteur' s proposals amending the proposal for a Council decision on a financial contribution by the Community to certain expenditure incurred by the Member States in implementing the control, inspection and surveillance systems applicable to the common fisheries policy."
"Control is important in guaranteeing a form of fishing that is responsible, sustainable and fair and the Community must therefore finance its costs and the necessary investment, bearing in mind that each Member State is responsible for implementing the system in its own economic area."
"The Council' s proposal maintains the continuity of the cofinancing system, but limits the time framework, the financial participation and the type of actions funded."
"The rapporteur proposes increasing Community cofinancing from 30% to 35% in training and investment actions, with 100% financing of eligible expenditure disbursed by the Member States for control and surveillance activities under EU participation in regional fishing organisations."
"Furthermore, I think it is unacceptable that here too, the proposal for a decision is attempting to make budgetary savings, by reducing the budget for these actions from EUR 41 million per year to EUR 35 million per year, which is in conflict with the need to create an appropriate infrastructure to cover control and surveillance programmes that may involve an increase in the actual financial burden."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I just want to thank all the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"They voted unanimously for the six amendments that allow this report to go beyond the Commission' s proposal, which only sought to unfreeze land for organic farmers and primarily to remain within the context of the COM agreements."
"The whole of Parliament wanted to go further and send a positive signal to breeders generally and also, at least initially, to farmers doing environmental work."
"I venture to hope, on behalf of my group, and no doubt on behalf of many others, that the Council will understand and follow our lead in the matter."
"As I said yesterday, Mrs Auroi' s report points in the right direction although, of course, the context is such that the proposals cannot measure up to our vegetable protein needs."
"Reading the Commission' s report on vegetable proteins in the context of the ban on meat and bone meal, I was deeply shocked by the authors' apparent contempt for their fellow citizens."
"First, contempt for consumers: the Commission' s position takes no account of the clear, strong and growing demand on the part of consumers for traceability and visibility in product origin."
"Here the proposal is simply to go on buying the proteins we lack as cheaply as possible in the great world supermarket for agricultural surpluses."
"So what if they contain GMOs?"
"Then, contempt for farmers: the Commission' s resignation is an insult to European farmers, suggesting they are incapable of producing the vegetable proteins we need on our own soil."
"The measures proposed in the Commission' s seven- point plan (authorising the production of fodder legumes on land set aside on organic farms) is sympathetic but in no way commensurate with the challenge."
"Between organic production and massive imports of genetically modified soya, there is a margin for the creativity of European farmers."
"In fact one could say the Commission is trying to find technical, regulatory and budgetary arguments for refusing to act."
"It is presenting us with a 'non-plan' for proteins."
"The Commission is demonstrating an accountant' s logic which is not even economically relevant: the fact that soya is cheap at the moment does not mean it will always be cheap."
"A price rise is bound to come."
"(The President cut the speaker off pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure)"
"The rapporteur has improved on the Commission' s initial proposal as far as she can and bearing in mind the emergency procedure, which was laid down in the package of seven measures to combat the crisis in the beef and veal market."
"The Commission' s proposal was one-sided and limited and sought to make it possible, only for organic farms, to grow fodder on land set aside under the COM in cereals."
"Given the Community deficit in vegetable protein production, the limitations of the Blair House agreement and the ban on the use of animal meal in feedingstuffs for breeding animals, it has become necessary to create a genuine internal system of support for the production of fodder legumes and protein crops."
"The rapporteur' s proposal, which I support, seeks to open up the same opportunity for conventional livestock farms and for farms covered by any agro-environmental programme in order to achieve a broad concept of fodder legumes, bearing in mind the importance, as we proposed for Portugal, of beans, sweet lupin and yellow lupin."
"Nevertheless, the proposal lacks a real system of incentives for fodder legume and oilseed production, which might require the use of aid under the set-aside scheme or tying this partially to the production of fodder legumes, or through a change to set-aside assistance when fodder legumes are grown there."
"The Commission would need to present specific proposals to this effect and not remain bound by budgetary constraints and by the World Trade Organisation."
"Following the recent discoveries of the dangers inherent in feedingstuffs, especially in the economically advanced countries of the EU and, in particular, the problem of BSE caused by using animal proteins as feedingstuffs, meat and bonemeal should have been completely banned as a feedingstuff and replaced with vegetable proteins produced in the Community, so that Community farmers would not be dependent on soya from the United States."
"In other words, the CAP should have been reviewed in its entirety, encompassing both the feedingstuffs sector and the farming sector which produces feedingstuffs."
"In our view, the quota system should have been reviewed, especially in the Mediterranean countries, and in Greece in particular, where quotas are far below self-sufficiency and potential production levels and where the method of producing animal proteins is far healthier than the method used in the economically advanced countries of the EU, where quotas far exceed requirements, with the result that they export the dangers inherent in their feedingstuffs to all the countries with shortfalls, including Greece."
"We should also examine the system for pricing and subsidising fodder crops, so as to support fodder legumes, with a view to guaranteeing cheap, top quality vegetable proteins and protecting the environment, given that legumes restore the soil and are ideally suited to crop rotation programmes, especially with the soil and climate in the Mediterranean."
"Instead of which, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has used various tricks, believing that the problem of BSE will be forgotten in time, in an endeavour to restore animal protein in animal feedingstuffs in six months' time."
"In other words, it is endeavouring to restore meat and bonemeal which, it has now been proven, is responsible for BSE, disregarding public health in order to serve the interests of the Community feedingstuffs industry."
"These endeavours are confirmed by decisions on the matter so far and discussions taking place in official circles."
"The alibi which the Committee is using for these endeavours takes the form of the proposal to cultivate certain land set aside from arable crops with fodder legumes, allegedly in order to increase the production of vegetable proteins; at the same time, however, it bans the production of seed on this land and restricts it solely to hay production, and unsubsidised hay production at that."
"Under this proposal, little or no vegetable proteins will be produced, even in countries with extensive set aside."
"For Greece, however, and perhaps for other Mediterranean countries, the proposal is meaningless because they have little or no set aside."
"The Commission proposal does absolutely nothing to resolve the problem of protein in Community fodder, and, as a result, it deliberately and consciously finds a 'solution' either in the Community meat and bonemeal responsible for BSE or in modified soya from the United States, which may well be equally dangerous to public health, as well as making Community livestock farmers dependent on the multinationals which market soya and soya products."
"Because the Commission proposal does not make use of the productive potential in the Member States in order to resolve the problem of proteins, and feedingstuffs in general, once and for all and in a way which safeguards public health, because the purpose of the proposal is to mislead farmers and consumers, so that the dangerous method of producing proteins for animal feed can continue, and because I have no desire to help, even indirectly, in perpetuating this serious public health problem and deceiving arable and livestock farmers, I shall not vote in favour of the Commission proposal. I believe that my vote will act as an incentive and that the production of healthy and suitable feedingstuffs will become the subject of an objective fight on the part of the people of the Community."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, among the package of seven measures proposed by the Commission in order to deal with the BSE crisis is the modification of the basic regulation on herbaceous crops in order to permit, in the context of organic farming, the use of set-aside land for growing some leguminous fodder crops for feeding livestock."
"As a background we have the ban of the use of meat and bone meal - a temporary ban that many of us trust will become permanent - and the now long-term EU deficit of vegetable proteins."
"The Commission proposal is going in the right direction but it limits itself to proposing a symbolic modification, the impact of which, limited solely to organic farming, is not going to give visible results."
"Mrs Auroi' s report, with the amendments adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, correct this timid proposal by extending it to farms that operate in accordance with Regulation 1257/99 on rural development, and by including, from 2002, the growing of leguminous fodder crops on land left fallow in conventional livestock farms."
"In this way we may be able to effectively counteract the EU' s dependence on supplies of proteins that are in many cases genetically modified and, as they are used to feed livestock, are introduced into the food chain without any opportunity for control on the part of consumers."
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists therefore supported the amendments adopted in the Committee responsible and there is nothing more for us to do than hope that the Commission will take them into account along with the successive requests from members of this House for effective progress to be made towards a visible correction of the European deficit of vegetable proteins."
"Foot-and-mouth disease (RC B5-0303/2001)"
"Mr President, I wanted to justify our vote straight away, but unfortunately you did not notice in this confusion."
"This Chamber knows that I have asked for a serious debate since the start."
"As Members of Parliament of the Austrian People' s Party in the European Parliament, we have spoken out against this resolution because we believe and we are convinced that it does not reflect what we imagine European agricultural policy to be."
"It is clear that, with such resolutions, the real existential anxiety and need of European farmers cannot be addressed, given that there are 80 different types of virus and 300 million animals in Europe."
"I would like to point out that in Austria more than 60% of land consists of mountains and disadvantaged regions."
"We rely on exports and we must do our utmost to ensure that these regions remain inhabited."
"I actually find it frivolous to make policy on a day-to-day basis at the expense of farmers."
"I cannot imagine how animals that have been vaccinated can be labelled."
"Mr President, consumer protection is a matter of great concern to all of us in this House."
"I do not believe that consumers would pay tribute to us for that, as it would only lead to further loss of confidence."
"The European Parliament' s resolution on foot-and-mouth disease deserves to be approved, notably because it steps back from the policy of slaughter, which can be useful selectively, but scarcely seems effective in a case like that of Great Britain."
"Public opinion is doubtful, and it is right."
"So the resolution we have just voted on is rightly geared towards authorisation of urgent vaccination, either in a particular region affected by foot-and-mouth disease, or in a 'buffer' region, or in the case of rare breeds."
"Beyond these urgent measures, we might wonder why foot-and-mouth, once common in the countryside of Europe, and not usually fatal to animals (let alone humans), should now be producing a national crisis."
"The answer is two-fold."
"First, the disease spreads faster than before because agriculture has become massively geared towards production, and is therefore highly specialised and fragmented."
"One animal can spend different stages of its life in several parts of a country, or even of Europe."
"It is transported many times, the link with the original breeder is broken and traceability becomes unreliable."
"So we think it is important to re-establish more stable rearing, where everyone knows who is responsible and where animals are not treated like inert merchandise."
"That is part of the agricultural reform we are proposing for the years ahead."
"Secondly, the massive slaughter seems to be motivated by economic reasons which are not always transparent."
"One of these appears to be a determination to maintain exports at any price, because some purchaser countries regard meat from vaccinated animals as indistinguishable from meat from sick animals."
"Under those circumstances vaccination would be useless from the economic point of view, because in both cases the meat is worth less. I find this financial reasoning absurd."
"Surely exports could be accompanied by a vaccination certificate?"
"And why must absolutely everything be subordinated to exports?"
"That just contributes to productivity-driven farming and necessitates subsidies which cost the taxpayer dear, all to achieve, ultimately, the destabilisation of farming in less developed countries."
"The system is verging on insanity, and things will have to be put back on an even keel in the near future."
"With 'mad cows' agri-industry created a new disease fatal to humans, and we still do not know how to cure it."
"Foot-and-mouth, though, is an ancient disease."
"It does not affect humans and the majority of animals recover from it."
"With the development of the world market in cattle and meat, however, agri-industry has given it an international epidemic dimension it did not have before."
"The market imposes its own health requirements too, with tragic consequences."
"The use of vaccine has been banned on purely economic grounds, 'economic' here being reduced to commercial regulations and an estimate of the financial costs which is in some respects questionable."
"Hundreds of thousands of healthy (or curable) animals are being slaughtered purely in the name of an accountant' s calculation of profitability."
"The decision-makers have only the market rules they have invented themselves to set against the despair of the farmers whose herds are being destroyed."
"Elementary respect for life, protection of local economies, maintenance of a thriving social fabric in the rural environment, and the living and working conditions of country people have all been ignored in the definition of health policies in response to the foot-and-mouth epidemic."
"All that remains is the power of the market and its laws of bronze. It is definitely high time we freed ourselves from that power."
"."
"(DE) In view of the fact that foot-and-mouth has broken out in at least four Member States, the foot-and-mouth vaccine which was adopted throughout Europe in 1991 must be screened and even abandoned."
"Politicians such as the German Agriculture Minister, Renate Künast, who reject foot-and-mouth vaccination must reconsider."
"The reasons for a ban that were valid then do not apply today, since improved foot-and-mouth vaccines have been introduced."
"Nonetheless, research into the development and manufacture of foot-and-mouth vaccines must continue."
"In particular, the following vaccinations should be authorised by the European Commission: emergency vaccinations (ring vaccinations) in regions hit by foot-and-mouth and in zones which are contiguous to regions hit by foot-and-mouth and for zoo animals."
"The outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, which has followed on from 'mad cow disease' , has made the crisis in the livestock industry worse. It has penalised farmers and has increased people' s lack of confidence in the safety of agricultural produce."
"The liberalisation of agriculture and the free movement of goods have increased the risk and the spread of animal diseases with a CAP that, in the name of competitiveness and constant price reduction has promoted the concentration, intensification and centralisation of production."
"In the current context, those who have been penalised most heavily are the producers, although we have not seen the necessary aid for compensation or sufficient contingency measures, in this case for foot-and-mouth disease."
"I have therefore proposed the creation of a specific budget line within the EU budget, to support farmers and measures for eradicating animal diseases, given the food, health and veterinary crisis."
"Given the spread of the disease, it makes sense to temporarily suspend the movement of animals between Member States and to increase controls on meat that is sold, and it is regrettable that the recent Agricultural Council did not take a decision on this matter."
"In addition to short-term measures, however, we also need a new type of agricultural policy, which protects production and supports changes in production methods."
"We need a policy that promotes the quality and safety of food in line with the precautionary principle."
"We need a form of farming that is sustainable and which promotes the specific characteristics of each region and a greater variety of aid for agricultural produce, bearing in mind the varying levels of agricultural development."
"We need a form of farming that contributes to economic and social cohesion and which is based firmly on family farming and on small and medium-sized holdings."
"While I am not happy with every aspect of the compromise resolution, it does reflect the determination of the European Parliament to urgently address the serious threat of foot-and-mouth disease."
"I have voted against sections of the resolution which deal with general vaccination and supported amendments which allow protective emergency vaccination, at the request of Member States."
"Given that the source of Britain's first outbreak originated outside the EU, I have called for an urgent review of cross-border controls to prevent a similar occurrence in the future."
"From an Irish perspective, we strongly favour a non-vaccination policy, and have made every effort to contain the country's single outbreak - so far with success."
"As an island nation, exporting 90% of the country's beef production, our animal health status is a priority."
"This resolution makes clear that any resort to protective vaccination during the present outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease would be at the request of a Member State."
"In view of the confinement of FMD to one corner of Scotland, in Dumfries and Galloway and nearby, the Scottish National Party has taken and will continue to take a strong line in favour of maintaining the policy of culling and destroying to restore disease-free status in Scotland according to present international standards."
"This is vital to Scotland's capacity to maintain its worldwide reputation for high-quality meat."
"We have condemned dodges by Mr Blair's government that appear more calculated to secure electoral convenience than to serve the public interest and I repeat this condemnation here."
"My willingness to support the resolution was entirely conditional on incorporation of an oral amendment extending a commitment to financial help to trade and tourism where these have been adversely affected."
"I am delighted that my amendment was unanimously accepted, and that the resolution with this amendment was carried."
"Commerce and centralism are the backbone of the European Union' s current policy."
"Based on the notion that this will strengthen Europe' s position on the global market, silly measures are being imposed on all Member States."
"The course of affairs with regard to foot-and-mouth is the latest illustration of this failing."
"Between 1956 and 1992, we had managed to control this animal disease effectively thanks to a massive preventive vaccination campaign."
"Due to the one-sided consideration of export interests, we are back where we were half a century ago."
"Instead of introducing preventive vaccination and banning the transport of live animals over long distances, a choice is now being made in favour of pointless mass slaughter in order to destroy healthy animals."
"In the absence of the possibility of vaccination, this primitive approach is considered to be the only means of curbing the further spread of the disease."
"Even rare animals in nature reserves and zoos are now being sacrificed to the mad ban on vaccination."
"Farmers are bewildered and at their wits' end."
"Restricted emergency vaccination and taking time out for further research are not solving the problem."
"In my opinion, the Member States can no longer adhere to the vaccination ban and must carry out vaccination immediately, even if this should lead to an even further setback in exports."
"I find myself with some difficulty in supporting this proposal as it stands."
"While I have changed my mind about vaccination in an emergency, I have some problem with the view that it can be used without the eventual slaughter of those animals vaccinated."
"It is clear to me that to adopt such a policy would not be in the best long-term interest of the European export industry."
"The Standing Veterinary Committee makes it clear that no vaccine has yet been developed that would differentiate between vaccinated and non-vaccinated animals."
"I agree that we should encourage the development of new vaccines that would give us more flexibility, better tracing and would ensure that we could continue to export to other countries, and we should develop improved controls on imports into anywhere in the EU, for it is clear we imported foot-and-mouth in the UK illegally."
"Stockholm European Council: Economic and social aspects (RC B5-0237/2001)"
"Mr President, before explaining why I voted against this document of the Stockholm European Council, I must explain why I am speaking in English."
"It is to make a present to the Italian interpreters, the Italian workers who, every day, have to work much more than the others to translate and put in writing my explanations of votes."
"I am doing this in recognition of their hard work."
"I voted against all Stockholm resolutions because there is no mention of the fact that European workers want to work less and have more time as pensioners."
"We cannot accept the conclusions of the Stockholm European Council because, as I said during the debate, they amount to a ragbag of all the issues in no order of priority."
"They give the impression of a Europe with its tentacles in everything, which does not distinguish big issues from small, or the national level from the European."
"That is damaging to the whole Union."
"The European Council, which is taking on increasing weight in the institutional balance, ought to present especially clear conclusions."
"To make the necessary improvements the preparation for Councils must be reformed, but also, more profoundly, European powers must be clarified and lightened, and those issues should be on the agenda for the next Intergovernmental Conference."
"In our view, rational and well-ordered conclusions ought to consist of three parts:"
"the first part should be devoted to certain vital issues of strategy, which the Council would have discussed thoroughly, and on which it would have taken some real decisions."
"The second part would give instructions for implementation to the various Councils of Ministers."
"Finally, the third part, which should be the most substantial, could set out certain guidelines that the Heads of State and Government intend to follow in their respective countries, particularly as regards managing the economy and social affairs - which was on the Stockholm agenda."
"These guidelines would not be restrictive, and the expression of contrary opinions would be tolerated."
"They would thus demonstrate a determination to develop free, informal and open coordination, respectful of national democratic choices."
"Reading the Stockholm conclusions, we can see how far away we are from that."
"In fact our motion for a resolution calls for thorough reform of the Treaty, involving the restoration of numerous powers to the Member States."
"Every summit goes one step further in damaging the workers' interests and the Stockholm Summit was no exception."
"Yet again, the summit' s sights were set on pension and social rights, with workers being called on to work more and receive less."
"It is clear from their joint declaration that the Heads of State or Government of the ÅU are anxious about the increase in the number of pensioners, which they feel ""will create substantial pressure on social welfare systems, in particular pensions, health care systems and care of the elderly"";."
"In other words 'prosperity' is being jeopardised by the increase in longevity."
"And the solution is to increase employment in the 55-64 age group by 50% by 2010, at a time when workers, especially young people and women, are suffering from the scourge of unemployment and under-employment."
"On the subject of the Balkans, they are continuing their policy of controlled destabilisation and, alongside their supposedly friendly stance towards the FYROM, they are endeavouring to promote the KLA as an equal negotiating partner with the government of the country."
"It is perfectly obvious that the imperialist plans for the region have not yet been completed and that the people will be unable to live in peace until ÍÁÔÏ withdraws."
"As far as Palestine is concerned, they are continuing their policy of maintaining the same distance from the state terrorism being applied by Israel and the just fight of the Palestinian people for a homeland."
"On the economic front, they have limited state aid and subsidies, taken further steps to liberalise telecommunications, postal services, the railways and energy and have prepared to complete the sell-off of the public sector to the multinationals."
"The joint motions for resolutions not only accept the summit conclusions, they also welcome the arrest of former President of Yugoslavia, Mr Milosevic, and call for him to be handed over to the 'International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia' in The Hague, which is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against them."
"The Stockholm European Council is happy with the European Union' s achievements and has announced that its 'strategic goal' remains ""to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world"" ."
"The working classes certainly have nothing to be happy about."
"To say that 'unemployment has fallen to its lowest level since 1991' is an involuntary way of recognising that it is still as high as it was ten years ago, when it was already catastrophic."
"In addition, the balance sheet for these ten years includes the widespread introduction, throughout Europe, of poorly paid casual work and the decline of wages as a proportion of national income."
"Only big companies and their proprietors and shareholders, can be happy about the exceptional level of profits, because that result has been obtained at the expense of working people, as well as public services and social provision."
"As to the future, we are promised a continuation of current policies."
"Some points even threaten a worse situation, particularly in terms of longer working hours and attacks on retirement age."
"We refuse to give an endorsement for the future to European institutions entirely at the service of industrial and financial groups."
"For public opinion and the media, Stockholm had all the hallmarks of a routine summit."
"In fact, had it not been for the announcement of the joint Franco-German decision to postpone setting a deadline for the full liberalisation of the energy market until there is greater mastery of all the consequences and all the effects, the summit would certainly have been overlooked by the newspapers and TV."
"It was an important summit in economic and social terms, however, and entirely in line with the Lisbon Summit, with the reaffirmation of the need to take action to secure full employment and skilled jobs in Europe."
"As it turns out, those guidelines have immediately run up against the brutal announcement of redundancy plans at Danone and Marks and Spencer, with no consultation and without even having any genuine economic reasons."
"Veritable 'dictatorship' by the stock exchange and frenzied profit-seeking to the detriment of employees, when they are in fact the prime wealth creators, has demonstrated - to anyone who did not already know - what a vast gap there is between the soothing speeches of politicians and the reality experienced by employees on the ground."
"So unless we want to acknowledge the death of the European social model, we cannot stand by and do nothing, and personally, since 31 March, I have been lobbying the highest European and French authorities to propose measures to end this diabolical spiral."
"I am now waiting, like many in this Chamber, for precise and relevant responses."
"If these are not forthcoming, there will be no point in organising any summits on employment and social policy in the future."
"In the meantime, I support Francis Wurtz' s proposal to create an ad hoc structure within the European Parliament, a sub-committee or observatory to monitor and analyse the adjustment strategies that powerful economic groups base entirely on staff reductions."
"There should be a European summit on this vital issue for the equilibrium and future of Europe, in the course of 2001."
"That is the spirit in which I have voted today for the joint resolution tabled by the left."
"Yet another summit serving private interests."
"In Stockholm, the fate of Macedonia would appear to have been dealt with in a few minutes."
"Farmers must make do with European 'solidarity' to cope with foot-and-mouth disease and rule out a return to the vaccination programme, cancelled a few years ago to save money."
"This time financial services emerge as the great victors."
"Between now and 2003 a single market in securities will be established to allow a few profiteers to speculate in shares and bonds."
"So, in the utmost opacity, financial dealings are encouraged and will revolve even more rapidly in the hands of a few industrialists, playing with the fate of millions of employees in passing."
"We demand, at European level, suspension of banking confidentiality, opening of account books, and transparency in all operations."
"That would be an effective means of combating money laundering and controlling the financial enterprises of companies, like Danone and Marks and Spencer, which persist in sacking people while making record profits."
"Finally, the private operators have obtained confirmation of the liberalisation of juicy public services - the post office, electricity and gas."
"Current social mobilisation calls for another type of summit, to bring together the efforts to ensure the establishment of a high quality European public service that responds to the fundamental needs of the peoples."
"Stockholm European Council: Financial Markets (B5-0244/2001)"
"Stockholm European Council: Foreign affairs (B5-0248/2001)"
"Despite the belittling of the results of the Stockholm Summit by most of the media, progress was made, responding to the objectives of the economic and financial groups that dominate the European economy, as the Commission' s proposal made very clear. The path has therefore already been mapped out."
"As in the story about the half-cup of water, some will see it as half full and some as half empty."
"The Lisbon strategy to speed up liberalisation, particularly through privatising transport, postal services, electricity, gas and telecommunications, was, despite everything, consolidated at the Stockholm Council."
"Furthermore, the process of integrating the financial markets was also speeded up."
"With regard to recovering 'full employment' , this does not necessarily mean an increase in the number of quality jobs, particularly if this increase takes place at the expense of greater job insecurity."
"With regard to the so-called 'modernisation of the European Social Model' , new attacks were made on the pensions system and changes to social security, with the method of open coordination in this area being started up and with this objective being included in the EU' s annual economic guidelines."
"It is worth highlighting, however, that the tiny echoes from the social part of the Lisbon strategy are due to the efforts of the workers and all progressives who want to see an economy that pays more attention to people' s problems and sustainable development. This is what I too hope for."
"Although many of the items here do actually move the agenda towards our vision of Europe, we simply cannot accept that there should be any enhancement of the role of the political institutions of the EU, especially the Commission, and development of what is termed 'The Community method' ."
"Third UN Conference (B5-0246/2001)"
"The EPLP has voted for the motion for a resolution on the Stockholm European Council."
"However, we have reservations about paragraph 13."
"The EPLP continues to have reservations, as was expressed at first reading of the framework directive on informing and consulting employees."
"The EPLP supports the view of the UK Minister for Trade and Industry, Stephen Byers, that it may be inappropriate to have European-wide legislation in the area of information and consultation."
"Mr Byers stated that for the UK, ""our whole system of corporate structures is quite different from that on the continent."
"However, in many respects, the directive reflects the continental system of corporate governance, not that in the United Kingdom."
"The directive is not appropriate for several reasons, but the issue is important and we should deal with it in our domestic setting."""
"(Commons Hansard Debates 18 January 2001)"
"The Stockholm Summit will not be remembered for its successes, the endeavours of the Swedish Presidency notwithstanding."
"It did not manage to set up a European Food Safety Agency, despite the spread of foot-and-mouth and BSE."
"It did not manage to agree on a common European patent system."
"It continues to rely on the USA for a satellite location system, now that the Galileo programme has come to a standstill, and questions relating to the electricity market are no further forward than they were at the Lisbon Summit."
"However, the main problem lies in the guidelines issued by the European Council on dismantling social protection mechanisms."
"By obsessing on notions such as the 'ageing population' , the need to 'modernise the European social model' and the priority of 'the sustainability of public finances' in relation to social systems, they are covering, strengthening and legalising the attempt being made by numerous governments in the European Union - such as Greece - to dismantle social protection systems and hand the workers over to private insurance companies without so much as a guarantee."
"I believe that the labour movement should react decisively to these negative guidelines from the European Council in Stockholm."
"The June Movement will not vote in favour of rules which mean that officials are enabled to legislate instead of elected representatives in open assemblies whose work can be monitored."
"With regard to the resolution that has been adopted today on the 'external relations' of the Stockholm Summit, against which I voted, I must mention some aspects in a explanation of vote that I am obliged to keep short."
"First of all, where the Balkans are concerned, I must criticise an unacceptable and flagrant example of interference and blackmail towards the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia by the USA, which is trying to whitewash and cover up the responsibilities of NATO and all those who waged a war against Yugoslavia, in blatant breach of the UN Charter and from within the Security Council itself. This was a war in which arms containing depleted uranium were used, the chemical and radiological effects of which on the population and on the environment have still not been fully assessed."
"The causes of the current situation in the Balkans are complex and deep-seated, but I must highlight the interfering role of the USA and the EU, which have significantly and, at times decisively, contributed to undermining a process whose consequences for the situation throughout the region are far from resolved. A strategy of selectively and arbitrarily criminalising certain political leaders is therefore unacceptable."
"Secondly, and bearing in mind the extremely serious situation in the Palestinian territories, I consider the resolution' s provisions to be quite inadequate."
"The resolution does not clearly and explicitly condemn the escalation of aggression by Israel, the bombings and the repression by the Israeli army against the Palestinian population or the intensification of the blockade imposed on the Palestinian territories."
"Thirdly, we must be extremely concerned about the absence of criticism of the current militarisation of the EU, which has the instrument of the common defence policy, as the European pillar of NATO, and the absence of criticism of the North-American anti-missile shield project (AMS) whose completion would contribute to relaunching the arms race and to greater insecurity throughout the world."
"Although the decision announced recently by the United States to reject the Kyoto Protocol has not come as a surprise, it is nonetheless extremely serious."
"It comes as no surprise because despite the fact that the United States signed the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, at successive United Nations Conferences designed to finalise the rules for implementing the Protocol, it has presented various excuses to block negotiations."
"This is serious because national self-interest has won the day."
"It is unacceptable that, given the increasingly dramatic predictions of the effects of global warming, the country mainly responsible for greenhouse gas emissions has refused to participate in the only international instrument designed to limit these effects."
"As serious as this decision is, however, we cannot waver or hesitate over the need to implement the Kyoto Protocol, with or without the United States."
"It is crucial that we put a brake on climate change and the Kyoto Protocol - and no other type of agreement - is the most appropriate political instrument to achieve this objective."
"The non-participation of the United States does make the Protocol less comprehensive, but does not detract from its raison d' être."
"This may make application of the protocol more difficult, but it does not make it impossible."
"The statement by the United States and the fact that COP6 part II, a conference designed to adopt the rules for implementing the Kyoto Protocol, forces the European Union to redouble its efforts and demonstrate effective leadership in this political dossier."
"Both internally, by countering the very harmful developments in greenhouse gas emissions in most Member States and externally, by negotiating the rules for implementing the Protocol with as many countries as possible to ensure that it is ratified and implemented by 2002."
"The European also has the task of fighting to ensure that the rules of fair trade are implemented so that the United States cannot gain any illegal economic advantages from not ratifying the Protocol."
"At the moment therefore, rather than insisting on a dialogue of the deaf with the United States, the European Union must implement an action plan that will enable us to implement Kyoto across the board, in other words, with as many countries as possible, and as a matter of urgency, by 2002."
"This action plan must enable us to achieve the following set of timetabled goals:"
"I) To negotiate, even before COP6 part II, the rules for implementing the Kyoto Protocol with Russia, Japan, Australia, Canada and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, in order to reach an agreement that can be ratified by more than 55 countries, corresponding to more than 55% of emissions, which is the minimum level required for the Kyoto Protocol to come into force;"
"II) For the EU to ratify the Kyoto Protocol by the end of 2001;"
"III) To adopt National Reduction Plans for greenhouse gases by the end of 2001;"
"IV) To present the directive on the implementation of the European Emissions-Trading System by the end of 2001;"
"V) To present, under the European Programme for Climate Change, a raft of copper-bottomed directives on policies and measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the industry, energy, services, agriculture and mainly, transport sectors, in which emissions are increasing most rapidly."
"VI) For the European Commission to draft an economic study on the competitive advantages that American products, particularly in the field of energy, will gain illegally over European products as a result of the European Union not implementing the Kyoto Convention;"
"VII) For the European Commission to draft a legal study to determine the way in which, within supranational institutions, particularly the World Trade Organisation and the Transatlantic Economic Partnership, these illegal advantages, to which I referred in my previous point, can be minimised."
"Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this morning' s agenda."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.25 p.m. and resumed at 3.00 p.m.)"
"TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE"
"The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance."
"UN Human Rights Commission and the People's Republic of China"
"The first item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B5-0268/2001 by Mr Dupuis and others, on behalf of the TDI Group;"
"B5-0269/2001 by Mrs Frassoni and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group;"
"B5-0277/2001 by Mrs Frahm and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group;"
"B5-0285/2001 by Mr McMillan-Scott, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group;"
"B5-0294/2001 by Mr Haarder, on behalf of the ELDR Group,"
"on the United Nations Human Rights Commission and the People's Republic of China."
"Mr President, I am rather disappointed."
"I can greet the Commission but I cannot greet the Council whose absence I deplore when this resolution on human rights in China is primarily addressed to the Council."
"I would like to tell the Council, or whoever is reporting to the absent Council, what a failure, not to say disaster, the EU' s China policy has been."
"We all know there are growing social and political contradictions in that country."
"The risk of explosion is imminent and we can all imagine the disaster that will represent in a country the size of China, not only in regional terms, but also in world terms."
"Our duty as elected representatives and citizens is to make the Chinese leaders, legal, yes, but certainly not legitimate, understand that only democracy and the rule of law can guarantee stability not just in China itself but also in the whole of the Asian continent."
"I think it is our duty to remind the Council, and the Commission where it is appropriate - that the right way to bring the Chinese Government round to the basic principles of democracy and the state of law, is this resolution tabled by the United States due to be voted on in the next few days by the Human Rights Commission in Geneva."
"It is our duty to remind the Council that the European Union cannot continue to take a hypocritical stance and that it must support this resolution, sponsor it and work actively in the Human Rights Commission for its adoption."
"Without intending to be either anti-Chinese or pro-Chinese, I repeat that China is a fundamental country in a regional and continental context where Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia and many other countries are experiencing enormous problems, and where Vietnam and Laos too are still ruled by a one-party regime."
"China can play a fundamental role providing it finally adopts a democratic system based on the rule of law."
"That is what we must make clear to the Chinese leaders. We have two goals: democracy for the Chinese, the Tibetans, the Uigurs and the Mongols, and the stability of the entire continent of Asia."
"Mr President, it is often said that Europe is not capable of producing a foreign policy, just as it is not capable of adopting a unified position on international affairs."
"I feel that if the countries of the European Union stick by their decision not to sign the resolution on human rights in China, that would only be confirmation of that inability."
"There is absolutely no reason, other than hypocrisy and defeatism, why we should not sign this resolution, for in not doing so we are not achieving anything at all that could justify taking this standpoint on a subject upon which there is such wide consensus from our public."
"Therefore, our resolution - which is not the first and, I believe and fear, will not be the last - seeks to make the Council change its mind, thereby ensuring that, at least at the level of condemnation from the civilised world, this time, China gets what it deserves."
"Mr President, China is very much in our minds at the moment following the incident involving the American EP-3 reconnaissance aircraft."
"This is a matter which should be resolved with great urgency by the Chinese authorities before its consequences spiral out of control."
"The US Administration has expressed its regret, which we share, particularly over the loss of a Chinese fighter pilot, but now is the moment to bring this matter to an end by releasing the American aircrew and enabling recovery of the American aircraft."
"Otherwise this matter will become a running sore, poisoning international relations at a very sensitive time."
"The Chinese Government seems anxious to play a fuller part in the international community, particularly in terms of economic development and eventual membership of the WTO."
"But it has not yet realised the need to adjust attitudes in other areas or recognise that political confrontation needs to be replaced by a more conciliatory approach."
"This applies not just in the field of international relations, but in terms of domestic policy as well."
"It will be an enormous leap forward when we no longer have to table resolutions on human rights abuses in China but we see very little progress being made and the catalogue of abuses continues to expand."
"The Falun Gong movement is violently suppressed and some 80 of its members are reported to have died in custody in China in the past 18 months."
"The sustained violence and intimidation against Tibetan Buddhists is little short of a programme of ethnic cleansing."
"A great country like China is surely sufficiently robust and forward-looking that it can give real freedom to all the peoples living under its authority."
"It must show that it recognises the individual humanity of its citizens and will exercise the duty of good government by providing protection for all under the rule of law."
"We urge the Council and the Member States to take strong note of the likely resolution of this Parliament and to support the resolution of the United States at the UN Commission in Geneva deploring the state of human rights in China."
"Mr President, we are looking just now towards China in the hope that the incident involving the American aircraft will be resolved without too much rhetoric and political point-scoring."
"Even setting aside this event, reports from China are, nevertheless, pouring in thick and fast."
"They almost always concern acts of cruelty against its own citizens."
"Commentators the world over are agreed that the human rights situation in China is becoming worse and worse."
"We are talking here about the situation in Tibet and Sinkiang and about the widespread increase in the torture and persecution of dissidents, active trade unionists and representatives of democracy."
"We are talking about the frequent use of the death penalty and the opposition mounted against freedom of expression on the Internet."
"We are talking, in particular, about the arrest, torture and persecution of Falun Gong practitioners."
"The Chinese régime' s objective of breaking this movement will not succeed."
"The persecutions must therefore be halted immediately and a dialogue entered into."
"Parliament agrees about the situation in China."
"I know that the Commission shares this view, and Commissioner Patten has defended human rights in China several times in this Chamber."
"The world' s most populous country is systematically violating its citizens' rights."
"Europe cannot remain silent and watch this happen."
"The signals coming from the Council are, however, conflicting and hypocritical and help weaken the international struggle to get the Chinese régime to change its policy."
"This lack of unity benefits none other than the Chinese régime, and at the expense of the Chinese people."
"The Council must therefore get its act together and show that all the talk about unity is not just idle chatter but can also be expressed in action. It must also support the resolution against China in Geneva in a couple of weeks' time."
"Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists would have liked to have seen the Council, in other words all the Member States together, submit a motion during the 57th sitting of the UN Human Rights Commission."
"We had also asked for this earlier in the European Parliament."
"But we did not get that far."
"We are not too keen ourselves on co-sponsoring with the United States, and would have preferred to have our own European position."
"We will be voting in favour of the resolution because, ultimately, we are naturally all agreed on the human rights situation in China."
"That is why we are delighted about the fact that the European Member States have decided in the Council to vote jointly for a resolution after all, if it is submitted."
"Apparently, it is not up to us to submit this resolution, but if the United States submits one, then we can support it."
"That is an advance on last year, when the Member States were still divided."
"Although he cannot speak on behalf of the Council, maybe Mr Lamy can give us this information here."
"The exciting thing for both Europe and China is, of course, that we have an incredibly strong financial market."
"We need a sound human rights policy to match."
"Foreign policy and the economy must be consistent and, in a completely different way, this also applies to China."
"China is extremely generous when it comes to giving free rein to economic processes."
"At the same time, the country is incredibly oppressive and dictatorial in its political policy."
"This will, of course, generate impossible tensions, fundamental also in terms of human rights."
"They sign international conventions, which they struggle to implement and then contravene."
"It would be extremely positive if we could encourage all those powers in China which inject more consistency into the fabric."
"Any partnership which we as Europe can enter into with China in this respect is very welcome."
"At the same time, we must continue to speak in clear terms on human rights and condemn as and when appropriate."
"That is why this resolution is so pertinent."
"Mr President, I realise that the questions on this point are addressed more to the Council than the Commission and that we are a poor substitute."
"Nonetheless, the Commission is examining the problem in depth and we share many of the concerns which have just been voiced."
"Broadly speaking, our position can be summarised as follows."
"The living conditions of the bulk of the Chinese population have improved over the last twenty years as economic reform and liberalisation have given citizens a certain degree of economic and social freedom."
"Unfortunately - and I do stress unfortunately - the same cannot be said of civil and political rights, and the human rights situation still falls considerably short of the commitments that China has entered into internationally."
"As you know, back in 1996 we set up a bilateral dialogue with China, which provides a suitable forum for frank exchanges of views which I can bear witness to, having attended the last summit meeting between China and the European Union during the French Presidency."
"A number of positive signs have emerged, such as the ratification of the UN Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights on 28 February and the signing, last November, of the outline agreement with the UN High Commission for Human Rights which, we hope, will now be implemented."
"We are clearly concerned, however, to see more tangible results on the ground."
"Our main preoccupations are the same as yours, the continued persecution of political dissidents, the restrictions imposed on religious freedom, the application of the death penalty, the ratification of the UN covenants and their implementation, especially as regards political and civil rights, the treatment of ethnic minorities, arbitrary detention and so on."
"As far as the United Nations is concerned, during the General Affairs Council meeting on 19 March, we decided to back the resolution on China tabled by the United States within the Human Rights Commission in Geneva, should that resolution be put to the vote."
"We also agreed that the European Members of the Human Rights Commission would vote against any non-action motion that is tabled and would lobby to ensure the other members did the same."
"We feel that the very notion of non-action is totally opposed to the spirit of dialogue that we have tried to establish."
"We restated our position in Geneva on 29 March that we take the issue of the violation of human rights seriously wherever it occurs in the world."
"As to the question of co-sponsoring the resolution, we feel that the dialogue on human rights between the European Union and China is a privileged channel of communication working to improve the situation in the many spheres of concern to us."
"This is in fact the position which was endorsed by the Council, because we feel that it may have a positive impact."
"As regards this year' s decision, namely that we will support a motion for a resolution which we do not co-sponsor, this does not mean to say that we rule out the possibility of returning to this mechanism at a later date."
"Dialogue is clearly an acceptable option only if it leads to progress on the ground."
"This is the position which was adopted in January on the EU-China dialogue and in the conclusions of the General Affairs Council meeting on 19 March."
"We will therefore support this resolution if it is put to the vote."
"We will not co-sponsor it since we think that direct dialogue still has potential."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m."
"Kyoto Conference objectives"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B5-0267/2001 by Mrs Roth-Behrendt, on behalf of the PSE Group;"
"B5-0270/2001 by Mrs Hautala and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group;"
"B5-0278/2001 by Mr Wurtz and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group;"
"B5-0287/2001 by Mr Moreira Da Silva and others, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group;"
"B5-0291/2001 by Mrs Muscardini, on behalf of the UEN Group;"
"B5-0295/2001 by Mr Davies and others, on behalf of the ELDR Group,"
"on the Kyoto Conference objectives."
"Mr President, by refusing to implement the Kyoto agreement on climate change, the President of the United States is waging an assault not only on people outside the United States but also on his own citizens."
"Mr Bush' s decision to withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol is an indication of his immense lack of responsibility regarding the future of humanity."
"The Social Democrats also wish to strongly emphasise the fact that his attitude is, more than anything, irresponsible with regard to the developing countries."
"The USA' s own emissions of carbon dioxide account for around a quarter of those now produced around the world."
"The USA produces per head of population more than ten times the amount that would represent sustainable development if that were the average figure for everyone on earth."
"The unilateral decision taken by the American President will tend to have an adverse effect on dialogue on either side of the Atlantic."
"To avoid any greater confrontation Bush should reverse his decision and embark on an active dialogue with the EU and other parties to the agreement on climate to ensure that we can together take adequate action to prevent climate change."
"However, in any event, the European Union must keep to its obligations."
"Europe, and presumably the United States also, today have all the technical facilities to ensure that emissions from industry can be reduced by a third from the levels for 1990 by the year 2010."
"Now enormous effort, greater than ever before, must be made in the energy production and traffic and transport sectors."
"There is no economic justification either for abandoning the aims and obligations of Kyoto."
"Sustainable development does not threaten economic prosperity, on the contrary, it promotes the rational use of natural resources and is an assurance of prosperity and jobs for generations to come."
"Mr President, the Social Democrats in the European Parliament would like to make a strong plea in favour of strengthening the action to prevent climatic change, ensuring that it does not in any way weaken and that the Gothenburg summit will send a clear message regarding the wishes of Europeans."
"Mr President, it is scandalous that President Bush is boycotting the Kyoto Protocol."
"Major American oil concerns, such as Exxon, Texaco and Chevron have helped Bush into the saddle."
"Their hand in this boycott is obvious."
"Bush is not only thick, he is as thick as two short planks."
"The EU must respond by ratifying the Kyoto Protocol before the summer of 2002."
"More than 20 countries have already done just that."
"The EU can and must ratify Kyoto, together with our Eastern European partners, Russia, Japan and countries such as Brazil."
"These 55 countries combined account for 55% of emissions."
"Even without the US, the Kyoto Protocol will be legally valid."
"Worldwide negotiations have taken place for nearly ten years."
"The time has come for action and deeds."
"Europe must take the lead with energy savings and renewable energy."
"The new technologies - wind power, biomass and solar energy - will also yield economic benefits for Europe."
"Windmills are Denmark' s second export product."
"European actions should persuade the developing countries to accept the climate objectives in time."
"Those same developing countries already made it clear at the failed climate summit in The Hague that they did not want nuclear energy, even if it were subsidised."
"European and American citizens can break Bush' s Kyoto boycott by boycotting fuel and diesel from Exxon, Texaco and Chevron."
"The political pleas by Commissioner Wallström and the troika were to no avail."
"The majority of MEPs refuse, on principle, to sign such a boycott."
"But MEPs from Sweden and the Netherlands have in the past called for a boycott of the apartheid regime in South Africa."
"Citizens, show your anger and boycott Bush."
"Boycott Exxon, Texaco and Chevron."
"Capital punishment in the US may be ethically unjustified, but in the final analysis it is a matter for the American people."
"However, the demise of the climate which Bush is bringing about for the whole world is unacceptable."
"Mr President, Mrs Myller is the rapporteur in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, for the 6th European Union environmental action programme, which is the environmental strategy for the next ten years."
"And one of the objectives of this debate is to comply with the decisions made in Kyoto, which we consider to be an unavoidable objective for the European Union."
"The European Union set an example when, in Kyoto, it asked for a greater reduction."
"It is true that later, in the discussion and debate, this reduction ended up lower than we all thought, given that the European Environment Agency said that instead of the 8% reduction from 1990, it should be 30%, if we wanted to go along the right path."
"I, therefore, share in the two amendments tabled by my colleagues in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, that is, we have to tell the United States that it is immoral not only for it not to comply with the Kyoto protocol, but also for it to rely on developing countries, saying that only they need to reduce pollution."
"It is immoral, and we have to say so here loud and clear, because while the annual average CO2 emissions of a European are 10 tonnes, the average for an American is 24 tonnes and developing countries are way below the average."
"We need to use this argument in the transatlantic relations that we have with the United States."
"We need to act unilaterally, not only on the basis that we need to look after the competitiveness of companies, but also on the basis that, from an economic point of view, the most reasonable thing to do is to support the Kyoto Protocol and take specific and clear measures aimed at implementing and ratifying the Kyoto Protocol."
"I think that in Europe we can once again set an example if all the European countries ratify the Protocol, if they start to take unilateral measures and if they force the United States, in transatlantic relations, not to continue acting in such an immoral way."
"Mr President, there was palpable shock and disappointment at President Bush's recent announcement that the US will not cooperate with efforts to decrease carbon emissions in the endeavour to stave off the real threat of global warming."
"The US, with 5% of the world's population, produces 25% of the world's greenhouse gases."
"For President Bush to tell the EU delegation in Washington this week that he acknowledges both the problem and the need to find a solution is hollow rhetoric, when the US distances itself from the only solution on the table, and that a partial solution at best."
"Kyoto is only the beginning of the way forward."
"What is President Bush afraid of?"
"Many of the Kyoto signatories, including my own country, are failing to meet our agreed targets; but we must keep trying, we must keep talking - at Bonn next in June or July - and endeavour to reach the targets set for all the difficulties posed in the short term."
"The longer-term consequences will be far more difficult to resolve."
"It is not a question of the environment, or of employment."
"The promotion and protection of economic competitiveness is inextricably linked to the protection of the environment."
"Well-managed environments are themselves a source of wealth creation through agriculture, tourism and the maintenance of assimilative capacity."
"Environmental protection is therefore a matter of enlightened self-interest for the future economic wellbeing and competitiveness of Europe, the US and the entire world."
"Viewed this way, environmental protection becomes part of a virtuous circle whereby a high-quality environment is sustained by wealth, which in turn is sustained by competition, which in turn requires a high-quality environment."
"Yes, environmental orthodoxies must be constantly scrutinised and re-evaluated to ensure that the protection required is proportionate and effective."
"What Kyoto requires of us all is just that: proportionate and effective responses to the global threat of climate change."
"And developed countries and communities have a particular responsibility."
"Great sensitivity, tolerance and compassion must be employed when it is proposed to apply the environmental standards of the developed world to the economies and environments of emerging economies."
"We need to acknowledge the resilience of natural systems and their ability subsequently to recover once a plateau of economic stability has been reached."
"This has been the pattern over most of the developed world."
"Productivity and profitability are important prerequisites for environmental protection and enhancement."
"I acknowledge the need for sustained economic competitiveness to provide the very resources required for a high-quality environment."
"President Bush, there does not need to be any contradiction between these two objectives."
"It is not jobs or the environment."
"Please come back on board Kyoto, and be sure you do not mortgage all our children's heritage."
"Environmental pollution, climate change, is no respecter of borders."
"Mr President, I have requested the floor first and foremost to express my full support for the resolution that has been tabled by the various groups and for the battle which I hope the European Parliament and the entire European Union will wage firmly and resolutely on this matter."
"It is with deep regret that the Europeans and all those who are sincere friends of the United States see a great country, which ought to be the leading light not just of economic progress but also of human civilisation in all fields, abandon one of the fundamental principles: the protection of the environment, of health and of the world that, in years to come, we will be leaving to our children and heirs."
"However, the current problem is not just deciding upon a position which, it appears, has been adopted by these bodies with a very wide majority, but how to move forwards."
"We must, in fact, ask ourselves whether a political position such as that we are adopting, a position putting pressure on the public, is enough in this matter, or whether more tangible action might not be required."
"Now we come to the question we are already, at this stage, putting to the Commission, to the competent bodies."
"Certainly, an initial recommendation has already been made: ratify Kyoto, in any case, and assume all our responsibilities before the world."
"But will all this be enough to make it clear that, without the cooperation of the United States, the battle on the world stage is a difficult one?"
"As of today, therefore, I am posing a question. Will the European Union genuinely stand 100% firm on this issue, or, as I regret to say has happened on other occasions, for example, in certain matters such as the death penalty, will it put up a good fight and then fail to achieve the key objectives at the decisive moment?"
"This, Mr President, is the question we wish to put to the representatives of the Commission today."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even though the worst scenarios involving ongoing climate change are not being depicted, it is the populations of the poorest countries of all that are hit hardest by these changes."
"It is therefore extremely odd that the country responsible for a good quarter of the earth' s total carbon dioxide emissions should not be contributing to the reduction of such emissions."
"It is dreadful and a big disappointment, but it is not exactly surprising."
"It was hardly by chance that President Clinton did not establish the Kyoto Protocol firmly in the American Senate."
"Time after time, and most recently at last year' s Climate Conference in The Hague, the United States has shown its unwillingness to negotiate about the American life-style."
"Now, President Bush has spoken his mind and said openly that the United States does not intend to participate in the Kyoto process because the Protocol, as he puts it, excludes 80 per cent of the world and would seriously damage the American economy."
"It is deeply shocking to see the world' s largest democracy knowingly sacrifice the long-term interests of the majority of the earth' s population on the altar of its own greed."
"Mr President, I wish to express my support for the positions put forward by our fellow Member, Jorge Moreira da Silva, who led our delegation at the Hague Conference on Climate Change and who demonstrated enormous commitment to achieving the compromise that we reached, fortunately, on this resolution. I wish to make four brief points."
"First of all, I must strongly condemn the unfortunate unilateral decision rejecting the Kyoto Protocol, which warrants our criticism, announced by President Bush."
"Secondly, although this is a serious development, it comes as no surprise; the Union should have forearmed itself a long time ago with alternative strategies."
"Thirdly, we must not waver or hesitate over the need to implement the Kyoto Protocol, with or without the United States."
"My fourth and final point is that the European Union must now redouble its efforts and demonstrate effective leadership, both within the European Union, by fighting against the increase in emissions that we are seeing today in most of our fifteen Member States and beyond the Union, by ensuring that Kyoto is ratified by as many countries as possible so that it can enter into force before 2002."
"Mr President, since the Bush administration has taken up office, the entire world is being shaken up by his highly conservative policy."
"His first action, abolishing aid to third-world countries in the field of birth control, was promptly followed by the transfer of social security in America to the churches."
"You cannot get any food in America unless you say your prayers."
"Subsequently, we witnessed America' s withdrawal from the Middle East peace process."
"That is literally a life-threatening development."
"And now, to cap it all, Kyoto."
"Bush thinks he can afford not to adhere to the worldwide agreements on CO2 reduction."
"The interests of the American oil industry thus apparently outweigh the environmental interest."
"All these retrograde steps surprise progressive Europeans and people worldwide."
"Our group is of the opinion, therefore, that it is of the utmost importance for all European institutions, but also the European Member States, to continue to take a firm stand against this development."
"Mr President, Commissioner, although it was distressing to hear in The Hague of the failure of the signatories to the agreement on global warming to implement the Kyoto Protocol, we must nevertheless welcome the healthy political reactions condemning the shameful provocation by President Bush who, by trying to blow the commitments of the fight against greenhouse gas emissions out of the water, is simply rewarding the American oil lobby which financed his electoral campaign."
"Commissioner, we must save the Kyoto Protocol."
"The survival of the planet is at stake."
"That is why we must set an example."
"With or without the United States, the European Union must sign the Kyoto Protocol."
"We must show and we must prove to the whole world that, as one of the parties responsible for currently polluting the planet, we are genuinely committed, in practical terms too, to combating greenhouse gas emissions."
"Public opinion supports us in this."
"We must convince the American public that its President is making an historic mistake."
"Mr President, in the light of the unilateral decision made by the United States, I would like to remind you of the conclusions of the intergovernmental group of experts on climate change, which said that if nothing is done to put a brake on the current trend, temperatures may increase by between 1.4 and 5.8 degrees by 2100, which will have disastrous consequences for the planet."
"Sea levels will rise; there will be more severe droughts and more brutal floods; islands, coastal regions and deltas will disappear; we will see famines and epidemics and entire species will become extinct."
"The poorest populations will be most affected. And this is not necessarily the worst-case scenario."
"That is why Parliament must take a stand on this issue and express, in the strongest terms, its deep indignation at the decision taken by President Bush to reject the Kyoto Protocol."
"At a time when populations are quite rightly apprehensive about the prospect of climate change, the consequences of which would be disastrous, the United States, the major consumer of energy in the world, has taken a decision which is totally irresponsible and dangerous."
"Furthermore, I think that all honourable Members are aware of the fact that the United States has even gone so far as to authorise an oil company to drill for oil in an Alaskan nature reserve."
"This attitude of allegiance to the interests of multinational companies shows total contempt for both humans and nature."
"All nations must assume their responsibilities."
"I welcome the protests made by the European Union, other major countries and Member States."
"The United States, which signed the Kyoto Protocol in 1998, must be called to account."
"We must reject any re-examination of the Kyoto commitments. We must ratify and apply the protocol even without the United States."
"Commissioner, as we know from past experience that a verbal protest will not be enough, in order to apply effective pressure it would be judicious to include environmental clauses in international commercial negotiations."
"It is the future of the planet and of our children that is at stake."
"I do not think it is employment which acts against the environment."
"Once again, it is the primacy of money that militates against humane and sustainable development, which is the undeniable ambition espoused by the European Union."
"Mr President, naturally the blow dealt to us by the US President has affected us deeply."
"The worst thing would be if we were now to cast doubt on our own objectives in Europe."
"This must not happen."
"I would like to remind you that we have a great many documents, such as the White Paper on Renewable Energies, and a great many directives which we have not fully applied and implemented."
"The more credible we ourselves are, the stronger our arguments will be in relation to the United States."
"We must also try, by bypassing the US administration, to convince the American intelligentsia of the benefits, especially the obvious ecological benefits, of reducing pollution."
"However, there are also massive economic and social advantages."
"If we open up this channel of communication we have the chance to prove that our economic future also lies in implementing ecological objectives."
"Mr President, President Bush' s decision is deeply tragic."
"For more than ten years, negotiations have been under way concerning measures to protect the climate."
"The United States has participated the whole time and privately forced compromises, especially on the part of us Europeans."
"Now that they are jumping ship, it is like throwing ten years of negotiations out of the window."
"It jeopardises the whole of the international negotiation system in the environmental sphere."
"President Bush states that the United States' s economy would be damaged."
"At the same time, we know that the United States consumes more than twice as much energy per produced unit as is on average the case in the EU."
"The potential for energy saving in the United States is enormous."
"What has happened is deeply tragic."
"The United States' s action means that we Europeans bear that much heavier a responsibility for taking the lead in climate work, for the work must continue, with or without the United States."
"We must then hope that the United States' s political leadership will listen to reason, for positive cooperation on the part of the United States is crucial in the long run if we are to be able to stabilise the climate."
"We must not therefore stop at merely criticising and condemning the United States, because we at the same time need a dialogue if we are to succeed in changing President Bush' s decision in the long term."
"Mr President, here is the world leader, who has such an irresponsible attitude towards the environment and towards our future; it is completely unacceptable."
"I would fully support any call for the boycotting of US oil companies right throughout Europe."
"The only way we are going to have any effect on the United States is if we use bullying tactics."
"It is clear that President Bush is only representing the interests of US industry."
"He does not care about the planet, nor about the future for ourselves and our children."
"Considering that the US is the world's biggest consumer of energy, it is completely unacceptable for it to take this totally irresponsible approach."
"President Bush is not a world leader, he is actually a prehistoric monster because he cannot understand what is happening in this world."
"If he does not understand, we are in big trouble because America is the biggest power in the world and, if it has such an irresponsible attitude, what is going to happen with the rest of the world?"
"It is completely unacceptable."
"He is an absolute disgrace and I pity the American people."
"The decision by President of the United States to reject even the cautious commitments of the Kyoto Protocol on emissions of six greenhouse gases into the atmosphere is clearly totally irresponsible from the point of view of the environment and the interests of humanity."
"However, the verbal clashes on this subject between the United States and the other industrial powers are hypocritical."
"The behaviour of America' s leaders is only the reflection of the behaviour of an entire social class which monopolises the means of production of the entire planet, in the United States, in Europe and elsewhere."
"Mr Bush is just doing the dirty work for large US corporations in the oil and coal industry."
"He is applying the philosophy of an economic order based on the quest for profit."
"Were European governments, however, which, by the way, claim to be defenders of the environment, able to prevent the Erika disaster?"
"Were they able to prevent many continental rivers being turned into sewers?"
"Were they able to prevent Seveso?"
"Are they even able to force industrial companies to respect the working environment and the health of their own workers?"
"Just like the Government of the United States, their main concern is to create the political conditions which will enable large companies to maximise their profits and not to curb them, even in the interest of society at large."
"For our part, while condemning the Government of the United States, we condemn the governments of all industrial powers and, beyond that, the current economic order, in which profit is everything and human beings count for nothing."
"Mr President, it is clear that, like Parliament, the Commission is extremely disappointed by recently announced rejection of the Kyoto Protocol by the United States."
"As you know, we took the initiative of condemning this rejection."
"Mr Prodi and Mr Persson wrote to President Bush on 14 March to voice our indignation."
"Mrs Wallström and our Council colleagues spent some of this week in the United States with Mrs Wittman and Mr Armitage, who are the competent persons in the American administration."
"We are not going to settle for these contacts, and we have also decided that this troika will hold talks with Canada and will initiate talks in the coming weeks with Russia, Iran, China and Japan."
"We have decided to do everything within our power to keep the Kyoto process on track."
"Be that as it may, the American administration has confirmed its unwillingness and hence its refusal to ratify the Kyoto Protocol."
"It has given no indication of the content of the recently announced re-examination of its policies on climate change or the date on which this information will be made public."
"The problem is very serious."
"The only good news, if you can call it that, is that, up to now, nobody has challenged the current state of scientific knowledge on climate change, which is an achievement, and the United States has indicated that it will continue to be involved in future international negotiations."
"Mrs Wallström clearly pointed out to our American counterparts that abandoning the Protocol would be a mistake."
"To start from scratch would not only be a waste of time but would also risk breaking the fragile balance that the Protocol had succeeded in establishing between the industrialised world, which had greatly contributed to the problem, and developing countries whose emissions per inhabitant were far below those of industrialised nations."
"At the same time, the European Union declared its intention to continue negotiations within the Kyoto framework, despite the fact that the United States had dropped out."
"The Protocol could come into effect if the European Union, the applicant countries, Russia and Japan ratified it."
"Like Mr de Roo, we believe that the impact of the Protocol will be lessened because of the absence of the biggest polluter on the planet, but we cannot, and we must not, wait for the Americans."
"So we have clearly reaffirmed our commitment to ratify the Kyoto Protocol in 2002 at the latest and, to this end, preparations are under way."
"This requires us to adopt a consistent approach, which means continuing our efforts to combat climate change."
"The European programme on climate change that Mrs González mentioned is now in existence."
"It is under development."
"We are going to make every effort to move the Protocol forward."
"We will ratify it and we will ensure that we are consistent."
"You can count on the Commission to continue to fulfil its role as the driving force in matters of climate change, which Mrs Isler-Béguin called for. We will also continue to ensure that the European Union is the driving force at an international level both in terms imparting our values to other countries and also in terms of our own implementation strategy."
"Like Mrs Myller, I am in no doubt that the two issues will feature on the agenda of the summit between the United States and Europe, which will take place in Gothenburg during the next European Council which, as you know, will be mainly devoted to the environment."
"This is therefore an important date for us all."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m."
"Human rights"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"Abduction of Mr Tsiakourmas in Cyprus - B5-0266/2001 by Mr Katiforis, on behalf of the PSE Group;"

"on the rights of homosexuals in Namibia."
"Abduction of Mr Tsiakourmas in Cyprus"
"SE). (EL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Tsiakourmas has been wrongly accused of drug dealing."
"As far as this accusation is concerned, allow me to read, in English, the report by the police stationed on the British bases, which are British sovereign territory, on the circumstances surrounding his arrest."
"The British police investigated the matter and they say:"
"In spite of the statements of the Turkish Cypriot police to the contrary, all other available evidence indicates that Mr Tsiakourmas was taken from his vehicle."
"The vehicle was abandoned well within the eastern sovereign base areas."
"There is absolutely no evidence, forensic or historical, to indicate that Mr Tsiakourmas had or has ever had illegal drugs in his motor vehicle, or in his possession."
"I think that if the Greek Government had said this, I would believe it, but others might not."
"If the Government of Cyprus had said this, I would believe it, but others might not."
"But these are the words of the British police."
"I think that draws a line under the question of what happened."
"As to the political significance of what happened, Mr Tsiakourmas was a building contractor who went into the British base, which is close to a Turkish-Cypriot village, and collected Turkish labourers for building work."
"In other words, this was a man with contacts with both communities, which the Turkish and Turkish-Cypriot leaders wish to keep apart and at loggerheads."
"It was because he was in the delicate position of dealing with his Turkish counterparts in Cyprus that he became the target of this criminal abduction."
"May I say that it is a sorry spectacle to see an arbitrary power which has claimed to be a state for 25 years, which has not been recognised by the international community for 25 years, now trying to impose its de facto presence by engaging in gangster-type abductions."
"Commissioner, I turn to you."
"Concern for the fate of the individual is one of the most noble traditions of France, your country and homeland."
"We need only think of the Dreyfus case, we need only think of Flaubert' s trial, we need only think of Zola' s 'J' accuse' trial."
"Tsiakourmas is, of course, no Dreyfus, Zola or Flaubert."
"But, in his own small way, he represents the very same problem."
"Which is why I call on you and the Commission to evince an interest in his case."
"Let me assure you that, in fighting and claiming his freedom, Tsiakourmas is claiming freedom, peace and reconciliation for the two communities in Cyprus."
"Mr President, I would like to express my agreement with Mr Katiforis."
"This is a really bad case of an unjustifiable seizure of a person outside the territory to which he was then taken and in which he has been illegally detained since 13 December last year."
"We want to take account of the fact, do we not, that Turkey has advanced towards candidate status for membership of the Union and that so long as we have sores of this kind weeping in the corner of the Mediterranean and problems of this sort, Turkey puts itself outside of reasonable consideration."
"This is a grievous attack on human rights, it is a totally unacceptable insult to a human being and we call for the President to let us put this resolution forward with the support of the whole of Parliament."
"Mr President, the accusations against Mr Tsiakourmas are groundless to the point that they must surely be thrown out even by the kangaroo court in which he is being tried."
"The question, of course, is where the illegal occupying regime in northern Cyprus finds the nerve to take such action, especially in an area under British sovereignty."
"Obviously, if the so-called international community wished to put an end to the occupying regime, it would have the means to do so."
"This comment applies even more so to the European Union, given that Turkey is a candidate country and Cyprus is already engaged in accession negotiations."
"The European Union has the means to exert pressure and could use them."
"At the same time, however, the European Union has huge economic, political and military interests in Turkey and it is obviously these interests that dictate its conduct."
"Furthermore, it would appear that the very procedure to integrate Cyprus into the European Union is probably complicating the Cyprus question, rather than helping to resolve it."
"In all events, we call on the European Union and on the Government of the United Kingdom to, at least this once, let Turkey feel the sharp edge of its tongue and ensure that Mr Tsiakourmas is released unconditionally."
"Mr President, I should like us all to vigorously support the motion for a resolution on the liberation of Mr Tsiakourmas."
"This is not the time to confine ourselves to polite recommendations to Turkey, whose forces illegally abducted him from inside the British base at Dhekelia in Cyprus and have been holding him in prison ever since, despite the fact that he is seriously ill and his life is in danger."
"I honestly wonder how Great Britain can accept this breach of its sovereignty without reacting decisively and effectively, which it is perfectly capable of doing, if it so chooses."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the abduction of Mr Tsiakourmas, the incursion of Turkish occupying forces on to neutral soil in Cyprus, the claim on Greek islands and Turkey' s constant threats that, if the Republic of Cyprus becomes a member of the European Union, Turkey will react violently, as the Minister of the Interior, Mr Cem, stated a few days ago, prove that Turkey saw the decision by the Helsinki Summit as an expression of weakness on the part of Europe."
"That is why, instead of falling into line with the terms laid down for it to become a member, it has become even more audacious."
"It is time for the European Union to prove that Turkey cannot pour scorn on our courtesy, tolerance and efforts to help it become a true democracy based on the rule of law before we accept it into the European family with impunity."
"Mr President, this is a straightforward case of illegal actions."
"Mr Tsiakourmas should be released and treated properly and his case should not be a weapon in a propaganda war between Greek and Turkish Cypriots, the latest manifestation of which is about which side has destroyed more of the other's culture."
"I am pleased to represent both communities as residents of London, and both deserve equal respect for themselves and their culture."
"I refuse to choose one side or the other."
"Our interest is in a united European Cyprus."
"The EU must get more engaged in the search for a political solution and it should press for mutual respect."
"We could perhaps give some funding to the preservation of both sides' cultural monuments."
"But in the meantime Mr Tsiakourmas must not be held hostage."
"Illegal action is illegal wherever it happens and this case must be solved without it becoming a weapon in a propaganda war."
"Mr President, the Tsiakourmas case should never have happened and it must quickly be brought to an end."
"It involves infringement of British sovereign territory and the wrongful arrest of a vulnerable individual who has no record of wrongdoing."
"It seems to have been an ill conceived tit-for-tat."
"With some regret, therefore, I have to say that we will support the resolution and I call on the Turkish authorities to release Mr Tsiakourmas now."
"I have also to say that it is a pity that the resolution contains some unfortunate language."
"When I spoke to the Greek Cypriot Foreign Minister, Mr Kasoulides, last week, I said to him that now was the time to build bridges to Turkish Cypriots, to find ways of reducing the economic isolation of northern Cyprus and to use language that might encourage support for Turkish people for genuine bi-communal and bi-zonal Cyprus as called for in the United Nations resolutions."
"I say to Turkish Cypriots: avoid stupid incidents and get into constructive dialogue."
"I say to the Greek Cypriots: stop seizing on opportunities for confrontation and stretch out a hand of friendship."
"Violence towards Catholic nuns"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, the truth here is extremely painful."
"The conspiracy of silence has been broken and it has come to light that Catholic priests and bishops are guilty of criminal acts against nuns in at least 23 countries."
"The report, which was published in the American periodical 'National Catholic Reporter' , talks of rape, sexual abuse, contamination with AIDS, forced abortions and blackmail and persecution of anyone who has the courage to report these acts of violence to the officials in charge."
"However much the Vatican official, Joachim Navarro Vals, has attempted to play down the issue or restrict it solely to Africa, sexual abuse and violation of the fundamental rights of women are a fact of life and, of course, neither bishops nor priests are above the law."
"That is precisely why my political group is calling for the perpetrators to be handed over to the authorities and for the judicial authorities in the 23 countries in which these crimes were committed to deal with all the cases of violence against women."
"For its part, the Holy See should release the five reports on the matter, strip those responsible of all official titles, work with the judicial authorities, restore the expelled nuns to their positions, give the victims the necessary protection and compensation and, above all, take measures to prevent similar situations from arising in the future and, of course, instruct priests in the fundamental rights of women."
"Mr President, instead of standing in judgment as a politician, I would like to quote two paragraphs from one of the reports which speak for themselves."
"Highly placed generals were extremely alarmed about the sexual intimidation to which nuns were subjected in certain regions."
"One mother superior from a diocese where several nuns became pregnant by priests was unable to find a suitable solution."
"In another community, 20 nuns had to be dismissed because they had become pregnant, in many cases by priests."
"Secondly, nuns have been harmed in various countries."
"When one sister became pregnant by a priest, she had to leave the community, whilst the priest involved could carry on with his calling."
"Is this social justice?"
"The sister is being abandoned in a situation in which she has to raise the child as a single parent and is for the most part subject to considerable stigma in deplorable social circumstances."
"Examples have been quoted of certain countries where they were obliged to become second and third wives in a family as a result of losing their social status in the local culture."
"The alternative, in order to survive, is to walk the streets as prostitutes and to expose themselves to the risks of HIV, if they have not already been infected by the priest."
"Mr President, I think that we were all shocked when both in the Balkans and in Africa rape was used as yet another weapon of war."
"However, I must confess my surprise that an organisation respected across the world should have hidden for so many years what happened to the women that were working for it."
"I am therefore completely in agreement with the resolution that we are going to put forward here today and that those responsible should be tried and punished like any other citizens who infringe people' s dignity."
"I think that we all, both men and women, are sorry for what happened, but I also think that as women we understand the degree of pain, humiliation, powerlessness and indignity involved in being forced to keep quiet in the face of such an attack on human dignity."
"Therefore, Mr President, I think that this resolution is necessary and that we should send it to all the bodies mentioned at the end of it."
"Mr President, the Vatican is not immediately known for its progressive view of sexuality."
"Not only does contraception give women throughout the world control over their own bodies, but condoms could also save the lives of tens of thousands of people in the African countries hit by AIDS."
"The Vatican opposes such measures."
"It is also trying to stop women who have been raped in Bosnia, for example, from having access to abortions."
"Against this background, it is extremely shocking to study the report showing how Catholic priests have committed acts of cruelty and actually raped nuns and other women."
"This is something the Vatican has known about since 1994, but it has tried to play down what has happened and silenced the women when they have tried to speak out or been forced to have abortions."
"A number of them have also reportedly been infected with AIDS."
"This is no isolated incident. It has happened in at least 23 countries, and there is only one word to summarise what has happened, and that - emphatically - is 'disgraceful' ."
"The Vatican must lose no time in punishing those responsible, apologise to the women affected, investigate properly what happened and publish the report in its entirety."
"Mr President, our group has decided against supporting the present resolution."
"In our opinion, sexual abuse of women is too serious to be used for political ends and for placing religious communities, in this case the Catholic Church, in a bad light."
"We consider rape and sexual abuse to be violations of fundamental human rights and of human dignity. We reject any form of aggression against women and are of the opinion that offenders need to be punished, irrespective of their profession."
"We are united in solidarity with the victims."
"Our group is expressing grave concern with regard to the sexual abuse committed by priests, medical doctors, politicians and others in positions of trust and moral authority."
"The Catholic community of faith and the Holy See have always rejected violence and sexual abuse, both on the basis of Christian values and of international treaties and obligations."
"Via its official representatives, the Holy See has acknowledged and condemned the actions, and has, in cooperation with the responsible bishops, superiors of religious orders and communities and other competent authorities, taken measures against the priests in question. This was done to support the victims and to prevent these eruptions of violence from being repeated."
"Sexual abuse by priests must be condemned and penalised without delay."
"However, we should not generalise."
"There are more than 404 000 priests and nearly 820 000 nuns worldwide."
"The fact that irresponsible members of the clergy have committed these acts of abuse, especially in developing countries where women often play a subordinate role culturally compared to men, does not mean that the majority of nuns and priests in the world are not dedicated: they are often the first to be self-effacing in the fight for peace and justice and against poverty."
"Our group welcomes the open debate in this matter and we regret that the response to sexual abuse has hitherto been inadequate."
"We want an effective response to all incidents and expect churches and other responsible organisations to step up their efforts to do everything in their power to prevent this from happening in future."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this proposal is seriously unfair, poorly thought out and out of all proportion."
"It shows complete disregard for the victims and is nothing but inappropriate chicanery."
"In these cases of rape, which are reprehensible, the catholic nuns' suffering was twofold: they suffered both as women and as nuns within a holy order."
"The Catholic Church has also been offended by the reprehensible actions of some of its members."
"When reality is exaggerated, facts are distorted and attempts are made to attack not the rapists but the church to which the nuns belong, many nuns feel violated a second time, now by this grotesque act of political manipulation."
"In dealing with this matter, understanding and respect for religion are required."
"Clearly this is not the position of those tabling the motion."
"This proposal attacks those who have attacked the problem, betrays a complete ignorance or scorn for the organisation of the Catholic Church itself, which is not the centralised European superstate that many people consider it to be. It is profoundly decentralised, both its Diocesan College and in its numerous institutes and religious congregations, as well as in other areas."
"This resolution could have attacked those who have violated and betrayed the service of God."
"But no, in an instant it passes swiftly over these, these few bad examples, and rains blows down on the Church as a whole."
"It was the Church that discovered these cases, debated them and then dealt with them as soon the facts were known."
"The Church deserves our appreciation for this as well as for everything else it has done for the communities it helps."
"It certainly does not deserve this misguided attack."
"Furthermore, it was the Church that brought these cases to our attention, not the frenzied proponents of a paradoxical text that attacks the solution instead of the problem."
"I voted against the proposal."
"It is completely lacking in humanity and is nothing but a monument to cynicism and hypocrisy."
"I speak on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group and, particularly on behalf of the Irish delegation, who expressly asked me to do so."
"Mr President, the Catholic media are reporting on extremely harrowing incidents."
"My heart goes out to the abused women within the Roman Catholic Church when I read about their plight."
"I therefore sincerely hope that this debate will help put an end to these wrongs for good."
"I assume that this is the intention of those submitting the resolution and that they are not being led by anti-religious feelings."
"In my opinion, the resolution not only addresses the Vatican, it also appeals to all church authorities to act in line with Christian ethics."
"The individual' s responsibility should not disappear in the anonymity of large institutions."
"There are no mitigating circumstances for the behaviour of the African priests involved."
"Neither their young age, nor different cultural notions regarding celibacy could justify these acts of violence."
"Any Christian denomination based on the Bible knows that abuse of women cannot be covered by the cloak of charity."
"We dishonour the name of Christ if we deal with these issues in this way."
"The joint resolution calls for a judicial procedure to provide a full account of the events - and rightly so."
"Based on my Christian faith, I should like to give my unqualified support to this appeal."
"As to the extent of this problem, we can only guess at the moment."
"The American magazine 'National Catholic Reporter' lists 23 countries where sexual abuse occurs."
"In any event, it is more than a marginal phenomenon."
"As long ago as 1994, there were reports of cases of abuse, but so far it has been unclear as to what action was taken to prevent violence against women."
"The Vatican must recognise the relevant issue and must give a clear account of the measures which are being taken to ban such practices in future."
"Finally, I would like to express my appreciation for the scrapping of recital H from the original resolution."
"If this had not been done, I would have had no option but to vote against the resolution."
"However much I denounce the distressing cases of abuse, these should not simply be associated with the Vatican' s policy on women' s reproductive rights."
"Bringing a pro-life approach to these issues into discredit in this way is inappropriate."
"Mr President, naturally we condemn these disgraceful deeds, whoever perpetrates them."
"But this resolution contains inaccuracies, distortions, lies and half-truths and so cannot be accepted."
"I believe this issue is too serious to be used as a party-political and ideological football."
"However, that is exactly what is happening."
"The Vatican has neither a global police force nor a global court to pursue these matters. But above all this is an issue for the state authorities."
"Of course, we support the Holy See in its efforts to combat these practices."
"We must be clear, however, about one thing. As Mrs Malmström has stated quite openly, this resolution clearly aims to weaken the role of the Holy See in international organisations where it is used on behalf of the family, for the protection of life, and against sexual abuse."
"This is often not the case with the governments of many Member States."
"This resolution is hypocritical and unacceptable. I therefore consider it to be dangerous because this issue was all too often abused in the twentieth century by totalitarian powers in order to discredit the Church."
"We must not go down this path."
"The people of the Church who lend their support to other people do not deserve such defamation."
"Mr President, I and everyone in this House condemns sexual abuse of women, or of anyone for that matter, and any delay in bringing to justice those who perpetrate it, whatever their creed, nationality or profession, should rightly be condemned."
"I cannot, however, support this resolution which targets one specific church; a church which has acknowledged and condemned the cases in question and which has made clear it is taking measures in cooperation with the competent church representatives and civil authorities against the perpetrators involved."
"It is also supporting the victims, as it does sexual-abuse victims, through its outreach programmes through the world and it is taking steps to prevent a repetition of these terrible incidents."
"Regretfully, it must be said that resolutions of this nature suggest an ulterior motive for political reasons, which appears to be the deliberate discrediting of the Catholic Church and the Holy See on an international level and possibly forcing its removal from international forums, where it is actively promoting the dignity of women and mothers."
"Mr President, the declaration by Mrs Martens could be mine entirely. I would, however, like to add the following."
"This sensitive and appalling issue came to light thanks to the openness of the Catholic press and to Catholic researchers who had drawn up a report. Eventually, the Catholic Church hierarchy reacted to, and condemned, these events."
"I also remember bishops, from the Netherlands for example, making statements."
"So why are we rubbing salt into the wound of the Roman Catholic Church?"
"As a Protestant, I must say that I am very surprised about this, to say the least."
"I read an interview in the Dutch press with one of the people who started the ball rolling and in which the background was explained."
"She says: ""We are against the Pope visiting the European Parliament."
"We must make it more difficult in this way."
"Secondly, we would really like to give as good as we get with regard to all the Pope' s admonitions in the moral sphere."""
"If that is the background, there is so much false fire on the altar, to put it in Protestant terms, that it is absolutely impossible for me to back this resolution."
"I also think that those nuns who suffered in the course of these events are now also being abused politically, something about which I am ashamed."
"Mr President, on such a sensitive issue as that of the urgent subject under consideration, we are genuinely perplexed."
"There is absolutely no doubt that the act itself is to be utterly condemned."
"However, to use this to create a theory which is tantamount to a political attack, which, in effect, this is, on the Catholic Church and the Holy See is a wholly inappropriate action in respect of the moral authority exercised by the Holy See throughout the world."
"What we find even more worrying is the way in which the concept of accountability is being used to state that what happens to a man must be considered to be the moral responsibility of the Holy See."
"We are truly perplexed because, if such sensitive matters are exploited in this way, we will ultimately lose sight of one of the tasks that the Church is carrying out with such difficulty in the world, the safeguarding of human dignity."
"Mr President, I would like to make it quite clear that the way this subject is being exploited for political ends is totally unacceptable, particularly the attempt to undermine the role played by the Catholic Church and the Holy See in those international bodies from which some would like to see it removed in order to further lobbies such as those behind this motion."
"I would like, first of all, to point out that the Holy See is one thing and the individual people belonging to the Catholic Church are another."
"The Holy See is not a State of which every Catholic is a citizen; the Holy See serves the universal community through its authority but it cannot be held responsible for every action of all the Catholics in the world, whether priests or lay people."
"This must be clearly understood to be a fact when we form opinions in a delicate matter such as this."
"Therefore, when the motion makes several explicit references to the responsibility of the Holy See, it is entering the realms of political exploitation, which must be totally rejected."
"Pakistan"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, twenty years ago, when the SAARC was established, the South Asian countries and the European Union laid the foundations of an ambitious partnership of development and freedom of expression."
"The recent arrests of politicians in Pakistan are, unfortunately, a cruel statement of failure."
"These mass arrests of more than a thousand people are a good illustration of the determination of the regime of General Musharraf to quell the democratic aspirations of the Pakistani people and to prevent political parties from carrying out their legitimate activities."
"In 1999, a few months after the coup, in my capacity as Vice-Chairman of the South East Asia delegation, I met the ambassador of Pakistan, at his request, who ensured me that the military junta which had just snatched power from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif would quickly prepare the ground for a democratic Pakistan."
"We are now, however, witnessing the intolerable radicalisation of this regime and the words 'democracy' , 'human rights' and 'political pluralism' are being written in letters of blood in Pakistan."
"The inspiration born of democratisation - that we had longed to see - quickly gave way to intolerance and arbitrary arrests."
"The European Parliament cannot remain silent when faced with a situation which holds sway in a country with which the European Union has cooperated for so long."
"We owe it to ourselves to make it clear to General Musharraf that respect for human rights and democracy is what makes a policy of cooperation meaningful."
"We owe it to ourselves to ask him to organise free, pluralist and transparent elections as soon as possible, which the Supreme Court of Pakistan has also called for."
"Mr President, Commissioner, as we heard from our fellow MEPs, such a long time after the military coup in Pakistan, we are further removed from real democracy and rule of law."
"We also note that the Pakistani military junta is providing active support to the inhumane Taliban regime in Afghanistan."
"Following Commander Massud' s visit to the European Parliament, the Pakistani Embassy addressed the President of our Parliament with a plea for a negotiated solution in Afghanistan."
"We too call for a political solution to the Afghan conflict."
"We too realise that the sanctions against the Taliban regime could end up harming the population and could bring about streams of refugees."
"We value Pakistan' s condemnation of the destruction of the cultural heritage by the Taliban, but we expect more."
"The Pakistani Government should put an end to its support for the Taliban regime and the fundamentalist groups."
"It has to help Pakistan on its way to the rule of law and strive towards a sustainable peace in the region."
"Mr President, what an undignified national day it is when the incumbent ruler of Pakistan calls on his own people to actively support the social model when, on the eve of this event, thousands of citizens were incarcerated."
"The police arrested the very people who fight for solidarity and justice and, instead of arresting activists who have gone underground, they arrest their family members."
"Among those arrested was Nasrullah Khan, the leader of the democratic renewal movement."
"The behaviour of the military regime in Pakistan is absolutely unacceptable."
"Credence can no longer be given to the reassurances and declarations of intention given by its ruler."
"Pakistan must fulfil its obligations as a member of the United Nations."
"These obligations include securing freedom of speech and freedom of assembly."
"The position of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is that it is no longer enough for the international community simply to complain."
"We call on the Commission to exert all its political clout and fight for the early release of the prisoners."
"The leader of the military regime, General Musharraf, is responsible for continuing to obstruct a return to democracy and humanity."
"The stability of the ruler of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan both at home and abroad is just for show."
"It will only be for real when the ruling of the Supreme Court to allow free national elections is implemented."
"The deadlines for these elections to take place must be adhered to."
"Independent parties must be allowed to field candidates."
"They must stop being exposed to constant pressure."
"These elections must take place under the supervision of international observers."
"In the sphere of human rights, the European Union must be active in Pakistan and must involve people who often risk life and limb in campaigning on behalf of human rights issues, namely the NGOs."
"We are obliged to do this."
"This would be our contribution to a great national day in Pakistan."
"Commissioner, we hope we will succeed."
"Mr President, thanks to General Musharraf' s rule, the Pakistani population is jumping out of the frying pan into the fire."
"There is nothing left of democracy, and the prospects are gloomy."
"The announcement of elections appears to be no more than a diversion to mislead the international community."
"Active party members of the opposition are being apprehended."
"Election campaigns have been rendered impossible, and the independence of the judiciary has been compromised."
"Whilst the World Bank is agonising over economic reform in Pakistan, the military regime is wrecking democracy."
"No democracy means no stability, and no stability means no economic recovery."
"Pakistan is becoming increasingly isolated on the world stage."
"The financial and military support granted by the military regime to the Taliban barbarians in Afghanistan is repugnant."
"According to the Afghan opposition leader, who is on a visit here today, only political reform in Pakistan can lead to the downfall of the Muslim extremists in the neighbouring country."
"The European Union was right to halt the negotiations with Pakistan."
"As long as democracy has not been fully re-established, there cannot be any hope of a cooperation agreement."
"The political dialogue can only be continued on an ad hoc basis and, in this connection, the regime has to be put under great pressure to hold fair elections soon."
"The Pakistani population must not be left in the lurch."
"European development aid must remain focused on education and other social programmes."
"Aid for elections can only be granted if it contributes to a fair course of events."
"The chance of that happening appears extremely remote for the time being."
"Pakistan is an important country in the region but, unfortunately, its Government appears to alternate between corrupt regimes and military juntas."
"The population must be freed from this."
"It deserves sunnier prospects."
"Rights of homosexuals in Namibia"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to read you a newspaper report: Today, President X from country Y has called on that country' s regional authorities to point out Jews and black people in their regions so that they can be arrested."
"According to this President, Jews and black people have to be arrested, gaoled and exiled."
"End of quote."
"You probably wonder which country this report is about, and the timeframe in which it is set."
"After all, we are only too aware of the historical examples."
"Replace Jews and blacks by homosexual men and women, and you will realise that I am referring to the very recent statements by the President of Namibia where it appears, not for the first time, that a witch-hunt is being launched."
"Namibia' s President made his appeal to cleanse his country, as he said, of homosexuals, on 19 March."
"Despite numerous protests, both from Namibia and elsewhere, he repeated this appeal earlier this week."
"It is thus not a slip of the tongue but a deliberate campaign."
"On previous occasions, the anti-homosexual rhetoric uttered by the Namibian President could be laughed off."
"It seemed to be a personal hobbyhorse of a frightened man who was desperate to hold on to traditional village life."
"The President' s statements conjure up an image of a community which seems to be losing the battle against sexual promiscuity."
"However, the criminalisation of homosexuals, mixed in with a generous portion of xenophobia, and the call on Namibian women to know their place, do nothing to address the problem."
"On the contrary, exploiting the fear of AIDS in this manner is playing with fire."
"Straightforward advice and the distribution of condoms would be a better solution."
"Namibia' s anti-homosexual campaign forms a threat, not only to the physical well-being of the potential victims, but also to democracy, the rule of law and human rights."
"Amnesty International has declared that it considers people who are gaoled on the grounds of their sexual preference or for exercising their right to freedom of expression and assembly to be prisoners of conscience."
"Namibia must be reminded of its international obligations, which signify that human rights apply to everyone and are universal and indivisible."
"It is crucial, therefore, for the European Union to ask Namibia, in no uncertain terms, to halt this witch-hunt."
"Let Namibia follow the lead of its neighbour, South Africa, where the rights of homosexuals are explicitly guaranteed in the constitution."
"Surely, a country which has fought for its own freedom and against racial discrimination and apartheid cannot embrace sexual discrimination and apartheid."
"Mr President, as Mr Swiebel asserted a moment ago, the statements by the Namibian President, Sam Nujoma, regarding homosexuals in Namibia, are nothing short of a witch-hunt."
"Sexual orientation towards people of the same sex is of all times and all cultures."
"Discrimination against, and persecution of, people with this orientation who openly acknowledge it are no longer of all times and all cultures."
"Fortunately, there is a steady decrease in discrimination in a large number of countries."
"Incitement to exclude, and use violence against, people of this orientation is increasingly becoming less acceptable."
"A good example is South Africa."
"After the apartheid regime was abolished, a clause was included in the constitution which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation."
"The argument used by the Namibian President that homosexuality is a Western phenomenon, an aberration of the West, is a nonsense argument."
"He only needs to look at his South African neighbours, something which, in fact, his colleagues Mr Mugabe and Mr Museveni should also do."
"Mr President, Europe is not only an economic union, it is also a union of standards and values."
"According to my group, the protection of human rights inside and outside Europe forms an integral part of this."
"Homosexual rights are human rights."
"We in Europe must, therefore, take a firm stand against any development, wherever in the world, which encourages slander against, or the exclusion or persecution of people, on the basis of sexual orientation."
"I am for that reason proud that my group is one of the initiators of this resolution which is directed against Namibia this time, and which clearly states that the developments in that country are unacceptable in our eyes."
"Mr President, while the Netherlands allows homosexuals to marry, Namibia despises them."
"This is the year 2001."
"Mr Lagendijk was right to point out that, unfortunately, Namibia is not the only African country which is taking things to such extremes."
"President Mugabe of Zimbabwe terms homosexuals and lesbians, in his own words: 'animals which have to be exterminated' ."
"His henchmen will take care of the rest."
"It is, of course, unacceptable that people should be discriminated against simply on the basis of their sexual preference. However, I appreciate how very delicate and difficult this debate is."
"In Africa, I found out that many people consider homosexuality as something which goes against their culture."
"Respect for culture, however, comes up against its own boundaries when fundamental human rights are at risk."
"Homophobic actions, largely orchestrated by the Government, must be unequivocally condemned."
"However, this should not be all that is done."
"In the spirit of the new Cotonou Agreement, I believe that the persecution of homosexuals should be taken into consideration in the assessment of our cooperation with developing countries."
"After all, the persecution of homosexuals is often not the only violation of human rights in the countries concerned."
"Despite their elevated ideals, certain SADEC countries have recently been repeatedly showing their less attractive sides."
"It is high time that a fresh wind blew through Windhoek and that the homosexual wall in a number of frontline states was razed to the ground."
"As regards the first item, which is the abduction of Mr Tsiakourmas, the Commission is familiar with the circumstances surrounding the arrest of this Greek Cypriot citizen last December."
"It has emerged that Mr Tsiakourmas was abducted on the sovereign territory of a British base in Dhekalia."
"The British Government raised the issue on a number of occasions both with the leader of the Turkish Cypriot community and with the authorities in Ankara."
"The General Affairs Council is going to look into this case when it meets next Monday."
"For our part, we in the Commission are still keeping a watchful eye on developments in the situation from our delegation office in Nicosia."
"According to our information, the proceedings which were opened against Mr Tsiakourmas resumed this week in Famagusta and a verdict is expected shortly."
"Like Mr Katiforis, I think that this case, like many others, must be seen in the context of the political situation in Cyprus."
"We are taking every opportunity to contact the parties involved in order, as you know, to try to promote a political solution to the partitioning of the island."
"As regards the Turkish side, which Mr MacCormick and Mr Alyssandrakis mentioned, you can rest assured that this topic is amongst those we will be dealing with within the framework of the political dialogue between the European Union and Turkey, which was strengthened by the European Council in Helsinki."
"Coming to the second item under the heading of human rights, which is your motion for a resolution on violence against nuns, we feel that the case of the Catholic nuns constitutes a serious violation of the fundamental rights of women and is a dreadful example of violence against them."
"As those who have taken the floor know, the European Union is firmly committed to combating violence against women."
"In all the institutions we are firmly committed to upholding the principles contained in the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, and, in particular, to working to ensure that the commitments entered into in Beijing not very long ago during the fourth women' s conference are respected."
"As far as human rights in Pakistan are concerned, the Commission shares the view of the honourable Members who tabled resolutions on this subject when they state that the recent arrests of so-called political activists belonging to the Alliance for Restoration of Democracy are a major concern."
"During talks with the Pakistani Government last November, the EU troika called on the administration to lift restrictions on the activities of political parties, in particular, the ban on public demonstrations."
"Political parties cannot and must not be excluded from political life in Pakistan any more than elsewhere, since it is clear they are called upon to play an important role in the country' s future."
"We are expecting to see tangible progress in the restoration of representative democracy at all levels, beginning with the holding of elections in provincial and national assemblies on the basis of a clear and credible timetable."
"The Pakistani authorities have given a firm commitment to the EU troika that it will respect the timeframe, which was established by the Supreme Court, of three years following the military coup until the organisation of these elections."
"Although the Government has confirmed that the political parties will be authorised to take part in provincial and national elections, as a number of you have said, it is clear that only the rapid lifting of the ban on public demonstrations will boost confidence in the process to restore democracy in Pakistan."
"As far as the last item is concerned, which is the situation of homosexuals in Namibia, like the authors of this resolution, we were amazed and concerned to read the recent statement on homosexuality which was given by the Namibian President, Sam Nujoma, calling for the persecution of people identified as homosexuals."
"We have always upheld the position that all individuals are entitled to benefit from human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"We believe that all nations must protect and promote these rights and actively contribute to abolishing any form of discrimination on grounds of race, gender, political opinion, religious beliefs and so on."
"Our position also reflects the position which was publicly adopted by the Government of the Republic of Namibia, evidence of which can be found in its constitution and in all the international conventions on human rights which this country has ratified."
"As a result, we are in favour of any overtures made to the Namibian authorities to try to clarify this matter and to express the wish that these recent statements do not constitute a repudiation of Namibia' s existing constitutional provisions, which ban such discrimination."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Lamy."
"I would like to take this opportunity to announce to our visitors that on Thursday the European Parliament always takes two and a half hours to discuss acute problems and acute violations of human rights around the world."
"We naturally also discuss many European issues."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m."
"Situation in Mexico"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B5-0262/2001 by Mr Seguro and Mr Naïr on behalf of the PSE Group;"
"B5-0275/2001 by Mr Knörr Borràs and Mr Lipietz on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group;"
"B5-0283/2001 by Mr Marset Campos and others on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group;"
"B5-0289/2001 by Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra and others on behalf of the PPE-DE Group;"
"B5-0297/2001 by Mr Gasòliba i Böhm and others on behalf of the ELDR Group,"
"on the situation in Mexico."
"Mr President, Commissioner Lamy, ladies and gentlemen, I rise to speak in this debate in order to express my agreement with the entire resolution that has been tabled by various political groups and on which I have worked, to say that, on this matter, the European Parliament has followed developments in political relations between Mexico and the European Union very closely."
"Parliament did so because it approves and welcomes the conclusion of a global agreement, and I think it is time that the European Union concluded a decent agreement with Mexico, not only on trade issues but also in the fields of cooperation and, most importantly, political concertation."
"We have maintained good relations with all the non-governmental organisations in Mexico, which is an ally of ours."
"Obviously, we are paying close attention, as we have always done, to developments in the situation in Chiapas and last year, as chairman of Parliament' s delegation to Central America and Mexico, I myself led a European Parliament delegation that visited Chiapas."
"We had also hoped to hold a meeting with representatives of the Zapatista movement, which we were not able to do."
"I wanted to hold this meeting because I feel that, one of the basic principles of this Parliament is to hold dialogue with everyone and, whilst respecting national sovereignty, making our contribution to a positive solution and to an end to disputes."
"It is in this context that we welcome first of all the attitude of President Fox of Mexico and the way in which he has made himself available. Secondly, I welcome the correctness, the action and the willingness to enter into dialogue demonstrated by the Zapatista movement in the person of Commander Ester in the Mexican Congress."
"What I particularly want to say for the moment is that we are encouraging and supporting this dialogue, because dialogue undertaken in accordance with the rules of democracy is the only instrument that can help to find a solution to problems."
"I will say once again that we respect the sovereignty of the Mexican people and that our message is one of support for this dialogue."
"I shall conclude by saying, with an appeal that I think is important, that talks must continue to persuade the Mexican Congress to support the law on indigenous peoples reached in the San Andrés Agreements."
"Lastly, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to say that only yesterday, the delegation which I chair was bound, after deliberation by the Conference of Presidents, to issue an opinion on a possible visit to this Parliament by representatives of the Zapatista movement."
"Unanimous approval was given, with all the main political groups present, to this Parliament, through its delegation and as a follow-up to what it did last year, restating its willingness to enter into dialogue within the rules of procedure of this Parliament, with all organisations, including the Zapatista movement."
"Mr President, I would also like to highlight the words of Mr Seguro, in that President Fox and the Zapatistas should be congratulated for the dialogue that they have undertaken."
"The other day I was in the sitting of the Mexican Congress, an historic sitting - and I should point out that it was also brought about by the votes of a sister group of ours, The Green Ecologist party of Mexico - and a vote that gave rise to a calm, respectful and I would say historical dialogue which demonstrated the maturity of the Mexican people and legislators and also the maturity of the Zapatista movement, which offered peace for peace."
"This agreement opens the way for dialogue and understanding."
"It was a great day for Mexico, for the indigenous people within and outside Mexico, and for the establishment of a culture of dialogue, understanding and cooperation between all the political and social forces as a means of solving conflicts."
"Our group would also like to make it clear, in line with what was expressed yesterday in the delegation, that we have no hesitations about the indigenous Zapatista movement being present in this House."
"And it is possible that some of our colleagues in Parliament will throw up their hands in horror, and even say that we need to keep up appearances, and that they are against hooded men and women appearing in Parliament."
"But let us see if we can end the great hypocrisy that prevails in international politics, because the same people who go to see Mr Putin, or who sing songs to the Chinese after they have invaded Tibet, cannot throw up their hands in horror."
"It is not a case of discussing appearances or whether or not they wear hoods."
"There is no greater hood than that which has been imposed on a people, on the indigenous people in and outside Mexico."
"They have had more than a hood imposed on them."
"Millions of people and human beings have been under a yoke of repression, which we are now going to begin to see lifted."
"Finally they are going to have their rights and they are being recognised in the constitution."
"Mr President, an event of such importance for Mexico and Latin America as the presence of the Zapatista commanders and the members of the National Indigenous Congress in the Mexican Congress, with the aim of setting out the reasons for adopting the 'Cocopa Law' and the appropriate constitutional reform, should be supported, without any doubt, by the European Parliament."
"This was the reason why last week three MEPs, Mr Sami Naïr, Mr Gorka Knörr and I were present in Mexico to support this event by our presence."
"This joint resolution that we are putting forward is positive, important, encouraging and also represents support for the actions of President Fox and the ZNLA."
"We also think that it goes in the direction of the agreement between the European Union and Mexico to promote a series of greater democratic freedoms and support for the political culture in Mexico, which is very important."
"We therefore think that this resolution would be improved if two amendments that we propose were accepted: on the one hand, recognising that it is important that the Members from the ZNLA appear in Congress and, on the other hand, inviting representatives of the Zapatista movement to come here, through the delegation for relations with Central America, or also through other committees, such as the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy or the Committee on Development and Cooperation, according to our customs, and to explain their points of view."
"In that way we can support a great hope for Mexico and Latin America."
"Mr President, I join my colleagues who have welcomed the fact that we have come to a time when there is recognition of an indigenous people that for a long time has been isolated and, what is more, in a complex situation, because there were people who considered themselves to be their representatives and who actually were not."
"I think that we must congratulate President Fox, his political group and all the Mexican political forces that have been capable of understanding that there needs to be direct understanding with minorities because democracy requires representatives and direct spokespeople and, at the same time, the acceptance of a culture of diversity, something that Europe is defending and which is part of our identity."
"I would also like to say in this vein that I think that the climate of dialogue that has been created is one that Europe should generously join in with and, in this respect, I think it is right and proper that whoever necessary should be received, that the Zapatistas should be received, that they should be welcomed in Europe and that we should offer them our hand."
"Now what I would not like at all would be for us to understand that we are creating a parallel relationship."
"I think that the democratic openness that the Mexican Government and the Assembly have shown by receiving the Zapatistas in their symbolic building, Parliament, is an institutional triumph and we should therefore understand that the Zapatistas should also be included with the invitation that has already been extended to President Fox. This is because we consider that we are in favour of strengthening institutions - because without strong institutions there is no democracy - and, at the same time, of the presence of all minorities, groups and associations who wish to knock on our door to ask for our help, to tell us about their specific characteristics and diversity."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that the motion for a resolution that we are presenting today is positive from a political point of view, because it fosters the process of integrating more than 10 million Mexican citizens that belong to the indigenous community and who represent 10 % of the population, into the social sphere of present-day Mexico. We therefore trust that living together peacefully will now become the norm for social behaviour, and also that there will be standardisation in Mexican political life."
"We must agree that the recent meeting between the indigenous communities and the Mexican politicians is a good example to follow in this political phase which began in July 2000, in which progress is being made, overcoming old contradictions."
"On these shores, on the old continent of Europe, many of us are pleased to see this political change that is taking place in Mexico in terms of recognising this minority, which has been historically marginalised."
"This attitude means that we should thank President Fox and his Government, as well as the Zapatistas and obviously the indigenous communities."
"Mr President, the Commission fully supports the opinion of those Members of Parliament who have signed the resolutions you are considering on the recent events in Mexico."
"The new Mexican Government and the Zapatista National Liberation Army have confirmed that they are committed to finding a political solution and we believe, as you do, that they have opened up the way to finding a peaceful solution to this conflict."
"In this context, we obviously welcome the fact that the new global agreement which was signed by the European Union and Mexico has recently come into force."
"As Mr Seguro reiterated, this agreement will enable us to continue to support the process that has recently been initiated in Mexico. As you know, this agreement goes well beyond objectives that are related purely to trade and cooperation."
"This agreement includes a clause entitled 'human rights' , which now stands at the heart of EU-Mexico relations, and also includes a clause on respect for commitments, which enables us to take into consideration developments in the human rights situation in Mexico and its states."
"In addition, this agreement puts in place a mechanism to allow the parties to take action if the objectives set out contractually are breached."
"In addition to cooperation on human rights, democracy and the proper management of public affairs, this agreement also provides us with a legal framework for cooperation in cultural matters, education and training, and which pays particular attention, as is the case given Mexico' s needs, to the most disadvantaged sections of society."
"We also have a framework of regional cooperation and, last of all and most importantly, we have a spotlight on social affairs and poverty, which includes vulnerable groups such as the indigenous population, whilst taking into account the need to respect the fundamental rights of these indigenous Mexican people as distinct groups."
"Out in Mexico, in order to apply all this in practice, and in line with the Country Strategy Paper for Mexico, which has now been adopted, we are working on an important project to develop the Lacandonia forest, in the state of Chiapas, and the practical aim of this project is both to work with the communities involved, and to seek to enlighten them on the concept of sustainable development, that is, by combining both action to sustain the environment and social action."
"This is an example of the practical measures we are taking at the moment."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 6.30 p.m."
"Situation in Somalia and attack against ""Médecins sans frontières"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B5-0263/2001 by Mr van den Berg on behalf of the PSE Group;"
"B5-0276/2001 by Mrs Maes and others on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group;"
"B5-0284/2001 by Mrs Morgantini on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group;"
"B5-0290/2001 by Mr Van Hecke in behalf of the PPE-DE Group;"
"B5-0292/2001 by Mrs Muscardini on behalf of the UEN Group;"
"B5-0301/2001 by Mr van den Bos on behalf of the ELDR Group,"
"on the situation in Somalia and attack against ""Médecins sans frontières"""
"Mr President, I am happy to say that the remaining two hostages, two humanitarian workers, British citizens, were released yesterday. They had been captured on 27 March last together with a further seven westerners and a Somali by the warlord Musse Sudi Yalahow."
"Of course, we are reassured by their release, but it does not diminish our concern at the failure to respect human rights and our condemnation of the continued acts of violence and banditry perpetrated by the armed militia in Somalia."
"It is vital that the temporary Somali Government does everything possible to initiate constructive dialogue working towards peace, stability and national reconciliation with all the parties involved, Somali community leaders and the authorities of Somaliland and Puntland."
"We all need to renounce the use of arms in order to be able to address the country's serious political, social and economic problems, so that all the parties tackle the issues of the management of aid, education, health and the economy together."
"The donor countries must all step up humanitarian aid and cooperation activities, ensure that the embargo on arms is fully respected and require all the parties concerned to cooperate to re-establish peace."
"The European Union, in particular, must provide all the financial and technical assistance necessary to guarantee the success of the peace initiative of the Intergovernmental Development Authority and Djibouti, but, in particular, it must, as it did in the case of the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea, undertake a coherent political initiative and speak with one voice to promote dialogue and negotiation to resolve the country's most urgent problems."
"Civil society, the local communities and the non-governmental organisations, which are fighting for national reconciliation and peace, must be supported."
"We must disband the armed groups which have caused the death of at least 20 civilians in recent weeks and step up mine-clearance operations. We must also show our complete solidarity with and support for the organisation ""Médecins sans frontières"", which, as I said, was attacked on 27 March last."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on 26 March, ten humanitarian workers from the United Nations and Médicins sans Frontières were taken hostage by a militia leader in Somalia, which should give the international community some idea of how far into the abyss this country has fallen."
"When banditry or acts of war - I am not sure how to distinguish between them in this case - afflict missionaries, even those working for peace and charity, which these Westerners are, and when these become bargaining chips for the warmongers, civilian populations are using this type of violent action to make the most desperate appeal for help to the international community."
"What sort of situation can this anonymous mass of people be in, if even those who are helping them are harmed in this way?"
"What can be the cause of their complaints?"
"Were these people not able to contact us in any way other than by kidnapping 10 UN and MSF workers, who are exemplary in their commitment but subjected to intense media coverage simply because they are from the West?"
"The hostages have now all been released, but this appeal must not be allowed to fade away and we must give the most effective and committed reply in response."
"In other words, we must take immediate action to ensure that humanitarian workers can work in safety in Somalia, this long-suffering country, and provide a long-term policy of support to democracy and human rights against a background of national reconciliation."
"Somalia, which is in a desperate situation, must be put at the core of the European ideals of democracy and solidarity."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although, as Mrs Isler Béguin has said, the hostages have been released, I think that what we must consider here is that we can in no way regard the taking of hostages as a political act."
"I believe that this is above all an act of cowardice, of barbarism, which is unacceptable."
"The message that should have been given when the hostages were taken must remain exactly the same one now."
"Therefore, Mr President, we must continue to give our solidarity, with the same conviction, to all those working behind the scenes, to all the NGOs which are easy targets for one simple reason - and that is because they often work in a non-partisan manner."
"Their members bring relief to all those in need, regardless of their political beliefs, and I think that this is what makes them extremely easy targets -vulnerable targets."
"We must therefore continue to give them our unwavering support."
"Next, Mr President, I believe that we must appoint a permanent representative for this affair who can monitor the situation in Somalia, as we did during the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea."
"Initial progress has been made with the appointment of the interim democratic Government, a Government that is recognised in the international courts and which has managed to quell the unrest throughout the region."
"I believe that we must now go further by also forcing this Government to take its place around the negotiating table with all the parties, all the political parties, involved in this conflict."
"Most importantly, we, be it the European Union, the UN or the Organisation for African Unity (OAU), must ensure that there is a total weapons embargo and that this embargo is strictly complied with."
"We must condemn in the strongest possible terms any supply of illegal weapons."
"Somalia is unfortunately experiencing a period of great instability due to all the fighting between various factions, which has caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people."
"It is the people who are paying the price."
"Violence is bringing about famine, famine brings about wars, and wars are bringing about disease, against a background of general indifference."
"We must send an equally powerful message."
"Mr President, for years, Somalia has been left to fend for itself by the international community."
"After all, there was no credit to be gained."
"Today, Somalia is a fragmented country ruled by a fragmented Government."
"The warlords are those who now wield power."
"The Arta peace talks brought renewed hope."
"A national transitional Government was installed, but it struggled to establish any authority."
"The European Union - and I believe Mr Sylla is right - has no choice but to give its emphatic support to this Government, without, however, misjudging the reality in Somalia."
"A constructive dialogue between the Government and the other leading figures is the only realistic solution."
"The Governments of Somaliland and Puntland must also be involved in this, and third countries, such as Ethiopia, must be warned against disturbing the peace process in any way."
"To be able to play a leading role, the Union must, in my opinion, appoint a special envoy for Somalia as a matter of urgency, just as it has now already done in the cases of Ethiopia and Eritrea."
"In fact, as far as I am concerned, this could be one and the same person."
"Now that there is at long last a prospect of sustainable peace between Eritrea and Ethiopia, we must avoid an unstable Somalia at all costs."
"We must employ all available means to stop the balkanisation of Somalia, and the Union can play an important role in this."
"Mr President, I would like to begin what will be a brief speech by clarifying that the Commission roundly condemns all attacks against any member of humanitarian staff and this condemnation is made in similar terms as those used by Mr Sylla."
"Having clarified this issue, we are relieved to have learnt, as is Mrs Ghilardotti, that the two remaining hostages have been released."
"Nevertheless, we believe that these kidnappings highlight the need to bring an end to the violent tensions in central and southern Somalia, as each of the previous speakers have also stressed."
"You may rely on the Commission to take prompt action in offering aid to help to rebuild the country in every aspect, and God knows that this needs to be done."
"We are doing this and shall continue to do this in close collaboration with all the other parties involved, whilst making use of aid coordination by the Somalia Aid Coordination Body, which also includes United Nations agencies."
"The Commission has granted substantial amounts of humanitarian aid for rehabilitation to Somalia."
"The aid receives the full support of all the political authorities of the European Union, and the troika mission that the European Union recently sent to Somalia enabled us to witness the extent to which Commission aid is both indispensable and appreciated in the regions that were visited."
"We have decided to continue to support rehabilitation in all the areas of Somalia where peace has more or less been established, and, in particular, Somaliland and Puntland, by applying the approach that was adopted and which is known as 'dividends of peace' ."
"At the same time, we are supporting the transitional government in its efforts to establish an environment of peace and security in the area of the country that is still affected by the conflict and where there are no administrative structures."
"There are regions in Somalia where rehabilitation is not possible under the current circumstances, and in these regions, we shall continue to provide humanitarian aid in the form of ECHO, which is working with the NGOs and United Nations agencies."
"The European Union has adopted a policy, in particular in the statement made on 8 September 2000, and this policy, I would reiterate, urges the transitional Government to enter into immediate dialogue with the current authorities - I mentioned Somaliland and Puntland earlier - in order to avoid losing the momentum created by the Arta process, in line with the resolutions made at the Summit of East African Heads of State."
"We would also stress the importance of including all those who did not take part in the Arta conference in this process of national reconciliation, with a view to trying to re-establish national unity."
"In any case, and I would reiterate this as far as we are concerned, we shall not support any attempt, from any quarter, which seeks to establish the authority of a government in Somalia through the use of force and which would threaten the situation of peace and stability, albeit fragile, but real nonetheless, that has been attained and which is present in various regions of Somalia."
"We cannot accept a peace process that leads to further conflict in regions where peace has been established with the active support of the international community, and on this issue, we support the speakers who have called for this resolution."
"Thank you, Commissioner Lamy."
"Today the Commission was very disciplined and spoke for less than normal."
"That is why we must have a 20-minute break. According to the agenda, the next two items are to be taken at 5.30 p.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 5.10 p.m. and resumed at 5.30 p.m.)"
"Fishing accidents"
"The next item is the report (A5-0087/2001) by Mrs Miguélez Ramos, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on fisheries: safety and causes of accidents (2000/2028(INI))."
"Mr President, this report that I am presenting today to this House on safety in fisheries and the causes of fishing accidents analyses, ladies and gentlemen, the reasons for the high accident rate in this sector, and examines aspects such as the European legislative framework, the problems surrounding the work of fishermen and preventing risks."
"Although the initiative to deal with this issue in Parliament came from the Group of the Party of the European Socialists, the work that is being presented to you today is the fruit of the work of many, including that of my colleagues, members of the Committee on Fisheries in the European Parliament, who worked very hard with me, and who finally adopted this report unanimously."
"There was also the hearing with experts in September, the invaluable contributions that I received from officials from the Directorate-General for Employment and Social Affairs and the European Parliament Directorate-General on Research and also the contributions made by the Advisory Committee on Fisheries."
"Everyone agreed on describing the job of fisherman (270 000 in the European Union) as a very dangerous profession, and also largely on the analysis of the reasons why fisheries has an accident rate that is up to 25 times higher than other economic sectors, and that one fisherman in seven in the European Union is involved in an occupational accident each year."
"This very high rate is due to a combination of very different causes: bad weather, long, very intense working days, payment systems, such as the so-called 'catch-share payment' , which are not very comparable, a lack of collective negotiation, difficult working conditions, bad living conditions on board, isolation, separation from families and from the social environment, the remoteness of fishing grounds, the age of the fleet, etc."
"I reject the sceptical position and fatalistic view of those who think that fishing accidents are inevitable and that the victims of them are a price we have to pay to the sea."
"I think that we need to look for the causes of these accidents and deal with them."
"We need to make safety a priority."
"We have unacceptable accident rates and we need to step up controls, raise awareness among ship owners and fishermen and, if necessary, encourage legislative changes in order to reduce them."
"We need to consider the social and labour conditions of seafarers and improve their working conditions, as they endure irregular rest times and working patterns based on working days of more than 14 hours."
"This sector needs to be given a right to constant weekly and daily rest and, if necessary, the public authorities should intervene in order to impose what is the fundamental right of any worker."
"These hard working conditions mean, for example, that young people do not want to join the industry, which prevents the new generation from taking over."
"We need to establish social dialogue in the sector, at European level, in order to reach collective agreements incorporating these issues of safety at work, consult more with the sector, provide those working in fisheries with social protection similar to that of other workers and develop a culture of safety among employers and workers."
"The European Union does not even have statistical data; only five countries provide figures and they are not comparable."
"This issue should be taken into account when launching the third phase of the 'European statistics on accidents at work' project so that the Community can have reliable and complete data, harmonised at European level."
"My group has always thought that in this House we should talk not only about issues associated with fishing resources, but also about the human problems that affect seafarers."
"Therefore, my report asks that the conclusions reached should be included in the regulations on the reform of the CFP, so that the triangle made up of legislation, training and social dialogue can be included."
"I also urge the Member States who have not yet done so to ratify the international conventions and improve the Community directives which at this moment in time do not cover up to 90% of the fleet."
"I also point out in my report that flags of convenience do not provide work or safety guarantees to their crews, which entails serious risks for fishermen working on board these vessels."
"In summary, ladies and gentlemen, this is a report about an issue that has not been dealt with so far."
"It is the first of these reports and will possibly be followed by second and third reports on accidents in fisheries."
"I hope that, as it is the first one, you will look tolerantly upon its defects and support it."
"Mr President, our Dutch colleague, Mr Maat, is shadow rapporteur for my political group for the report by our distinguished colleague, Mrs Miguélez Ramos."
"He apologises for his absence and has asked me to step into the breach."
"I will make his statement in English:"
"'Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur for her report."
"It is a very important initiative, because safety is a subject of great importance to the fisheries sector as a whole."
"Mrs Miguélez Ramos says that each year worldwide a great number of accidents take place and many are fatal."
"In the European Union alone more than 2 000 accidents occur every year."
"It will be impossible to decrease this number to zero due to the special features of the sector, but at least we should try and decrease the number of accidents as much as possible."
"This could be accomplished by improving some preconditions: first of all, better control on working conditions and safety on the fishing vessels that operate in the waters of the European Union."
"Furthermore, it is important to improve harmonisation and coordination between Member States as a whole."
"Regular controls on safety and working conditions should take place on all EU fishing vessels regardless of whether they are small, large, old or new."
"Besides this, further awareness regarding safety in the fisheries sector is necessary."
"Information campaigns and education are important tools to achieve this."
"Taking into account the increasing difficulties experienced throughout the EU in attracting young people for jobs at sea, the aspects of safety and working conditions should be given full attention."
"It is highly necessary to create a safety culture in this sector, so that all the interested parties know about the situation, which is very special, and respect their responsibilities."
"I, Albert Jan Maat, hope that this initiative report will be integrated in the discussion about the Green Paper and in the proposals for the new fisheries policy after 2002.'"
"I would like to add a few personal comments. I agree with all these statements."
"Recently I was on board a shrimp trawler in Greenland."
"The icy polar wind was blowing and many small one-man boats were lying in the harbour in thick ice."
"I respect the fishing profession and admire fishermen who go about their daily business under the most impossible and most difficult conditions."
"Fishermen need our active moral and legislative support especially in the area of safety at work."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Miguélez Ramos, the fisherman' s profession or vocation, call it what you will, has always been one of the toughest and most dangerous in the world."
"History, chronicles and the literature of all maritime and fishing nations are full of references to acts of heroism, to suffering, to tragedies and shipwrecks at sea involving both small and large fishing boats."
"Fishing communities keep alive the memories of tragic events, which they pass on from generation to generation."
"Today, fortunately, modern technology can substantially reduce the danger, the uncomfortable conditions, accidents and shipwrecks."
"We now have the means to act, as long as there is the desire to act in this field."
"Mrs Miguélez Ramos' s report is one of the most useful, appropriate, intelligent and well-drafted own-initiative reports that I have had the task of reading and studying amongst the many own-initiative reports that abound in this Parliament."
"This is not an empty rhetorical exercise. It is an exemplary text and the rapporteur deserves our utmost praise and gratitude."
"I therefore support not only her diagnosis, but also all the proposals, recommendations, encouragement, suggested measures and warnings contained in the report and I fully agree with its motives."
"If the Commission and the Council give a favourable welcome to the content of the report and put it into practice, in a few years we will have fewer accidents, fewer deaths, fewer shipwrecks and less risk at sea."
"We will not, of course, be able to eliminate risk entirely, but the accident rate will be greatly reduced, fishing will take on a more human face and its workers will be given more dignity."
"Congratulations, Mrs Miguélez Ramos."
"Mr President, I would like this report to contribute to the Commission giving up once and for all its obsession that a modern fleet runs counter to the protection of resources."
"Protection of resources is a priority objective of the CFP, which can under no circumstances be put before any measure that promotes the safety of fishermen, because this is a fundamentally false approach."
"There are many measures for maintaining and even reducing the fishing effort, while at the same time enabling living and safety conditions for crews to be improved."
"The report that we are debating today, like all those that have been drawn up regarding safety, shows that the fact the fleet is so old is the main cause both of accidents on board and of sinking, and that sinking often has very serious consequences."
"The Commission' s plan to reserve the structural measures for the fleet almost exclusively for destroying it, while the surviving fleet is condemned to sail under increasingly precarious conditions, is therefore ridiculous."
"The only thing that is unfortunately achieved through this policy is that the Community fleet features more strongly in terms of accidents than in terms of savings."
"Also, there is no point in having a battery of safety standards if it is not required that they are complied with."
"This is doubly concerning because the fact that this compliance has to be monitored and required makes us wonder what perception the sector has of its own safety."
"The last FAO report on the world state of fisheries and aquaculture says that a safe working environment is not something that can be imposed easily and that measures for improving safety can only be effective if there is the will to put them into practice."
"We therefore need to remember the responsibility that we all have as politicians, governments and fishermen, to end the fatalism that seems to surround this sector, a responsibility that cannot of course be escaped by the Commission or its narrow view on the modernisation of the fleet."
"Mr President, admittedly, we owe this report to the determination of Parliament' s Committee on Fisheries but also to the tenacity of Mrs Miguélez Ramos who has been able to convince everyone on this subject, because the Committee on Fisheries is often, if not always, obsessed with protecting fishery resources; we should not forget about the lives of our fishermen."
"I would reiterate that, according to the International Labour Organisation, 24 000 sea fishermen die every year throughout the world - we do not, admittedly, have a global responsibility - as a result of accidents at sea."
"As a result of this report and also because of the timetable set out by the new fishing policy, we now have the opportunity to include this point in the Green Paper and we will later be able to include it in the common fisheries policy."
"This has been mentioned by numerous speakers and I think and hope that the Commission will include it."
"Since we obviously have no commitment to achieve specific results, we cannot do this, but we do have a commitment to resources in this matter, and we can make use of many of them."
"For example, I am thinking of direct legislation in the area of fishermen' s safety and safety at work, ship and equipment design or introducing rules for managing resources, which may have, and can have, implications for fishermen' s safety."
"We must also urge ship-owners to make use of technological developments."
"We must always be at hand to help Member States and the fisheries sector to include these requirements in both initial and in on-going vocational training."
"Lastly, I shall conclude by repeating the simple terms that Mrs Miguélez Ramos suggested, that is, the safety culture - it should be used to the maximum."
"In this sector, there is a tradition of fatalism, which is related to the natural elements."
"We must fight against this tradition, in the name of the safety culture, because there is no reason why, at the beginning of the twenty-first century, we cannot reduce the number of accidents at sea and the number of deaths amongst our fishermen."
"Mr President, fishing is an activity which takes place in a naturally hostile environment, and is clearly associated with risk-taking."
"Risks are inherent in almost every decision made by a skipper or individual fishermen: on when and where to go fishing, what gear to use, when and where to land the catch, and so on."
"The level of marine accidents is unacceptably high."
"In the UK, for example, the fatality rate among fishermen is 20 times higher than that for workers in the manufacturing industry."
"Fishermen work in an unpredictable environment and are confronted with daily challenges from bad weather, fires on board, loss of power, poor vessel construction, poor communications and sometimes out-of-date navigation equipment."
"Casualties at sea have, unfortunately, become an integral part of the fishing profession."
"But the accident toll could undoubtedly be reduced if the fishing industry and individual fishermen, national authorities, the EU and international organisations faced this vital issue with enough thought, consideration, political will and economic means."
"I welcome this initiative, I congratulate the rapporteur and I hope that the Commission will follow up the recommendations in this report with positive action to improve safety and to reduce the number of accidents."
"It is also important that safety be one of the key priorities in the forthcoming review of the CFP."
"It is essential that we do not create a management regime which forces fishermen to go to sea when the weather is bad, for example, in complying with days-at-sea restrictions or attempting to land fish in a designated port cut off by bad weather."
"High prices in periods of bad weather may also drive fishermen working under quota systems out on risky fishing trips, which may be the only way to obtain the best prices for what they land against their quotas."
"Such risks are preventable if safety forms an integral part of fisheries management."
"I welcome the recent developments in Scotland, where changes in fishermen's safety training mean that an age exemption for older catchers will be a thing of the past and that basic sea survival, first aid and survival training will soon be mandatory for all fishermen."
"Finally, although a gradual ban on vessels more than 20 years old can be supported, the latter part of paragraph 4 in the report says, and I quote: "". . . except for those proven to be in perfect condition""."
"It would be better if that section read: "". . . except for those that have passed annual safety tests""."
"It is more practical to use that language than to open up a variable definition of perfect conditions."
"I therefore urge Members to support Amendment No 6."
"Mr President, can I also congratulate Mrs Miguélez Ramos on this own-initiative report."
"When you read the frightening statistics at the beginning of her report which indicate that some 24 000 fishermen die each year throughout the world, the huge risks involved in working in this industry become apparent."
"This report calls for some radical proposals such as the call to introduce a gradual ban on vessels of 20 years of age or over, which my colleague Mr Hudghton has just mentioned, except where they have passed stringent annual safety checks."
"I support this proposition."
"Indeed such a policy might encourage participation in scrap-and-build programmes amongst those Member States which have traditionally refused to take advantage of cofinancing for such schemes, and the UK is a case in point."
"The UK fleet is now approaching an average age of 30 years and our fishermen are being forced to put to sea in vessels which are becoming increasingly risky and accident prone."
"I would also like to raise a couple of additional external factors which are not covered by the report but which the Commission may wish to consider."
"Too often recently, we have seen lives lost when fishing vessels engaged in a trawl have snagged their gear on undersea cables and other foreign objects on the seabed."
"There must be much more stringent regulation concerning the laying of undersea power and telecommunication cables or any foreign objects on the seabed where the lives of our fishermen might be endangered."
"Also there have been many cases of fishing vessels being dragged under or rammed by submarines."
"Only recently we had the tragic accident involving a US submarine and a Japanese training vessel where seven students lost their lives."
"There have been similar cases in Scottish waters in recent years."
"There must be better coordination between fishermen and naval personnel to ensure that such accidents can be avoided."
"Finally, many fishermen think that learning to swim is a bad omen."
"Can I suggest that as part of the rigorous training qualifications that are being called for by Mrs Miguélez Ramos in this report, swimming qualifications would be necessary and would save many fishermen's lives every year."
"Commission."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Commission, I would first of all like to congratulate the Committee on Fisheries, its chairman and, in particular, you, Mrs Miguélez Ramos, as rapporteur, on this initiative."
"The Commission entirely agrees with you."
"The safety of our fishermen must be given top priority."
"In the Green Paper on the future of the CFP, which I will shortly be presenting to Parliament, we have not forgotten this matter of concern and have thereby met one of your objectives, which you presented under paragraph 32 of the report."
"Since 1989, on the initiative of the Commission, the European Union has made every effort to improve the health and safety of workers in the fisheries sector."
"Framework Directive 89/391/EEC, together with the associated specific directives, offer a solid legal base."
"The following specific directives have also been issued: Directive 92/29/EEC on medical treatment on board, Directive 93/102/EEC concerning the minimum safety and health requirements for work on board fishing vessels and Directive 97/70/EEC setting up a harmonised safety regime for fishing vessels of 24 metres in length and over."
"According to your report, Mrs Miguélez Ramos, there are problems above all in two areas: firstly, the correct maintenance of vessels and, secondly, the working conditions, hygiene and the organisation of work on board."
"The framework directive and the specific directives cover both these spheres of action."
"Having said that, we must note that more and more accidents are occurring in the fisheries sector."
"Just in the last few months, accidents have occurred which have led to a number of deaths. I would at this point like to express my deep condolences to the families affected."
"The Commission can agree with you fully."
"First of all, the Member States must also implement the provisions of the directives."
"As far as your conclusions are concerned, Madam Rapporteur, I feel there is a need to act in the following areas. The first area has to do with the legal framework, which is covered in paragraphs 1 to 3 and paragraph 27 of your report."
"The applicable directives are essentially adequate but they are just minimum requirements, and there is nothing to prevent the Member States from issuing stricter rules or establishing special requirements for specific cases."
"Moreover, the directives contain a reporting duty for the Member States with different timetables."
"With the help of these national reports, in 2002 the Commission will compile a summary report and, where necessary, table amendments."
"In preparation for this, we have started to amend Directive 97/70/EEC to ensure the harmonised interpretation of the Annexe to the Torremolinos International Convention."
"The second area relates to the vocational and continuing training of workers, which is covered by paragraphs 7, 10, 11, 15, 16, 20, 26 and 30. The directives already contain articles on the vocational training of workers."
"Here too, however, we are dealing with minimum requirements."
"It therefore once again lies with Member States to see to it that they are implemented and, if needs be, to bring about higher standards."
"I can assure you, however, that the Commission will make the vocational and continuing training of workers in matters of safety one of the central issues in its forthcoming report."
"However, the best rules are useless if they are not complied with correctly or at all."
"Monitoring and control are the main problems. But these fall exclusively within the remit of the Member States."
"We must therefore urge them to apply the provisions correctly."
"Moreover, objective, reliable and comparable data on the causes and circumstances of accidents are a prerequisite for successful prevention."
"In this regard, there is already an initiative on the harmonisation of data in the competent departments of Eurostat and also in the Commission' s Directorate-General for Employment."
"As regards fleet renewal, I would like to remind you that one of the objectives of all the structural programmes in the fisheries sector is to modernise fishing vessels."
"In the context of the financial instrument on structural assistance in the fisheries sector, there are abundant resources available to improve safety on board."
"Finally, as regards the international part of the CFP, the Commission has always insisted on compliance with the rules in force."
"Safety and health on board vessels are part and parcel of our overall strategy both in the bilateral agreements and in the regional fisheries organisations, as well as in the fight against illegal fishing and flying flags of convenience."
"By way of conclusion, Mrs Miguélez Ramos, I can agree with you fully."
"All of us - the European Parliament, the Commission, the Council, the Member States and international organisations - must do our outmost to ensure that the risk for our fishermen is reduced to an absolute minimum."
"Your initiative is an important step towards achieving this goal."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m."
"Professional fees"
"The next item is the Oral Question to the Commission (B5-0164/2001) by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on compulsory tariffs for certain liberal professions, in particular lawyers."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one normally never gets this amount of time."
"I have no idea how I am going to fill the seven minutes allotted to me."
"But this is a very serious matter."
"Europe is becoming increasingly concerned with the role of the liberal professions."
"As they are part of the single market it is clear that issues concerning freedom in the single market are also extremely important for the liberal professions."
"Unfortunately, what one hears in European institutions is not always easy to understand, to interpret properly and to elucidate."
"We do know that, a few months ago, the Commissioner for Competition, Mario Monti, made a number of statements in this connection."
"Mr Monti was attending an international conference when he said that, in his view, setting tariffs for liberal professions, which up to a point is done according to the law in some Member States through such mechanisms as fee scales for lawyers, is not without its problems under competition law."
"He also announced at this conference that the Commission would look into this problem."
"We also have the situation in which an Italian court submitted a request to the European Court for an advance determination in relation to which a hearing took place last autumn, and now the European Court will have to rule on the admissibility of Italian fee scales for lawyers under European law."
"We have liberalised markets in many areas of the European Union."
"However, we have not normally liberalised them in such a way that we said from one day to the next, that' s it, we are now releasing you into a world of completely free competition."
"Usually there are transitional periods, statutory regulations for adjustment and so on, for example in energy policy and many other sectors."
"Only in the specific area of the liberal professions does it seem that there are no, or not enough, political considerations of this kind at the level of the European Union."
"I think it is extremely important that, in the future, the Commission takes a closer look at the liberal professions and starts to deal with their specific demands."
"They must deal not only with the people who work in the liberalised professions but, most decisively, with consumers as well."
"Fee scales were issued by national legislators in the Member States in order to provide reliable protection for consumers when they made use of the services provided by the liberal professionals."
"I think this aspect is gaining increasing influence in the policy of the European Union and must be integrated into any strategies that are developed."
"We know that the Commission has just presented a paper on the services sector and the problems posed by the single market."
"This is very much to be welcomed."
"It just strikes me that this paper follows a completely horizontal approach and does not deal with the specific interests of the individual branches in the services sector, which is very big."
"In my view, the medical and legal professions, for example, cannot be dealt with according to the same criteria as the supermarket round the corner whose social task is quite different."
"We must not forget that the liberal professions are largely subject to specific special provisions attached to their profession in terms of competition, advertising, standards of behaviour and other obligations."
"Today at midday, we voted in second reading on the money-laundering directive which dealt with such obligations."
"That is why I believe that a specific political approach for the liberal professions is appropriate."
"We want Parliament to deal with this issue and we want to force the Commission, by means of this oral question, to tackle the issue of the liberal professions head on, which it has so far failed to do."
"That is why we have introduced this oral question with the text you have before you, which you are all familiar with and which I do not intend to go into any further."
"I would now like to say a few words about the task my political group feels we have to take on, which is the reason why this resolution was introduced."
"It is not enough just to talk about it; we must take advantage of this part-session to announce our demands in a brief Commission resolution."
"From our experiences in committee, the Commission normally complies with such requests."
"On the basis of this resolution, therefore, I expect the Commission to make concrete proposals and statements on the development of policy with regard to the liberal professions."
"I also expect it to answer the question of how, from a political viewpoint, it intends to deal with the modern developments that society entails. The liberal professions cannot ignore progress; they must of course bear in mind that times change and the world moves on."
"I have one final comment. Most liberal professions are also small and medium-sized enterprises."
"That is why there is special interest in protecting these groups and also a special obligation on the part of the Commission to deal with this issue."
"I have now spoken for six minutes."
"I will forego my last minute."
"Commission."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, promoting competition amongst the liberal professions in the interests of consumers is one of the avowed priorities of my colleague, Mario Monti."
"I welcome this opportunity to be able to present our policy to Parliament on his behalf and to comment on it."
"The Commission agrees with you that guaranteeing the quality of services is of the utmost importance because customers, that is, consumers, are often in a weaker position than those who provide these services."
"A rule which is solely targeted at guaranteeing top quality services without distorting competition is clearly in the interests of consumers."
"This holds true regardless of whether the rule is introduced by the state or by a professional organisation."
"The Community' s competition rules do not therefore apply to purely professional rules."
"Whether a rule is a purely professional rule must be determined from one case to the next."
"In so doing, account must be taken of the impact of the rule on the freedom of action of members of the profession or of professional organisations as well as consumers."
"As far as determining compulsory tariffs or rates of charges is concerned, it depends, firstly, on who determines the fees or rates of charges and, secondly, on what interests are taken into consideration."
"The determining of uniform fees by members of a profession is a fundamental violation of competition rules."
"Justification on grounds of professional ethics is not recognised."
"At the same time, Member States only have the right to determine compulsory tariffs if these fees are objectively justified on grounds of the general interest."
"The Commission is of the view that this requirement is met if the mandate and the power of the authority issuing the rule in question is sufficiently clearly and unequivocally expressed in the rule itself and if there is no room for unlawful agreements to be reached between members of the profession."
"The Commission does, however, have certain reservations concerning the interpretation of the case law referred to in the question, if this interpretation leads one to believe that only fees which are determined by professional bodies or associations of all members of a given profession can be subject to competition law."
"What is important however is that the existing, clear, objective and justified criteria of general interest, which are determined by the state, are met."
"These criteria must include consideration of the interests of consumers and not only consideration of the interests of the profession."
"The quality of services should be guaranteed through other, less restrictive, means than the determining of fees."
"It is therefore not enough that a fee agreement is approved or confirmed by the relevant authorities in order for it to be exempt from the applications of competition rules."
"A price agreement reached between members of a given profession, that is, between competitors, is a fundamental violation of competition rules."
"Moreover, a Members State can violate its obligations out of the EC Treaty if the rule in question removes the effectiveness of competition rules."
"This is the case, for example, when a state obliges the profession to determine uniform fees without specifying the criteria of the common good which have to be met."
"A breach of contract takes place if a Member State transfers its power to determine fees to a professional association without reserving the right of supervision."
"For the sake of completeness, I would like to point out that the Commission does not support the determining of compulsory tariffs but at most tolerates it under certain circumstances."
"In areas in which compulsory uniform tariffs apply, competition must result from quality."
"It is therefore important for members of the profession to publicise their special fields and to be able to advertise."
"The Court of Justice just recently pointed out that advertising on every market is an important competitiveness factor since, in this way, the advantages of individual market participants, the quality of their services and tariffs are conveyed more clearly."
"The Court confirmed the Commission' s opinion that a ban on comparative advertising seriously affected the ability of the most competitive members of the profession to expand their services and also had a negative impact when the customer base was confined to the single market."
"Finally, on the question of the country-of-origin principle, it must be noted that this principle helps to bring about a single market."
"It is anchored in the Parliament and Council Directive 98/5/EEC facilitating the permanent exercise of the lawyer' s profession and guarantees, among other things, that lawyers can establish themselves using the professional title of the Member State in which they completed their training by simply registering in the host country."
"The directive aims to enable layers who practice under the title given by their country-of-origin to establish branches and subsidiaries."
"In general, the Commission continues to ensure that the advantages of freedom of movement, which can be achieved through the country-of-origin principle, are weighed against the general interest, which is protected in the host country and recognised under Community law."
"The Commission is currently looking into how it can make further progress concerning the conditions for the cross-border provision of certain services."
"Mr President, first may I say that I am speaking on behalf of my colleague, Lord Inglewood, who is an expert on this topic and who has had to return to London at short notice."
"As a liberal professional myself, in this case a doctor, rather than a lawyer, I have to say that my British experience of fixed professional fees - fixed in this case by government - such as cremation fees and attendances at coroners' courts, is that they are artificially low and have tended to benefit the state rather than the professional concerned."
"Politically I have recently been involved with asking the Commission to examine the restrictions applied by British health insurers in only paying the medical fees for treatments provided within the UK and refusing such benefits to British residents who wish to avail themselves of treatment in, for example, France."
"Last year I lobbied on behalf of a British lawyer wanting to register in France as a notaire, as non-French notaires are currently prohibited by French law, and this is an activity governed in many Member States by fixed fees."
"Currently I am my group's shadow rapporteur on EMAC on a proposed directive for a single market and free movement for insurance mediators, whose commissions are often fixed."
"Therefore these concepts apply to a number of different professionals other than lawyers, as I have already mentioned."
"The single market is one of the major achievements of the European Community and for that market to be complete it must include services as well as goods."
"I entirely agree with Commissioner Bolkestein that the services sector in Europe offers huge potential growth for competition and employment which must be to the benefit of all of Europe's citizens."
"The Commission's initiative in this area is therefore one that I strongly support and in accordance with the so-called single market principles, it should be possible to introduce in one Member State business models providing services pioneered successfully in another, and of course they should be subject to examination under the Treaty rules on competition."
"I am conscious of the need for proper consumer protection across a single market, but I also suspect that many practices which have grown up over the years, through tradition and usage, may have outlived some of their original usefulness."
"It is very important, therefore, that a thorough inquiry be conducted which will lead to a comprehensive debate so that special privileges and practices and exemptions which may be attached to the exercise of the liberal professions - and not just the lawyers - are properly scrutinised."
"It is necessary to ensure that they will provide a real benefit to the citizen, and are not merely privileges supporting the vested interests of all the professions concerned."
"Mr President, having heard Commissioner Fischler' s answer it gives me the impression that at the moment on this matter the Commission is completely unprepared."
"I think that it is only starting to see the outer layer of the problems."
"Because I was thinking a moment ago that in the last part-session, Commissioner Reding, sitting where Commissioner Fischler is sitting now, gave us a detailed explanation of the agreement that had been reached between the Commission, FIFA and UEFA."
"That is a business worth many billions of euros and in that case it seems that competition gives way to quality."
"At times it seems that quality is very important, and I agree with this interpretation."
"We are talking about a profession, that of a lawyer, which is said to be one of the oldest professions in the world - they say that there is another profession that is older, but I am not going to mention it to avoid being accused of sexism."
"The law profession is very old and the danger of that is that lawyers deal with quantities."
"Using the words of Karl Marx, here quality becomes quantity, or the reverse, if you like, because lawyers are defending interests that can be quantified."
"In the different countries of the Community, or at least in some of them, there is a system of protection through professional organisations, which is not perfect and could be improved but which at least establishes some guarantees, as there are too many unscrupulous lawyers who, left to the free interaction of supply and demand, could be tempted to act and abuse their position."
"I have the impression that the Commission is currently at a very immature time and therefore that we should look at this subject with a degree of calm."
"I think that we need to start seeing what is happening - I think that Mr Tannock was referring to this - in the different Member States, what makes it difficult for someone to go to a lawyer and, above all, why people are afraid of going to a lawyer."
"That is to say, I think that there are real problems, but that those real problems cannot be solved by mathematically applying the rules of Community competition and much less by focusing solely on the criterion of prices."
"I think that the ideal would be for us to have a professional lawyers' organisation covering the whole Community, not so much in order to protect lawyers but to protect consumers."
"We have to think about moving towards an area in which there is protection for people who go to lawyers, protection for consumers, protection for clients, and I think that the conclusion that we could therefore draw here is to invite the Commission to continue to look at the issue and, perhaps with the cooperation of Parliament, to see what the sectors involved say, including, of course, the clients, the people who would like to go to a lawyer, but who normally do not go out of fear."
"I suppose I should start by declaring an interest as a member of a liberal profession to whom this question applies, being a lawyer."
"It seems to me that this week in Parliament we have been lobbied hard by lawyers' organisations supporting their professional position."
"In contrast, last week in the UK we saw the publication of a report by the Office of Fair Trading looking at competition in the professions, the very issue that we are looking at today."
"That report was based on two premises: first, that the professions are entrusted with the delivery of services of considerable public importance; but second, that any restriction on the supply of professional services will tend to drive up costs and prices and will limit consumer access and choice."
"That is why the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party in this Parliament has tabled certain amendments."
"Yes, liberal professions have a special position in society, but that position and the services they offer should be enhanced by more competition and independent scrutiny."
"That is what we want to see the Commission look at."
"Let me give you two UK-based examples."
"First, price: should this be regulated?"
"Solicitors, my own profession, used to have a monopoly of conveyancing, the buying and selling of land."
"Competition was introduced, licensed conveyancers allowed, and it drove down prices, but not standards."
"I experienced this myself the other week."
"I had to renew the lease of my office."
"I was bound to use my landlord's solicitors."
"To set up the original lease they charged me GBP 300; that seemed quite enough to me."
"But to vary a couple of words in the self-same document, they proposed to charge me GBP 500."
"That, to me, is licensed robbery by our profession."
"They need to be challenged."
"Secondly, a constituent of mine recently came to me with a history of a dispute over the last 15 years."
"That dispute had taken him through five law firms, ruined his business and his family life, all about a debt that had actually been acknowledged in writing."
"He had had no help from my profession's complaints body."
"These are the kinds of examples that do the liberal professions no service; and sadly they are not limited or isolated."
"Yes, professional standards can be imposed by professional bodies, but they can only be further enhanced by competition and external scrutiny."
"That is why I ask colleagues to support the amendments tabled by my group."
"Commission."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to add just a few more comments."
"Firstly, I would like to point out that the Commission has been tackling these issues for a long time now."
"In fact the first rule dates back to 1993."
"In total, the Commission has issued three resolutions on competition amongst the liberal professions, the fundamental principles of which have been confirmed by the Court of Justice."
"Two of the resolutions were directed against uniform tariffs which could not be justified on the grounds of the general interest."
"In one case, which concerned the procedure to determine lawyers' fees in Italy, the Commission is waiting for the interpretation of Community law by the Court."
"This ruling will prepare the way for the adoption of further measures."
"I would also like to point out that the Commission believes that each of the liberal professions needs to be dealt with separately and not all according to the same pattern."
"The example the speaker from Great Britain presented concerning doctors is evidence of the need for separate treatment."
"I believe that, in my introductory comment, I said a great deal about consumer protection being our top priority."
"The debate is closed."
"I have received a motion for a resolution pursuant to Rule (42)5 ()"
"The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 6.25 p.m. and resumed at 6.30 p.m.)()"
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament."
"(The sitting was closed at 6.45 p.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 5 April."
"Agenda"
"The order of business was established on 2 April, but I have received a number of proposals for amendments."
"Relating to Wednesday 2 May:"
"The Commission communication will deal with our partnership with the United Nations in the areas of development and humanitarian issues and will be made by Commissioner Nielson."
"The second item of information I have is that on 11 April, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market approved the report by Mr MacCormick on the request for the waiver of Mrs Jeggle' s immunity."
"Pursuant to Rule 6(6) of the Rules of Procedure, this report has been placed at the head of the agenda and will be followed immediately by Mr Zimeray' s report on the request for the waiver of Mr Voggenhuber' s immunity."
"Madam President, according to Rule 6(6) of the Rules of the Procedure, committee reports concerning immunity of Members shall be placed at the head of the agenda."
"Recent events have reminded us that questions of immunity are not mere matters of form, but go to the substance of great issues of democracy in Europe and you have, indeed, alluded to that yourself."
"Are you certain that it satisfies Rule 6(6) to take these issues of immunity after the Commission communication which appears to have been placed at the head of the agenda ahead of the issues of immunity?"
"Is that a correct interpretation of Rule 6?"
"Mr MacCormick, you are quite right and you will be pleased, since the three reports on waivers of immunity have been placed at the head of the agenda, after the Commission communication and before Mr Cashman' s report on public access to documents."
"Madam President, am I right in assuming that the item on Turkish prisoners on hunger strike has not been included in today' s agenda?"
"Yes, Mr Wurtz, you are right."
"The Council did not believe that it was in a position to make this statement. Of course, there would not be much point without the Council."
"The Council can, however, attend the sitting of 14 May."
"In my view, this answer, not the one you gave, Madam President, but the answer given by the Council, is unacceptable and we should not accept it."
"(Applause from the left)"
"When I wrote to you on 25 April, you were, in fact, in favour of this yourself."
"I believe I am right in saying that all the political groups were also in favour of this."
"At that time, 17 prisoners had died."
"Since then, there have been a further two deaths."
"A further 160 prisoners are in a critical condition."
"I think that the Council' s response to postpone this debate to some other later date is an unacceptable, bureaucratic answer."
"We cannot allow the number of victims of the hunger strike to increase with each passing day, nor can we shirk our responsibilities."
"If, as I understand it, the Swedish Minister for Justice will be present at this sitting to talk about the Cashman report, one cannot imagine that he would refuse to respond to our request, in other words, to send the Turkish government an urgent request to resume negotiations with the prisoners' representatives so that this dreadful slaughter can be brought to an end."
"(Applause from the left)"
"Thank you, Mr Wurtz."
"Just to clarify matters, it is Mrs Lejon, Minister for Democratic Issues, Public Administration and Consumer Policies, who will be present."
"Mr Danielsson is currently on a visit to Korea and so the only minister who will be available is Mrs Lejon, and she does not believe that she is in a position to address this issue."
"Madam President, it would, of course, have been good if we could have debated this urgent matter here today."
"I would like to remind you and the House that Mr Daniel Cohn-Bendit, and for part of the time, I myself have been in Turkey over the last few days as part of a very spontaneous action."
"Mr Cohn-Bendit is, of course, chair of the delegation that is to visit Turkey and its prisons in June."
"We have also had a meeting on this subject today."
"Mr Cohn-Bendit and I - to the extent that I was present - made the viewpoint of this House very clear to the Turkish Government, to the Minister for Justice and to the Minister for European Affairs, as we did to the organisations that are organising this hunger strike, to the human rights organisations and to the country's MPs."
"I particularly wanted to mention that."
"We have tried, by means of a very spontaneous action, and in view of the urgency of this matter, to make the views of this Parliament very clear to the Turkish Government, Parliament and to the human rights organisations."
"Madam President, it is a matter of regret that the Council is not represented here today."
"We are very well aware that the request for the Council to be represented here was made at very short notice."
"For that reason I do not mean to criticise the Swedish Presidency as such, but I would like to make a point about the future, Madam President."
"Just as we expect the Commission to be present at meetings of the European Parliament, in future it should also be possible for the Council of Ministers to be available to make statements when the European Parliament is sitting in Brussels or Strasbourg."
"We should focus our efforts, following the great success we had just last week with a regulation on transparency and access to documents, so that in future it goes without saying that the Council of Ministers, which is always welcome here, is not only welcomed by us when it is willing to attend, but rather that the Council should always be present here in future."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Poettering, I fully agree with what you have said, and, as you know, I have already spoken to the Council about this matter, following a debate at the Conference of Presidents, where we all made this comment and fervently hoped that the Council would be available to attend, as you have said."
"Madam President, I do not know whether our actions over the last two days will be successful."
"Some members of the government told us that they were going to take measures and, that in fact, an agreement between the position of the hunger strikers and that of the government is now quite clearly achievable."
"That is why we asked the Turkish government to take action."
"If we are unable to discuss this matter today, I would like us to make a public statement to the effect that we shall discuss this issue with the Council at the May part-session and that we want to see some results in May."
"The positions in Turkey are clearly evident today."
"We can find a solution in two days."
"We shall see what happens over the next two or three days and, in May, all of us in this House shall shoulder our responsibilities."
"Madam President, as you know many of us are very concerned with the prestige and reputation of this Parliament and for that reason I rise in connection with the procedures concerning the lifting of Mr Berlusconi's immunity."
"At the last meeting of the Conference of Presidents on 5 April this matter was referred to the Constitutional Affairs Committee and Madame Garaud was invited to represent us vis-à-vis the Spanish authorities."
"I understand that Madame Garaud cannot for the time being undertake that mission for personal reasons, which are fully understandable and have my deepest sympathy."
"Nonetheless, the matter has become all the more urgent because of three new developments: first, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, using the same procedures as us to waive parliamentary immunity, appears to be moving much faster within a deadline of only two months, and the European Parliament could find itself in the unfortunate situation of being left well behind."
"Secondly, the Spanish Government has transmitted a new request to the Italian authorities without waiting for the opinion of the Council of State of Spain, which is ostensibly the reason why it has not yet replied to the European Parliament."
"Thirdly, again according to the press, the Spanish anti-corruption prosecutor, Carlos Castresana, has written asking you to investigate the delay."
"In these circumstances, do you agree that it is all the more urgent to proceed rapidly?"
"Do you intend to ensure that the mission to Spain takes place as soon as possible, if necessary with a different envoy?"
"Would you give us a deadline for this - would it be a matter of weeks, months or years?"
"Mr Corbett, I would like to thank you for raising this issue as a point of order, as this gives me the opportunity to give the House some extremely important information."
"As a rule, I do not respond to controversial press stories with further controversy."
"I have a deep respect for the dignity of this Parliament and so I am only too happy to be able to clarify matters for its Members."
"What is the current situation?"
"As you said, there was a meeting of the Conference of Presidents."
"Three decisions were reached, following a first decision that we had taken at Mr Barón Crespo' s request."
"Mr Barón Crespo had asked that we draw up an exhaustive document of all previous requests for waivers of parliamentary immunity, in other words, all the requests received since the European Parliament was elected by universal suffrage."
"I thought that this very comprehensive document would be of great use."
"I would like to thank the Secretary-General for having diligently drawn up this document, which is extremely interesting."
"It confirms that all requests, apart from those made by Portugal and one request made by Spain where there is some doubt, have always passed through the governments of the relevant Member State."
"You have access to this document."
"I am sure that it will have been sent to you through the appropriate channels."
"At the Conference of Presidents, three decisions were taken."
"The first decision was to ask the Committee on Constitutional Affairs to draw up a substantive document on how requests for waivers of immunity should be dealt with in general."
"There would therefore be grounds for wondering whether there is a need to amend Parliament's Rules of Procedure."
"In these circumstances, as in others - I am thinking of the procedures for requests to withdraw a fellow Member' s mandate, or for other things - you realise that Rule 6 does, in actual fact, seem rather inadequate."
"Mr Napolitano, the Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, has accepted to undertake this task on behalf of his committee and I would like to thank him for doing so."
"I believe that the coordinators of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs are meeting tomorrow to appoint a rapporteur."
"I would repeat that this is an extremely important and serious matter which affects both this institution and the guarantee that every Member must be able to legitimately enjoy."
"It was then decided that I should again write to the Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs, reiterating my desire to see this issue investigated as soon as possible."
"This letter was drafted, I believe, directly after the meeting of the Conference of Presidents."
"I believe that it is available to you, again, through the appropriate channels."
"If you do not have access to this letter, we shall, of course, put the matter right."
"The Conference of Presidents then asked me to appoint a Member of Parliament who would, more or less, be responsible for monitoring this issue."
"I appointed Mrs Garaud, who is a member of the French Council of State, a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and a member of the Conference of Presidents; she does not belong to any political group, is therefore someone with an excellent profile and is acknowledged by all to be an excellent jurist."
"I believe, Mr Corbett, that you are aware that Mrs Garaud has been through an extremely painful experience."
"I do not know if she is present, but I would like to pass on my deepest condolences to her."
"I do not think that we really could have blamed her for not being able to go to Spain during the period following her appointment to this position."
"I think that you are aware of the situation."
"I have some very important information and I would like to thank Mr Corbett for mentioning the Council of Europe."
"The Spanish Supreme Court sent a request for the waiver of parliamentary immunity of the same Italian MEPs to the Council of Europe. However, you seem to be unaware that this request was sent to the Council of Europe via the Spanish government."
"I am saying to you in all sincerity that this only adds to my doubts."
"Who are they trying to embarrass here?"
"A request was made directly to the President of the European Parliament, the Supreme Court then passed this on to the European Parliament' s information office in Madrid and, a few months later, the same Supreme Court involved the government, through the Spanish government' s mission to the Council of Europe."
"If I had not acted in the way I did, Mr Corbett, I would have had deep regrets."
"I certainly would have acted in the wrong way and if I had taken a hasty decision to refer this to the Committee on Legal Affairs and to announce it to Parliament, this decision would have been subject to an appeal, a perfectly legitimate appeal, by those concerned."
"I repeat, in order to respect the dignity of this Parliament, I think that we must treat this situation with all seriousness."
"Referring this matter to the Council of Europe, therefore, fully endorses the approach that I took when this matter first arose."
"I sincerely hope that the Supreme Court informs me why there are two different ways of dealing with this, one way for this Parliament and another way for the Council of Europe."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, for more than a month now, the Somme valley has been flooded, affecting the region of Amiens and the town of Abbeville in particular, which is where I live, and the surrounding area."
"This is the first time that floods have hit our département."
"I shall inform you of the extent of the disaster, which is a very difficult task for me."
"In total, 125 municipalities are under water - in other words, approximately 1 500 houses are flooded and more than 2 000 people have been evacuated."
"Substantial damage has been caused, and the people of the area are suffering untold misery and despair."
"The situation is particularly worrying, because as well as the natural disaster, experts are predicting that water levels will take a very long time to subside and it could take several months."
"We have gone beyond the stage of a localised disaster and we are looking for ways to drain the huge amounts of water."
"People are showing great solidarity at local and regional level and help is being mobilised at national level."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union should also take part in this solidarity, in other words, by providing considerable financial aid, bearing in mind that the cost of the damage will amount to several billion French francs."
"This area of France, which is already badly affected by economic and social problems, has been devastated."
"Admittedly, the media are saying that the water levels were yesterday beginning to subside. However, first of all, this is not happening everywhere and, secondly, the most difficult work still lies ahead of us, as we will now have to face the problems of restoration due to subsidence and pollution problems, which are already a threat."
"For these reasons, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would again appeal, if I may, for European solidarity."
"Thank you, Mr Butel, I have absolutely no doubt that a request for a topical and urgent debate on the terrible situation that you have described will be tabled for the next part-session."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to refer to Mr Corbett's statement and also to your own, Madam President."
"On behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats, I would like to say that the President of this Parliament has behaved quite properly in this matter, and to express our full support for you on this, Madam President."
"(Applause from the right)"
"It is amazing that the Socialist Group has raised this subject in debate during every part-session, either here in Brussels or else in Strasbourg."
"Mr Corbett, you say you are concerned about the reputation of the European Parliament."
"What you are really worried about is the election campaign in Italy, and you want to influence that campaign by enabling your political friends to benefit from a debate here in Brussels."
"(Applause from the right)"
"However, unlike the President, I am free to express my own opinion, because things are being insinuated here, and to comment on the fact that Mrs Garaud, for whom I have great respect, has so far not been able to travel to Madrid."
"The President made a discreet reference to the reason."
"Why is it that Mrs Garaud has been unable to undertake the mission?"
"It is because her husband has died."
"We offer her our sincere sympathy."
"I am saying this so that there can be no more insinuations here."
"(Applause from the right)"
"That brings me to the question of how this was dealt with in the Conference of Presidents."
"I am one of those people who not only always wants debates to be held here, but also believes that we should make decisions."
"However, we need to recognise that the Conference of Presidents reached a unanimous decision."
"It was unanimously agreed that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs chaired by our esteemed colleague Mr Napolitano, who is not a member of my group, should now draft a report on how we deal with the procedures for waiving immunity."
"That was a unanimous decision."
"That is why I was very surprised, after the Conference of Presidents, to hear about a letter from the chairman of the Socialist Group to the President of Parliament, in which the very decision we had agreed upon was once again called into question."
"If this were about another person, if this did not involve a country in the middle of an election campaign, then I am sure that the Socialist Group would not keep raising this issue in this House."
"That is why we very firmly reject these attempts to influence the election campaign in Italy and the democratic process of forming a new government in that country."
"(Applause from the right)"
"Madam President, the various groups here have been adopting positions regarding the matter of Mr Berlusconi' s parliamentary immunity, and I would like to state, on behalf of my own group, that I have been studying some documents relating to earlier cases, which were in the possession of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and which relate to the immunity of the Spanish and other Members."
"I think it is very important that Parliament should comply with the rules on the waiver of parliamentary immunity in a way that is completely fair and consistent."
"Having familiarised myself with these precedents, I could not help but come to the conclusion that there were two suitable precedents for concluding that the request to waive Mr Berlusconi' s parliamentary immunity should have been made in plenary immediately after last summer' s recess, and referred to the Committee on Legal Affairs for deliberation."
"I had the impression that the last argument you put forward, Madam President, was that the requests in question had come from the Spanish Supreme Court through Parliament' s Information Office."
"My opinion is that this is not a very plausible reason for postponing the issue and delaying discussions on it."
"Consequently, I can only state that it is the opinion of my group that there was every justification for announcing this request to waive parliamentary immunity in plenary without delay, and referring it to the Committee on Legal Affairs for deliberation. The committee could then have discovered if there were any problems associated with this competent authority."
"I believe the committee would have been very happy to do that."
"(Applause from the Verts/ALE Group)"
"Thank you, Mrs Hautala."
"You may, of course, make a statement on behalf of your group."
"I must, however, just pick up on two points that were inaccurate."
"There were three requests to waive the parliamentary immunity of Spanish MEPs."
"Two requests were sent directly through the intermediary of the Spanish governmental authorities."
"There is only one request where there is some doubt."
"The Official Journal reports that it was sent by the Spanish government."
"In the report by the MEP at the time, which is the report on the request for the waiver of immunity, it says 'given the request made by the Spanish Minister for Justice' , but when you look into the case, the letter from the minister cannot be found."
"Therefore, there are obviously two requests from the Minister of Justice, submitted by the Spanish governmental authorities, and one request where there is some doubt, in spite of the Official Journal, which, however, in principle, is deemed to be authentic."
"With regard to the latest information that I have just provided, I have the impression that you might not have fully understood - perhaps there was a problem with the translation - this does not relate to the Council of State, this relates to a request for a waiver that was submitted by the Supreme Court at the Council of Europe, not long ago, and I clarified that this request was sent by the Spanish government' s mission, and this happened very recently."
"This information that I have given you is new and extremely important information."
"That is why my colleague at the Council of Europe was able to send it to the appropriate committee, since there was no doubt that the request came from the Spanish authorities."
"I do understand that all these facts might be cause for regret for some Members, but unfortunately for them, these are the facts, and we cannot change them, as they certainly are objective and beyond question."
"Madam President, I would just like to point out to Mr Poettering that the problem in this Parliament is ensuring that Members receive equal treatment."
"The response to the case of Mr Berlusconi does not ensure equal treatment: indeed, if Mrs Frassoni - myself, that is - had been the person concerned in this case, I am sure that the President would have acted differently."
"There is no doubt about it. Therefore, Mr Poettering, the matter in hand is that of the equality of Members."
"That is the issue we must tackle and that is why Mr Corbett's question must be resolved by referring the question of the waiver of the parliamentary immunity of Mr Berlusconi without delay to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, precisely in order to preserve equality between all the 626 Members."
"We cannot continue to beat about the bush."
"I am totally shocked by what you have just said, Mrs Frassoni."
"I think that, in all the years spent working in Parliament, I have shown"
"that I have always treated all Members equally, wherever they are from, whatever their political affiliation - and I did so again not so long ago - and that has always been my objective."
"I am able to prove this very easily, Mrs Frassoni."
"Madam President, thank you for your explanation."
"In connection with it, I would first of all like to point out that you commissioned a study, at my request, in which two things were clear: firstly, that there were different types of treatment, and secondly, and I would like to stress this, that no request had ever remained in the drawers of the Bureau of Parliament for nine months."
"This is important."
"I would also like to say, with the utmost respect, that the President of Parliament has to submit to the Rules of Procedure, which means giving the responsibility to the corresponding committee."
"I have said this to you in public and in private."
"Out of respect for you and for the position that you hold I have tried to maintain a constructive attitude throughout this process and I would like to point out that the three proposals that you mentioned as agreements of the Conference of Presidents came from me."
"Specifically, the nomination of Mrs Garaud, and I add my condolences for her situation, was your proposal, but the proposal to send an emissary was mine."
"This therefore justifies the letter that I sent to you with the agreement of my Group."
"My Group still considers that this issue should be announced in public."
"The truth is that we are faced with a very paradoxical situation because a matter that has not been announced is taking up a large proportion of our plenary sittings, but in the end, that is how it is."
"We also think that it should be the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market that should deal with the matter."
"Now, if you will allow me, Madam President, I am going to answer the allegations made by Mr Poettering who, with his usual elegance, has launched a torrent of abuse at the Socialist Group."
"First of all, the problem could have been avoided."
"This comes from August of last year, when the Italian elections had not yet been called."
"If it had been dealt with at the time, we would not have had anything to say about it."
"But also, Madam President, although the Secretary-General of the PPE insists that the Socialist International is behind everything, they are not going to tell me that we control media such as The Economist, El Mundo, Le Monde, Handesblat and even the Los Angeles Times."
"Unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen, we do not have these powers and what is more, even if we had them, we would not use them."
"Therefore, there is a very simple solution to the matter under consideration."
"You belong to the same political group as Mr Berlusconi, who was enthroned as the rising star of the PPE at the Berlin Congress, and who is of the same political group as the President of the Government of my country."
"And you are of the same political group as the President of Parliament and the chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"I did not wish to use these arguments."
"So be careful what you say because everything has an answer."
"Madam President, I would like to ask Mr Poettering a question in order to confirm what he said on Friday."
"Do you think that, in your country, a person with a conflict of interests such as Mr Berlusconi has could stand for the German elections?"
"Because your colleague, Mr Brok, says that the answer is no."
"Please do me the favour of answering the House."
"(Applause from the left)"
"You have just done a great job in showing that this issue is certainly of a political nature."
"However, I should like to return to the subject of the law."
"You said that respecting the Rules of Procedure meant referral to the committee responsible."
"Mr Barón Crespo, several years ago, we had an MEP in this House who was held in great esteem by all Members of this Parliament. This MEP was Mrs Marie-Claude Vayssade, Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"Here is what Mrs Vayssade wrote in a letter dated 8 March 1985. She said that she would like to point out straight away that, pursuant to Rule 5(1) of the Rules of Procedure, a request for the waiver of immunity can only be referred once it has been established that the request is from the appropriate authority."
"Therefore, I believe that this condition must be fulfilled before this is done, as well as the announcement to Parliament and the referral to committee, a point also laid down in the Rule 5(1) of the Rules of Procedure."
"Once again, Mr Barón Crespo, there really is no getting away from the facts and you have my sympathy but everything points to this."
"I am slightly weary of these groundless accusations and we know exactly what lies at the root of them."
"I must start my speech by referring to certain allusions that have been made."
"Whilst I have the utmost respect for Mr Barón Crespo, he said something that, as with so many things that are being said in this House today, he left unclear."
"We are compatriots, yes, we are all aware of that, and it is a great honour, may I add."
"I am surprised at the tone of this debate."
"I am surprised because you pointed out that we are discussing an issue that is essentially legal in nature, and we need to keep it within the boundaries that you, Madam President - and I would like to highlight this - have kept it within, come hell or high water, thus demonstrating conviction and legal certainty."
"Mrs Frassoni started by making an accusation that I think discredits itself."
"That is not all, however, as Mr Corbett, Mrs Hautala and Mr Barón Crespo also seem to be telling us that the important thing for an institution is who gets there first, and to be saying that we need to move faster, that we are going very slowly."
"That is not the point of the issue, as you so rightly pointed out."
"Here there are major doubts, doubts that are justified, as to whether the procedure was formally correct, and therefore time does not matter."
"We have to wait until the necessary legal steps have been taken in order to dispel that doubt."
"It is unfortunate that we were not able to obtain an answer before, but what is most unfortunate is that it was not sent through the usual channels according to the Rules of Procedure."
"I would also like to make a couple of points to Mrs Hautala, with all the admiration that she knows that I have for her."
"Mrs Hautala, in the case that you mentioned and which you have consulted, there is a fact, aside from the two that the President gave to you. In the Official Journal it shows that the request came from the Minister of Justice, as it also shows in the report, but there is a letter from President Kleps, by which the President of Parliament notified the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, in which the Ministry is also mentioned."
"Are we perhaps to think that in this Parliament, which drew up that letter, the official who drew it up is not able to tell whether something comes from the Ministry of Justice or not?"
"Therefore, an assumption has been made, despite the fact that there is no documentary evidence, but assumptions have been made, and very strong ones, that in one way or another the letter was sent through the Ministry of Justice, because I cannot believe that the person responsible for drawing up that letter for the President at the time was not able to tell and would say explicitly in the letter that it came from the Ministry of Justice if that was not the case."
"Madam President I think that, as the Conference of Presidents very wisely decided, we should wait for Mrs Garaud to deal with this matter and to take the steps that she deems appropriate as the person mandated by the Conference of Presidents."
"We need to give it that time."
"With regard to the delay, I would like to say that this case is taking a long time, but that people should take a look in the files of the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"At the moment, for example, we have a request for the German Government that has not been answered for nine months. That is how it is, and it is there for all of you to look at."
"Finally, Madam President what is the problem that we are faced with?"
"It is a problem, if you will allow me, associated with the happy event of the growth of Europe in the context of a Europe of justice, the area of justice, because here the Supreme Court is arguing that appeals can be made to the European Parliament just as they can to national parliaments."
"In my opinion, with the law as it stands, this is still not possible. Let us hope that it will be in the future."
"Personally I hope so, but for the moment let us be content with respecting the law that is in force."
"We do not want voluntarism, which, as you so rightly said, Madam President, would only lead us to the Court of Justice."
"(Applause from the right)"
"Madam President, it seems clear that we face in all these issues two critical imperatives: on the one side, it is vitally important that democratic deliberation in an assembly of this kind goes forward without unfair impediment or abuse of legal processes to deter Members from exercising their democratic mandate properly."
"That is very important."
"On the other side, always when issues of immunity arise, the contemporary unpopularity of politicians becomes an issue and people say ""politicians hide behind membership of legislative houses in order to get away with things that ordinary people are punished for doing""."
"It is equally important and vital to avoid giving that impression."
"That is why it is so important in these cases that the House becomes seized as quickly as possible of the question whether what is before us is an abuse of the legal process in terrorem democratiae or whether on the other hand this is a case where something is being done which ought to be tried in the ordinary courts in the case of any ordinary citizen, for we are all ordinary citizens as well as legislators."
"It is very regrettable that this issue has become a matter of long drawn-out deliberation in the executive branch of a Member State because that is exactly the wrong place for these vital issues to be debated."
"We should get them into Parliament as quickly as possible."
"(Applause from the Verts/ALE Group)"
"Madam President, as you might have noticed, the Italian Members of the European Parliament on this side of the House have until now avoided intervening on the issues related to Mr Berlusconi's and Mr Dell'Utri's parliamentary immunity."
"The reason is quite obvious."
"The situation in my country is very delicate."
"The question is very complex."
"We are but a few weeks, or even a few days, away from Italian national elections."
"But with due respect to the high functions and duties and role you are discharging, and after listening to all my honourable colleagues, particularly Richard Corbett, and to you, let me say that the situation is perceived outside this House as becoming more unbearable, more unacceptable by the day."
"I am raising my voice therefore not as an Italian politician, but as a European Member of this House, to urge you to put an end to all the ambiguities and delays and specious protocol formalities, and to communicate to all of us, as Mr Corbett has suggested, a precise date, a deadline immediately after May 13, the national election day in my country, by which we intend to pursue a definite legal and procedural solution of the affair."
"This is a matter that goes far beyond political partisanship, and concerns, or should concern, all members of this House, for it concerns the dignity and functioning of our institution."
"Mr Manisco, I do understand that some Members are finding that this matter is dragging on."
"However, you understand that, for myself, as a president who has been accused in an extremely unfair manner, it is nonetheless important, in the interests of transparency, that we are able to see all the unquestionable, legal facts before us, including archived documents, such as the letter from the then Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs, for example."
"With regard to the deadline - there is a simple answer, which I have already given."
"I am now waiting for the Council of State to deliver an opinion."
"You will understand that as soon as the government of the Member State concerned informs me that the matter has been referred to the Council of State, I will act when the Council of State has delivered an opinion, when the Spanish government informs me who in actual fact is considered in Spain to be the appropriate authority to issue these requests for immunity."
"Immediately afterwards, I assure you that I shall make an announcement in Parliament, as Mrs Vayssade specified in her letter, and I shall refer the matter to the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"The matter will then be perfectly clear."
"Madam President, in response to what Mr Poettering has said, I would just like to underline that I did not raise any question relating to your past actions."
"I simply asked for a deadline to be set for the mission which our Parliament has agreed to send to the Spanish authorities."
"Nor did I cast any aspersions about why Mrs Garaud has not been able to go up to now."
"On the contrary, I said we fully understood those reasons, and that she has our every sympathy."
"I urge Mr Poettering in future to listen to what other Members say before he decides to attack them and to distinguish between a genuine concern for Parliament's reputation and procedures, and party political points."
"I was not making a party political point."
"I was making a point on behalf of this Parliament."
"Madam President, I had no intention whatsoever of speaking on this issue, but since the debate has been sparked off again...(Heckling)."
"Please be a little more patient!"
"You can tell me what you thought of what I am about to say in a moment."
"You may even be slightly troubled by this."
"Madam President, since the outset, the Members in my group believed that this was a matter involving a string of events that are all the more worrying and harmful since they evidently relate to a political issue, the scope of which is clear to all to see."
"I am clear at least about one thing - and that is the political responsibilities used quite openly in this matter - namely, the prolonged silence, and then the delaying tactics used by the Spanish government for more than eight months since the matter was referred to it by your office, Madam President."
"I think that we cannot help but associate this attitude with political collusion with Mr Berlusconi. That is what is unacceptable."
"We must not accept it."
"As for everything else, the more we have out into the open, the better it is for our institution, and, in my view, and I want to state this personally and very clearly, I do not question the integrity of the President of this Parliament, even though I do not approve the course of action she chose to follow in this sensitive matter."
"I know only too well what courage you have shown in other circumstances, Madam President, and therefore I will not go accusing you of anything underhand today."
"On the other hand, we have asked for complete transparency from the outset and you helped to provide this earlier by giving the details of this matter."
"It was just so that the whole truth could be known by all, and possible misunderstandings avoided, and most importantly so that we could finally make up some lost time to look into this request for the waiver of parliamentary immunity."
"I hope that the precedent of the Council of Europe that you mentioned - the Council of Europe to which the Spanish government felt it could turn - will enable you to persuade the Spanish government to treat the European Parliament in the same way as soon as possible, so that we will finally be able to look into this issue and turn the page on this chapter."
"Madam President, I too had not intended to take the floor, but this issue has now occupied our attention for three-quarters of an hour."
"In the meeting of the Conference of Presidents, all of the group leaders present made a very great effort to try to understand the precedents, to try to understand the complexity and to try to arrive at a reasoned and fair decision."
"I believe the decision that was arrived at at the Conference of Presidents reflected a consensus view, which was a collective wisdom, and you have enunciated that view here today."
"Everyone who has studied this dossier in great detail and who has discussed it free from polemics, but not free from their political preferences, has a view on these issues; no one made any personal accusation or imputation against you."
"I want to say, on behalf of my own group, that although you find yourself in an extremely difficult personal position, you have behaved with honour personally, as President of this House, from the very first moment this issue was placed before you."
"On 28 August last, you requested the assistance of the Spanish authorities on the issue of the competent authority to transmit this document."
"I believe that the delay, for which you are now being reproached in debates like this, is totally undignified and unwarranted, and that you and this Parliament find themselves becoming the victim as bystander of a process of an Executive outside this House."
"I intend, on behalf of my own group, notwithstanding the mission you have conferred on Madame Garaud, to whom again, on behalf of my group, I wish to express our profound sympathy, to take direct personal contact with the Spanish authorities, because we have a right to have an early and urgent answer."
"The delay has been unwarranted and undignified and it has cast you in a light and in a role where you do not properly belong."
"I defend what you have done."
"I hope and believe you would similarly defend any Member."
"If Madame Garaud is not in a position, for perfectly understandable reasons, to undertake the mission that you have conferred on her, it could be advisable to see if, in such circumstances, an alternative may be found, if only because it is important for the Presidency of this House to be able to assure Members, as I believe we were assured at a prolonged debate of the Conference of Presidents, that you have acted with concern for due process and with propriety at all times."
"We discussed the matter of precedents at length and the two precedents were rather interesting."
"One was an Italian case which came as a direct reference from a court."
"This is not a good precedent in this case because the Italian Constitution had changed between the earlier format of transmission and the most recent, and consequently the law itself had changed."
"Therefore, because the constitution was a different constitution, it is not a precedent with regard to the issue of a competent authority to transmit such a request."
"The second was one of three cases to lift the immunity of a Member, as it happened I think from Spain."
"Two of them clearly came through the transmission mechanism where there was no argument on competent authority."
"But the third came with the thumbprint of Government on it, unlike this request, so it is an inadequate precedent, even if it is a modest step in that direction."
"All this has left you in a very difficult and delicate position, Madam President."
"I believe the undignified delay is the primary cause of all this concern and therefore, if we have political anger, while we are entitled to feel and express that anger, we should direct it at those who have caused the delay: that is most certainly not you and it is not the office of the Presidency of the European Parliament."
"Madam President, I do not think that anyone could doubt the uprightness of your actions."
"I would just like to inform Chairman Barón Crespo that, in 1994, when Silvio Berlusconi was Prime Minister with a centre-right coalition, a bill was presented to Parliament, intended to resolve the issue of the conflict of interests - it is right for this House to be aware of this as well - and the proposal was adopted by a section of Parliament."
"However, when the political situation changed, the law was not adopted by the other part of Parliament."
"On several public occasions, Silvio Berlusconi and the parties supporting his candidacy for Prime Minister announced that, under the new legislature, a government bill would be tabled once again, with the aim of resolving the conflict of interests, and that, as a citizen, Mr Berlusconi would strictly observe this new law once it had been adopted by Parliament."
"I would like to end by reminding Mr Manisco that the law is not a protocol formality."
"It may be in some countries with which he is particularly concerned but, in Europe and in civilised countries, the law is not a protocol formality."
"Thank you, Mr Tajani."
"We have reached the end of this debate."
"I would quickly like to add one last thought, just a short comment, for the benefit of Mrs Frassoni."
"I would just like to confirm to her that if the request had concerned Mrs Frassoni, I would have acted in exactly the same way."
"However, where there would have been a difference, and I do not think that this will annoy you, is that there would not have been any comments about or contention surrounding my behaviour."
"I think that this is precisely the problem, Mrs Frassoni."
"I wish to ask your advice on raising this particular issue with the Petitions Committee: I wonder whether that would be in order."
"It is about my constituent, Mark Forrester, who was arrested on alleged football hooliganism during the EURO 2000 championships."
"He was subjected, and I say subjected with good reason, to the fast-track trial procedure last year, and was convicted: it was then deemed to be unfair and he went for retrial last month."
"The conviction was upheld last week."
"I believe this fast track trial and the conviction being upheld is contrary to Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights."
"It is contrary to Articles 47 and 48, of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which you, Madam President, signed."
"Every EU citizen has the right to a fair trial and should be deemed innocent until proven guilty."
"The video evidence that we saw in Court showed that my constituent, Mark Forrester, was not involved in any way, shape or form with any violence."
"A further video was offered to the Belgian authorities by the UK police. The Belgian police refused to take that further evidence."
"I believe the decision by the Court was more about propping up the fast-track trial procedure than about justice."
"Mark Forrester is innocent and we will carry on that fight to prove that he is innocent and to clear his name."
"I hope, Madam President, you will help us in that endeavour."
"Thank you, Mrs Lynne."
"According to the details of the situation that you have given, I think that the Committee on Petitions could indeed be the appropriate committee, but I suggest that you contact Mr Gemelli who is the Chair of this Committee and who will be able to advise you in full."
"Madam President, very soon the European Parliament will vote on public access to documents."
"In Ireland, the only country in the European Union which will vote on the Treaty of Nice, I am informed by my constituents that the Irish Government is not providing copies of the Treaty of Nice, but only its White Paper on the Treaty."
"Our Government has made clear that it will support a yes vote for the Treaty of Nice, as of course democratically it is allowed to do, but my constituents would like to decide for themselves and would like to have copies of the Treaty itself."
"Can you offer any advice in this situation?"
"Thank you, Mrs Scallon."
"We shall see what can be done in order to make this possible."
"EU/UN partnership on development and humanitarian issues"
"Commissioner, please accept my most sincere apologies, but you are a fervent supporter of transparency."
"We are aware of the extent to which you defend this value that is indispensable for our democracy and our institution, and so, I shall give you the floor, an hour later than planned, unfortunately, to allow you to give us the communication on the partnership with the United Nations in the areas of development and humanitarian issues."
"Over the past year, the Commission has had numerous contacts with the UN at political level."
"President Prodi met with Secretary-General Annan in October 2000 and visited Geneva in January this year."
"I have met the Secretary-General and most of the Heads of all the UN agencies over the last 18 months."
"In January this year, I paid a very successful visit to New York, where the Commission for the first time accepted an invitation to speak in the Joint Executive Boards of UNDP, UNICEF, UNFPA and WFP."
"So relations are close, and on both sides there is a strong political will to strengthen them."
"Over recent years, a consensus on the fundamental objectives and strategies of development cooperation has emerged on the global scene."
"This must result in better coordination and more coherence."
"The EC finances activities carried out by UN agencies at an average of EUR 354 million per year."
"This is a rather modest amount compared to the globality of what we are doing. Nevertheless, it is an important contribution."
"Many UN agencies, funds and programs possess reservoirs of professional skills and know-how as well as broad-based information and data systems."
"Making better use of those assets is one of the reasons for presenting this communication."
"Neither side has been able to draw maximum benefits from the existing cooperation."
"Different administrative cultures and regulatory obstacles are among the reasons for this situation."
"I have described this situation as the war of accountants: this war is still not over but we can see solutions on the horizon."
"The Communication sets out a number of fundamental principles for strengthening the working relationship:"
"Selectivity: The EC will be a positive, but demanding multilateral partner."
"The Commission will seek to focus on strengthening cooperation with those UN entities that work in the areas identified by the EU and where working at the Community level provides added-value."
"Predictability: By clearly setting out long-term priority areas for cooperation, both the EC and UN will be able to enjoy a more predictable flow of EC financial contributions."
"We have to move from projects to programmes."
"Active presence: The EC will further exploit the already extensive opportunities for active EC participation in the work of the governing bodies of priority UN entities."
"The Communication focuses on the administrative environment necessary to reach these objectives."
"We need:"
"A successful conclusion of the ongoing negotiations on a Verification Clause, giving the EC controllers satisfactory access to information about the use of EC funds."
"A re-negotiation of the 1999 EC/UN Framework Agreement to focus, in co-financing operations, on output-based budgeting and upstream programme funding."
"A speedy Council approval of the Commission' s proposal on the recasting of the Financial Regulation [COM(2000) 461 of 17 December 2000]."
"I would like to draw this point, in particular, to the attention of Parliament."
"Finally, the Communication adopted today sends an important message to our UN partners:"
"The EC is proposing to intensify cooperation on EC priorities that match key capabilities of UN agencies."
"To ensure smooth cooperation on this, strong UN inter-agency coordination is required."
"The EC is suggesting amending legal and administrative provisions governing EC/UN financial cooperation."
"The Commission hopes and expects that this will be met with flexibility from UN negotiators in recognition of the special role and status of the European Community in the work of the UN institutions."
"The EC is proposing to provide programme funding to selected UN agencies."
"It is a prerequisite that UN agencies continue efforts to further UN reform and to improve their quality of delivery."
"This in turn should lead to an improvement of our own efficiency and effectiveness, both in the policy and operational domain, and in turn, to a sizeable improvement in the quality and impact of EC development and humanitarian policies and activities."
"But let me conclude by stating one thing quite clearly: this is not about giving the UN system a blank cheque!"
"This new approach by the Commission can only succeed if we can count upon active collaboration from the United Nations."
"Improving EC/UN policy and operational cooperation in the development and humanitarian fields is conditional to the UN strengthening in-house coordination, focusing its thematic strengths along the lines of its ongoing reform process and pursuing negotiations on the legal and financial cooperation framework."
"We are fully committed to upholding the fundamental principles of sound and transparent management of the resources of the European taxpayer."
"We will make clear to the United Nations that the Commission is prepared to reduce or even suspend its support to individual UN partners, which fail to perform to an acceptable standard."
"But, to relate in a more open and cooperative manner within the UN system is also an element in making our own development cooperation and humanitarian activities more efficient."
"There is a limit to the kind of relationship we can enter into."
"It is called the United Nations, it is not called the United Commission."
"We will remain different, but what we are proposing to do will improve and normalise the way we can work together with these partners also at country level and this is what we want to do."
"Mr President, I welcome the statement."
"I am sorry that the discussion about one Member has taken so long that once again the discussion about the poorest countries of the world and how we can more effectively aid them has been relegated and diminished."
"I have personally been involved in Europe's support for UNHCR for UN aids."
"It is the best quality support."
"I totally support what Mr Nielson has said about the financial regulation and given that Members of other committees than the Development Committee are here and are part of the process for agreeing such legislation perhaps he could elaborate on that more."
"My questions to him are as follows: first, how will the communication actually change matters on the ground in countries so that in emergency situations better coordination takes place."
"Secondly, how will the communication ensure that together we better meet the UN goals on development, for example, halving world poverty by 2015."
"Finally, reflecting on his point about United Commissions or United Nations, how far will the Member States go along with this."
"Too often in the past they have wanted to keep the European Union and its institutions away from the UN rather than ensuring effective collaboration."
"Can he count on their support in achieving this communication?"
"Mr President, I am delighted to hear what the Commissioner has said about working closely with the United Nations."
"Some of the United Nations programmes which deliver on the ground are very effective, and sometimes more effective, than what the European Union has been doing so far."
"I want to ask two questions: first, what level of complementarity are you looking at when the Commission is trying to set an arrangement in place to work with the United Nations, or are we merely going to give the United Nations the money they require and they will do the delivery on the floor?"
"This is a point that has taken prominence in Indonesia and in the Jaffna area of Sri Lanka where the UNHCR has been doing an excellent job in trying to rehabilitate and give support to people."
"The second question is really more broadly addressed to Parliament: are we going to set up a permanent standing liaison committee of MEPs involved with development and cooperation to report to the General Assembly of the United Nations each year on our joint cooperation?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, I want to state that, as chairman of Finland' s national UNICEF Committee, I have a special interest in this issue."
"Secondly, I note with satisfaction the incredible importance of cooperation on particular themes."
"Unfortunately, the feeling in UNICEF is that the organisation has been given assignments to carry out only for as long as there has been no special European organisation that has been able to do so."
"As Mr Howitt mentioned, thematic cooperation must include education and the fight against poverty."
"I hope that we shall be able to see a significant increase in the EU' s contribution to high-quality education for women and girls."
"We know that this has been a topic taken up by the UN, and it will be a topic at the UN' s special session on children in September 2001."
"We have obtained a communication from the Commission concerning the EU' s contribution to the conference for the poorest countries, but I wonder: will there also be a communication from the Commission about the efforts being made to prepare for the special session in September 2001?"
"The EU' s input will be required in this area too."
"First to Mr Howitt, we can realistically expect better results on the ground if we look at the ability of being able to fund, for example, UNHCR actions in a more programme-based manner."
"If we look at Kosovo, they were given the mandate of coordinating all humanitarian support, but the Commission was not allowed, and would still not be allowed, to do core funding, so they had very great difficulty in defining specific projects that we can legally fund."
"But if we can have a broader definition defined by goals of what we can fund, we can make it possible for them to do their essential work of coordinating on the ground better."
"We need that also to give security to all the NGOs working in these humanitarian theatres, therefore predictability and better planning is what we can expect from the changes."
"As to the larger goals, certainly our influence on policy-making in UN bodies is increased when we have a more normal ongoing discussion instead of the hit-and-run operation of funding a project here and a project there."
"To Mr Deva, we will not just give the money."
"We are not contemplating core funding."
"This is something the owners of the UN organisation, its Member States, should do, but where we are now is inadequate, it is too much split up on individual projects without predictability for the World Food Programme or for UNICEF, as was mentioned."
"They need a quality partnership with a major donor like the Commission and, by doing what we are putting forward here, we can bring ourselves into that role."
"Finally, for the special meeting in September, the Commission is planning to have a strong presence and make a strong contribution."
"Mr President, Commissioner, when we in the Committee on Development and Cooperation heard the person in charge of UNDP speak last year, what I heard him say was: we are extremely competent, give us the money and we will do the rest."
"I am pleased that you have adopted a different stance, and are urging us to respect our own priorities."
"But I am still left with the big question as to when the key actors will begin to join forces."
"UN aid might sound very prestigious, and expectations are high - with good reason, but in practice, too little aid from the UN bodies is filtering down to the smaller players at grassroots level where it could really make a difference."
"That is why I not only urge you to look at the big picture when it comes to cooperation with those key players, I also urge you to consider how this work can penetrate down to grassroots level."
"Mr President, we have taken good note of this decision by the Commission."
"We would have liked to have had the opportunity to discuss this matter with the Commission before it took the decision."
"We were not able to do so, but in any event, I wish to say that we have no objection, in principle, to the idea of closer cooperation, which would lead to more effective and more appropriate action by the European Union."
"There is, however, one specific question that I wish to raise, which is both a question and a fear: to what extent will the identity and visibility of the European Union become subordinated as a result of this cooperation, particularly in terms of defining guidelines to follow and, specifically, with regard to the agencies that are really behind all decisions taken in this area, by which I mean the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank?"
"To what extent are we maintaining our independence from these institutions, which, as we know, have become greatly discredited?"
"Commissioner Nielson's department have produced an excellent communication and programme for action for communicable infectious diseases, HIV Aids, TB and malaria."
"It is not possible for the EU to fund that programme alone and therefore I would like to ask, is he going to take the lead in initiating and establishing a global fund in cooperation with the UN and other agencies so that this can be done?"
"I am the rapporteur for that report and I hope this Parliament will put it on fast track so that it can be debated before the UN international conference on the subject in the third week of June."
"I saw a lot of time wasted this afternoon."
"This is an important subject and those responsible in this House should put that on the agenda for fast track debate, so Members of this House can debate it and the European Parliament's view can go to that conference for consideration."
"To Mrs Maes first, the way we want to move forward is to participate fully as a donor in funding the realisation of sector programmes that are better organised than what we have done so far at country level."
"It also has an impact on the demand that UN organisations have to meet, when all donors are more disciplined."
"We are also raising the expectation that members of the UN family will play their part more in consultation with other donors: this has worked with the World Bank to a reasonable extent in very recent years and this is the same disciplining."
"As regards the humanitarian side, it is quite different."
"There, the main reason why we should support the UN instances is that they very often have the special mandate to do things where they have access and where others may have great difficulties."
"We are trying to establish a balance using them and NGOs."
"The only thing is coordination, but for example UNHCR has a special mandate and we have to be careful not to leave them marginalised."
"Mr Miranda, quite frankly the Commission is not proposing anything today, which would surprise those who have been discussing these issues with me over recent years."
"This is very much in line with what I have announced as the next logical and necessary step."
"We will discuss it and it is important that we try to work out the same kind of well-informed consensus on this step as we managed to do on the overall policy paper."
"This is part of implementing those ideas and we will both manage to do things more efficiently, also having more influence."
"This ability is fine, but not enough and if it is a visible PR stunt, I prefer the kind of visibility that comes from professional respect and getting real influence on the global scene."
"This is what we are aiming at."
"Mr Khanbhai, this discussion about the global fund is in one way easy to understand and we can quite sympathetically step up the effort against communicable diseases to the extent that the creation of this fund actually mobilises new and additional money from new private sources."
"We welcome it and we may also participate, but the real problem is delivery on the ground."
"This is where the UN organisations need to answer our questions more directly and where we have to become better at actually doing things."
"This is the bottleneck of the fight against these diseases, not whether we are adding EUR 100 million from money which is already devoted to do this job."
"The reality on the ground is the bottleneck and we should never forget this in this discussion."
"There are many fashions of the month in the discussion on these issues and I will be quite stubborn, with the support from this House, and stick to what we have defined."
"May I thank the Commission for an excellent initiative on our relationship with the UN."
"Three short simple questions: how in the Commissioner's analysis do the priorities of the United Nations differ from the priorities of the European Union in terms of the way we believe that humanitarian aid should be delivered?"
"How will the tensions which I have personally observed be overcome - the tensions which always exist on the ground between the UN and the European Union, and how will the new approach which you intend to adopt, facilitate a better partnership and a lessening of those kind of tensions on the ground?"
"I would like to thank the Commissioner for the statement he has just made."
"One thing is quite clear: unless we get better cooperation between the donors, we will never get rid of the duplication and voids we see in aid."
"Does he find already that we are getting better coordination with the United Nations because of what he is doing?"
"I noticed in the ninth EDF that 90% of the funds will be going to the least developed countries."
"Do you think they have the capacity to deal with such a large amount of money?"
"And if not, are the United Nations organisations helping to build that capacity?"
"The EU policy is to move towards regional cooperation and integration."
"Is that also a policy that the United Nations organisations are following and will support?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, I thought your Communication was interesting and I would like to ask you two questions."
"This initiative for partnership between the Commission and United Nations bodies is important, in my opinion, as long as it is not detrimental to European development and humanitarian aid policies, the design and implementation of which are subject to the democratic control of this House."
"I would therefore urge you that it should not be limited to giving or supplying funds or delegating responsibilities to a bigger partner, but that this responsibility should also be monitored."
"My second question refers to the identity of Community aid, which is one of our fundamental pillars and which is focused on the non-governmental sector."
"I would like this aid to continue, and in this respect I am concerned about the relationship that NGOs often have with United Nations bodies."
"How will this continue to be organised or coordinated?"
"First to Mrs Kinnock, as I said before, in the area of humanitarian aid the organisational problems and the challenges on how to do things are not as complex as when we look at the transitional phase and general phase."
"The tensions on the ground - here I would respond also Mrs Sauquillo's question concerning the relation between NGOs and UN organisations - have very often been a big problem."
"Things are better now than they used to be."
"There is more of an acceptance of the need for a professional manner of work also among humanitarian NGOs, and of the need and the obligation to accept coordination as part of our contracts with anybody we are funding."
"So from case to case it looks somewhat better today."
"I have already mentioned protection and security."
"In Chechnya, the access to using radios has been discussed with the Russian government since the troubles started and only now is it possible to have that additional little element of security, but without the UN being there as those who can actually handle this part of the whole work, no one would ever get permission to have radios."
"This is good and clear and this is being discussed now more and more internationally."
"This is one of the aspects I mentioned in connection with the special mandate of some of these global UN organisations so we need a division of labour between specialised NGOs and the umbrella, in some cases, of UN organisations."
"As a very large humanitarian donor, we need to be able to play on all the instruments available and by entering into a more structured relationship as we are foreseeing now, we shall also have a stronger voice in the discussion on these issues with the UN organisations, compared to just an on-and-off donor."
"To Mr Corrie, the figure of how much we are allocating in the ninth European Development Fund of 90% covers both the least developed countries and the low-income group of countries."
"It is these two added together which is the 90%."
"On capacity building we need everybody who is able to do it, UNDP, World Bank and ourselves: this is such a big job that we should not even think of doing everything ourselves."
"Let me remind Parliament that in the overall development policy paper, we have specified areas of special focus, which also means that we will frankly have to rely on others doing more in the areas where we will do less, and we have Member States who will and can do this."
"But we also have the global system and it is in order not to exclude that type of partnership that we are doing what we are now."
"Regional cooperation: we are using very clearly the Economic Commission for Africa and the other relevant UN players and they are extremely interested in the bold, ambitious line followed by the Commission in trying to organise the geo-economics especially of Africa."
"We have a good partnership in this and good support."
"Finally, that part of Mrs Sauquillo's question dealing more or less with visibility and clarity of our policy."
"This is the self-confidence."
"We could also look at this the other way around: we have now reached the point where we have some certainty and clarity and strong support for the line that we have defined."
"Now we feel we have the strength and maturity to discuss more globally with the UN system."
"We were not that organised before in this field, so we are increasing the ambition of influencing what goes on globally, and this is the thought behind it."
"Mr President, Mrs Sauquillo was right to question the inspection procedure with regard to the way in which the Union' s money is spent."
"The first inspection is carried out at the General Assembly which is held between September and December."
"I should like to ask the Commission how this is done at the moment."
"Does the European Commission fulfil a coordinating role at that Assembly?"
"Has anybody been especially appointed to carry out this task, and is this inspection carried out effectively in concert with the 15 Member States at this General Assembly?"
"I take a keen interest in this matter because I was Dutch representative working on this General Assembly in the 1970s."
"My second question relates to the United Nations' refugee work."
"I know that resources have been cut considerably in this respect."
"The present High Commissioner for refugees has already paid a call on the Commissioner to see if matters could take a turn for the better."
"Does this new alliance with the United Nations also mean a financial improvement for the work of the UN' s refugee organisation?"
"This would indeed be good news for the new High Commissioner."
"Mr President, in welcoming the Commissioner's commitment to working with the UN agencies, can I ask him if he agrees with Kofi Annan that there can be no economic health without physical and mental health, and will he work with the agencies, particularly WHO and UNICEF, to achieve that."
"We have heard a lot today and we will rightly hear a lot more about one of the biggest challenges, Aids: two days ago, Kofi Annan was appealing to the world to play a bigger part in this."
"But there are other illnesses: TB, malaria, river blindness and the mental and neurological health area which this year was designated by the WHO as its key area."
"Will he bring forward to this Parliament plans to do more work in that area?"
"Mental health is the fastest growing cause of disability."
"For example, there are more people with epilepsy than with Aids - 40 million people live with it, but only 8 million of those 40 million are treated for it."
"That is a disgrace to the world."
"We can do more."
"Will he commit this Parliament, this Union, and this Commission to do more as well."
"First to Mrs Maij-Weggen, it is not the role of the Commission to coordinate the Member States in the UN General Assembly, that is their job."
"In general, what the EU Member States are doing in the political negotiating processes in the General Assembly is quite well coordinated."
"However, when we move into the boards of the different UN organisations the level of coordination is lower, and this is where we, as a Commission, have a real presence in terms of being more of a practical partner, very much in line with what Member States are themselves, but where we have no voice except in a very few cases, namely the FAO."
"We are not asking for a new legal basis."
"We are asking for a closer partnership."
"We do not need it, but it would be nice if it were to grow over time into a role where we play a more visual political role."
"We will gain political influence by the changes we are suggesting, but it is a matter of process and achievement."
"As regards the money I mentioned, the control issue: given the existing legal framework for how we can spend money, this is one of the few outstanding issues being discussed with the UN organisations before we can renew and improve the framework agreement on how we do things practically."
"This is the final round of the war of accountants, but it is in fact still on."
"We need a little more responsiveness from the UN organisations to give access to our auditors and controllers to follow our money, to open up in a manner which is comparable to what we have obtained with the World Bank."
"The big thing is that to work well in a normal partnership, we should not insist on having everything done according to our rules."
"If it is good enough for a Member State to do this together with a UN organisation and have its reporting accepted, it should be good enough for the European Union to do basically the same."
"But we can only do this when we have the financial regulation changed."
"Until then we are in the terrain we have described in this communication and there is ample room for improvement on how to do things."
"I hope we will in this way be able to build up confidence and thus stimulate efficiency."
"Mr Bowis, I agree that the issue of mental health is a very large one."
"I would add other sorts of disabilities which, in a very poor environment, are often totally ignored."
"From a human point of view this needs more attention."
"In the humanitarian phase, we are now giving much more attention to the psychological aspects of the victims, not only children and women, but in general: it is quite clear that the demobilisation of soldiers is impossible without addressing the psychological aspects."
"I am very pleased that you mentioned TB and malaria as diseases that we need to give the same emphasis as Aids."
"This is another aspect we have tried to include in our communication and the programme of action on these communicable diseases."
"This is as important as sticking to the line of giving prevention absolute priority."
"We are trying to keep the broad picture of all these diseases at the top of the agenda."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Nielson."
"The debate is closed."
"Request for the waiver of Peter Sichrovsky's immunity"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0124/2001) by Mr Zimeray on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on the request for waiver of the immunity of Mr Peter Sichrovsky."
"- (FR) Mr President, the case involving Mr Sichrovsky is probably the most sensitive that we have had to deal with in the course of our mandate, both because of reasons relating to procedure but also, and more importantly, because of the background to the matter."
"I would like to take this opportunity to remind you of the principles that have guided us in writing this report and which are, as we have seen in the previous debate, fundamental to this Parliament."
"The first principle that must hold sway here is to disregard, as far as possible, all public opinion when we have to deal with a report on a request for the waiver of immunity, as well as to abstain, as far as possible, from judging or prejudging the Member of Parliament involved, something that is not always easy."
"The second principle is that we must always act in accordance with the law, with respect for both the law of the Member State and also what is becoming parliamentary law, for substantive rules and formal rules, which imposes a strict obligation upon us to be consistent with decisions we have made in the past."
"We must also focus solely on the charge laid against the Member, and this is a principle that cannot be violated."
"This is a particularly important point in the case involving Mr Sichrovsky and I shall come back to this in a moment."
"Finally, when there is some doubt, the doubt must always work in the favour of the accused, of the Member of Parliament whose immunity we are being asked to waive."
"In the case of Mr Sichrovsky, therefore, as in all cases, I believe that it is important to reiterate the principle of immunity and the reasons for its existence."
"Immunity is not a privilege granted to an individual Member of Parliament."
"Its role is to protect: not to protect an individual, but rather to protect the institution through the individual concerned."
"I must say that the case involving Mr Sichrovsky and those that we shall deal with in a moment have arisen in situations where information has been flowing freely, which explains why we have an increasing number of slander and libel cases."
"We have also entered into a democracy of opinion and a situation in which life and public life, in particular, are penalised, and I am taking this opportunity to reiterate that civil laws also exist to sue for alleged damages, particularly where the damages have been caused by a press article or by slander, and I think that we must take this opportunity to reiterate that immunity does not mean impunity, it is a suspension of the criminal law procedure, which does not, to any extent, prevent criminal proceedings being instigated during the mandate of the Member of Parliament."
"In the case of Mr Sichrovsky, who, I must remind you, has been accused for having described the President of the Jewish community in Vienna as an 'idiot' , an 'aggressive, irascible, incredibly mean' and 'spiteful person' , a 'professional Jew' who 'would take advantage of his dead parents to appear on television' ."
"Naturally, one would think that these words constitute an incitement to racial hatred and to anti-Semitism."
"I personally refuse to contemplate this theory for the simple reason that he is not being charged with this crime, and in these circumstances, I think that we must not allow ourselves to substitute the crime against him with another."
"We were able to carry out a detailed analysis of the case within the Committee on Legal Affairs and this was a detailed investigation of the case over the course of several meetings, since this case has been before the Committee on Legal Affairs on three or four occasions. This investigation showed that these words, even if they were pointed, however excessive or hateful they may seem, were spoken in a political context and in response to criticism of which Mr Sichrovsky himself was a target and to criticism regarding his political affiliation on the basis of his religious beliefs."
"That is why the Committee on Legal Affairs has taken the view, as it has in similar cases, namely those involving Portuguese Members of Parliament, that there was a link, albeit tenuous, between what he said and his political affiliation and political views."
"However, this link does not, of course, apply to everything that was said but I think we should accept that all of Mr Sichrovsky' s words form a whole, and that the privilege of immunity should therefore be granted to him."
"Mr President, we certainly endorse and support the outcome reached in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, presented to us by Mr Zimeray, because our Parliamentary immunity must be such as to allow us to use expressions, albeit as moderate as possible, of course, on political matters in every speech that politicians have to make in various different circumstances, whether they are made live on public occasions or reported through the general media."
"I would like to take this opportunity, Mr President, to point out certain aspects of immunity, all or, at any rate, some of which I would like to explore in greater detail, despite the fact that they have already been mentioned by Mr Zimeray."
"As we always state in the reports of the Parliamentary Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, our Parliamentary immunity is a European immunity and is therefore independent of national procedures."
"That is because this institution, the only European institution to be elected by universal suffrage, must be independent of any other European institution, as we always state in our reports."
"In reality, however, we adhere to the clear provisions of the Treaties, the Rules of Procedure and the Statute of Parliament, with the result that this is not the case."
"I will develop this point in my forthcoming speeches."
"In any case, I endorse what was said in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market: we recommend that the immunity of the Member in question should not be waived."
"Mr President, like the previous speakers, I believe that we should use the Sichrovsky case, which we are discussing today, as an opportunity to go beyond matters of pure routine and to reflect on the logic or otherwise of parliamentary immunity."
"The historical roots of this concept, that is to say the protection of the free mandate of Members against interference from what originally were often still very much monarchy-led authorities, now only serve as a partial justification for the institution of immunity."
"There must be no doubt that when it comes to statements made as a direct consequence of exercising our mandate or in connection with votes in this House, immunity, sometimes referred to as indemnity, needs to be fully guaranteed in practice."
"However, in cases involving actions and statements with very tenuous political connections, and in particular where protection against prosecution by the state is not involved, but rather the rights of fellow citizens in relation to Members, then we are pushing at the limits of the legitimacy of blanket immunity."
"In such cases, there is a risk that immunity becomes a privilege."
"If we in the European Parliament - in contrast to many national parliaments - still grant such wide-ranging protection, then every single Member should behave in such a way that we are justified in maintaining this practice."
"The generosity of this Parliament, which is rooted in fundamental considerations in this case too, which is as it should be, therefore also benefits those Members who belong to parties which do not take the protection of freedom of expression and freedom of information very seriously at home."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I can only tell you what Rule 6 of our Rules of Procedure says on this point: ""Without prejudice to Rule 122, the Member whose immunity is subject to the request for a waiver shall not speak in the debate."""
"I am just telling you that, so that we all have the same information."
"Thank you very much for your understanding."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Request for the waiver of Johannes Voggenhuber's immunity"
"The next item is the report (A5-0124/2001) by Mr Zimeray on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on the request for waiver of the immunity of Mr Voggenhuber."
"Mr President, to continue what I was saying earlier, in actual fact, as we have seen in this Chamber, we very often find ourselves talking about immunity or about requests for waiver of immunity, according to procedures, application methods and characteristics which differ according to the origins or allegiance, whether national or political - more national than political if the truth be known, of each of us."
"Today, someone has raised this issue, which seemed to me, in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, never to have been analysed before."
"I feel that Parliament and the Presidency must make further endeavours - and we are doing - and reach a speedy conclusion on the matter for the difficulties that arise from the different laws of the nations to which we belong do not, when it comes down to it, make all the Members subject to the same conditions."
"In the case in point - as Mr Zimeray very rightly said - the Committee on Legal Affairs expressed a unanimous vote on the matter."
"It is true that, in politics, there is sometimes exaggeration, very often personal comments are made, and we have witnessed precisely that in this Chamber today."
"However, we remain democratically of the opinion that, however strong the expressions used by each Member of Parliament, each politician, may be, they must be considered to be political actions - although I do not mean that Parliament must not cover up for individuals - and therefore, in order to protect Parliament, immunity must not be waived."
"On behalf of the PPE, I therefore endorse the proposal of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, while making it clear that, if comments on the personal affairs and private, personal lives of all of us - which, I regret to say, are often made, as the international press is doing at present - could be avoided, it would be much better and would certainly be an indication of more democratic, more correct political behaviour."
"Mr President, for a long time now, one thing that we have been able to rely on in Austria's domestic political scene is the Freedom Party and Jörg Haider bombarding their critics - the media in general, individual journalists, other politicians and also individual members of the public - with lawsuits."
"The current Minister for Justice has in the past appeared in court in connection with some of these cases in his capacity as a lawyer."
"Many of the legal judgments handed down are most interesting, because Austria's judges can now at least still display sufficient independence."
"Not long ago, for example, it was established at appeal in the case brought by Jörg Haider against the university professor Anton Pelinka, which also attracted international attention, that the statement that the Freedom Party was playing down Nazi atrocities was permissible."
"We would also have expected a similar clarification of a fundamental point in the case of the lawsuit brought by Jörg Haider against our fellow Member Johannes Voggenhuber, by which I mean establishing whether or not the Freedom Party is a fascist, neo-fascist, or post-fascist party."
"In order to establish the facts of the matter, Johannes Voggenhuber, in contrast to his colleague Mr Sichrovsky, has himself asked for his immunity to be waived."
"However, for reasons of principle, which I support, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has been unable to accede to this request."
"Nevertheless, I hope that it will be possible to achieve legal clarification of the nature of the Freedom Party in some other way."
"I would now like to use my remaining speaking time to point out that I am amazed that the report on the Sichrovsky case as adopted in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market was amended before it reached the plenary, so that in many places it is no longer as clear as when it was adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"Mr President, Mr Voggenhuber has presented us with a serious problem, calling Jörg Heider a fascist and his party a neo-fascist party."
"Mr. Voggenhuber himself hopes his parliamentary immunity might be waived, as he has very persuasively shown our group that this is a matter of standing up for freedom of speech, which is something he wishes to be involved in."
"He therefore wants to fight verbally against this sort of fascist party and its leader, and he would not want parliamentary immunity to be a barrier to this."
"Consequently, I have to inform you, Mr President, that, unlike the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, my group will respect Mr Voggenhuber' s wishes, as it considers them to be totally justified, and will recommend that his parliamentary immunity be waived."
"This does by no means imply that we should question the principles adhered to by the Committee on Legal Affairs or the fact that it should stand to its principles, but in this case we consider that there are good reasons why Parliament can best safeguard its own independence by accepting this challenge Mr Heider has issued to Mr Voggenhuber."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11a.m."
"Request for the waiver of Elisabeth Jeggle's immunity"
"The next item is the report (A5-0216/2001) by Mr MacCormick on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on the request for waiver of the immunity of Elisabeth Jeggle [2001/2031(IMM)]."
"Mr President, the previous two cases we have considered dealt with issues of free speech and the conditions of maintaining robust political debate."
"This case raises no such issue. It is a case concerning a traffic violation, as the second to last paragraph on page 10 of my report says, ""the charge against Mrs Jeggle relates to the offence of dangerous driving since it is alleged that when driving her car on 4 May 1999 she acted recklessly and in gross violation of road traffic regulations by overtaking another vehicle at a point that did not afford sufficient visibility to do so."""
"We are not in any sense called upon to form a judgment on the truth or falsity of these allegations or on Mrs Jeggle's conduct."
"We are called upon only to decide whether an allegation and a trial on a matter of this kind attracts parliamentary immunity which ought not to be waived."
"The German authorities have rightly halted proceedings which were already quite far advanced on learning that Mrs Jeggle had been elected to this Parliament and in due course sent a request to Parliament for Mrs Jeggle's immunity to be waived."
"We come up here against what I regard as an extremely important principle: that we elected politicians ought to enjoy no special privileges over our fellow citizens."
"Members of a democratic assembly of this kind should only not be subjected to harassment or persecution for carrying out their duties."
"We are agreed, Mrs Jeggle as fully and firmly as anybody else, that traffic offences are not covered by that principle and that Parliament should never claim immunity for any of its Members on a matter of this kind."
"Mrs Jeggle has passed to me word through another colleague that she is unable to be present in the House this afternoon and she wanted to assure me, and the House, that this is no intentional discourtesy on her part but an unavoidable conflict of obligations."
"I am very happy to pass that assurance on, because it certainly has been the case that at no point in the discussion of this matter has she in any way deviated from the view which I am putting to the House."
"This is not a case where Parliament should insist on a Member's immunity and I have no hesitation at all in reporting to the House the unanimous view of the Committee on Legal Affairs that immunity ought in this case to be waived on the request of the German authorities."
"Mr President, of course we too endorse the opinion expressed in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on this request for waiver of immunity; that is, we support the rapporteur's proposal."
"However, I would like to take this opportunity to remind the previous speaker - not the rapporteur, the Member who spoke before him - that the immunity is Parliamentary immunity, not immunity of the individual Members, that the European Parliament expresses its self-protection through its Members and that the will of the Members who find that they are the subject of a request for waiver of immunity has no bearing on the situation, because each one of us represents the entire Parliament, not himself or herself."
"A Member's wish to relinquish immunity therefore has no effect: this is the custom and this is the written rule, and political expressions or, in any case, political activity - I repeat it is the custom - cannot be subjected to any type of judgment."
"Therefore, the Committee on Legal Affairs has expressed a clear opinion in these three cases: it has already expressed this opinion in the past and I am sure that it will do so again in the future, simply because it is now consolidated practice."
"Outside this Chamber, certainly no one could think or maintain that Parliament could be condemned for performing activities which are clearly and explicitly political."
"The refusal to uphold immunity in this case, and therefore the committee's proposal to waive immunity for something which has nothing to do with politics, is proof of consistency."
"I would like to make a brief point, Mr President, that, in Mrs Jeggle' s case, there is nothing to prevent parliamentary immunity being waived, even more so because the events, which today justify such a request, took place before Mrs Jeggle was elected to the European Parliament and they bear no relation, either direct or indirect, to her political activities."
"I will, however, briefly comment on what the two previous speakers said."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market was, I believe, unanimous in its support of this outcome also because, although the offence was, admittedly, serious, there were, as far as I am aware, no victims, and because given the nature of this offence, Mrs Jeggle does not run any real risk of being imprisoned or prevented from exercising her mandate."
"Having also taken this into consideration, the Committee decided, rightly in my view, to waive the parliamentary immunity of Mrs Jeggle."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.a.m."
"Public access to documents"
"The next item is the report (A5-0318/2001) by Mr Cashman on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on public access to documents of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission [COM(2000) 30 - C5-0057/2000 - 2000/0032(COD)]"
", rapporteur. In November last year, I presented my report on public access to the EU institutions' documents, a subject which, as I said then, I consider crucial to the lives of the people we represent and to the future of the Union."
"I am happy to say that I stand before you today to ask Parliament to endorse a compromise text, as this House requested of me in November 2000."
"I, Hanja Maij-Weggen, my ex-co-rapporteur, and all the draftsmen of opinions and some shadows for the other Committees embarked on a series of meetings with the Council and the Commission, latterly called trialogues, in order to reach this compromise."
"All the various versions of the compromise text during the trialogue processes were discussed in public meetings."
"Indeed, the trialogue process, it can be argued, has been more transparent than a conciliation process, in which only final texts of negotiations are published."
"The negotiations were not always easy and, contrary to what some believe, the distance between our institutions in January was great, but we fought hard to maintain what we considered to be essential elements to ensure the rights of the citizens."
"Of course the text does not go as far as we would have liked."
"I am the first to admit that, but it was a priority for me and my co-rapporteur Hanja Maij-Weggen to complete the dossier in line with the Treaty deadline, so that the institutions could not be accused of failing to deliver for the citizen under Article 232 of the Treaty."
"The standpoints of the three institutions were difficult to reconcile in such a short space of time and even the Council, under the wonderful Swedish Presidency, found it difficult to achieve a political consensus, or at least a qualified majority, within itself."
"Nonetheless, we have a text which improves on and consolidates the status quo and delivers to the citizen, within the time frame set in the Amsterdam Treaty, a comprehensive and practical framework for access to the institutions' documents."
"It is by no means a step backwards."
"We have established a self-evolving text which, I am sure, will be improved upon in the course of time."
"The compromise text revolutionises the rights and procedures for access to documents of the institutions and sets in motion the enshrining of freedom of information in the EU and in Member States' national legislation."
"It is the first common framework for the three institutions which recognises the citizen's rights so that the citizen no longer relies on the goodwill of each Institution."
"Access to documents regarding the activities of the institutions enables citizens to hold the EU governing bodies accountable, stimulates greater efficiency and enhances democracy."
"The text would not have been possible without the hard work and commitment of the Swedish Presidency."
"I would like to take this opportunity to also pay tribute to the remarkable work on this dossier that they have contributed and to that of my co-rapporteur, Mrs Maij-Weggen, and Graham Watson, Chair of the LIBE Committee."
"Of course there are some cases when documents from the institutions should not be released into the public domain."
"Indeed, it is part of our responsibility as deputies of this Parliament to protect the security of our citizens and the institutions."
"MEPs have a responsibility to ensure the vital interests of the Union are protected by improving its internal security, whilst at the same time balancing the citizens' rights of access."
"This new regime means that every document is considered on a case-by-case basis without blanket exceptions and documents concerning security and defence are by no means excluded from the Regulation."
"Under this compromise text, the Council is obliged to repeal or amend the Solana Decision of August 2000 so that it conforms to the principles of this Regulation."
"There is assumption in favour of access to the public for all documents in all areas of the Union's activities and access will only be denied to those in areas which directly relate to a listed exception."
"It has to be shown that such an exception is necessary and the disclosure would cause harm."
"The exceptions are therefore discretionary, not mandatory."
"If access is refused to the citizen, the citizen must be given the reason for refusal and there is recourse to the Ombudsman and the Court of Justice."
"Virtually all documents will be placed on a public register."
"Documents from third parties will be accessible for the first time and agencies or bodies created by the institutions will also apply the Regulation."
"If a document is excepted, or parts of the document are excepted, those parts of the document which are not excepted will be made public, and the exceptions will only apply for a limited maximum of thirty years, except in some cases."
"Finally, each Institution will produce an annual report outlining where the Institution refused access and the number of sensitive documents not recorded in the register, thus ensuring a continuing review by the European Parliament, and the Commission will also report by January 2004 on the implementation of the principles in the Regulation, thereby offering another opportunity to refine and develop access."
"Finally, this is not the end of the beginning."
"This is one small step on the road to access to documents and ensuring that the European Project is accountable to its citizens."
"Mr President, Mrs Lejon, Commissioner, today is a joyful day for the citizens of the European Union."
"After years of sabotage and delay, there is now a Regulation before us which addresses public access to the EU institutions."
"This European Parliament has pressed for this to happen for years."
"Since 1979, I have been one of the MEPs who repeatedly put the need for public access on the agenda, even when I was allowed to sit on the European Council of Ministers."
"Indeed, public access is directly linked to the democratic content of an institution and guards a government body from underhand politics, nepotism and financial irregularities."
"When this proposal was submitted by the European Commission last year, it left a great deal to be desired."
"The French Council proposal, which appeared subsequently, was not acceptable either."
"In November, our Parliament tabled its proposal with a huge majority."
"Since then, intense negotiations have taken place among the three institutions."
"In this respect, Parliament was a great support for the Swedish Presidency."
"This coalition, which has, step-by-step, brought the Council and Commission closer to Parliament' s position, has proved to be very fruitful."
"The outcome was a considerably improved text in which Parliament' s key points were adopted."
"I would like to quote seven as these proved crucial to our positive stance vis-à-vis this compromise."
"Firstly, Article 4, the most important article, which articulates the limitations of public access, has been cut down to size and the limitations are tied down to conditions."
"A reason for secrecy should be given at all times, and there is an opportunity to appeal to the Ombudsman or the European court."
"In the case of huge public interest, documents are to be disclosed nevertheless."
"That was a key element for our Parliament."
"Secondly, the term ""document"" should be taken in a broad sense."
"Electronic mail also falls under this heading."
"Thirdly, a register will be introduced after all, in which all documents need to be included with attendant details and which must be published on the Internet."
"Fourthly, the Union' s agencies, such as the European Environment Bureau, the European Trade Mark Office and Europol, will fall within the remit of the Regulation."
"This will happen in the near future thanks to a new act which has now been promised."
"Fifthly, national legislation which goes beyond this Regulation - and this is a sensitive area for the country that I come from - should not be hindered by this Regulation."
"This is clearly stipulated in recital 16."
"I should like to see it explained accordingly."
"Sixthly, the rules which Mr Solana imposed last year in August without any consultation now fall under this Regulation and will also be verified against the same."
"The Netherlands has already noted that the appeal at the Court of Justice can then be withdrawn, and I believe that the European Parliament could follow suit."
"Finally, an annual report will be drafted, and the Commission will need to compile an evaluation report with proposals for improvement before 2004."
"Is this Regulation now perfect?"
"No, quite a few areas could be honed down further, such as the handling of documents of third parties, and the registration of secret documents, as well as a number of other issues."
"However, in our opinion, it is better to grant approval now and to tighten the rules in two years' time, should this prove useful and necessary."
"If we were to overhaul the Regulation now, we would end up in a long-term codecision procedure."
"Moreover, we are familiar with this procedure: the Council could put us out of action if the European Commission were not to lend us their support."
"I am not expecting the Commission to do this, but you never know."
"All that remains for me now is to express my thanks to my fellow MEPs who have helped us over the course of last year to achieve this result."
"I should first like to thank Mr Cashman."
"He has done a sterling job, but that is also true of Mr Watson, Mrs Hautala, Mrs Cederschiöld and of the other draftsmen of opinions."
"I would also like to thank Mrs Dean who, as Parliament official, has carried out much of the work on our behalf."
"I should also like to thank the Swedish Presidency, of course."
"I am convinced that, without the cooperation with the Swedish Presidency, we would not have achieved the result that is now before us, one that can withstand any criticism."
"Finally, we should be acutely aware of what is at issue: democracy, transparency and the rights of the citizens."
"That is the most important aspect, that is what this is all about, and this Regulation constitutes a step forward in this respect."
", draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. (FI) Mr President, in the debate on transparency it is worth stating right away that we are not starting from scratch, as rules on public access to information have been in force in the institutions of the European Union since around 1993."
"Therefore, the only true point of comparison is this: will we be improving the situation as it is now by means of these new rules?"
"We also have to take into account the fact that the Ombudsman and the Court of Justice have, over the years, been improving the rules in force on public access to documents and making them much more specific."
"For this thanks go to all those active NGOs and individuals that have refused to believe that the institutions can deny them access to certain documents, and that have sought to appeal against such negative decisions."
"When to this we add the fact that the Treaty of Amsterdam guarantees the right - in its broadest possible sense - to have access to documents of the Union institutions, we could say that the existing basic framework is quite demanding."
"With regard to the matter in hand, it is my opinion that the acceptance of this compromise raises certain questions."
"The European Parliament should have insisted on using its powers to repair the defects of this compromise."
"I will most probably be accused of being a fanatical transparency activist, but I refuse to accept this and I refute the charge. I simply want to describe to you now how I think Parliament should have bided its time and continued the debate."
"First of all, it is worth mentioning that these talks during the Swedish Presidency have been going on in camera."
"The European Parliament should really be very careful about when it becomes involved in an accelerated codecision procedure such as this, as it tends to forsake the issue of transparency to a considerable degree."
"Parliament has often been able to bring pressure on the Council of Ministers to make improvements to their proposals in accordance with its own objectives through various stages of the codecision procedure."
"With regard to restrictions on time, it is a fact that the institutions - including Parliament - wasted quite a lot of time, which could have been successfully spent in the successive stages of the codecision procedure, where Parliament often makes considerable gains towards the end."
"In this regard I have found that the Swedish Presidency has perhaps created a sort of Stockholm syndrome, and that Parliament' s negotiators maybe took the claim that only Sweden could bring this matter to a creditable conclusion too literally."
"I myself have no reason to doubt that Belgium, for example, would rate as well as anyone else in the transparency stakes, and that it is learning all the time to respect the issue more and more. I therefore believe we would easily have been able to continue."
"I would like to illustrate certain problems with this Regulation by showing you a small object."
"This is a Russian wooden doll."
"This one possibly has a rather ugly face: perhaps it should have a more beautiful one as we are talking about transparency."
"Let us imagine that this doll is the Regulation on transparency in question."
"When we open up the doll we find new dolls inside."
"This is just how these rules work. Inside the regulation on transparency there is also a sort of shadow regulation that the Council has managed to smuggle in, saying that there is a whole pile of documents labelled as 'sensitive' , which are covered by quite separate rules from those we have written into the paragraphs of the Article relating to transparency."
"When it is being said here that this Regulation on transparency repeals the so-called Solana Decision I can state that this is not the case at all, but in fact there are more new rules to be found in it, helping to ensure that the Solana Decision is incorporated in this Regulation in a new form."
"And, at the end, who do we find but Mr Solana himself!"
"This is thus a question of these sensitive documents making it possible for the Council of Ministers in particular to conceal a large number of documents."
"I think it a pity that the European Parliament did not challenge the Council of Ministers a little more forcefully on this issue."
"For that we would have required rather more time, rather more transparency and some measure of public debate."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the establishment of clear rules for public access to documents is absolutely essential, both in terms of the proper functioning of the Community institutions and also, as has just been mentioned, in order to reinforce the institutions' democratic legitimacy in the eyes of the European Union' s citizens."
"The Commission therefore believes that the draft regulation before us today is of particular importance and significance."
"Mrs Lejon, I would like to say how pleased I am to see that following many months of intensive work, the representatives of the three institutions have managed to draw up a text, which I believe is both clear and balanced, and which been approved by the Committee on Citizens' Freedom and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs of this Parliament, the Committee of Permanent Representatives of the Member States and the Commission itself."
"It is now the task of Parliament to deliver a completely independent opinion on the outcome of this work."
"At this point, Mr President, I would like to express my most sincere thanks to the rapporteurs, Mr Cashman and the co-rapporteurs, Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mrs Hautala, Mr Watson, the Chairman and the members of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms, for the work they have carried out over 15 or 16 months and for the receptive and tenacious attitude that they have shown."
"I would also like to praise the efforts of the Swedish Presidency, and you yourself, Mrs Lejon and your whole team, which has tried successfully to reconcile differing points of view, which, as we know only too well, is not always an easy task, and for having made the draft regulation compatible with the various administrative procedures in the Member States."
"As the rapporteurs stressed earlier, the draft regulation represents a major step forward compared to current practices and, as a result, it brings the Community system a step closer to the system used by the Member States that are the most advanced in the field of transparency."
"Naturally, ladies and gentlemen, the text is probably far from perfect."
"It is very likely that not everybody will be pleased with every aspect."
"I heard Mrs Hautala use a symbolic expression earlier, involving Russian dolls."
"Mrs Hautala, I do not think that you will find Mr Solana if you open all the boxes."
"In my view, Mr Solana' s standing and personality are of a much higher level and far more important than your description of them earlier."
"It is true, however, that once you have started to open the boxes or the Russian dolls, and you notice that there is something inside, it will then be difficult to stop yourself."
"To this extent, the picture that you painted is probably fair and symbolic, on this point in any case."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission believes that this text does indeed strike a fair balance between the specific characteristics of each institution and the practices within the Member States."
"In this respect, it does, in all sincerity, represent the best possible compromise."
"The Commission, therefore, officially accepts all the amendments tabled today by the rapporteurs and which were approved on 25 April 2001 by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms, chaired by Mr Watson."
"I hope that the European Parliament will also support the opinions and recommendations made by your rapporteurs, so that we can adopt this regulation and effectively implement it as soon as possible."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the nature of the documents created and held by each institution, as well as the volume of the documents processed, does indeed reflect their specific characteristics and their roles, which are both different and complementary."
"Out of the three institutions, the Commission is by far the one which handles the largest amount of documents. The nature of these documents varies greatly, due to its variety of tasks, ranging from initiating legislation to acting as Guardian of the Treaties and guarantor of Community law and to ensuring respect for Community law."
"The Commission is, therefore, perfectly aware of the fact that the main responsibility for implementing the regulation on public access to documents will fall on its shoulders."
"It is precisely because of this two-fold objective, which is, on the one hand, to ensure the public has the widest access to documents and, on the other hand, to ensure the respect of Community law, that the Commission has carefully considered which system to use with regard to the sensitive issue of infringement proceedings."
"The Commission wishes to state here in Parliament, and will also state to the Council, that, in a spirit of compromise and as proposed by the rapporteurs, Mr Cashman and Mrs Maij-Weggen in particular, the Commission can accept that infringement proceedings are not included in the derogations specified in the regulation, since it believes that this approach would not have an adverse effect on the fulfilment of its responsibilities in ensuring respect for Community law."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that, in implementing this regulation, we are doing the institutions and citizens of the European Union a good turn."
"I would like to assure you that the Commission is fully aware of the importance of this text and is committed to implementing it diligently and efficiently, not only because this is our duty, but because I am deeply convinced - and it is in this spirit that I myself worked alongside you and the Council Presidency from the moment Mr Prodi entrusted me with this task - that this text will considerably enhance the democratic legitimacy of the EU institutions."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen and all those who have participated in this process, the European Parliament is about to vote on the proposal for a Regulation concerning public access to documents of the EU institutions. The proposal was prepared jointly by Parliament, the Council and the Commission within the framework of what has been termed tripartite collaboration."
"This new Regulation is a step towards a more open and more democratic EU in as much as the work of the bureaucrats is to be subject to public scrutiny."
"The point of departure must be that all documents are to be accessible to the public."
"Obviously, there are exceptions to this main rule, just as there are from the Swedish principle of public access to official records, but the number of exceptions has been significantly reduced in comparison with the original proposal and is now limited to what is absolutely necessary to protect mainly military and security interests, commercial secrets and information about the private lives of individuals."
"Every document must be examined on its own merits, and a new examination must take place in response to each new enquiry from the public."
"A document may only be withheld if making it available would harm some aspect of the public interest."
"In previous proposals, it was enough that releasing a document might harm the public interest."
"To make things easier for the general public, there must be a register listing all documents, and both the register and the documents must, as far as possible, be available on the Internet."
"These are some aspects of the progress that has been achieved in the course of the tough negotiations of recent months."
"There are still critics of the compromise."
"They should consider that most EU countries do not have anything approaching the Swedish principle of public access to official records and that a number of these countries think that the issue is incomprehensible and its significance overrated."
"To vote against the proposal because 100 per cent of what was desired has not been achieved would be frivolous."
"Is it sensible to go hungry just because a three-course meal has not been offered?"
"The demand for the proposal to be overhauled before the European elections in 2004 is a prerequisite for public support."
"This will facilitate a subsequent improvement of the text in the event of political opposition, so that the electorate can influence the issue, partly by the way in which they vote."
"The result that has been achieved has been presented as a victory for the Swedish Presidency and, because transparency has been a key issue for the Swedish Government, it would have been a clear failure on the Government' s part if it had had to hand it as a gift to the forthcoming Presidency."
"I should nonetheless like to add something to that picture - not take the victory away from the Swedish Presidency, but nonetheless supplement the picture."
"The Prime Minister, Mr Persson is known for being a proponent of the intergovernmental model, on the basis of which citizens exercise little control."
"A theoretical, but relevant, issue in connection with the debate on transparency is that of how the result would have looked on the basis of Mr Persson' s intergovernmental model."
"How much control would the public have exercised then?"
"The Commission' s and the Council' s original proposal was completely unacceptable from the perspectives both of transparency and citizenship."
"The answer has been given: Parliament is the institution which has stood up for transparency and which it has been possible to use as a lever during the negotiations in the Council."
"Without Parliament' s hard fight for more transparency, and without the codecision procedure, no such commendable result would have been achieved."
"I want to conclude by extending heartfelt gratitude to Mr Cashman, Mrs Maij-Weggen, Mr Watson, Mrs Hautala and Mrs Malmström, as well as to Commissioner Barnier, who has made a major contribution in the Commission, and, finally, to the committee secretariat."
"Mr President, as shadow rapporteur, I should, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, first of all like to thank the rapporteurs for the high level of commitment they have shown in their bid to reach a compromise with the Council and Commission on the Regulation, which is informally referred to in the Netherlands as the ""Euro-WOB"" ."
"Given the huge resistance on the part of a number of Member States, it was clear from the outset that the negotiations would be tough."
"Needless to say, I, like many MEPs, including Mr Cashman and Mrs Maij-Weggen, would have liked to see more disclosure on a number of scores in the proposal, but to many Member States, that appeared to be a bridge too far."
"The compromise receives our unqualified support, as it represents in our eyes the result which is most viable."
"The agreement is a considerable improvement on the Commission proposal and on the existing regulations."
"For example, I was unable to consent to the far too extensive and exhaustive list of often vague reasons on the basis of which access to documents could be denied."
"But under heavy political pressure from both Parliament and a number of Member States, this list has been cut down considerably, with a ceiling put in place."
"It is also very satisfying to see that Mr Solana' s rules of last summer, by means of which entire categories of documents were excluded from public access by definition, are being rescinded by the new disclosure regime."
"It would also have been unacceptable to me if the European disclosure regime were to prejudice existing national legislation."
"Fortunately, that is not the case."
"Another bonus is that documents drafted in the preliminary phase of legislation and policy are now expressly made public."
"At the same time, I regret that as a result of the heavy resistance of a number of Member States, among others, certain points were not included in the compromise."
"For example, I would have preferred it if confidential documents originating from third parties, such as NATO, or a Member State, were to fall entirely within the scope of the European disclosure regime."
"Instead, permission from the third party involved is now required for this."
"Also, in my view, all documents should have been included in the public register, where now an exception is made for confidential documents."
"The European Parliament will need to closely monitor how the institutions involved will give substance to public access in their day-to-day practice."
"This is why I greatly value the annual report on the implementation of the disclosure regime."
"If in the evaluation in January 2004, it appears that the Regulation does not guarantee sufficient disclosure and that the percentage of sensitive documents is too high, then it is up to Parliament to do something about this."
"Finally, I should like to say to those MEPs who wish to vote against the compromise that they cannot adopt a clean-hands policy in that way."
"The implications of rejecting the current compromise would be that the European citizens would remain deprived of a clear, European disclosure regime for the time being."
"The Swedish Presidency, in tandem with a number of Member States as well as Parliament, has bent over backwards to reach a compromise before 1 May."
"It very much remains to be seen whether the next presidencies will deal with this issue with just as much drive, and there is also the risk that further negotiations will not have a beneficial, but rather a detrimental, effect on the Regulation."
"That is why this is the right time for me to adopt this compromise."
"Mr President, let there be no misunderstanding: the liberal group will be voting for the disclosure Regulation."
"If we compare the present situation with that of a year ago, we are definitely making progress."
"Last year, the European Commission had tabled a weak proposal, taking existing practice as a point of departure."
"That was not acceptable to us."
"Last summer, we also witnessed Mr Solana' s coup d' état, who, in one fell swoop, declared all documents under his remit to be secret."
"It is certainly thanks to Parliament' s persistent pressurising that there is now a better proposal before us, and I would like to congratulate both rapporteurs warmly on this."
"I am all the more pleased, because the liberal group has been closely involved in the negotiation process: firstly by tabling a number of amendments, also in the later stages, in order to keep the pressure on; secondly by supplying no less than three draftsmen of opinions and thirdly, as already mentioned, by the commitment of the liberal Committee Chairman, Mr Watson, in the final and deciding stage."
"Mr President, we will be voting for the Regulation, but I will not make a song and dance about it."
"It is a fact that the compromise proposal still contains weak areas, such as the grounds for exception, the documents of third parties in Article 4, the secret documents of Article 9, and I could mention a few more, but the improvements definitely outweigh the weaknesses."
"The proposal' s mainstay is disclosure, barring exceptions, and that is a huge step forward for the Brussels bureaucracy."
"In addition, we can identify a number of liberal touches in the compromise: the agencies in recital 8, the exceptions which do not apply in the event of a predominantly public interest in Article 4, the register of Article 9 and the annual report of each institution, listing refusals in Article 17."
"All in all, I am keeping it low-key. This is not a story with a happy ending, but we accept the compromise because the best is the enemy of the good."
"Whoever now votes against, now that a compromise has been reached with the Swedish Presidency, will be wasting an opportunity, for as Mr Van den Berg stated a moment ago, other presidencies will not be prepared to go that far."
"Mr President, tomorrow' s vote is not the end of the story, it is only the beginning."
"The European Commission' s evaluation in January 2004 will certainly need to lead to adjustments."
"The ELDR Group will make every effort to expose the weaknesses in the Regulation in the mean time, and to contribute to the improvement thereof."
"And our motto is: ""Secrecy shows up the weakness of bad government, disclosure reveals the strength of sound government"" ."
"Mr President, in the thick of euphoria, people who vote against the Regulation are immediately accused of adopting a clean-hands policy or eloping into fantasy, but my group has fundamental objections to a number of aspects in this proposal, and I refuse to sweep them under the carpet."
"My group, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, accepts that there are exceptions to disclosure."
"For example, a European defence policy could yield certain operational information which does not belong on the streets."
"But all documents must be recorded in the register, and it must be possible to test exceptions against strict criteria, in the last instance by the Court of Justice."
"That may be the procedure for normal documents, but unfortunately, special treatment has been agreed upon for potentially too large a group of special, sensitive documents, and I hear very little about this."
"The documents which are rubberstamped as ""sensitive"" are identified by a select group of officials within the institutions themselves."
"It is not necessary to include sensitive documents in the register, and the Court of Justice cannot verify whether this decision is justified."
"Should a clever citizen find out that the document exists after all, the same officials will decide on the application."
"And to cap it all, with regard to documents which do contribute to the decision-making process of European policy but which originate from outside, the author has a veto regarding both the inclusion in the register and the disclosure of the document."
"The Court too has to accept this veto."
"Sensitive documents constitute a black hole in this agreement on disclosure of information, and the right to information simply becomes an act of goodwill."
"Mr President, there is quite a gap between the euphoria expressed by some today and the view expressed by others, to the effect that this is a compromise balanced on a knife edge."
"If any way of characterising this result is to be found, then this is probably the most honest."
"The process concerning transparency and public access to documents has, of course, been conducted for a long time behind hermetically sealed doors."
"This is in itself a major problem because, in tackling such an essential area as public access to, and scrutiny of, documents - which is fundamental to our having democratically active citizens able to influence the decision-making process - it is crucial to involve people, partly in the debate as to how the rules are to be designed, and perhaps, in addition, to go so far as to listen to some of people' s objections."
"I think we have a result which, in some respects, can be lived with, which in other respects is good but which, on a number of points, is unfortunately a retrograde step in relation to the current situation which is, of course, the result partly of a number of rules, partly of the practice of the courts and partly of intervention by the ombudsman."
"One of the areas in which, in my view, there is a major problem is that of internal documents which are not clearly defined in this proposal and which can be kept secret if it is thought that publication will have a decisive influence on the decision-making process."
"All right, but is that not precisely what transparency is all about - enabling people to have a decisive influence on the decision-making process?"
"I think it is a problem that Member States can demand that documents be classified and, in addition, decline to register them at all, without there being clear rules as to when and why the Solana documents, as they are called, are not generally exempt, but that the rules governing what may be exempt are so loose as to be largely meaningless."
"There is, of course, no doubt about the fact that these rules will be of decisive importance to the rules in all member States, but large parts of the rapporteurs' presentation have been vague and it has been very difficult to get clear information about the whys and wherefores."
"I doubt if there is a single document that cannot be accessed under the current rules but which it will be possible to access under the rules now being discussed."
"I doubt if it will be possible to extract so much as one more document from the EU system than it is possible to extract today."
"I think the European Parliament has played a difficult role in this, and I think it is also transparently obvious that the European Parliament' s own interests have, from time to time, unfortunately overshadowed the public' s interests."
"By far the best thing about this proposal is that we nonetheless have a chance to look at the rules again in 2004, and I think we have some detailed and substantial work to do before then."
"Public access to documents is, of course, the very stuff of democracy."
"Control, public scrutiny and democracy are different sides of the same issue and, against that background, I essentially agree with the criticism forwarded to all my fellow MEPs from five distinctive organisations."
"The conclusion is that this proposal is really worse than nothing."
"Many aspects of the rules concerning sensitive documents are absurd, and administering these exceptions is a bit like selling elastic by the metre, as a Danish humorist once put it. It in any case requires a firm character and a significantly more democratic turn of mind and basic attitude than that which the Commission and the other institutions of the EU are used to exhibiting."
"Article 5 undoubtedly involves a deterioration in the current rules governing public access to, and scrutiny of, public documents as practised, for example, in the Scandinavian countries."
"Moreover, there is another thing which really surprises me, in addition to my fellow MEPs failure to understand the reality of the situation and to the praise forthcoming from the large political groups."
"It is a source of surprise that not one person has raised the question of whether what has taken place is in accordance with the Treaty."
"These negotiations have taken place in the strictest confidence, with all the small groups excluded."
"The negotiations have been conducted by my fellow MEPs, Mr Cashman and Mrs Maij-Weggen, and by the brilliant chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, Mr Watson, from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party."
"The major groups have gone through this process without the rest of us being involved at all in these negotiations."
"All we can do is vote for or against."
"This, I would point out, contravenes the basic rules of the Treaty which presuppose that there are three independent institutions which play their part. There are also rules relating to the conciliation procedure and so on, which ensure that the small groups are heard."
"What we are concerned with here, moreover, is a matter concerning public access to documents. It is quite simply a farce in terms of democracy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to congratulate the Swedish Presidency and the rapporteur on their initiative."
"It seems to me that transparency quite rightly has a special place in the Nordic legal world, and transparency should also occupy a special place in the institutions of the European Union."
"I hope that we will go further than this expression of intent, this declaration, and that in future unlimited access to documents will be guaranteed."
"Democracy and the need to bring the Union closer to its citizens are always associated with the transparency of political decision making."
"It is not just the European public that has in the past complained - quite rightly in my view - about making policy behind closed doors."
"I too would have preferred a more far-reaching compromise."
"However, I think that for the time being we must be satisfied with what has been achieved."
"As the representative of the European public, Parliament has a duty to ensure that this regulation is strictly adhered to."
"In one or two years' time we will be able to review whether this regulation has really been a success."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at the beginning of the negotiations on the proposal for a regulation on public access to documents of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, the Committee on Budgets considered an opinion on this which I myself drafted."
"I would like to reiterate the basic principles of that opinion, which are still valid today."
"We highlighted three main points, the first of these being transparency and openness, which are a fundamental requirement for any system of democratic control."
"These principles require an administration to be legitimate, efficient, responsible and meaningful for the public."
"Furthermore, they provide protection against arbitrary actions and the abuse of power."
"In addition, they contribute to the exposure, punishment and prevention of irregularities and fraud, phenomena that the Commission in particular has been very much subject to in the past."
"The second main point is the statement that documents produced by the institutions should be made public as a matter of principle."
"Any necessary exceptions to this principle should be justified."
"This has now been firmly established."
"Furthermore, I believed at that time that it was not appropriate to draw up an extensive catalogue listing existing legal provisions, which would only lead to doubts and disputes."
"The third main point is the public's desire for their rights to be respected in practice by guaranteeing the existence of an accessible registry, as is being requested now, and also, by means of the Internet, to respond swiftly to requests for documents and to justify any refusal of such a request, and last but not least to use the language of the applicant."
"I would also like to see a coordinating body facilitating all this."
"We shall see how this works in practice."
"I am pleased to see that the basic requirements have been established, even if not in full as yet."
"That can be covered in the revised version."
"I also believe that the framework agreement should be revised to bring it in line with the requests we have made about openness and relations between the institutions."
"Mr President, I want to begin by thanking both rapporteurs, and I also want to thank the Commission, the Presidency and the Council for the constructive work they have done."
"The first question one might ask oneself is whether, in Parliament' s view, this is the best proposal that can be achieved."
"The answer is no."
"There are details in this document about which we have reservations and which we could wish were better."
"That applies, for example, to the issues surrounding documents of a sensitive nature."
"Reservations might also be entertained about the way in which the process has been conducted and about the fact that it has sometimes been conducted behind closed doors, as has been the case, on the whole, where the conciliation procedure is concerned."
"Even though discussions have taken place, the procedure is not especially open."
"The second question we must ask ourselves is whether this proposal constitutes progress, or even considerable progress, in relation to the situation we have at present."
"My answer is an unqualified yes."
"It constitutes substantial progress in relation to the present situation."
"I really cannot understand those who say that it is a retrograde step."
"Is it not progress that all incoming documents are now to be made public, as is not of course the case at present?"
"Is it not progress that, in principle, all documents will have to be registered in a way that they are not at present?"
"Is it not progress that the secrecy rules which we have, which we recognise must exist and which exist in all those countries which have made the most progress of all in this area, are relatively few in number and, moreover, quite out in the open?"
"The answer is an unqualified yes."
"Furthermore, an individual requiring access to a document will only have to wait for a short period of time while the matter is administered."
"Documents must be more readily available on the Internet, and the administration period must be a maximum of fifteen days, meaning that the process is relatively quick."
"If the individual is not satisfied with the result, there must be a right to appeal and have the decision reviewed."
"That, if anything, surely constitutes progress."
"Moreover, the national rules must apply in those countries which have better legislation than that now being proposed."
"The proposal is not, therefore, a retrograde step for those countries which have more open legislation."
"All this does constitute substantial progress."
"It would therefore seem very odd if this Parliament were to vote against a proposal just because it does not go the whole hog, for we are nearly there and have the opportunity to carry out an annual audit."
"Moreover, a review will take place in a few years' time."
"It is quite clear that we in Parliament must vote in favour of this proposal."
"People want the institutions to be more open."
"This proposal constitutes a clear improvement when it comes to transparency and, in addition, to democratic administration within the EU."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs, Mr Cashman and Mrs Maij-Weggen without whose drive, determination and doggedness, this would not have been possible."
"I would like too to thank the rapporteurs of other committees for their considerable contribution."
"If the House approves this tomorrow, credit will be due to all of those, including Mrs Hautala, who helped in the process."
"This proposed new regulation is an important milestone on the road to abolishing unnecessary secrecy in government."
"Other speakers have outlined its direct benefits to the citizen, but to me tomorrow's vote must mark the beginning of a change in the culture of the European institutions from secrecy to openness."
"Many of us would have liked wider rights and fewer exceptions."
"Some argued that delay would give us a better deal, but the overwhelming majority on my committee decided not to make the best the enemy of the good, believing that this proposed regulation gives us a framework for progress."
"The European Parliament must now be vigilant in making sure the law is put into practice."
"Some external critics have attacked us for not insisting on the naked civil servant."
"These proposals allow public officials a fig-leaf, but little more."
"I would like to thank the Presidency-in-Office, in particular, Ambassador Lund, for their willingness to grapple with this issue, to respect the deadline set by the treaties and to build a majority in Council."
"It is fitting that freedom of information legislation should be adopted under the presidency of a Member State which has long standing rights for citizens in this area, thanks to the farsightedness of an eminent former legislator, Mr Chydenius."
"Commissioner Barnier deserves the gratitude of the House for his work in the Commission."
"In conclusion, it is said that only three legislatures in the world make their decisions entirely behind closed doors: one is in Havana, one is in Pyongyang, and the third is the Council of Ministers in Brussels."
"We may not have broken down the doors, we may not have allowed in the TV cameras as the Swedish government once wanted, but we will shine the searchlight of public opinion into the darker corners of decision-making, in the Council, in the Commission and here in our own House."
"Mr President, it should be a day for rejoicing when the European Parliament votes on EU rules on transparency and access to documents, but there are also too many flies in the ointment."
"The reason for this lies in the wording concerning documents of a sensitive nature. This makes it possible in future to classify not only sensitive military documents as secret, but also more general documents concerning security and perhaps other policy areas too."
"The wording concerning sensitive documents is too general and too vague."
"When, subsequently, it is a matter of which documents are to be classified as secret in a Member State such as Sweden, is it not the Commission which will in future decide this?"
"In that case, it is a substantial infringement of the Swedish constitution."
"What is more, I agree with what has been said about the procedure itself, namely that it is extremely difficult to understand how, as part of an informal process I would characterise as very dubious, the negotiations concerning such a sensitive and important subject could have taken place between the committee, the Council and the Commission but not been subject to scrutiny by ordinary Members of Parliament and the general public."
"Mr President, transparency and the right to study the contents of documents are central elements of a living democracy, but the proposal on which we are now to adopt a position and which concerns access to EU documents is a disappointment."
"In some areas, it is downright worse than the EU' s existing practice."
"Moreover, the very negotiations concerning the proposal have been a display of lack of transparency."
"The normal parliamentary process has been set aside, and significant parts of Parliament, including our group, have been excluded from influence."
"Respect for national rules on transparency is not guaranteed by the proposal."
"National rules are subordinate to an EU Regulation."
"Paragraph 14 of this Regulation also specifies that the Member States must be loyal to the contents of the Regulation."
"Furthermore, Article 5 states that, in cases which are not clear, Member States must ask the EU' s institutions for guidance in order to decide if EU documents are to be handed over."
"Nor is it the case that the Swedish principle of public access to official records is guaranteed by this proposal."
"On the contrary, it is the EU' s Court of Justice which has the power to decide in the event of conflicts arising in this area."
"There are extensive and partially unclear exemptions from the rules concerning access to documents."
"Whole areas such as security policy, internal documents and documents from the Member States are exempt in practice."
"What are called 'sensitive documents' do not even need to be shown in the registers."
"These exemptions substantially undermine the improvements made by the proposal, for example the demands for registers, time limits and access to electronic documents."
"The European Parliament' s access to classified documents has also been dealt with in these negotiations, at the same time as the public' s right of access to documents."
"It is an unfortunate confusion of different issues which ought not to have happened."
"I cannot see how the advantages of this proposal significantly outweigh the disadvantages."
"This is not the time to conclude this work, for it is not complete."
"The conciliation ought to continue as normal."
"Mr President, I cannot support the new rules concerning transparency because they impose a common limit upon transparency and open the way to directly retrograde steps."
"Documents which are at present in the public domain may be classified tomorrow."
"Documents which may at present be made available in Copenhagen or Stockholm may tomorrow be classified throughout the EU."
"At present, we in practice operate with common minimum rules governing transparency."
"It is possible for those countries that wish to do so to go further."
"The EU Regulation makes the rules the same in every country."
"That is good for consistency but bad for transparency."
"The Member States will now be obliged to conform to the common rules and consult the EU authorities before they make documents available."
"We are now to be given common maximum rules on transparency."
"Just look at recitals 9a and 12, which exclude better national legislation, and Article 4a of the Regulation in which the Member States are obliged to consult the EU."
"See also recital 5a concerning the actual decision-making process, recital 7 concerning countries' right to classify documents, recital 9 concerning personal information which, for example, makes it more difficult to know who sits on the 1 500 committees, and Article 6a, Paragraph 3 which excludes sensitive information from the registers."
"See the text on euobserver.com, if you do not have it in your briefcases."
"Transparency and the new ceiling are accompanied by a new procedure in which three opponents of transparency such as France, Spain and Germany are able to block progress on transparency, even if the whole of the European Parliament and twelve national parliaments are in agreement concerning a little more transparency."
"At present, progress can be made by means of pressure from the ombudsman, decisions by the Court of Justice or a simple majority in the Council of Ministers, that is to say eight out of fifteen countries."
"From tomorrow, any progress will require 62 out of 87 votes in the Council, and the Court of Justice and the countries in favour of transparency will not be able to help us obtain clear rules in the Regulation."
"It would be in the greater interests of transparency if we were to defer the decision today and see how the Council and the Commission are to interpret the new rules."
"The various forms of progress have, of course, been decided upon ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, many of us have recently had difficult personal experiences of how hard it is to obtain certain documents."
"That needs to be stressed here today."
"However, I shall be pleased if this regulation means we can ensure that not just Members of the European Parliament, but all citizens of the European Union are given real access to all documents."
"I hope at least that we as Members will derive some benefit from this."
"If the transparency called for in this regulation actually becomes a principle of the institutions of the European Union, then we will have taken a great step forward."
"If there are now to be some exceptions to this, then I regard that as positive."
"It is positive that there are only a few exceptions, but it is also positive that these few exceptions exist."
"I say that because the few exceptions exist for reasons of security and in order to protect the right to privacy."
"That is important in this context, because it means we have achieved something - we have managed to strike a balance between total openness and transparency on the one hand and the security interests of the Union and its citizens and protection of the right to privacy on the other."
"Anyone who is against secrecy being observed in these few exceptional cases has to be against the security interests of the European Union and also against protection of the right to privacy."
"So we should maintain this balance here and certainly not abandon it."
"As I see it, what has not yet been decided is how the register will subsequently be designed and how the actual process of access will be arranged."
"One wise fellow Member mentioned in today's debate that there are two ways of treating people as stupid - one is to withhold information from them, which, thank goodness, has now been overcome, and the other is to flood them with unstructured information."
"Both of these are bad and we do not want either."
"That is why we are calling for the setting up of a structured register which is easy to understand and which also takes into account the need for genuine transparency."
"In conclusion, I hope that this regulation will actually lead to a new approach in the institutions of the European Union, so that it is not just a question of committing words to paper without overcoming the existing difficulties that we are all aware of."
"There must be a genuine guarantee that there will be a review after a relatively short time."
"We need a review in 2004 to highlight any shortcomings in what appears to be a very positive system, and, should it be necessary, to take further steps to ensure that the principle to which we are pledging ourselves - the transparency of the institutions of the European Union - really is thoroughly implemented."
"I would like to congratulate everyone who has worked on this report and been involved in this outcome."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to know what is going on, please."
"You talk about a crowning achievement, a historical decision, a milestone."
"It reminds me of Faust - Gretchen would have liked to record this day."
"State Watch, which is what this is about, the European Federation of Journalists, and so on say that rather than enshrining the rights of citizens, it undermines what we have been discussing today and will be voting on."
"It says that the current code enshrines the rights of Member States, albeit in different form."
"If I interpret this, it reminds me of Goethe, of Faust, again: ""I hear the message well, but I have little faith."""
"Maybe an attempt is being made to find a compromise position, perhaps today is not such a historical day."
"But receiving the EU's proposal here is rather like getting to see a new car."
"""Now you can have a look!"" they tell us."
"We certainly will."
"It is not long since the European transparency initiative was launched, an initiative taken so as to provide as many of Europe's citizens as possible with access to as many documents as possible, including those relating to Council meetings."
"Will we now get to see what documents really exist and which ones are sensitive?"
"What does sensitivity mean?"
"We are all very sensitive."
"How will you interpret sensitivity?"
"Will you tell us that we can look at the car, but the motor is sensitive, the seat is sensitive and the steering wheel is sensitive?"
"Or will we get there and see the whole car?"
"I believe that there is room for optimism when you look at the example of the United States."
"It took decades until the Freedom of Information Act was passed, and even they started off by just having a first look at the car."
"But I hope that the Presidency and their successors will not come to us in future and complain about money, and say that it is too expensive if we ask for detailed information."
"There is money available for that."
"In the USA, the Freedom of Information Act costs USD 40 million every year."
"The bill for the American Government's public relations is USD 1.5 billion."
"I share the opinion of our rapporteur, Mr Cashman, who is to be congratulated. He says that this is something that will develop by itself."
"We are relying on it developing by itself up to 2004."
"I believe that we should not be holier-than-thou about this, but that we should make a start here in this House when it comes to transparency."
"Mr President, when the present Commission took office in the autumn of 1999, all the Commissioners promised that it would be a case of turning over a new leaf."
"In future, the work would be driven by transparency and public scrutiny, and the mistakes of the Santer Commission would not be repeated."
"A very great deal of the general debate in 1999 was about transparency and public scrutiny."
"Quite a few of us voted for making the EU more open."
"Openness and public access to official records are necessary elements of a democratic and efficient administration, and if people can follow the decision-making process in the EU' s machinery, then there will also be an increase in confidence."
"We also know that there is a crystal-clear connection between a high level of transparency and a low level of corruption in an administration."
"The Regulation we are voting on tomorrow is a compromise between Parliament and countries in the Council of Ministers which are sympathetic towards transparency."
"It is a step forwards in many ways."
"It provides the people of Europe with unifying legislation concerning the way in which they are to obtain access to documents."
"It lays down important principles, a fact which quite a few of my fellow MEPs have touched upon."
"However, we Liberals are also sorry to see that it is deficient in a great many ways."
"It contains a rather ambiguous clause concerning what are called sensitive documents that are to be dealt with under a separate system."
"This is an unfortunate rule which may be interpreted arbitrarily."
"What is more, there is a certain lack of clarity as to how the Regulation would apply in relation to national law if conflicts were to arise."
"In some Member States, including Sweden and the Netherlands, there are more far-reaching rules governing access to documents."
"In Sweden, the tradition of transparency goes back to my fellow Liberal Party member, Anders Chydenius in 1766."
"What happens if a document is secret in Brussels but in the public domain in Stockholm?"
"The Government and Swedish Prime Minister have said that, in a case like that, Swedish law applies, but can that be relied upon?"
"The Presidency bears considerable responsibility, namely to ensure both that Dutch legislation and, above all, the Swedish Constitution are not undermined and that no self-censorship is practised by Swedish authorities either."
"There is, of course, an obvious fear in the Commission and certain Member States that people will be given too much information."
"Those of us who believe in transparency must constantly fight to demonstrate that the opposite is the case."
"Public scrutiny is not dangerous. Rather, it is democratic and efficient."
"The Liberal Group views this Regulation as a compromise involving a certain amount of progress but also containing certain shortcomings."
"We shall vote in favour of it tomorrow as a first step on the long journey ahead of us in terms of opening the institutions of the EU up to the people."
"Further efforts are required in this regard, and we shall test the limits of the legislation."
"We shall also take the lead in establishing still better rules in a couple of years' time for, in spite of everything, transparency has the future on its side."
"Mr President, when the tsars were in power in Russia the country had a common legal system."
"The monarchy did not govern the country by laws, however, but by exceptions to them."
"The principle which prevailed in tsarist Russia now holds true for the system of public access to European Union documents."
"The documents are publicly available, but their secrecy is assured by derogations."
"The documents pertaining to the common foreign and security policy are better kept secrets in the EU than Freemasons' rituals, and the Worshipful Master of the EU Lodge is NATO."
"It has a monopoly over EU documents but has no connection with democracy."
"A culture of secrecy has been built into the EU, one that Parliament also helps to support."
"Last summer, a majority in Parliament approved a framework agreement with the Commission on the subject of public access to documents, one that places the various Members of the European Parliament in unequal positions."
"As a result, more than twenty Members brought an action against Parliament and the Commission for infringement of basic provisions in the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg."
"I wish to express my regrets to my Swedish fellow Members, but this wretched compromise has to be rejected."
"Mr President, we have managed to complete a compromise text on which the Council, Commission and negotiators of Parliament agreed just within the time limit."
"It is encouraging to see that Parliament is managing to leave its mark on an increasing number of negotiation procedures of this kind."
"But I am not thrilled with the end result."
"The procedures are not particularly wonderful."
"I do not welcome the secret negotiations, as a result of which the small groups and interest groupings have hardly been able to play a role at all."
"We are now being confronted with a text whose adagio is in fact ""like it or lump it"" ."
"We are having to 'like' a great deal in terms of content, especially the classification of confidential documents represents quite a big step backwards for Parliament."
"Many phrases are so vague that they could be interpreted in any which way in practice."
"For example, the claim by the rapporteurs that the national disclosure regulations have been safeguarded springs to mind."
"If that is the case, why has a section dedicated solely to this subject been deleted from the text of the Regulation?"
"On the other hand, it was too much to expect that a regulation on access to documents, with which only a few Member States were familiar, could be made applicable in its entirety to the whole Union."
"The southern Member States do not have such regulations, so we cannot blame them for showing signs of cold feet."
"It is utopian to believe that we will always reach the ideal policy at European level."
"The range of opinions on the desired transparency is unfortunately too wide for that to happen."
"At European level too, we increasingly notice that certain limits are reached in the Member States."
"The most achievable result is then a compromise which, in fact, satisfies nobody."
"This is a reality which we must accept."
"In the European Union, we must accept the Member States' own backgrounds and cultures, even if this does not always suit us."
"Firstly, I offer my congratulations to the rapporteur Michael Cashman, his co-rapporteurs, the whole of the Civil Liberties Committee and the Swedish Presidency, who have been so vital in getting us to where we are today."
"Let me be clear."
"This report does not go as far as I would like."
"For that matter, it does not go as far as some of the pioneers in this area, in some of the NGOs, would like, like Tony Bunyan of Statewatch."
"It does not go as far as I hoped, but it does go further than I expected, as Parliament and the Swedish Presidency dragged the Commission and Council far closer to our position than they ever expected to be."
"To accept what is offered here is to take a window of opportunity that is not guaranteed to remain open indefinitely."
"We recognise that some documents should and must remain confidential and classified, but what must not happen is that legitimate reasons of security, public safety and public protection are used to hide the merely embarrassing and misjudged."
"We welcome in particular the annual report that will detail the number of documents not listed from each institution, which will hopefully stop institutional creep from taking place, as year after year they add further and further categories of documents that will remain secret."
"We welcome the assumption of access and hope it proves just that."
"These processes will increase transparency, improve accountability and give citizens rights to access documents."
"It does not give us freedom of information, but merely freer information."
"The latter, however, is a goal well worth achieving."
"The annual reports and the promised follow-up report in January 2004 may well prove that this report, this agreement, is not the beginning of the end but the end of the beginning."
"As my friend Hans-Peter Martin said, it took decades for the Freedom of Information Act to become law."
"Nevertheless, it is a political pleasure to be here."
"Mr President, Minister, when all is said and done, it is a question of the meaning of words and of our really intending what is stated in Article 4 of the Regulation, namely that access to a document currently being dealt with will only be refused if such access would significantly undermine certain interests."
"The aim is, in fact, to achieve transparency, and we are striving to make this transparency as fully effective as possible."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is about our believing in the words we write."
"I would call upon everyone who has contributed to the decision to ensure that the words are given their intended meaning."
"Otherwise, people will become even more mistrustful."
"We have achieved a compromise and made certain gains."
"I am extremely pleased that we have succeeded in introducing more good administrative procedures for the handling of documents than I had believed we would."
"It is also important that the exceptions are more limited than those proposed by the Commission."
"It is interesting to see what was dispensed with."
"What was also interesting was today' s statement from Commissioner Barnier to the effect that the infringement proceedings must be public, which means that we are entering a new era in the European Union."
"Citizens will be able to monitor the Commission' s activity in a completely new way."
"Many images have been used today."
"I agree with Mr Watson - without whom we should not have come so far - that we have obtained a powerful searchlight to use on documents, instead of the pocket torch we had previously."
"We have acquired a powerful tool."
"The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party will use that tool in the way cited by my colleagues and, in this, we are counting upon the help of the ombudsman."
"There are shortcomings, but they are not as serious as our opponents maintain."
"We must respect the meaning of the words."
"We must also make sure that the Commission stops misusing the protection of personal data, something which has recently happened again."
"It is now a question of going further, beyond what emerges from the reports about what has happened."
"It is about freedom of expression for employees and about ensuring that future discussion of the EU deals with transparency in a broader perspective, for transparency must apply to all the institutions and involve more than making documents publicly available."
"Mr President, Parliament is taking an important step today on the road towards the greater transparency which we have been talking about for so many years."
"The new rules are a stage in the cultural revolution that is needed if the EU is to develop into a modern, efficient and democratic form of cooperation which citizens in fact have confidence in."
"What we have here are marked improvements."
"As a starting point, all documents, including internal documents, are included, and they must be registered."
"The exceptions to this rule are few but well-founded, and the rules governing the lodging of complaints have been tightened up on."
"Many here today have criticised the present compromise, and in the case of a compromise there will always be something to criticise. This must not, however, overshadow the fact that this is a good compromise in which the EU is setting a standard for transparency unknown in many of the EU' s Member States."
"Transparency does not come about through legislation alone, however."
"It also depends upon a culture of transparency."
"Transparency ought not to be perceived as an inconvenience for the administration."
"Transparency is an advantage, not only for democracy but also for the authorities to which it extends."
"Today, I want to call upon the Commission to take the spirit of this proposal seriously, not only the wording of the Regulation but also the recitals."
"The Commission should forget the lack of public access that characterised its first proposal and straightforwardly adopt the new proposal and the new spirit."
"The Commission has a big responsibility for ensuring that those who at present maintain that the new rules are no better than the existing rules are proved wrong."
"In three years' time, practical experience must constitute a sufficient argument, and this is what we shall spend the next three years acquiring."
"We must see how the new rules work."
"We must make sure that countries which are sceptical come to see for themselves that transparency is beneficial to democracy."
"Mr President, first of all, I want to congratulate Mr Cashman, Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mr Watson."
"When a conciliation is entered into, not everything that may be wished for is obtained. Such is life."
"The proposed compromise is assessed and a judgement arrived at as to whether, despite its shortcomings, it is better than nothing. A decision for or against is then made."
"That is because there are no other possibilities when no further progress can be made at the negotiating table."
"The compromise reached in the negotiations concerning public access to EU documents is in no way what I would have wished for at the start of the negotiations, and it contains weaknesses, as has already been pointed out."
"For example, there are too many exceptions and too much uncertainty concerning the exceptions that are to apply."
"However, it is the first step in the right direction, and it means that, in a few years' time, we can take the next step. Above all, it reflects the EU' s desire for greater transparency."
"I can well understand why the compromise has been called a victory for the willingness to negotiate."
"The Commission' s proposal was far from what we in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party had looked forward to and far from what we in the Nordic countries might have wished for."
"We in the Nordic countries have good traditions of administrative transparency and, naturally enough, we took these as our point of departure."
"Over and against us, there was a long list of countries which do not have the same traditions, countries in which public access to official documents is scarcely known, countries in which there is no legislation in this area at all."
"In other words, our points of view were worlds apart."
"We Danes have a special love-hate relationship with our Swedish neighbours."
"We often find them self-satisfied and overly correct, but as a rule we are, of course, just envious."
"When it comes to administrative transparency, every country, including Denmark, has a lot to learn from the Swedes. We therefore have fewer reservations about voting in favour of the compromise when we see that Swedish colleagues in our group, together with the Swedish Presidency, are able to recommend a vote in favour."
"We shall carefully monitor the implementation of the result that has now been achieved."
"Mr President, as I had half a minute left over from my previous speaking time, which I usually do not use up, I would like to use that time to make a few observations."
"Mrs Kessler might want to do the same at the end."
"I must say that I was greatly perturbed by Mrs Frahm' s intervention, because she claimed that the proposals represent quite a step backwards, and that is simply not true."
"Maybe we need to have a one-to-one on this, but I think that you cannot make a claim about this proposal which simply bears no relation to reality."
"I do believe that we must be extremely careful that the small delegations do not feel excluded."
"All rapporteurs were from the largest and larger delegations, and we might need to consider how we could also involve the smaller delegations in those activities more in future."
"Finally, I must say that, in my opinion, Mrs Hautala' s example of those Russian dolls was not all that appropriate."
"If there is one country which is currently showing how to ruin disclosure, then it is surely Russia with the media campaigns which are taking place there at the moment."
"Mr President, my last observation relates to the fact that the debates show up the cultural differences."
"Hardly any representatives from southern European countries have spoken."
"You are southern European, and Mr Barnier is French, but that was it."
"Let us hope that this debate also strikes home with our southern European MEPs, for those countries might need public transparency more than anyone else."
"The President is not authorised to reply to the allusion as to whether or not there are Members from the South present."
"I rise because a damaging accusation was made that somehow we have violated the treaties by excluding smaller groups from discussions and negotiations and it is extremely important to correct this."
"The debate and vote on the first draft report was held on 16 November 2000."
"The rapporteurs were given a clear mandate by Parliament for discussion with the Council."
"The European Parliament's Conference of Presidents also gave their clear political support."
"The mandate given under Rule 69 of the Rules of Procedure was, and I quote, ""to table amendments seeking to reach a compromise"", in order to adopt the Regulation in a single reading and within the date set in the Treaty to implement Article 255."
"The series of trialogue meetings, discussions between the Council, the Commission and Parliament, took place from January to March 2001."
"All, and I repeat all, the various versions of the compromise amendments were discussed in the LIBE Committee and following the trialogue meetings."
"The process has been considerably more transparent than the conciliation process and these compromise amendments were agreed on 25 April in the LIBE Committee."
"At no time has any group, or any individual, been prevented from putting down amendments to put their influence into the procedure."
"Things move on."
"This Union has moved on."
"Post Nice, we have a security policy."
"It is right that we operate properly and responsibly."
"Thank you very much, Mr Cashman."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"Welcome"
"On the occasion of the debate that is about to take place, it is my honour to welcome the presence in the diplomatic gallery of an important delegation from the National Assembly of the FYROM, made up of Mr Tomislav Stojanovski and Mr Iljaz Halimi, Vice-Presidents of the National Assembly, Mr Slobodan Kosev, President of the inter-parliamentary delegation with our Parliament and Mr Nano Ruzin, member of the National Assembly."
"Allow me to remind you that Mr Stojan Andov, President of the National Assembly, travelled to Strasbourg during our March part-session in order to inform the Conference of Presidents about the situation in Macedonia, and that in Strasbourg we are going to receive Mr Boris Trajkovski, President of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, in Parliament on Wednesday 13 June 2001."
"EU/FYROM Agreement"
"The next item is the debate on the recommendation (A5-0132/2001) by Mr Swoboda, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council and Commission decision on the conclusion of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, of the other part."
". (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, particularly those of you from the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, tomorrow's decision on the first Stabilisation and Association Agreement with a Balkan country is also a big step for the European Parliament towards integrating the Balkan region into the European Union, especially as regards Macedonia's membership."
"It is not by chance that Macedonia is the first country we are signing an agreement of this kind with."
"Ever since it was created, this country has been extremely cooperative and constructive towards its neighbours and consequently also towards the European Union."
"All governments have endeavoured to give minorities, especially the large Albanian minority, a share of social and political power."
"This has certainly not happened without various debates and problems."
"Furthermore, the international community, including this Parliament, have helped to meet some of the compelling needs of the Albanian population, particularly in the area of higher education, not least by establishing the University of Tetovo."
"However, I can understand that the Albanian population in Macedonia does not think that this sequence of events is enough."
"But what I cannot understand and will not accept - and what none of us should accept - is that extremists and terrorists should use those aspirations that have not yet been met as an excuse for attacks and for murder."
"We must resolutely condemn these methods of achieving political objectives, which are totally inappropriate in a democracy."
"In a democracy, no one should bring bombs and murder to the negotiating table."
"Violence and terror tactics should not be rewarded."
"It is, of course, necessary to build on what those in positions of political power, and not least the current government and President, have achieved since Macedonia's independence in terms of integrating minorities, by taking further steps so as not to jeopardise the internal stability of this country."
"The Albanian minority is certainly a special case because of its size, but this should not result in further discrimination against smaller minorities."
"Greater recognition of the Albanian language and a gradual but qualitatively justifiable and comprehensible increase in the share of teachers, judges, police officers and administrative officials is certainly called for."
"Some of the provisions of the constitution have also been called into doubt."
"I do not want to give any advice here as to whether and how the constitution should be amended."
"But after all the positive and negative experience with emphasising the ethnic question, the inalienable individual and personal rights of every person, that is of every single citizen of Macedonia, should be the top priority, with special arrangements for ethnic reasons being accorded a lower priority."
"As I see it, we in the European Union should not be promoting or supporting any division of this society along ethnic lines."
"A newly shaped and improved relationship between the Slavic Macedonian majority and the Albanian minority is dependent on a greater desire for tolerance and acceptance on both sides, and also on integration and solidarity."
"I say this because segregation and mere cool coexistence under a very shaky roof are not the ideal conditions for developing a joint state."
"Alongside the need for regional cooperation and free movement across borders it is also important to shape the joint state of Macedonia."
"During my many visits to the Balkans, generally together with Doris Pack, I have scarcely met anyone who dreams of a Greater Albania."
"However, the Albanian population of Macedonia, who belong to a people which is represented in several different states, needs to be particularly sensitive in how it takes account of doubts and fears about this idea."
"What is more, the political leaders of this society should not cave in under threats from extremists and terrorists."
"Furthermore, I believe that all Macedonian politicians should work - and work together - on solving the country's urgent economic and social problems, because unemployment, poverty and poor prospects, particularly amongst the young, always make young people easy victims of the lure of extremism."
"The agreement that we are to decide upon tomorrow will particularly help to solve the economic and social problems of this country."
"Extremists will not bring Macedonia closer to Europe - just the opposite."
"That would not help anyone except the extremists themselves."
"In view of the most recent events I would like to say, however, that the same applies to the counter-violence that is already becoming apparent, and which also benefits no one but extremists."
"I would like to call upon all responsible politicians in Macedonia to summon up sufficient courage to implement the necessary reforms."
"But I would also particularly like to thank the representatives of the European Union, Javier Solana, Chris Patten, and the Commission representative in Skopje for their commitment."
"Macedonia can solve its current problems by working with the European Union and in return we can certainly find better solutions to the problems of this region by working with Macedonia."
"On that note, I wish every success not only to the agreement but also to Macedonia itself in tackling this difficult task."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I could actually say that Johannes Swoboda has said it all."
"I could say exactly that."
"However, perhaps I can highlight some slightly different points."
"The speed with which we are acting is also due to the fact that we simply want to show that Parliament is backing this country, Macedonia, and we also want to help it to overcome the current crisis as quickly as possible."
"Of course we are also pleased that in Macedonia this House has totally subscribed to the European ideal and given its assent to this agreement."
"This demonstrates whom Parliament has decided in favour of."
"However, we must also make it clear in Macedonia that this Union is a Union of values."
"We do not always observe them all, but these values include a high level of tolerance, a high level of respect for others and a great commitment to protecting minorities."
"That is why I believe that in Macedonia it is necessary to work together, across party political lines, taking account of this tolerance threshold."
"We need to fight together against criminality."
"I deeply regret, in particular, the death of four Macedonian soldiers in the last few days."
"So we need to fight together against criminals and agitators."
"Everyone should distance themselves from these actions and condemn them, work towards a climate of tolerance, and do everything to promote it, in all the media as well as in the Macedonian Parliament and in Macedonian society."
"Albanian terrorism must be condemned, but Slav-Macedonian nationalism is not an appropriate response to it."
"I think Johannes Swoboda said that too, but perhaps he did not say it as emphatically as I have done."
"Reason must make its entry on the Macedonian stage and that is why I believe it is the duty of all politicians to sweep aside any grounds for such actions, be they perceived or genuine."
"It is true that the Albanian population is nowhere near having had appropriate access to public office and has not had a public presence which would enable it, with justification, to reject any attack on the fragile inter-ethnic balance."
"This is partly a legacy of the communist past, but it is also partly attributable to the fact that in recent years insufficient efforts have been made to enhance this inter-ethnic balance."
"In my conversations with former President Kligorov he repeatedly told me that he recognised this and was seeking to take action."
"I must also say, however, that the former government did not necessarily pay sufficient heed to these appeals."
"So it is all the more incomprehensible that after the admirable way the Kosovo crisis was handled, when the entire Macedonian people, both Slavic Macedonians and Albanians, genuinely accepted the refugees in a truly commendable way, that just at this moment when Albanians are occupying key ministerial posts, when the law on higher education has been passed, when the fate of the University of Tetovo has been resolved with assistance from us and with the help of other states through additional funding, and the academic year can actually start, that just at this moment an explosive situation should arise."
"I believe that this is happening not so much for genuine political and rational reasons, but rather to keep a real trouble spot alive so that terrorists can strengthen their hand."
"I very much hope that all reasonable politicians in Macedonia will, in view of the new European window of opportunity opened up by this agreement, jointly launch yet more initiatives to achieve a functioning Macedonian society."
"But I would also like to appeal to the international community, to UNMIK and to KFOR, to do everything possible to help Macedonia by pursuing a better and more consistent policy in Kosovo, because the dissatisfaction there is releasing ever more terrorist potential."
"There are many areas of policy in Macedonia where assistance is needed."
"We should help them in the field of criminal jurisdiction, with their problems of corruption and also of trafficking in human beings, which is also a major problem throughout the region."
"I particularly welcome the fact that the border agreement with Yugoslavia was the first to be concluded in the region."
"I would also, amongst other things, like to see media representatives being trained so that they are worthy of that name and do not unnecessarily pour oil on the fire."
"I would also like to see the politicians who are here today and their colleagues doing everything in their power to ensure that their youth can in future stay in their country, because it is their future."
"But they need jobs and they need prospects."
"That is why we very much welcome the fact that the five regional Enterprise Promotion Centres have been set up, and I hope they will be a success."
"The most important thing, however, is political stability, because only if that exists will companies move there."
"Under our new agreement, it will be possible for the European Union to provide them with the necessary support."
"I am sure that in conjunction with the Commission we will do everything to achieve this."
"Mr President, today we endorse Mr Swoboda's recommendation which, like all his work, is excellent."
"The situation is somewhat ironic, since today is 2 May and the Commission's agreement was signed on 24 November."
"It may be that, had we adopted it earlier, we would have been able to avoid some of the consequences as well."
"I will restrict myself to pointing out that, this afternoon, the guerrillas have fired on the Albanian Embassy, shops and flats belonging to Albanians have been destroyed in Bitola, which had never known any disorder before, and yesterday a bomb was defused at Skopje airport."
"I therefore call upon you, ladies and gentlemen to do whatever you can to stop this escalation of violence while it is still possible, while there is still a chance of success and you still have the strength."
"Macedonia has been a nightmare for the West for years."
"The Council and Commission resolutions mention Macedonia chiefly in relation to Albania, but then there is Kosovo to be taken into consideration."
"And there is clearly more than that: Macedonia appears to be the centre of the mess in the Balkans."
"Well then, it cannot do without dialogue or the country will fall to pieces."
"Today, Europe is doing something more to help: the greater the European interest in Macedonia, the greater the stability of Europe."
"However, you must do your part."
"Mr President, I had the pleasure of taking a delegation of Members from my group, firstly on a visit last month to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and then last week to Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia and Kosovo."
"We, the vast majority of my group at least, have returned with an even greater conviction that the European Union cannot exist without south-eastern Europe."
"In our view, the European Union must therefore provide itself with the economic, political and institutional resources necessary to implement a strategy that would allow us to include these peoples and nations, if they so wish."
"We believe that the Stabilisation and Association Agreement concluded between the European Union and the Republic of Macedonia plays a part, albeit a modest one, in achieving this."
"It was signed on 9 April 2001 and was ratified by Parliament just three weeks later, and in my view, this agreement represents a step forward for Macedonia, the region and the European Union."
"It is a step forward for Macedonia, since, in addition to the considerable funding provided by financial aid worth EUR 62 million since the beginning of this year and the opportunity to export its products to the fifteen countries of the EU, free from customs duties, the political significance of this agreement is a decisive factor."
"It symbolises a commitment given by the major Macedonian political forces, both Slav- and Albanian-speaking, to encourage political dialogue, without any acts of violence being committed between the various ethnic communities."
"This agreement encourages taking steps towards establishing equal rights and equal opportunities for all citizens and opens up the prospect of unification for a society that is threatened by instability, signs of which can be seen on a daily basis."
"This is a step forward for the region, which we should no longer call 'the Balkans' , since this is a term widely rejected for its painful connotations. For the region, the fact that Macedonia was the first country to sign this type of agreement is an incentive to take inspiration from this model of inter-ethnic cooperation, which is imperfect, but nevertheless groundbreaking."
"We should remember that the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for the Economy, the Minister for Justice, the Minister for Labour and Social Policy, the Minister for Local Self-Government and many deputy ministers in Macedonia are Albanian."
"Finally, it is a step forward for the European Union itself, which has experienced so much difficulty in making a success of its common foreign policy, and the fact that the EU is able to play a truly constructive role in this important country should be seen as an encouraging sign."
"So, we must continue to make good progress."
"Other similar agreements must be signed in the same spirit with Croatia, Yugoslavia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Albania and the next step should be to accept their candidature for joining the European Union."
"Even if each country understands that the path leading from their application to actually joining is part of a process, the conditions for an active partnership already exist."
"My group, in any case, has decided to make a determined effort to achieve this."
"Mr President, establishing relations between the European Union and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, on a new, innovative basis and offering that country the prospect, albeit in the long term, of joining the European Union' s structures through the measures provided for in the Stabilisation and Association Process would, I think, be a major contribution to the stability of the Balkan region."
"The agreement which we are discussing today, which was signed by the contracting parties six months ago, covers the inclusion of protocols establishing political dialogue with FYROM, contains measures for closer regional cooperation, opens the way for the establishment of a free trade area with the European Union and lays down measures for the free movement of workers, freedom of establishment, the provision of services and the movement of capital. It also gives a commitment to harmonising the legislation of that country with that of the EU, particularly in certain fundamental areas of the internal market, and, lastly, it also promotes measures on cooperation in a wide range of fields, particularly justice and home affairs."
"This, Mr President, is the agreement that has been reached."
"Now that the agreement has been concluded, we hope that its clauses will represent a great step towards peace and stability in the region, whose peoples have already demonstrated that their aspirations to become part of our area of freedom and development are legitimate."
"This is also why the agreement can and must set an example for the other countries in the Balkans."
"With the recent acts of aggression that have been committed at the border and perpetrated against that country' s civilian population and armed forces, the important thing now is to support the efforts of the Macedonian government and people to maintain the stability of the country and to encourage the government and the moderate Albanian parties to avoid destructive and confrontational positions."
"Their action must focus on maintaining peace and democracy in a multi-ethnic society, which is, incidentally, a crucial factor for the implementation of this agreement."
"We must therefore encourage the Macedonian government to pursue its policy in order to guarantee fundamental rights and tolerance between all ethnic groups so that impetus can be given to the country' s economic development."
"To sum up, I think that the agreement must enter into force as quickly as possible and I hope that with Parliament' s vote, our message to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia will be understood, so that the violence can be dealt with effectively and that this example is followed by the neighbouring peoples and countries."
"Mr President, Representative of the Commission - who is not here - representative of the Council, I would like to start by making a preliminary statement about democracy and to stress - and here I am addressing our esteemed fellow parliamentarians from the Republic of Macedonia - that the issue of democracy, the problems of democracy, do not concern your country alone."
"In a country in which I was elected, Italy, at this moment, one of our fellow Members, Emma Bonino, is reaching her 113th hour of a hunger strike, and this is over a matter of democracy, because in Italy, a country of the European Union, the conditions of democracy, of democratic participation in elections are not guaranteed."
"In Italy, we are witnessing a squabble between the 'Pole' and the 'Olive Tree' over non-existent issues, over questions of deference of one or the other to the Vatican, and squabbles over serious matters as well, such as that of the conflict of interests concerning the centre-right candidate, an extremely serious matter yet one which has not been tackled by the centre-left in the five years of the legislature which is coming to an end."
"What I am trying to say is that democracy is a serious issue, an issue that concerns us, and something as serious as what is happening in Italy now and concerns the debate and the capacity ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr Dupuis, I wish to make a suggestion, which is that you restrict yourself to the issue under discussion and leave matters of Italian domestic politics for another occasion."
"I would suggest that you comply with the Rules of Procedure and that you make a speech on the issue we are discussing and not on Italian domestic politics, which is not on the agenda."
"Mr President, I was just about to say that the issue of information is also fundamental."
"I will now turn to the issue which is more central to our debate, the issue ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, until it is proved otherwise, we are still free to say what we want, we are still a democracy."
"You may have a different view of democracy, but everyone can say what they feel needs to be said."
"I was just getting to the point, Mr President."
"Thanks to Mr Swoboda and his initiative and the cooperation of some of the Members, we have, at last, recouped the time lost, and I am extremely grateful to Mr Swoboda for that."
"At last, we have an agreement."
"We are all aware - every now and again I agree with Mr Wurtz - that what is needed is to start to think about the real issue, which is that of accession, for we cannot continue to have different categories for candidate countries and countries which cannot be candidates."
"With regard to the issue of Macedonia, a few weeks ago, when the High Representative, Mr Solana, returned, I think we all had some hope of seeing an improvement in the situation."
"The recent events mentioned by Mr Volcic are, however, evidence that the situation is anything but under control: indeed, what has happened - the fact that eight soldiers were killed a few days ago and the anti-Albanian demonstrations - shows that this is not the case."
"In my opinion, the situation is extremely serious; it is true that we were a minority to say so months and months ago, but I feel that the situation is extremely serious."
"Certainly, Parliament can no longer see this agreement as the solution to the crises in Macedonia."
"A great deal more will be needed, and here I am addressing our fellow parliamentarians from Macedonia: the conditions have to be restored for genuine dialogue, there must be proper non-manipulative analysis of the real issues concerning, in particular, the Albanian minority, the cumulative frustrations suffered by this minority but also by other Albanian communities."
"I would point out that, until the Kosovo issue is resolved, it will be difficult to find a solution to the problem of Macedonia."
"Therefore, we must persuade the Commission and the Council to tackle these issues comprehensively at last and to discuss, at last, the matter of Kosovo's final status, to resolve, at last, the issue of Kosovar prisoners, and then to help our Macedonian friends deal with their genuine problems."
"These frustrations are far-reaching."
"Macedonia's current economic situation certainly does nothing to further the resolution of any of these issues, but there is no doubt that there are currently economic and other disparities between the treatment of the Albanian minority and that of the Macedonian majority."
"When the Albanian minority of a town such as that of Tetovo sees coach loads of workers, 'ethnic Macedonian' workers, arriving from Skopje, the only possible conclusion is that they are being treated differently."
"So federalism cannot provide a solution?"
"In my opinion, Mrs Pack, quite the contrary: we must consider federalism."
"Federalism does not necessarily bring division."
"There are federalistic solutions - and I refer to the case of Belgium, for example, which invented the concept of community federalism, in which, for matters more directly related to the relationship between the citizens and their institution, which may include culture, education and even health, it would be possible to conceive of a federalism which would not bring about territorial division in Macedonia but which would provide the substantial Albanian minority with institutions to represent it too and, therefore, with autonomous control at least over the areas which concern it most directly."
"I believe that our fellow parliamentarians from Macedonia should be able to view these proposals for a solution without fear or suspicion, for they are the channels through which a climate can be established in which the two great communities that make up Macedonia today can coexist peacefully."
"Mr President, Saturday' s bloody border incident is a serious setback for those forces in Macedonian society which advocate peaceful, ethnic coexistence within a Macedonian state."
"The ethnic disturbances in the city of Bitola are further proof of this."
"At the same time, this violent clash between Albanian guerrilla fighters and a Macedonian elite patrol raises fresh questions concerning the effectiveness of the international military presence on both sides of the Kosovar-Macedonian border."
"First of all, where were the KFOR units at the time of Saturday' s confrontation, which was very intense indeed."
"I would appreciate it if both the Council and Commission could shed some light on this."
"In the final analysis, rapporteur Swoboda has not for nothing highlighted the KFOR' s essential contribution to the pacification in the border region between Kosovo and Macedonia."
"I have a second question for the Council and Commission: there is an apparent lack of communication between KFOR contingents which are based on Kosovar and Macedonian border territory."
"I am not expecting a direct reply, but I do hope that both European institutions will address this elementary pacification condition with the seriousness it deserves."
"Finally, it is recommended, in sound consultation and close cooperation with the Macedonian and Serbian authorities, for the KFOR to deploy extremely tight border control with neighbouring Kosovo."
"It is precisely this assistance, as rapporteur Swoboda pointed out with good reason, which benefits the stabilisation and association process in the entire region of the western Balkans."
"Mr President, more than a year ago, in a report on the same subject Mr Swoboda remarked that Macedonia is, in fact, a stabilising factor within the Balkans."
"He spoke those words with the backing of the entire Parliament because, of course, we remember the time before the Yugoslav wars, when Macedonia, in particular, played an extremely intelligent and constructive role by drafting compromises to make the warring parties change course."
"That is something which we will not forget in a hurry."
"Secondly, we remember the reception in Macedonia of refugees from Kosovo: that too was an enormous effort which caused the necessary tension within Macedonia."
"It was not an easy task and we will not forget this."
"The western world, and the European Union too, on the other hand, have not always behaved impeccably towards Macedonia."
"A boycott was introduced, the effects of which Macedonia had to shoulder."
"Macedonia was fobbed off with humanitarian aid and was not really given any opportunities for its own industry."
"It is extremely important for the European Union to take an emphatic and positive step forward now with this Stabilisation and Association Agreement, by means of which fresh opportunities will be created for Macedonian industry."
"Needless to say, we were also critical of Macedonia, and still are, because it was slow in establishing interethnic relations."
"But all hell is breaking loose precisely at a time when the University of Tetovo is turning over a new leaf by offering opportunities to Albanian-speaking groupings in Macedonia, as a result of which the official apparatus will probably be less one-sided."
"It is extremely unfortunate that the Copenhagen criteria, which apply across the board to all candidate countries, are at now risk there."
"I would therefore call on the Macedonian politicians to make a special effort to act as advocates for the constitutional state, because in this way they will be welcome to join the union of constitutional states of which we are all part."
"Mr President, my group backs the rapporteur' s conclusions, and that is why I can congratulate Macedonia on the fact that this former Yugoslav Republic is the first to sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU."
"An agreement will enable us to set up intensive relations in a very concrete manner."
"An agreement is an important instrument for the region' s further stabilisation and adds, as such, to the Stability Pact in a meaningful way."
"But there is more."
"A Stabilisation and Association Agreement is the first step towards EU membership."
"It is the culmination of the pledge which the European Union undertook, namely that a successful implementation of all elements of the Stability Pact will open up the way to membership of the EU."
"It underlines the focus on Europe and on European values."
"We hope that the Macedonian model will be copied promptly by the others."
"There are already negotiations under way with Croatia."
"With regard to Albania, preparations to that effect are being made."
"Hopefully, initial talks will soon be held in Belgrade too, provided that the Montenegro issue does not put a spanner in the works."
"And we should not overlook Bosnia, of course."
"The strength of this agreement lies not only in the provisions it contains, which enables cooperation in many areas."
"The close ties with the European Union which are based on this agreement, as well as the prospect of membership tied in with that, could have a moderating effect on the internal relations in these countries."
"That is a form of conflict prevention."
"We have actually noticed these effects in the candidate countries."
"The active role which the High Representative Solana and Commissioner Patten have managed to play during the recent disturbances in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is a shining example of this positive effect."
"The only conclusion we could draw therefore is that more of these agreements are needed in the region in the short term."
"Mr President, this agreement opens a door which we should have opened years ago in an area which, thanks to our stupid policy, has become the black hole of Europe."
"This agreement is the right move in the right direction."
"However, it is a fragile agreement."
"Eight policemen and soldiers were killed the other day."
"Provocation."
"The response from a few irresponsible people in Bitola, a bomb at the airport."
"Mr Swoboda has never heard talk of Great Albania, I hear it every day living and working as I do in the area."
"It is a fragile agreement, a delicate situation, for another reason: it is quite unclear, there is no certainty whatsoever as to what policy we as the European Union wish to apply here."
"Without a policy which guarantees integrity and sovereignty, there can be no trust, no prospects, no dialogue and no democratic reform."
"Only then can there be political stability."
"Otherwise we shall come back in a few years' time to count up our mistakes."
"Mr President, following the fall of the Milosevic regime on 1 October 2000 and the ensuing democratic changes which took place in Belgrade, the European Union has radically changed its policy towards Serbia."
"In the Union's message to the Serbian people last September the foreign minister said that the Union promised that a vote for democracy in Serbia would be a vote for Serbia in Europe."
"After the democratic transition in Serbia, the Union lifted its sanctions to repeal the oil embargo against Serbia and the Union lifted flight bans."
"The Union has also extended funding via the European Reconstruction Agency in Serbia to Montenegro as well as to propose an extension to the recently announced trade preferences of the Balkans and the whole of Yugoslavia."
"It is very important that the European Union and Yugoslavia normalise diplomatic relations."
"The European Union is right to be active in contributing to the institutional and economic rebuilding that is presently taking place within the former Republic of Yugoslavia."
"We must all work together to put behind us the tragic events that have taken place in the Balkans since the 1990s."
"The arrest of Mr Milosevic is the first important step in bringing him to justice and the authorities in Belgrade must be congratulated for their determination in this regard."
"It is only right and proper that he answers to the Serbian people for crimes he has committed against them and in their name."
"We now have before us the best prospects for a generation of building lasting peace and prosperity across the whole of south-east Europe and the European Union is prepared to play an active role in this regard."
"The overall financial assistance from the Union to the states which comprise the former Republic of Yugoslavia now amounts to EUR 475 million."
"This assistance includes help for educational programmes, reconciliation schemes, the provision of shelters for refugees, constructing border crossing-points as well as supporting infrastructure projects such as the building of roads and the clearing of the Danube river of pollutants."
"I also believe it is important that Kosovo leaders speak out clearly against the violence that is taking place in the former Republic of Yugoslavia."
"These leaders should remember that it is very hard to justify to European taxpayers the very substantial levels of financial assistance Kosovo is receiving from the Union if its leaders fail to condemn the violence which is taking place in the region at this time."
"The violence, murder, human suffering and instability in the Balkan regions, which have been taking place over the last 10 years, must now be put behind us."
"Mr President, allow me to extend a particularly warm, friendly and affectionate welcome to our colleagues and neighbours from the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and to welcome the real burgeoning democracy which will bring it closer to the European Union."
"I am sure that our colleagues expect a Greek MEP to say something about the dispute over the name."
"Perhaps this dispute should never have arisen, perhaps it should have been settled a long time ago; in any event, negotiations are under way, friendly negotiations, and I trust that this problem will soon be resolved."
"For the rest, Greece wholeheartedly supports its neighbouring state."
"Everything we have heard here about what the European Union should be doing, in the form of action rather than high-flying words, Greece is already doing."
"In other words, Greece is already providing economic support in the form of investments - it is one of the biggest, if not the biggest investor in our neighbouring country - and through trade."
"It is providing political support by steadfastly backing the policy of reconciliation being applied by the government in our neighbouring country to the extremely difficult, the terribly difficult internal problems which it faces and it is providing international support in that it has officially called on NATO to prevent the anarchy which other areas in the region are endeavouring to import via our neighbouring country."
"We should not be lulled by the calm here in Parliament into underestimating just how terrible the problems being created are."
"Extremists are using age-old, familiar tactics to kill, plunder and create incidents in order to set two groups in the same country - and in the final analysis from the same nation, because they are Europeans just like us - at each others' throats."
"It is a familiar tactic."
"Unfortunately, it has proven effective and we must oppose it."
"Unfortunately we, the European Union, have added grist to the mill of mutual destruction with our mistakes."
"We must stand firm in our opposition and prove that we can bring about reconciliation and facilitate collaboration between nations; this is the only way of forging a link in the chain of peace rather than creating a hotbed of discontent."
"Mr President, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece will not be voting in favour of this agreement with the FYROM, because it proves yet again that the European Union is endeavouring to get a tighter grip on this country."
"Economic concessions and promises of accession to the European Union, naturally once it has complied fully with social demands, are a means of ensuring greater penetration of European capital."
"The report, which cites the decisions taken at Stockholm, basically agrees to treat Albanian extremists posing as negotiators who, as we have seen, have not let up in their criminal activities, and the government of the FYROM on an equal footing."
"Everyone knows that the famous National Liberation Army, which aspires to be the official negotiator of the Albanian minority, is in fact an offshoot of the KLA."
"Having set the wolf to guard the lambs, it is up to the High Representative to monitor compliance with the agreement."
"That is why, in our view, this policy, as set out in the present report, merely adds fuel to the fire raging in the Balkans and offers encouragement to the grand unification plans of the Albanian nationalists."
"We need to safeguard the right of the people in the area to decide their own future and, if we want to help, it is precisely this sort of intervention and activity which we should refuse to support."
"Before I turn to the question of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, let me place on record our condemnation of the attack on the Kosovo foreign border at the weekend in which eight Fyrom soldiers were killed."
"As Commission Patten said at the weekend, this was an attack against democracy, an attack designed to derail the interparty dialogue that has recently begun in Fyrom on interethnic relations, a dialogue which the European Union has strongly supported."
"We continue to stand four square for the values of tolerance and moderation and in support of those who seek to resolve differences through dialogue instead of the bomb and the bullet."
"That is why the signature of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union and Fyrom which took place in Luxembourg on 9 April was such an important event."
"It is the first such agreement we have signed with a country in the region and it symbolises the strong ties that exist between the Union and Fyrom."
"It was signed in the presence of the European Union's Foreign Ministers and representatives of nearly all the parties: opposition government, Albanian, Macedonian, Slav, which are represented in the Parliament in Skopje."
"The message was one of unity, unity in the face of the threats to democracy that Fyrom has recently faced and continues to face today."
"Unity in a shared belief in Fyrom's future as a key member of the European family."
"The negotiations were launched by the Commission on 5 March 2000."
"Thanks to excellent cooperation with the Macedonian authorities, the negotiations were concluded within nine months and the agreement was initialled in the margins of the Zagreb Summit on 24 November."
"The main elements of the agreement are the establishment of a free trade area between the Community and Fyrom within a ten-year period after the entry into force of the agreement, the establishment of a political dialogue, provisions on regional cooperation provisions on the freedom of movement of workers, freedom of establishment, supply of services, a commitment by the Fyrom authorities to approximate legislation to that of the European Community especially in the internal market, cooperation in areas such as justice and home affairs, establishment of a stabilisation and association council that supervises the implementation of the agreement."
"The agreement makes clear that Fyrom is a potential candidate for membership of the European Union once it has implemented the agreement and subject to the Copenhagen criteria."
"The interim agreement also signed on 9 April provides for the trade-related provisions of the agreement to enter into force from 1 June 2001, without having to wait for the formal ratification of the agreement by national parliaments."
"The Commission invites the European Parliament to give its assent to the agreement and we hope that national parliaments will ratify the agreement as quickly as possible."
"As honourable Members are aware, this is a critical period in Fyrom's history."
"This agreement and Parliament's support for it underline the European Union's commitment to Fyrom's wellbeing and the confidence in our people."
"That is the context in which the Presidency, Commissioner Patten and the High Representative have been working hard in recent weeks to facilitate the dialogue between democratically elected political parties in Fyrom, initiated by President Trajkovski and which is designed to address legitimate grievances."
"That hard work will continue, but as with the agreement, while the European Union will wish to be as supportive as possible, ultimately the main effort must be made by the people of Fyrom and their political leaders."
"It is they who carry responsibility for their countries future which is why it is so important to press ahead now with the political dialogue."
"Thank you all for your contributions and thank you also to Mr Swoboda."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Wallström."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Nuclear safety fifteen years after Chernobyl"
"The next item is the Commission statement on nuclear safety fifteen years after the Chernobyl accident and its health consequences."
"Mr President, honourable Members, the Chernobyl accident in 1986 was a tragedy on a global scale and we continue to feel strongly for the victims this tragedy has caused, both among those involved in the clean-up and plant workers, and among people not directly involved, including innocent children."
"We also recognise the huge economic burden this accident has put on Belarus, Russia and Ukraine and other countries and the problems for the population in contaminated regions to restore normal living conditions."
"The consequences of the accident on EU territory were comparatively minor but nevertheless important efforts continue to be made for monitoring levels of radioactivity in the environment and in foodstuffs: controls on the import of foodstuffs were even recently strengthened."
"The commemoration of this event provides us with an opportunity to reflect upon nuclear safety in the region."
"On 15 December 2000, Ukraine shut down definitively the Chernobyl nuclear power plant."
"The Commission welcomed this decision as a major contribution to the improvement of nuclear safety in Europe."
"We also appreciate that by deciding to close the Chernobyl plant before the end of 2000, Ukraine lived up to the commitment it made under the international agreement signed with the governments of the of the G7 countries and with the European Commission."
"The European Union has provided considerable support to Ukraine over the last few years in addressing and overcoming the consequences of the Chernobyl accident, which had such devastating effects on the population and the environment."
"Over EUR 340 million have been granted in assistance today, not taking into account technical assistance provided for other nuclear installations in the Ukraine."
"For Chernobyl, important EU support is related to turning the sarcophagus into an environmentally acceptable system and addressing social needs."
"The Commission will soon adopt the formal proposal for a Council decision on a second contribution to the Chernobyl shelter fund at the EBRD which will then be submitted to the Council and to Parliament for decision."
"Nuclear safety is a priority for the European Union."
"Since the beginning of the political and economic reforms that took place in the former Soviet Union, the European Union has actively assisted the countries of the region in improving the safety of their nuclear installations."
"The strategy followed by the EU was in line with the G7 multilateral programme of action."
"This included support for short-term measures for nuclear safety improvements as well as longer-term measures to replace unsafe reactors by alternative energy sources."
"In the particular case of the candidate countries of central and eastern Europe, the PHARE Programme has helped and continues to help improve nuclear safety there as well as to develop economically and environmentally sound energy strategies for the replacement of the less safe nuclear reactors."
"As requested by the Council, the Commission has given a high priority to nuclear safety in the accession partnerships and in using pre-accession funds to pursue these priorities."
"Important landmarks are: the agreement to close non-upgradeable units in Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria; the support that the programme has given to the nuclear regulators; the short-term urgent safety improvements made to some reactors; the design and operational improvements in upgradeable reactors and also considerable assistance to tackle the problems related to radioactive waste and spent fuel."
"The case of the Russian Federation is particularly important."
"Russia is the only state of the former Soviet Union involved in all aspects of nuclear power, from uranium mining to plant design, power generation and spent fuel reprocessing."
"Some 15% of electricity in Russia is generated by nuclear power."
"Russia's civil nuclear industry is also a major source of employment accounting for approximately 300 000 people in direct jobs."
"Given the limited size of the available EU budget, the large number of operating reactors and the special economic conditions in Russia, it would be impossible for the European Union to offer Russia financial assistance equivalent to that made available to the candidate countries and to Ukraine."
"Nonetheless the basic policy orientation is the same: to use the technical and financial resources available to the European Union to help the Russian Federation improve safety levels."
"With regard to Russia, we also pursue an active cooperation in spent fuel and radio active waste management in north-west Russia."
"An enormous quantity of spent fuel from nuclear submarines is stored under very poor conditions."
"This poses a major threat to the Barents Sea and the Arctic environment."
"The Community is not party to the Arctic monitoring and assessment programme, but is nevertheless closely involved in the work related to environmental radioactivity in the Arctic."
"We are at present involved in active negotiations on a specified multilateral agreement, the MNEPR, which should allow us to set up and implement a large international effort."
"To conclude, the Commission has undertaken an active policy in assisting our partner states in their efforts to increase nuclear safety."
"We are committed to continue this policy and hope very much that together we can ensure a secure and safe energy supply consistent with sustainable development and respect for the environment."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when we think back today in Parliament to the accident in Chernobyl, what we remember is the cynical attitude taken by a dictatorship towards man' s safety and his environment."
"I stress this point because we have, of course, acted in the debate on many occasions as if Chernobyl were everywhere."
"It is not."
"Twelve years ago a dictatorship crumbled, a dictatorship which from the outset did not have the standard of technical safety which we have in the rest of the world or, more to the point, in Europe."
"For the rest, we should clarify that, in a democracy, discussion takes place in public. That alone contributes to safety."
"A democracy has independent supervisory agencies."
"That too contributes to safety. And it has independent courts, which again contribute to safety."
"In other words, a democratic system operating under the rule of law is, per se, such an important safety factor that any parallels need to be made clear at this point."
"The consequences of the cynical attitude of a dictatorship, which had a nuclear power station which was unsafe from the outset and four reactors which were shut down in December in response to international pressure, have had to be borne mainly by the people in the countries affected. I note that, even twelve years after the fall of the Soviet Union, many leading politicians have yet to depart from this cynical attitude towards the people, as the truly abysmal treatment of the people after the sinking of the Kursk proved."
"Public discussion is still not a routine matter there and we would do well to bear that in mind."
"We are right to say in our resolution that there is widespread concern."
"But I also notice that many people are wrongly feeding this concern in order to achieve a completely different objective, namely to lump unsafe nuclear power stations together with the safe nuclear power stations which are currently being built around the world, including soon in the Union and America, and this is unacceptable."
"This does not apply in other technical areas: if something goes wrong with a car, we do not ban all cars, and if an aeroplane crashes, it is terrible, but we do not ban all aeroplanes."
"We want help for the Ukraine."
"But we must also tell the Ukraine and ourselves that we cannot rest easily just by giving money; we must put conditions in place there so that money in a functioning economic system can fulfil the same purpose as it does in a democracy, which is why we expect - as the resolution makes clear - all manner of changes and adjustments to the energy system in the Ukraine."
"Commissioner Wallström, if we are talking about learning lessons, then that applies in particular to the candidate countries."
"We have nine new nuclear power stations there with 27 reactors."
"Of which we know that three power stations with eight reactors are to be shut down."
"But we know equally well that other parts of nuclear power stations can be upgraded and that brings me to my sixty-four thousand dollar question to you, Commissioner: the Commission is conducting accession negotiations, including on the ""standard energy safety"" chapter on behalf of the European Union."
"Parliament is still waiting for you to tell us and the public exactly which nuclear power station safety standard the negotiations are based on."
"To my knowledge you have promised Parliament as much on several occasions, but the matter is still pending."
"The Commission has a debt to discharge here."
"I only hope that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy will receive a clear answer from you as soon as possible as to what safety standard negotiations with candidate countries are based on."
"It is a question of the utmost interest to all of us and all of our citizens."
"Mr President, the closure of the Chernobyl nuclear plant has, of course, been widely applauded by Members in political groups in this House, but it could have happened earlier and the reasons why it did not are instructive."
"The Ukraine does not wish to increase its dependence of supplies from Russia and therefore it wished to complete the reactors at Khmelnitski and Rovno and in their eyes we have been rather slow in operating the memorandum of understanding that was concluded in 1995."
"However, the decision to make the Euratom loan available to complete those reactors marks a very important step towards improving EU/Ukraine relations because the loan agreement marks the willingness of Ukraine to operate its nuclear plant to safety standards equivalent to those in the European Union."
"It is one thing talking about the operational standards of safety, the other important aspect is the regulation of the industry."
"I am pleased that the Commissioner made such reference to the support that we give to regulators throughout eastern Europe, because this is the area that gives us the greatest concern."
"It is not in any way to challenge the competence of the regulator or his staff in Ukraine."
"It is a question of the power of the regulatory body to authorise start-up procedures to ensure stoppage for maintenance and to be the final arbiter for loading and restarting."
"There is still an outstanding need to satisfy the West that the status of the regulator in Ukraine, and in some other eastern European countries, is equivalent to western practice: it certainly should be established before K2 is finally commissioned."
"Paragraph 12 of the joint resolution calls for closer cooperation and dialogue between Ukraine and the European Parliament on energy-related matters."
"This is crucial to building up the Ukraine economy, because structural and technical improvements are also needed in the gas, oil and coal sectors and while the commitment of Ukraine to improving energy efficiency and developing renewable energy sources is welcome, the dominant factors for the foreseeable future will be fossil fuel and nuclear power."
"It is essential that this Parliament, its committees and its delegation to the Ukraine are linked into the work of the subcommittee of the political cooperation agreement which handles energy and environment issues."
"Parliament should also be kept fully informed of progress in the shelter construction, the decommissioning of the site and the completion of the two reactors."
"These are the pressing practical matters which must follow from the voting of this resolution."
"Mr President, we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance are pleased that we have, at any event, succeeded in agreeing upon a resolution, even though we should, of course, have liked it to be stronger on certain points."
"Fifteen years after Chernobyl, the safety of nuclear power and its effects upon health are the subject of this resolution."
"Chernobyl is a constant reminder to us that we cannot continue to ignore the risks of nuclear power, and it constitutes the clearest warning of all about the threat posed by nuclear power to our whole existence."
"I would say to the previous speaker that nuclear accidents were not the invention of Communism. Rather, accidents have also occurred in the United States and Japan."
"Is that at least not something we should be able to agree about?"
"The UN' s Department for Humanitarian Affairs estimates that 9 million people have been affected directly or indirectly by the disaster in Chernobyl."
"In Belarus, 18 per cent of the total population live in a heavily polluted environment."
"These figures are extremely high, considering what they mean for individual people."
"Just as Commissioner Wallström pointed out, children are the most vulnerable."
"The World Health Organisation reports that the annual rate of thyroid gland cancer among children in the Gomel area of Belarus and the most affected areas in Ukraine exceeds the normal values by almost a hundred times."
"The question is whether we have learned anything since then."
"Is the precautionary principle being applied today?"
"EU funds are still being handed out for the purpose of completing the nuclear reactors in Ukraine, and Euratom still spreads the gospel of nuclear power, praising its splendid qualities."
"It is, of course, commendable that the EU should contribute to nuclear safety, but should we not also at some point provide funds for closing down nuclear power stations?"
"I want to ask Commissioner Wallström if the Commission has any plans to require the applicant States to close down nuclear power stations before they can become members of the European Union."
"I would also add my name to the question asked earlier about what safety standard the EU has."
"What answer do we give to the applicant States when they ask about this?"
"Mr President, the Chernobyl disaster was not an exception, and, as such, not something which was typical of one type of nuclear power station which was produced and used in the former Soviet Union."
"Even before 1986, there was the disaster in Harrisburg in the US, where an overheated and melting nuclear reactor threatened to sink into the ground."
"The fact is that since the 1950s, there has been too much optimism worldwide about the characteristics of nuclear energy."
"It was expected to be a non-exhaustive source of cheap and clean energy, but instead it turned out to be a risky business which, even after production was stopped, continued seriously to pollute the environment."
"Fifteen years after the disaster, a large area in Belarus and Ukraine is still not inhabitable for people who do not want to get cancer."
"Those who stay have become dependent on government aid, and those who should be able to help those most affected avoid or leave the area."
"Food from the polluted area remains unsuitable for consumption."
"To solve this situation, we do not need a new type of nuclear power station, but rather a recovery plan for the affected area, alternative ways of generating energy, as well as energy-saving measures."
"Only a financial contribution is in the interest of all Europeans; anything else will just lead to wasted energy and to future disasters."
"Mr President, according to a statement by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the number of cases of thyroid cancer has risen sharply."
"That is the finding in a report by the Otto-Hug-Institut at Munich University."
"According to WHO forecasts, in the district of Gomel in Belarus alone, which is the main area affected, a third of the children who were under four years of age when the accident occurred will contract cancer of the thyroid during their lifetime."
"The repercussions could become apparent in seven million people over the next 50 to 70 years."
"In Belarus alone, there is a shortfall in the funds needed to treat radiation victims of EUR 800 million a year."
"Because there is no money, people over the age of 45 are no longer being treated."
"Meaning that they will die."
"Compare this amount with the EUR 1.2 billion spent by the Commission on nuclear research under the sixth EU nuclear research programme and draw your own tragic conclusions."
"We call on the European Union to issue strict, uniform nuclear safety standards."
"A repeat of Chernobyl must be prevented, which is why bogus environmental impact tests, such as those in Temelin, should not be carried out."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the Chernobyl disaster would have been thought impossible before it happened, even under a dictatorship."
"Of course, I believe that this sort of thing could never happen in a British, French or German nuclear power station."
"But we are surrounded by nuclear power stations using obsolete Russian technology."
"I need only think of Bohunice, Kozlodoui or Ignalina."
"These power stations cannot be upgraded, even with the very best western technology."
"In Austria no one - not one party - is in favour of using nuclear energy."
"We have learned to accept that we cannot force others to follow our example."
"But what we can do is warn them about dangerous nuclear power stations, about nuclear power stations which would be unable to obtain an operating licence anywhere in the European Union."
"When someone builds a house, the neighbours are asked if the tree in the garden is too tall and is blocking out too much light."
"When someone builds a nuclear power station which would not be able to obtain a license anywhere in the European Union, suddenly it is a question of national sovereignty and everyone is insulted if you question safety standards or ask for information."
"In Austria - and I think that I really can speak for everyone - we have taken great pains for a long time to call for uniform standards which apply in all the European countries."
"Commissioner, the same thing has been put to you twice today already."
"I know full well that we cannot compare French technology, for example, with British technology and that the French industry may wish to guard its secrets."
"But we must have a minimum consensus."
"We must be able to say if an old or a new nuclear power station built in a candidate country - and I am thinking quite specifically of Temelin here - is safe."
"I have to say that, if a nuclear power station would be unable to obtain an operating licence anywhere in the European Union, then I am against it, I do not want any nuclear power stations in any candidate country which do not meet our standards, irrespective of which country has issued them."
"We harmonise so much in the European Union - our common values, thank God."
"We shall soon have a common currency - wonderful."
"We also hear talk of standard shapes for cucumbers."
"So why no minimum consensus here?"
"I have tried to achieve a minimum consensus in my group."
"I believe that Mr Mombaur or Mr Chichester will be tabling an oral amendment tomorrow."
"I call on you, if you are still here and can hear me, to vote in favour of this oral amendment."
"Commissioner, it is precisely because we are surrounded by dangerous nuclear power stations that I say to you: there is no border at which the danger stops - and I am thinking here of the candidate countries, I am thinking of nuclear power stations which cannot be upgraded and I am thinking of new nuclear power stations which may be built."
"It must be possible for us to say that we demand British, French or German standards."
"If we cannot, then what I want to know is why we bother about the shape of cucumbers."
"Mr President, Belarus commemorates the Chernobyl disaster on 25 April of each year, and tens of thousands of people take part in those commemorations."
"In the West, it is a little known fact why that is, for the nuclear power station was located in Ukraine."
"But upon closer inspection of the effects of the disaster, it becomes clear that Belarus, where more than 70% of the nuclear fall-out ended up, was at least as badly affected as Ukraine."
"In the latter country, nearly two and a half million people were exposed to radioactivity."
"Over the past ten years, the Ukrainian government has spent USD six billion to combat the effects, and this spending is set to continue for the time being."
"To quote a few examples: funding is needed to repair the housing built around the exploded reactor as it is deemed unsafe."
"A great deal of materials polluted by the explosion need to be stored and processed."
"Ukraine' s main river, the Dnepr, is still at risk of becoming contaminated."
"The European Union has addressed a number of these problems in good time and has given a great deal of aid to Ukraine - something which the Commissioner already referred to - although the effectiveness of that aid is sometimes called into question."
"The situation in Belarus is possibly worse still."
"About two and a half million people are still living in the contaminated areas where they often eat contaminated food."
"The health situation is alarming, especially for the children."
"The socio-economic situation in that country is bad anyway, which makes the people more vulnerable to disease and adverse effects than in normal circumstances."
"The government in Minsk may spend a huge proportion of the government budget on the effects, but it refuses to deal with the problem openly."
"Its policy is often counterproductive and screens the problem from the outside world."
"The international community is involved, albeit on a small scale."
"NGOs carry out their work under difficult conditions."
"My admiration goes especially to the European organisations which bring thousands of children to western Europe annually for a holiday in order to enable them to recover to some extent from the effects of radiation."
"But that, of course, is not enough by a long chalk."
"Relations between the European Union and the undemocratic government in Belarus are strained."
"We can understand that."
"At the same time, it is difficult to accept that not more of an effort is being made, precisely in the interest of the people affected, who are not at all involved in government politics."
"It has been said before, but I would once again like to make an urgent appeal to the Commission to free up more specific aid for Belarus."
"I am not convinced by the argument that neither TACIS nor ECHO allow this."
"We are talking about hundreds of thousands of people who are still in need and still require direct aid."
"Let us for once overstep our own political and bureaucratic boundaries."
"Mr President, Commissioner, as you have explained, the issue of Chernobyl is by no means done and dusted."
"After 14 years, the European Union has a responsibility to take a different course of action, as, in response to this human tragedy, the measures taken still focus largely on the energy technology aspects."
"The European Commission gave in to blackmail by the Ukrainian authorities by approving the construction of two new nuclear power plants in exchange for closing down Chernobyl."
"This self-seeking collusion between the political elite and the nuclear lobby rides roughshod over the total disapproval of Ukraine' s citizens and the potential that Ukraine has for renewable energy sources and energy savings."
"With regard to Belarus, 23% of the territory is affected by radiation and needs to be evacuated immediately."
"It is essential, therefore, that the second part of the TACIS programme be implemented in Belarus to provide medical and health support, in Belarus and within our own Member States, to the civilian population still living in the contaminated areas and particularly to children."
"This moral and humanitarian duty must be accomplished with adequate resources and funding which are in line with the extent of the ecological disaster."
"The autocratic and repressive regime in Belarus, which wants to play down this public health crisis as far as possible and to silence scientists such as Mr Nesterenko and Mr Bandazhevsky, can no longer be used as an alibi by the European Union and pro-nuclear lobbies to hide the reality of Chernobyl and abandon the long-suffering communities of these contaminated regions, to their fate."
"It is also the responsibility of the WHO, a direct accomplice in this tragedy through an incestuous agreement concluded in 1957 with the International Atomic Energy Agency, which takes, of course, a pro-nuclear stance, and which has since become its legal censor in nuclear matters."
"It is also the European Union' s responsibility to free the WHO from the control of the IAEA."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it is fifteen years since the epic disaster at Chernobyl but the consequences are still being measured today."
"Victims, human lives are being lost to cancer."
"And this disaster did not just affect the neighbouring countries, Ukraine and Belarus, it affected countries thousands of miles away, including my own."
"The question is, and I agree with previous speakers here: have we learnt our lesson from this accident, have we finally understood that human error is always there, lying in ambush waiting to strike?"
"Where human error combines with a nuclear reactor which is unsafe and does not meet proper safety standards, as in the present case, then of course the dangers are immense."
"I say this, Commissioner, because similar reactors are still operating in Europe."
"They are operating in Russia, they are operating in Lithuania, they are operating in Slovakia and four reactors are operating in our neck of the woods, close to Greece, in Kozlodoui."
"I, for one, disagree with the Commission' s timetable for shutting down these reactors which, as the Commission itself says, cannot be upgraded at reasonable expense to the safety standards which a nuclear reactor should meet."
"For example, what has been said about Kozlodoui?"
"That two reactors should be shut down in 2002, while we have yet to agree that the other two should be shut down in 2006."
"Surely this is a very long time to leave dangerous reactors in operation."
"And why?"
"Because there are financial considerations."
"Well, let us deal with the financial considerations."
"Financial considerations cannot take precedence over the environment and human health in general and the health of European citizens in particular."
"Consequently, I say to you, as you are here, that you should be forceful, not only because some of the candidate countries do not want to keep to these dates, but also because various arguments as to how their service life can be extended are already being bandied about."
"For example, I read in the papers two days ago that the official press in Kozlodoui said that it could stay in operation until 2010."
"The reactors may even be sold to private individuals."
"For the love of God, how can they say such things?"
"I therefore think that, fifteen years after Chernobyl and with what we have to do so that Chernobyl is safe and sound under its sarcophagus, we need to be sure, over and above these efforts, that we intend to put an end to these dangerous reactors in Bulgaria, Slovakia, Lithuania and Russia."
"I think that, if money needs to be spent, Commissioner, we should spend it."
"The financial problem is secondary."
"The most important considerations are the environment and health, the public health of the citizens of Europe."
"Mr President, we will probably never know the real ecological, biological, psychological and economic magnitude of the Chernobyl disaster."
"As well as the deaths and the terrible illnesses in the region, 15 years on there is still a frightening legacy of radioactive contamination."
"An area about the size of Britain is permanently contaminated and uninhabitable."
"Much less tragic, but serious even so, in my constituency in Wales, following contamination from Chernobyl, 359 farms are still under restrictions today and thousands of sheep are restricted from movement to ensure that no animal contaminated with radioactivity enters the food chain."
"There has been continuous monitoring for 15 years and the restrictions will last for another 10-15 years."
"We must have sustainable energy policies."
"Nuclear power is no solution."
"It is not clean and it is not cheap."
"In over 40 years of operation the nuclear industry has not even solved the problem of radioactive waste and, above all, it poses massive threats to human health and the environment."
"Nothing illustrates that better than Chernobyl and we have to learn from it."
"We may never know the full impact of the disaster but we must make every effort, as outlined in this resolution, to find out all we can and provide effective assistance to help the worst-affected areas."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for the debate."
"I believe it is important that we remember the event in Chernobyl 15 years ago, and you have yourselves provided testimony to the ways in which this affects us even today and in our Member States too."
"We should like to be able to debate energy policy, but I believe we should avoid that today and instead concentrate on the subjects of how we can improve nuclear safety in the applicant States and, of course, of how we are to continue to cooperate with Ukraine and Russia."
"These issues also illustrate the nature and character of the environmental problems."
"They acknowledge no national borders, but follow a river or prevailing wind, something for which we are still paying a high price today."
"I have received a number of questions, which I shall try to answer, but I should perhaps say first of all that I hope that Parliament can take the time to deal with the communication on which the Commission decided in September of last year and which concerns the Commission' s support for improved nuclear safety in the applicant States."
"In this, the Commission explains its view of how these issues must be worked with, that is to say that both short- and long-term approaches are required."
"In the short term, it has been a question of getting a number of applicant States to close down the old-fashioned Chernobyl-style reactors they use."
"We have tried to encourage the applicant States to submit concrete timetables for doing that."
"These must then be followed up in order to ensure that they are really being implemented."
"Naturally, Members of Parliament know as well as we do that we do not have competence in this area to force either the Member States or the applicant States to do anything."
"We must try to work with them through a variety of agreements, through sound cooperation and also by means of support in many different forms. We are concerned here with everything from education to financial support for upgrading safety."
"I have been asked what standards are applied."
"As you know, we have no special European standards, but we say that European Union Practices must be complied with. What does that mean?"
"Over the years, the EU' s Member States have developed a safety standard which we should also like to see the applicant States being able to comply with."
"There is now also a working party in the Council which compares those standards that exist in the applicant States with those that exist in the EU countries, identifying those shortcomings and differences that exist so that it will be possible to overcome these and upgrade security in the applicant States."
"The IAEA' s standards form the basis, of course, but these are so general that they require 'practical application' ."
"We do, Mrs Schörling, in fact also have agreements to close the most dangerous nuclear power stations of all - Kozloduy, Ignalina and Bohunice - and to ensure that the safety of the remaining reactors is upgraded so that we obtain an acceptable standard."
"I believe that we have explained fairly well in this communication from the Commission how we view these issues, but we can perfectly well use this day and this opportunity to reflect upon the vulnerability of even the very most modern nuclear technology and nuclear power used."
"We are still vulnerable, and we still have a problem with waste."
"You probably know where I stand when it comes to the use of nuclear power but, even though I am critical of this, I believe that the research into safety issues must continue."
"That is incredibly important, I believe."
"In this area, we cannot decide over the heads of the Member States or against their will."
"We must cooperate with the Member States on these issues and do all we can, because we share the same environment and are all exposed to risks if we live with unacceptable safety levels."
"Above all, I agree with what one MEP pointed out, to the effect that we must remember the children and make sure we do everything in order also to help and support those children who still have to pay the price for the dreadful tragedy of Chernobyl."
"Thank you for the debate."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Wallström."
"Pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received five motions for a resolution."
"The debate is closed"
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 8.28 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)"
"Protection of euro against counterfeiting"
"The next item is the report (A5-0120/2001) by Mrs Cederschiöld, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs:"
"I. on the Initiative by the Government of the French Republic with a view to adopting a Council Decision on the protection of the euro against counterfeiting [5551/2001 - C5-0054/2001 - 2001/0804(CNS)]"
"II. on the Council position on a draft Council Regulation laying down measures necessary for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting [6281/2001 - C5-0084/2001 - 2000/0208(CNS)]"
"III. on the Council position on a draft Council Regulation extending the effects of Regulation (EC) No. .../01 laying down measures necessary for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting to those Member States which have not adopted the euro as their single currency [6281/2001 - C5-0084/2001 - 2000/0208(CNS)]."
"Mr President, we all know that euro notes and coins are to be brought into circulation on 1 January of next year."
"Twelve of the national currencies of the Member States are to disappear and be successively replaced by the new common currency."
"The names of Mr Kohl and Mr Delors ought to be mentioned in this context."
"It is odd that not all Member States have yet realised that the internal market cannot be fully efficient in the long term if it is fragmented in terms of a number of different national currencies."
"We are all familiar with the advantages of the single currency, that is to say economic and monetary cooperation."
"The Europe-wide use of the euro has already brought economic stability and a variety of other advantages. It has encouraged economic growth, increased consumption and investment and led to the creation of new jobs."
"I believe that the single currency will stimulate increased mobility to the extent of leading to a completely new Europe in ten years' time."
"With the euro, European integration is taking a giant step forward."
"The euro will become one of the most significant and most important currencies in international trade."
"In a few years' time, 300 million people will have this new national currency which will be used outside the EU as commonly as the dollar is today and with which it will be possible to make payments directly, with no need for currency conversion."
"The euro is already an international reserve and transaction currency and will in future be so to a much greater extent."
"The importance and significance which the euro will acquire as an international currency will, unfortunately, also mean that it will become attractive to organised counterfeiting organisations."
"There is evermore sophisticated equipment available for such activity, which means that counterfeiting is nowadays much less complex than it used to be."
"Against that background, it is important to have comprehensive and effective protection against counterfeiting in place in good time before the euro comes into circulation."
"There will be huge scope for disseminating the euro, extending beyond all frontiers, both within the European Union and between the EU and the outside world."
"Hence, the arrangements for protecting the euro against counterfeiting must take this new dimension into account and also be equipped with a legal framework involving all the EU Member States, institutions and bodies and also relevant international organisations."
"The three legislative proposals for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting with which this report is concerned are mutually complementary."
"Unfortunately, they have their legal bases in two different pillars, the first and the third."
"In the long run, it would be desirable if measures based upon Article 29 of the EU Treaty could be included in Title IV of the EC Treaty so that appropriate decisions for the settlement of issues for which other kinds of measures are unsuitable could be adopted in a unitary fashion."
"The first proposal is an Initiative by the Government of the French Republic and is based on Title VI of the EC Treaty."
"It is concerned, then, with protection under criminal law and with Europol units having to receive the information and intelligence they need in order to perform their tasks."
"The amendments are largely aimed at incorporating wordings that have been forgotten about and left out, as well as at correcting a number of unclear terminological and other points."
"The second legislative proposal, which in a way is more interesting, contains the Council' s guidelines on the protection of the euro against counterfeiting and is based on Article 123(4) of the EC Treaty."
"This legal basis enables the scope of the Regulation to be extended only to those Member States which have adopted the euro as a single currency."
"The proposal is based on the establishment of a system for the exchange of information and for cooperation and mutual assistance."
"My most important amendments are about the necessity of having a Counterfeiting Analysis Centre at EU level and a national centre in each Member State."
"The advisability of setting up a permanent European Technical and Scientific Centre for the analysis and the classification of counterfeit coins is also referred to and, especially, the need for entities engaged in the daily handling of notes and coins for their clients to carry out suitable checks on the authenticity of these."
"Otherwise, it is citizens who are affected, and the latter are completely unprotected when they receive counterfeit coins and notes."
"There is no way in which they can offset such a loss anywhere else."
"How can citizens be expected to carry detection equipment the same size as a large PC around with them?"
"Even if someone is prepared to pay for the equipment - which does not cost a great amount, but costs approximately the same as a PC - it is not practically possible."
"I therefore think it is much more appropriate for notes and coins to be analysed before they leave the exchange entity."
"This is a position which Parliament definitely ought to adopt in order to protect people."
"The third legislative proposal is based on Article 308 of the EC Treaty and is aimed at taking care of those Member States which have not adopted the single currency, namely Great Britain, Denmark and Sweden."
"In fact, they too must of course be covered by the security regulation we are now developing. Otherwise, this will not work."
"I am convinced that people in these countries realise that they too must participate in these decisions."
"They must also realise, however, that, if they are not members of the club, they cannot participate in the decisions on the same conditions as the members."
"However, those who adopt the euro can be party to decisions on the same conditions as other members."
"Those who do not adopt the euro do not, unfortunately, have the same influence."
"The decision as to whether or not to adopt the euro is one requiring strength, and on this point I would call upon my own country, Sweden, to try to summon up the strength to take this decision as quickly as possible."
"It is about nothing other than political leadership."
"For example, we can draw a comparison with France which, at the time of approving the Maastricht Treaty, approved the latter with a smaller majority than Sweden."
"In spite of this, France nonetheless managed to take the decision it did."
"The fact that Sweden, in contrast, did not is something I deeply regret."
"I want to conclude by stating that the proposals in the Council' s guidelines are aimed at guaranteeing effective protection of the euro, and I therefore welcome the proposal in its entirety."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"The reason that I am speaking is purely to support and highlight, if possible, essential elements expressed by the rapporteur of this report, our colleague Charlotte Cederschiöld, whom I congratulate for her rigorous and excellent work."
"I would like to start by pointing out what a revolution it is going to be when the euro appears on 1 January of next year."
"The euro is going to be the ultimate symbol of European identity, and along with the yen and the dollar it will be one of the guiding currencies that will be used not only in Europe but also, as our colleague said, on a global scale."
"It will be the cornerstone on which to build a political union."
"Despite all this, as the euro takes the form of a note or coin, there is obviously the very real risk that there will be attempts to counterfeit it, and as a result, prevention policies are essential."
"With this objective in mind, we need to work thoroughly on the need to train those who will be working daily with the currency, through courses and other measures, especially banks and bureaux de change, so that they are familiarised with the euro."
"They are going to be the key players in detecting counterfeit currency."
"Therefore, and given that the legislative proposals that we are examining today aim to regulate this matter, it is essential both that we have an effective system of police and customs cooperation and that we establish a global information system that includes identifying counterfeit notes, collecting them and sending them to centres that study the method of counterfeiting, the paper used, the ink, the amount counterfeited, etc."
"Finally, I would also like to emphasise the importance of effective criminal protection in order to remove any trace of counterfeiting."
"As I do not wish to dwell on fundamental issues that have already been discussed by Mrs Cederschiöld, such as the inconvenience and confusion caused by having legal instruments that are dependent on different pillars in order to defend the same objective, which is combating the counterfeiting of the euro- I am going to focus on two or three matters that I feel are important."
"One is the reference made by Amendment No 23, unlike the Regulation, which does not allude to it at all, to a counterfeit currency database."
"I think that this is something that would increase the efficiency and accuracy of the battle against counterfeiting."
"With regard to the status of the European Technical and Scientific Centre, which as established in Article 5 of the proposal for a regulation, will channel the fight against the counterfeiting of coins, I would like to stress the need to protect its independence from the Paris Mint from the start, as set out in Amendments Nos 20 and 26."
"The functional link of this body should be solely with the European institutions and under no circumstances with a national institution."
"Finally, Amendment No 27 adds to the original text of the Regulation the idea that I expressed at the start of my speech, which is the key role that those who work with money should play in the battle against counterfeiting of the euro."
"It is important that they be obliged not only to withdraw from circulation any notes and coins whose authenticity is questionable, but also to check for authenticity themselves."
"We are, of course, aware of the suspicions that this requirement could give rise to, as it would require considerable investment in tools, machines and items to ensure that the money is legal, but it is essential from the point of view of protecting citizens."
"It is also a guarantee that the money distributed by these bodies will be authentic."
"I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Cederschiöld on her excellent report and the recommendations contained therein."
"Of course the circulation of the euro will have both positive and negative impacts."
"The positive is that it will be a physical recognition of the Union moving together closely when it actually benefits individual Member States."
"The negative aspect of course is that a new currency is open to abuse and to undermining by the expert counterfeiters that we have already heard of."
"The euro is of enormous importance in the world markets, and therefore it is vital that we move to take protective measures to prevent counterfeiting."
"I am pleased that Mrs Cederschiöld makes such recommendations in her report and I personally and my group support these."
"It is worth noting, on the obligation to make checks at banks and bureaux de change, that she encourages close cooperation between Member States, the European Central Bank, national central banks, Europol and, when established, Eurojust."
"Also, she makes important reference to previous decisions on increasing criminal penalties, and calls for the harmonising of criminal charges and penalties."
"It is absolutely essential that we leave no hiding-place for criminals, who can move very quickly with their information and their expertise from one Member State to another."
"It is also essential to pool and centralise information, and expert analysis when such counterfeiting comes to light."
"Technical assistance to facilitate the coordination of investigations is also needed if we are to track down these criminals across the Member States."
"Equally, I applaud her recommendations to improve and facilitate cooperation between investigative and prosecuting bodies of the Member States, and that every Member State should recognise the principle of previous convictions."
"Whether in the EURO zone or not, I maintain that every citizen within the European Union has much to gain from a stable currency and a currency that can withstand the threats from the counterfeiters."
"Therefore I am extremely pleased to congratulate Mrs Cederschiöld on her report and the recommendations contained therein."
"Mr President, in order to protect the euro against counterfeiting, we are looking this evening at a series of technical measures which, however interesting they may be, will not solve the problem."
"In fact, they even dispose of a crucial problem, which is of a political nature, and which the European Parliament does not seem willing to resolve."
"I shall therefore take it upon myself to do so."
"Once the euro has actually been introduced into circulation, there will be a high risk of counterfeiting, particularly because of the decision that was taken to launch from scratch an entirely new currency which will cause all citizens to lose their points of reference."
"It may have been designed to do exactly that."
"Once citizens have lost their points of reference, there is a high risk that they will accept counterfeit euros, believing that they are the real thing."
"The consequences of this confusion will be made worse by the high face value of some notes, of EUR 100, 200 and 500."
"Yet, who is going to pay the price for this huge risk?"
"The most vulnerable, the most fragile, those who are least well-informed, small businesses, micro-businesses who may find themselves bearing the cost of worthless, forged notes that they have accepted by mistake."
"This situation is unacceptable - all the more so because it is the same people who are being asked to bear the often very substantial costs of changing over to the euro and who will receive absolutely no financial compensation."
"It is, therefore, unacceptable that we today continue to pretend that these costs do not exist and to implicitly accept that they are to be borne by the most vulnerable people."
"We are asking the national and European authorities not to shirk their responsibilities."
"We are asking them to give citizens a guarantee that they will be reimbursed if they accept a forged note by mistake, at least during a transitional period."
"Otherwise, then, we should provide small businesses with free detectors for forged banknotes."
"Some will say to me that we do not have the money to do that."
"I shall reply that we should have thought of this before."
"We must now shoulder the responsibility, in other words, to postpone the changeover to coins and notes until next January - would it matter after everything we have been through? This would, in any case, be desirable for several other reasons."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over a year ago, on 16 February, the European Parliament considered the problem of counterfeiting of the euro, at the time within the context of a common penal framework."
"It was our fellow Member, Mrs Cederschiöld, with her skill and rigour, who drafted the report then and opened our debate on the matter."
"She said that we cannot allow counterfeiting to undermine our single currency."
"This statement is still valid one year later and sums up the fundamental issue: the security of our currency."
"We have all spoken here of the euro' s importance for our Union, of its economic importance as a complement to the establishment of a genuine economic area without internal borders, of its importance as a mechanism that has contributed to budgetary discipline and to the transparency of the Member States' public accounts and also of its political value as a symbol of the European integration that we are developing, taking forwards and consolidating on a daily basis."
"Therefore, for all of these reasons, the security of our currency is extremely important."
"In addition, we know that the currency' s security is also tied up with its stability and its exchange rate, but the approach we are considering today is that of protection against counterfeiting."
"If things do not go well, however, with the other approach, there is all the more reason now not to neglect this fight and to increase our precautions."
"In her report, Mrs Cederschiöld quite rightly emphasises the worldwide importance of the new currency and the undeniable fact that it whets criminal appetites. She states that ""the euro will be in open competition with the dollar for the title of the world' s most counterfeited currency"" ."
"I am sure that Mrs Cederschiöld will agree with me when I say that this is not the competition against the dollar that we wish to win."
"We are aware that the system will be particularly vulnerable during the transitional period, in which the new European currency and the old currencies will be coexisting."
"Lack of understanding, unfamiliarity and the obligation on the banks to promote currency exchange will encourage the counterfeiting of both the euro and national currencies."
"We must also fight against swindling and confidence tricks. We must provide more and better information, especially in my country, Portugal, where surveys show disturbingly high percentages of people not understanding the euro."
"We have seen examples of the educational contribution made by Catholic priests, particularly in the regions: the contribution of the Church and of the local and regional press must be encouraged and supported."
"I also agree with the approach adopted by the Commission in its communication, and with the four aspects that have been identified: training, an information system - cooperation, specifically with Europol, OLAF and the European Central Bank - and protection under criminal law."
"In conclusion, I shall say once again that I do not share the reservations about the coins having national faces."
"I think that the increased risk will be compensated for by a greater sense of belonging and of identification, and will also provide a political response to those who are always quick to criticise excessive standardisation."
"Congratulations, Mrs Cederschiöld!"
"I apologise to Mrs Cederschiöld for mistiming my arrival and arriving after much of the debate."
"We had an opportunity in the committee for me to have an exchange of views with Mrs Cederschiöld about her report."
"I would like to congratulate her on the overall thrust of the report."
"My concerns are twofold, however."
"First, I am concerned about the size of the larger notes, particularly the five hundred euro note that is going to be issued, which is far larger than the largest note in common use in the United States, in the United Kingdom and in Japan."
"It obviously makes it attractive for counterfeiters, if they are going to counterfeit notes, to counterfeit large denomination notes, rather than smaller denomination notes and I am slightly concerned that this very large note will, if you want, make the euro the counterfeiter's currency of choice."
"Secondly, at the same time, of course, it will enable those people engaged in money laundering - I know this is not a report on money laundering, but it is a connected issue - to also move their ill-gotten gains around fairly easily and fairly simply."
"The amount of money that can be put into a small suitcase will be roughly ten times larger than it would have been if we had restricted the currency to smaller notes."
"There is a threat and an opportunity with the introduction of the euro."
"Firstly the threat is the counterfeiting and clearly, if that happens, it will drive people away from the euro, will have dire consequences for its use around the world if people are badly stung by that, but secondly, we have an opportunity at this period of time to actually catch people engaged in money laundering, as they make the change."
"We do not have, or we do not apparently have in place, any mechanism across the European Union to try and take advantage of that opportunity, or to try and deter at the point of introduction of the euro the threat of counterfeiting."
"It is all very well having something up and running later, but if I was organised crime, the time which I would be trying to engage in counterfeiting on a large scale would be around the period of introduction of the euro when you are going to have four hundred million people in the European Union and billions of people around the world who have never been familiar with the notes themselves."
"So I think that there is a threat there and I hope that the Commission and the European Central Bank, although it is probably too late to consider whether to issue a five hundred euro note, will actually consider whether they should issue it at the beginning of the process when there are so many dangers attached to it."
"Mr President, honourable Members, rapporteur, 1 January 2002 will indeed be an historic date, marking as it does the physical introduction of the euro for 300 million citizens in the European Union."
"Obviously, numerous preparations still need to be made and it has been mentioned, not for the first time, that the European Parliament is tackling this."
"The European Parliament has dealt with the preparations and the necessary steps right from the start."
"This report deals with the Commission initiative and the French initiative on the protection of the euro against counterfeiting."
"I should like, on the Commission' s behalf, to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work and to report that the Commission will be happy to include any addenda proposed by the European Parliament."
"I should also like to stress that the regulation is the pivotal and central point of a comprehensive procedure to protect the euro against counterfeiting."
"I should like to remind you that the Commission has submitted various proposals since its communication in July 1998."
"The regulation before us stipulates in particular - I do not intend to go through the whole thing, I just want to mention a few points - that exchanges of information on any counterfeit euro notes and coins discovered will be centralised and regulated."
"Collaboration and mutual assistance between the various players involved at Member State level and the institutions and bodies at European and international level is clearly regulated, as are collaboration with third countries and the obligations incumbent upon credit institutions."
"I should like at this point to highlight once again the importance of Article 6 of the regulation, namely the obligation to withdraw from circulation any banknotes which have been identified as counterfeit or which need to be tested and to pass them to the appropriate agencies."
"It is, of course, particularly important, in the light of the time frame which we are discussing, that the regulation be adopted as quickly as possible and I hope that it will be adopted before the end of the Swedish Presidency, because preparations need to be made as quickly as possible."
"This is the credo which the Commission is passing on to small- and medium-sized enterprises and consumers."
"Any preparations which can be completed today will mean less worry and stress tomorrow and will make the whole project that much safer."
"The Commission intends to take an active part in the subsequent implementation of the regulation."
"This applies in particular to Article 7 dealing with collaboration between the Member States, the Commission and the European Central Bank and with Interpol."
"An advisory committee has been set up to help the Commission here."
"I should like to remind you that this regulation is not the only important measure to protect the euro against counterfeiting."
"Various additional instruments have already been adopted or are currently being prepared."
"For example, a framework resolution relating to criminal law was adopted on 29 May."
"I should also like to mention another measure which is currently being prepared and which the Commission will adopt in a few weeks' time, namely a multiannual programme to provide training, technical assistance and exchanges for officials in order to protect the euro against counterfeiting. The delightfully named PERIKLES programme will also be of considerable importance."
"The euro is indeed an historic milestone on the path towards integration and it offers huge potential for further economic development."
"Of course we always highlight the opportunities here but we do not underestimate the risks attached to the date set for the physical introduction of the euro."
"We are not underestimating the problems, we are tackling them."
"I should like to thank the European Parliament for its support; it just goes to show that we are all working to make this project a huge success."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Illegal substances - Synthetic drugs"
"Mr President, we are now to deal with the issue of synthetic drugs."
"Europe is a world leader in the manufacture of synthetic drugs."
"That is not a fact to be too proud of."
"Large quantities of LSD, amphetamines, ecstasy and other synthetic drugs are produced every day in Europe, either for domestic consumption or for export to third countries."
"This large-scale and often organised production is a blot on Europe' s copybook and undermines our credibility in the international struggle against organised crime."
"This initiative against synthetic drugs ought therefore to be warmly welcomed."
"The proposal is based upon a highly developed method of analysis applied by certain laboratories."
"Synthetic drugs have certain features in common because of the process and methods by which they are produced. Links can therefore be made between synthetic drugs confiscated on different occasions in different places."
"Such information enables the police more easily to identify illegal centres or networks manufacturing drugs."
"The method provides the police and judiciary with an excellent tool for isolating narcotics factories."
"The first decision is about setting up the system of special forensic profiling analysis."
"The Member States are obliged to send samples of certain drugs that have been confiscated to particular laboratories."
"At present, such laboratories unfortunately exist only in Sweden, Germany and the Netherlands."
"The idea is that, as soon as a laboratory in a Member State has the required competence, this laboratory will become part of the network."
"In that way, the relevant skills will be extended throughout the European Union."
"The second decision concerns the actual transmission of samples of controlled narcotic substances."
"The Member States are obliged to allow these to pass through their territory."
"They must be sent in a way that guarantees the greatest possible security so as to ensure that the transported samples are not misused."
"It should also be emphasised that we are talking in terms of milligrams, that is to say extremely small quantities which can scarcely be misused because they are so incredibly small."
"It must be emphasised that the initiative affects only the fight against the large-scale organised production of synthetic drugs, something that is prohibited throughout the EU. It therefore has nothing at all to do with the sensitive debate about what should be readily available on the street, for personal use etc."
"The present debate has nothing at all to do with that. Instead, we are concerned here with the organised production of synthetic drugs."
"It must also be underlined that the system proposed is not definitive."
"It is not perfect in every respect."
"I know that. It would be preferable if every country had its own laboratory for forensic profiling analysis but, because the technique has so far only been developed in a small number of countries, that is not the case as matters stand."
"At the same time, it would nonetheless be a great pity not to make use of the opportunity of getting our hands on those production units that exist within the European Union."
"Regarding the actual transmission system, I take the point also touched upon by certain countries such as France and, especially, Spain, to the effect that it would be good if these samples could be transmitted electronically."
"I completely share that view."
"The report also states that the method of transport must be continually reviewed."
"In my opinion, it would be completely wrong, however, to use such arguments to prevent the system from being introduced right now."
"This Parliament will certainly have an extremely important role to play when it comes to pushing the issue of electronic transmission, but I really do hope that Spain will not use this as an argument for stopping the transmissions."
"That would be deeply regrettable."
"Fortunately, the committee realised this and adopted the report unanimously."
"I am sorry that there are some countries in the Council which have not realised that it is just as well to get started now, for they are in fact slowing down the fight against crime."
"As I see it, it is downright irresponsible to weaken the fight against organised crime, just because we do not have the perfect system."
"It is the same argument we heard just now when we discussed transparency and public access to documents and when Sweden offered Europe a compromise."
"There is now every reason for us to join together in offering just such a compromise."
"I hope that both Parliament and the Council will support this initiative, and I want to thank young Nils Hänninger at the Ministry of Justice in Sweden who has driven this idea forward."
"I also want to congratulate the Swedish Presidency on this decision, which may well be the first binding decision in the area of drugs."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen still present, looking at the Chamber, one might well imagine that drugs pose no problem to Europe and no problem whatsoever to its young people."
"But, unfortunately, they are a problem, and not just any problem; the truth is they are the problem."
"The huge increase in the use of drugs is threatening to destroy part of today' s generation and hence part of our society, while organised crime is threatening to undermine it."
"Drugs help a mere handful of people make a great deal of money in the organised crime sector; but they destroy countless lives and existences."
"I can back up what I have just said with a few figures provided by Europol and the Drugs Monitoring Centre in Lisbon."
"It is estimated that some 8,000 tonnes of cannabis and derivatives, 350 tonnes of cocaine, 60 tonnes of heroin and at least 50 million ecstasy tablets reach the European market every year."
"These are the latest figures available."
"And all of these drugs are taken, by more and more youngsters."
"If I tell you that investigations have proven that some 20% of young people have already used cannabis at least once and that an estimated 5 million young people take synthetic drugs, it should be enough to start alarm bells ringing."
"The producers and traffickers who deal in these drugs are part of organised crime."
"They ply their trade at the expense of young people, which is why we must do everything we can to combat this crime - which, as I said, is part of organised crime - in the Union and internationally with representatives from other countries in the world which are equally affected."
"I therefore welcome the Swedish initiative because it takes a step forward here."
"It is another piece in the puzzle of instruments which we need if we are to be able to make any headway."
"The first initiative on the transmission of drugs for the purpose of analysis and testing is designed to avoid abuse as the result of larger consignments and is a perfect instrument in the fight against drugs."
"Secondly, I think it is most important that analyses be used to check the origin of synthetic drugs."
"Both instruments are essential in the fight against drugs and organised crime."
"What we need to do is to extend the network of suitably standardised, quality laboratories."
"However, this alone would still be too little; we must have cooperation with Europol, which is working on the same agenda and keeps a list of synthetic drugs and similar products used for ecstasy and other amphetamines which are available on the market."
"This means that there will be no loose cannon or parallel work and that work will be carried out in cooperation with Europol."
"The third point which I think is extremely important is that, although the European Union is now an export market for synthetic drugs and candidate countries are buying from it, having become transit countries and countries of destination, we need to make all the instruments at our disposal immediately available to the candidate countries so that we can create a larger area of security, which is our goal."
"The objective, and I know that it is an ambitious objective, is to achieve a drugs-free society."
"It will be no easy task but these measures certainly take us a step closer to this objective."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the first point is that drugs only harm people who abuse them and that drugs taken in moderation, such as alcohol and tobacco, can also be seen as a source of enjoyment."
"Drugs cause harm when they are abused."
"However, I see this rather as a social problem, with drugs acting more as a catalyst, which is why I think that fighting the drugs is not really doing anyone a service."
"That is why the best solution is to allow people to decide the quantity of drugs which they want or do not want to take for themselves."
"I therefore think that this initiative will not be much help."
"In the final analysis, it is just more repression, more powers for Europol, which does very little to help us live our lives as we so choose."
"There is an alternative to this proposal in the form of drug checking."
"Various highly successful drug checking projects have been carried out in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Vienna and Germany."
"The European Drugs Monitoring Centre in Portugal has given drug checking a very good report and it continues to be active in this area."
"That is why I think that we should not agree to this repressive measure."
"In all events, we the Greens shall not do so; instead we shall back the right of the people who wish to consume these substances to decide for themselves."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the fight against the trade in illegal substances and the drugs trade, in particular, an efficient system would not go amiss which would enable us to analyse the trade in the products within the Union in a coordinated manner and to chart the networks."
"But that is exactly where the problem lies."
"Setting up laboratories presupposes that the criteria are sufficiently clear and the procedures transparent."
"However, it appears that there are many unanswered questions surrounding the method, the results of which are said to lead to different validations in different countries."
"The Swedish proposals seem to want to hide the fact that Sweden itself needs a few years yet in order to fully develop its own capacities, but it wants to get the ball rolling at this stage nevertheless."
"At the moment, we are still waiting for the recommendation of the experts from most central laboratories, but we will not receive it before the end of the Swedish Presidency."
"Not everyone in my group will agree with me that this is potentially a sound proposal and that, in time, such a set of instruments could be really useful, whichever way the drugs issue is addressed in future."
"However, it is extremely regrettable that the diligence which Sweden has displayed in this matter is particularly ahead of its time."
"Mr President, Members of Parliament, the Commission welcomes Parliament's proposed resolution and supports the objectives of these two Swedish initiatives establishing a system of special forensic profiling analysis of synthetic drugs and on the transmission of samples of illegal narcotic substances."
"The Commission has been working in this area for some time."
"In particular it has supported research into the development of a harmonised method for the profiling of amphetamines."
"This research project is due to be completed in February 2002 and we hope that its results will be taken into account in future work in this area."
"The objective of the Swedish initiatives is in line with point 4.1.1.4 of the European Union action plan on drugs 2000-2004 which was endorsed at the Feira European Council of June 2000 and so represents a priority for the European Union in the fight against drugs."
"The Commission is also working actively on the implementation of the EU action plan on drugs."
"In the coming weeks, we intend to publish two important texts: first, the Commission will present a communication to Parliament and to the Council on the implementation of the action plan, and secondly the Commission will bring forward proposals for a framework decision establishing minimum rules on drug trafficking."
"The issue of synthetic drugs, as mentioned by several Members, is of particular importance at the moment, both for the European Union and internationally."
"The Commission intends to launch this year a review of the joint action on new synthetic drugs of June 1997, which allows new synthetic drugs to be controlled throughout the European Union and to be made subject to criminal penalties."
"The Commission recently brought forward proposals to monitor informally the non-controlled chemical precursors of synthetic drugs and this is currently being considered by the Council and Parliament."
"We have also presented a resolution to the Commission on narcotic drugs in March 2001 addressing the problem of the diversion of precursors for synthetic drugs and this proposal attracted wide support."
"We have also been active in a meeting in December 2000 on synthetic drugs organised by Japan within the G8 framework."
"All these elements show how important this debate is at world scale."
"Therefore, I would like to congratulate Mrs Cederschiöld for her excellent report and join her in my appeal to pass over what I consider minor difficulties in order to have a quick approval of these two Swedish initiatives by the Council."
"Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0118/2001), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies [14780/1/2000 - C5-0048/2001 - 1998/0323(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mrs Roth-Behrendt)."
"We have two reports concerning the treatment and transport of animals: that will be a very familiar subject for the Commissioner."
"I would like to say at the outset - and I am sure that the Chairman of the Committee will say the same - how much we regret the absence of Dagmar Roth-Behrendt tonight."
"She is one of the most energetic, enterprising and intelligent members of the committee."
"She is the coordinator for our group on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection Committee and, in her general enthusiasm, she is like a one-woman Congress of Berlin."
"She is in Berlin tonight and is to have an operation in the morning."
"I am sure the whole House, even at this late hour, would join with me in wishing Dagmar well, and believing that she will recover with her customary vigour in the very near future."
"Dagmar Roth-Behrendt intended to move one of the two amendments tonight."
"I would like to say briefly why I and my group now believe that it would be for the better passage of this directive if it goes through unamended."
"That would mean, therefore, that we would wish to vote against both Amendments No 1 and No 2: Amendment No 1 for the very simple reason that it smacks of a desire to scuttle back into a form of neo-protectionism, but certainly over-regulation, of animal imports, which is a desirable but unnecessary consequence of the many scares we have had in recent years."
"In my country we are particularly aware of that, but we believe that the OIE code covers trade in live animals and will protect countries which do not have BSE from introduction of the disease."
"Additional measures against imports are not justifiable on health grounds and I expect that the Commission will say the same thing."
"Even more briefly, on Amendment No 2, which did indeed come in my name: at that stage, we tabled this because we believed that if there was to be a vote through this Parliament for tests at twenty-four months in all the Member States quasi-imposed upon them by the Commission, this needed to be amended with a provision that those Member States which already have other forms of testing - or in the case of the United Kingdom, the over thirty-month cow - should not have to go through that procedure."
"Given that the principal amendment fell, it seems to me now that the second amendment should fall also."
"So, from the point of view of my group, we are not supporting any amendments."
"My apologies for the inability of the shadow rapporteur, Mr Trakatellis, to be with us this evening."
"At short notice, I have agreed to try and say a few words on his behalf in relation to this most important topic."
"First of all, I would like to commend all those involved to date from the Commission up through the Council and indeed, back to us, but particularly Mrs Roth-Behrendt, for the personal commitment she has given to this most important issue."
"A year ago, I spoke in Parliament in relation to this particular matter and my views were clearly laid out."
"I think it was 16 May last year, the time of the first reading."
"Not a lot has happened since in one sense."
"In another sense, both politically and scientifically, a huge amount has happened in the whole area of TSE, more particularly if you like, in relation to BSE."
"A year ago, it was the UK, Ireland and one or two other isolated outbreaks of BSE that was concentrating the minds, particularly the epidemic that had been experienced by the UK for some time."
"Since then, as you know, we have had Portugal, Belgium, Holland, Spain, Denmark, Germany, Italy and Austria."
"But we must look at the numbers involved relative to the cattle population in each country to make sense, rather than just to panic the consumer."
"It has been very hard to have a reasonable rational debate on the impact of an outbreak of BSE, be it 3, 4 or several hundred cases at a time."
"It must be taken relative to the cattle population in each country."
"Only this week we hear of reports of outbreaks among the elk in the Colorado regions of the US and of new variant CJD outbreak among young men, young hunters - not the normal age group associated with CJD as we have over the years understood it to be."
"There has also been increased rigour in the reporting of BSE and increased surveillance generally with new testing regimes."
"This is not an indication that the disease is spreading, because we are get increased numbers."
"It means we are being more effective and more efficient in terms of looking for the disease in the various countries."
"That must be spelled out also so that we do not panic the consumer into thinking that the disease is continuing to spread."
"It is not."
"BSE is a disease of older cows, primarily older dairy cows."
"It has a much higher incidence among the dairy herds, than the suckler herds, probably because the dairy men could afford more concentrates traditionally over the years."
"In most countries the milk gave a higher economic return than, for example, breeding beef - certainly that was the experience in Ireland and the UK."
"But at the moment the high risk is with the dairy herd, the six and seven year-old cows and that is why, since I spoke last year, we have had the destruct scheme that was announced on 13 December 2000, if I recall correctly, that will be in place until the end of this year."
"My one big criticism of the destruct scheme is that it did not particularly insist that Member States with a problem targeted the older cow, where the real risk cohort still remained."
"In fact, this scheme was used to underpin the market and the price of cattle, rather than primarily to take out the disease in the older cow."
"I do not mind underpinning the market."
"That could be part of it."
"But it should be secondary to removing the disease and that was not the case and I criticise that particular scheme in that respect."
"We have also learned a lot in the last year in relation to new variant CJD and that patients with a distinct genetic makeup are prone to it, not the entire population."
"We need to say more about that so the public understands the relative impact that it may or may not have."
"It is genetic, its infectious, its degenerative, but there are very, very few cases, given, for example, the number of BSE cases in the UK in the cattle herd."
"We have been eating scrapie-infected sheep for over two hundred years, with no ill effect, and that is because the structure of the shape of the prion, the non-infectious protein, in the sheep, is not compatible to that in the human brain, unlike the rendered cattle or beef prion, that replaces the protein necessary in our brains."
"Again, we have not been telling the story as it is."
"Yes, I agree with an awful lot has been done and we need what is proposed before us here today, but I would rather we use the OIE or WTO standard, so that all countries could agree on the classification, so that what we do in Europe would not be considered a trade barrier by the rest of the world with whom we must trade our meat products and live animals."
"That is my one criticism still that, in this respect, we want to go it alone in Europe, rather than operate a worldwide basis in relation to this."
"Congratulations to all concerned."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Roth-Behrendt has done an extremely good job over a long period when it comes to combating BSE, or TSE."
"We have now finally reached the point at which we have perhaps obtained some control over, and put an end to, the chains of infection which we know exist in this connection."
"I should like to take this opportunity to ask us to think in the longer term."
"Unfortunately, human beings still do not know why, where and when the prion becomes 'mad' or when this prion-caused disease occurs and for what reason."
"The situation requires a certain humility on our part."
"Right now, another discussion concerning animal by-products is being conducted, and it now looks as though a new round of the debate will be getting under way."
"We tried to make cows, which are vegetarian, into omnivores, and that gave us BSE."
"Right now, we are at a point at which I suspect that, out of fear, panic or for other reasons - political populism, perhaps - we shall try to make the pig into a vegetarian."
"It would also be a good idea if we were to give a little consideration to our own history."
"Our forefathers knew perfectly well that animals that had died of natural causes should not be eaten."
"It is in modern times that we have left nature so far behind that we have begun to embark upon such experiments."
"I should like us calmly and quietly to show a bit of humility in the face of the food disasters which have hit us."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what we should do, this evening especially, is to enable the remarkable report by Mrs Roth-Behrendt to be implemented as quickly as possible, in other words, to enable the measures to take effect from July."
"On the basis of scientific knowledge, which is increasing every day, I do believe that the two amendments that have been proposed to us are ambiguous and are more likely to slow down the implementation of these measures than to have a positive impact."
"My group, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, could conceivably support the first amendment, because classifying countries according to the number of suspected cases is a good approach and because the most crucial task is, above all, to monitor the infectious disease."
"Whether or not the countries that feel most vulnerable want to protect themselves, this is not necessarily a form of neo-protectionism."
"On the other hand, Amendment No 2 seems to be slightly excessive, seeking, on the pretext that animals under 24 months do not pose exactly the same problems as other animals, to eliminate the systematic use of rapid screening tests and to allow other countries, particularly Great Britain - the country that initiated this and the most affected - not to carry out systematic screening."
"If that is the intention behind the amendment, we in the Group of the Greens are totally opposed to it."
"Since this debate is evolving continually, I will add that, as Mrs Doyle has just said, we are asking ourselves questions about Canada or the United States."
"No country is today able to say that it is free from BSE or TSE and, more importantly, we should now have screening for sheep, since it is obvious today that the disease was definitely spread from them and that it is better to monitor this type of livestock, which can also pose the same problems that we have had with cattle."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, BSE is the biggest tragedy ever to hit European veterinary, an unparalleled tragedy which will claim an unknown number of victims."
"BSE is a nightmare for the consumers who desperately question the safety of their food, and BSE has dealt cattle farming an enormous blow."
"Today, we are discussing a package of measures which was announced back in 1997."
"This is therefore the appropriate time to thank rapporteur Mrs Roth-Behrendt: her perseverance, her expertise in this field were essential, and without her thoroughness, the Union would not be where it is today."
"Thanks to Parliament' s input at first reading, the common position is, on the whole, acceptable: systematic test programmes, which will also apply to sheep in due course; strict and clear rules with regard to specific risk material; effective inspections especially on imports; and market access legislation."
"All of this is of crucial importance."
"Today, we have to express our trust in the common position."
"This is the policy by means of which we can fight BSE."
"The measures must also be able to count on the commitment in Brussels and in the Member States."
"That is a deciding factor."
"After the increase in the number of BSE cases in France, fresh measures have repeatedly been put in place in recent months, and it was remarkable in this respect that Commissioner Byrne himself stated that food safety as such does not require new measures, but that the measures were particularly necessary to restore consumer confidence."
"With this statement, he was, in fact, vague once again."
"Measures are needed and are no luxury. Let there be no mistake about this."
"Food safety is a very emotional topic and as such, food politics is now partly about the management of emotions."
"Statistically, we can say that food has never been so safe, but that does not convince anybody."
"You cannot restore confidence just like that, not even by encouraging organic farming, or by discouraging large-scale, industrial production methods."
"Confidence can be restored by means of a credible policy and clear language."
"Safety, prevention, control and eradication of BSE now require political commitment."
"The BSE crisis was much more than a very serious food problem;"
"BSE ended up being a political crisis as well."
"It stands for passing the blame and dodging responsibility."
"In this way, BSE became the cause of a complete overhaul of European food policy."
"A European food authority is set up and we re-establish the principles of policy on foodstuffs."
"But our discussion goes further than that, of course."
"We must now take a good look at food production."
"We want a green revolution, we want quality rather than quantity, our agricultural policy can no longer damage the environment, we must move away from protectionism which disadvantages third-world countries, and we must take animal welfare seriously."
"And we should not wait six years to achieve this. Today, we must express our commitment to the BSE policy, and that is, in my view, the go-ahead for a green revolution and for a policy that is based on quality."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Parliament, the Council and the Commission have cooperated splendidly to make the prevention and control of encephalopathy in animals more effective."
"The Regulation under discussion will help in the harmonisation of the legal basis."
"The Regulation takes account of scientific development."
"BSE tests for sheep and goats will be introduced as soon as the testing methods exist."
"The rapporteur is proposing two amendments."
"The first one deserves our strongest support, as it will provide even more protection, especially for those countries where there have been no cases of BSE as yet."
"The transport of animals is the main reason for the spread of animal diseases, which is why inspection has to be effective."
"Our group considers the second amendment to be unclear and for that reason does not support it, especially if the aim is to lower the age limit for BSE tests to animals which are 24 months old."
"This is not necessarily a sensible solution for all Member States."
"In saying this I certainly do not wish to oppose the proposal, if some Member States want to do this."
"Measures in the EU must, however, adapt to the BSE situation prevailing in Member States in compliance with the general policy contained in this Regulation."
"Mr President, although I am not from the same group as Mr Whitehead, I share his thoughts on Mrs Roth-Behrendt, and if she has to have an operation tomorrow we wish her a speedy recovery because in a way she is the driving force behind the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"In any event, she has only tabled two amendments, because the Commission accepted the majority of the amendments tabled at first reading."
"These two amendments, as has already been said by other Members, concern the additional guarantees that some Member States can stipulate in order for animals to enter, and also with the possibility of conducting tests on animals of less than 30 months."
"However, as I come from a small region with small farms that have huge problems, and where there have been some, but very few, cases of BSE, I would like to highlight three issues that I think are fundamental."
"One of them features in Article 6 and refers to the need to train and educate staff working for the competent authorities, staff that work in laboratories, people who rear animals and those who sell them."
"In practice, I have seen that all of these people are faced with a problem that they do not understand and that they do not know how to deal with."
"This training programme is therefore essential, in my opinion, and should be implemented as soon as possible, because it would be a method of prevention."
"With respect to the banning of feed containing animal proteins, as established in Article 9, my opinion is that this ban should now be total."
"Cows should eat grass and this is the best way of preventing what is occurring now."
"There should also be immediate 100% compensation for the animals slaughtered on these farms."
"I have seen how some of the farmers in the region where I live, who had 25 or 30 cows, have very little money left on which to live."
"If all the animals are slaughtered they are left without their livelihood."
"It is therefore essential that the compensation that they have not yet received be paid out immediately."
"I think, Mr President - and I will finish here because my time has run out - that if we wish to regain credibility among consumers, measures like these and others must be implemented immediately and clearly."
"People need to see that measures are being taken in Europe, otherwise it will be impossible to regain that credibility."
"Mr President, although the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has not treated the rapporteur, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, very gently this time, I would nonetheless like to thank her for the excellent work she has done at the various stages of the report."
"The committee adopted the two amendments, the first of which was originally a joint proposal by Professor Trakatellis and myself."
"Its content, in brief, states that Member States in category 1 maintain their right to demand additional guarantees on animals being brought into their territory."
"It does not aim to prevent imports of or trade in animals between Member States, but just to stop diseases from spreading to those countries where they have not yet occurred."
"It is naturally in the interests of the EU as a whole that diseases, including TSEs, are confined to as small an area as possible and prevented from spreading to new areas."
"In our examination of individual rules on the prevention and control of TSE, it becomes ever more apparent that the whole common agricultural policy needs to be reformed, which is to say, certain steps need to be taken to amend it."
"It would be worth seriously considering an arrangement whereby the CAP would set common targets and minimum requirements in such areas as environmental consumer protection and animal welfare, but in which the wisdom of common agricultural aid would be reconsidered."
"Such a model would permit national aid to be granted mainly to promote food safety, environmental cleanliness and the aims of regional policies."
"In my opinion this would be one possible way forward, and one that should be taken seriously, from the current system, which is bad for the taxpayer, the consumer and the environment, and particularly bad for the farmer."
"When the EU was established, the goal of its agricultural policy, in its simplicity, was to guarantee a sufficient supply of food at a time of shortages in an economy just recovering from the war."
"Article 33 of the Treaty is still based on this approach, even though the EU achieved self-sufficiency back in the 1960s and production has exceeded demand since the 1970s."
"We now have to shift the emphasis from quantity to quality."
"Tonight could signal the end of two years of hard negotiations between Parliament, the Council and the Commission on the legal framework to combat transmissable spongiform encephalopathies."
"This is the first major piece of legislation to be adopted following the introduction of co-decision in relation to veterinary matters impacting on public health set out in the Amsterdam Treaty."
"It is both ironic and appropriate that it relates to BSE, as it was the BSE crisis which led to the introduction of co-decision in this area of community activity."
"I would like to pay particular thanks to Mrs Roth-Behrendt, the rapporteur, for her tireless work over the years in pursuing a coherent community approach to the control of TSEs."
"A great many of the key provisions of the Regulation under discussion result directly, or indirectly, from her personal commitment to putting in place a very strong framework to protect our citizens from the threat from TSEs and this is an objective I fully share and I want to join with Mr Phillip Whitehead in wishing Mrs Roth-Behrendt the very best for her stay in hospital over the next couple of days."
"When we started our work on this proposal in late 1998, the majority of Member States considered themselves free of BSE."
"This was still the case in May 2000 when the initial opinion of Parliament, largely endorsed by the Commission, was adopted: The ensuing negotiations with Council remained blocked as Council could not agree on the proposed central role of a scientific assessment for the BSE classification of countries."
"However, after the adoption of new emergency measures for the Community-wide removal of specified risk materials and the introduction of rapid tests for BSE, a compromise on the legal framework came within reach."
"The provision for such a large-scale screening allowed Council to agree to classification by the Commission on the basis of the Scientific Steering Committee opinion provided it was verified by that screening."
"At its first reading, Parliament proposed verification of the scientific risk assessment by statistically valid large-scale screening."
"In its amended proposal, the Commission proposed large-scale screening as a transitional measure for the changeover from the current uniform SRM rules to the classification-based rules of the regulation."
"These two elements allowed the Council to come to a political agreement on its common position in December 2000."
"Apart from leading to the Council common position, the start of the large-scale screening at the end of 2000 had yet another effect: within days Germany detected BSE cases amongst healthy slaughter animals."
"Around the same time, Spain and Italy detected their first cases and a number of BSE cases detected in France also rose steadily."
"Consumer confidence dropped to a record low."
"Faced with this crisis, the position of Council, Parliament and the Commission drew closer."
"Aware of the urgency of the matter and the need for a proper legal framework, in particular in relation to BSE eradication and imports from third countries, an informal trialogue took place prior to the Council adopting its common position."
"During this trialogue, a very solid basis for agreement between the three institutions emerged."
"These were hard but very constructive negotiations proving that the three institutions can work together very constructively on key issues related to public health."
"The Council agreed to additional demands from Parliament increasing the number of tested animals."
"The Commission committed itself to introduce all new measures, adopted under safeguard procedures after the common position, into the regulation."
"The Commission also committed itself to take without delay all necessary initiatives under comitology after entry into force of the regulation."
"Consequently, the common position of Council was adopted by unanimity and endorsed by the Commission."
"This compares with the very sharp differences in approach in the past on BSE-related issues."
"I would finally like to remind Parliament of its resolution of 16 November 2000 on BSE and the ban on animal proteins in animal feed."
"In this resolution, Parliament asked for several protection measures. These included a temporary suspension of the use of meat and bone meal, increasing testing in all Member States and rules for the control of scrapie."
"The TSE regulation, in its current form, provides the framework and, in many cases, the detailed rules for these measures."
"Further amendments at second reading would, however, delay formal action upon this resolution."
"I trust that this House agrees with me on the need for the proper legal basis to be operational without delay and from what some of the speakers have already said, there appears to be a measure of agreement on that issue."
"The debates we have had in Parliament on this subject since last November make this only too evident."
"It is vital, therefore, that this regulation enters into force as soon as possible."
"The Commission is therefore prepared to consider only amendments which would substantially improve the text or correct important weaknesses."
"Neither of the two proposed amendments falls, in my view, into these categories."
"I cannot accept Amendment No 1 for reasons of substance also."
"This amendment, which had already been rejected in committee during first reading, proposes the right for BSE-free Member States to take unilateral action at their own discretion against the import of any live animal."
"This is against the principles of laying down Community rules."
"It is also superfluous, as one of the main objectives of the regulation is to create harmonised rules for the marketing of animals in view of BSE status."
"Nor can I accept Amendment No 2 as it makes the establishment of an epidemiological picture of all Member States more difficult."
"This does not however prejudge future initiatives from the Commission on the basis of this regulation in the light of the experience gained particularly on the aid structure of the cases detected by the current screening, and this can be done by comitology."
"Over 1.3 million tests were carried out on healthy animals aged over 30 months in the first three months of this year."
"These are in addition to the tests on fallen animals and at-risk animals."
"We are rapidly acquiring a hugely improved picture of the true incidence of BSE in the Community."
"If I see any reason in the light of this evidence to reduce the current age of testing, I will not hesitate to take the necessary proposals."
"I would also add, in this respect, that research continues on more sensitive tests than are currently available."
"In conclusion, we are now very close to putting in place the proper legislative framework for the control of TSEs."
"It has taken much time and effort, but the text of the common position following considerable input of all three institutions provides a coherent set of rules and procedures for the future."
"May I just comment briefly on some of the contributions made by some Members a moment ago."
"This particular proposal is compatible with the OIE international standards."
"Furthermore, let me say that I greatly welcome the views expressed by Mrs Paulsen when she made reference to the proposals on animal feed and, in particular, the bi-product legislation."
"Let me comment on Mrs Auroi's remarks on the testing of sheep: I should point out that I am bringing a proposal on random testing of sheep very shortly."
"In the draft decision, we have foreseen as a first step 170 000 tests on sheep from October 2000 for the first year."
"Thank you, Commissioner Byrne."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Movement of pets"
"The next item is the report (A5-0125/2001) by Mrs Jillian Evans, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on the animal-health requirements applicable to non-commercial movement of pet animals [COM(2000) 529 - C5-0477/2000 - 2000/0221(COD)]."
"Mr President, the purpose of this regulation is to ensure consistency by 2002 in the rules governing the non-commercial movement of pet animals, which has been commonly labelled the pet-passport scheme."
"The fact that this proposal has been brought forward by the Commission represents a remarkable achievement in action taken to control rabies."
"The success of the vaccination campaigns against rabies have led to a fall in the number of cases amongst cats and dogs from nearly 500 in 1991 to just 5 in 1998 and it is because of that success that we have seem the partial abolition of the six-month quarantine system in the United Kingdom and Sweden."
"It is the problem of rabies, which has prevented consistent rules being adopted up until now, and so Member States have dealt with the movement of pet animals in very different ways, so I am sure that a uniform set of rules will be very welcome."
"The Commission measures are based largely on the British scheme and they allow for the easier movement of cats and dogs within the EU and certain third countries on condition that they can be identified by electronic chip or tattoo, that they have been vaccinated and that their immunity has been checked more than six months prior to travel."
"The proposal also allows the free movement of insects, fish and some other animals."
"It is very important that there is scope within this proposal for certain Member States to vary the provisions when special circumstances make that necessary."
"The Commission proposed both Article 37 and 152(4)(b) as a double legal base."
"However, as the regulation refers only to pet animals and to the adoption of veterinary measures to protect health, the Environment Committee agreed that the regulation should be based only on Article 152(4)(b) which relates to public health and which covers rabies."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs agreed with this view as again the proposal concerns only the movement of pet animals and its aim is the protection of public health."
"I hope that we can reach agreement on the legal base."
"The key points of debate in committee were first the use of tattoos and electronic identification systems."
"Tattoos can cause problems, they can become difficult to read or they can be altered."
"In contrast, the use of electronic chips are more effective both in terms of identification, but they are also a much more humane method because the animal does not need a pain reliever or a tranquilliser."
"Therefore, in the long-term we believe that microchips are preferable, but we have to take account of the fact that a number of Member States at the moment accept tattoos under their national legislation and so a transitional period of 8 years is proposed by the Committee for the phasing out of the tattoos."
"Similarly, it is proposed that during this transition period the countries which do not accept tattoos as a valid form of identification at the moment can still require electronic microchips only."
"Amendment No 8 refers to the need to state clearly in this proposal that puppies and kittens cannot moved until they have reached the age for vaccination and other requirements because there is misconception about this."
"If this scheme is to be successful, it is crucial that it is operated effectively."
"The use of specified ISO transponders would help achieve this."
"Similarly, the capacity to record the name and address of the animal owner would assist in combating trafficking in pet animals, and clarification of the anti-rabies vaccine is included in the report as well as the OIE International Animal Health Code again for the purposes of effectiveness of the proposal."
"Another issue that we discussed in committee is that of quarantine and the purpose of Amendment No 9 is to clarify that animals from third countries at risk of rabies which are brought into Sweden, Ireland or the UK, the so-called sensitive countries, via another Member State have to remain in that country for at least six months before travelling to those three countries."
"This of course removes the need for quarantine, but it also provides the extra safeguards that those countries require."
"A controversial issue has been that of ferrets and whether or not they should be included in this regulation."
"The Commission proposal includes ferrets in the category of pets which would not require any specific animal health requirements."
"There have been very different views on this, but the view of the Environment Committee is that this would pose an unacceptable risk and ferrets should therefore be removed from Annex I, Part b."
"Finally, it is very important that detailed information is available for consumers and for staff at EU borders to ensure they are familiar with the requirements."
"My aim in drafting the report has been to retain the positive and essential elements of the Commission's proposal whilst at the same time taking account of the requirements of certain Member States."
"We heard a lot in the previous debate about confidence, and confidence in this scheme is essential for its successful operation and the amendments are designed to improve the Commission's texts to this end."
"Mr President, the Regulation before us is aimed at coordinating and facilitating matters for those who wish to travel within Europe with their pets."
"The matter may at first sight appear trivial, but we Swedes remember the Swedish ambassador to Portugal, who has now been retired for a good 20 years, who refused to leave his residence in Lisbon because his life companion, an old Angora cat, would be forced to remain in quarantine for a long period in order to be able to enter Sweden."
"In the first place, these rules are intended to offer protection against rabies, a disease which, in popular belief, has fearful and deeply mystical associations."
"It is not for nothing that, in Swedish, the disease is known by a word also meaning hydrophobia."
"Ireland, Great Britain and Sweden have been free from rabies for quite a few years, and the proposal for a Regulation is therefore, in the first place, of significance for these countries, even though the incidence of rabies has declined throughout Europe."
"We must, however, make sure that the rules are designed in such a way as to provide adequate protection against the spread of rabies to, in the first place, areas that are free of the disease."
"In the wake of mad cow disease and foot-and-mouth disease, cases of rabies in, for example, Great Britain as a result of changed EU regulations would give rise to deep mistrust of the EU as an organisation."
"In the course of dealing with this matter, the legal basis has been changed."
"The change is explained in terms of the fact that the Regulation is aimed at protecting public health."
"Nonetheless, animal diseases too, including those affecting pets, can be very aggressive and cause great suffering."
"Examples include aggressive forms of distemper."
"I should therefore like to ask Commissioner Byrne: do you believe that protective measures in accordance with other EU directives are enough to enable the Member States to take measures to combat infectious diseases that can cause great suffering among domestic animals?"
"For many years, it has been incomprehensible that the rules governing the commercial transport of animals have been less rigorous than for domestic animals of the same species."
"The undersigned therefore submitted a proposal to the committee to the effect that the Commission should review existing legislation governing trade involving animals with a view to attempting to achieve harmonisation with the rules in this proposal for a Regulation."
"This was also the committee' s decision, but I would alert the Bureau and the secretariat to the fact that the wording in the present proposal has been changed on this point."
"Many are of the belief that puppies and kittens cannot be infected by rabies and can therefore cross the borders in Europe freely."
"It is therefore important that the proposal for a Regulation should have been clarified in this respect, especially with a view to reducing the illicit trade in puppies and kittens not protected against rabies that clearly exists at the present time."
"Apart from dogs and cats, ferrets are the only pets that can spread rabies."
"There are now scientific proofs that vaccinating ferrets against rabies is effective."
"According to the Swedish state Institute of Veterinary Medicine, ferrets ought in future to be vaccinated in the same way as dogs and cats."
"In the reading in committee, all mention of ferrets was, however, removed from the list of measures to be taken."
"Reference to ferrets ought, however, to be introduced into Annex 1, Part A, alongside reference to dogs and cats, and, if this is not approved, ferrets should continue to be referred to in Part B as per the Commission' s proposal."
"Completely to omit ferrets is irresponsible."
"We must remember that it is, in particular, children and young people who have ferrets as pets."
"Finally, I want to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Evans, for the sound work she has done on this matter."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Evans, not only on the work she has put in on this, but her very fair and lucid summation of the proposal as it left committee."
"What we have here is that critical balance between public health requirements and common humanity."
"Humanity forces us to consider the suffering of those who have to leave cherished pets behind when they travel throughout the European Union."
"We call this the ""Whisky and Soda"" reform in Britain, not because it was conceived in some drunken evening in SANCO but because those are the names of Commissioner Patten's two dogs which for many years he had to leave behind in France when came back to England and he was the principal sufferer - certainly in terms of publicity - who has brought about perhaps a change of thinking in our part of the world."
"I just want to mention three critical areas: first, the time scale;"
"Mrs Evans has accepted now that we have a time scale for the changeover of 8 years, which seems to me to be effective given the life span of most pets in moving from tattoos with all their weaknesses to a proper system of microchips."
"I do not personally think that in Amendment No 7 where there is a proposal that we have to have an absolutely universal system of ISO standard microchips, that you can expect all animals fitted with a chip to be of that universal variety in the early stages."
"We have to be a little more lenient there."
"Secondly, I am delighted that we have now effective proposals, which I am sure the Commissioner will accept for the quarantining of animals which come from third countries where rabies is endemic - the Indian subcontinent would be a case in point."
"People do move about, their animals move about and we know from other considerations, which are now taking part in another debate on vaccination which is going on with the import and export of foodstuffs, how many things come into and out of the European Community, which are putting us at hazard."
"We do not want that in this case and so it is very important that the quarantine provisions remain."
"Finally, ferrets."
"The Ferret Trust have been following me around over the last few days in a state of great excitement about the provisions on ferrets."
"In the UK, for sure, there are still some doubt whether you can actually prove the vaccination of a ferret sufficiently to be certain that it could be vaccinated and then be safely transferred as a pet from one country to another."
"The Ferret Trust told me, very temperately, that they thought the determination of whether ferrets should be included in the pet passport scheme should be deferred until further research had been carried out and they quote two US authorities, Dr Bruce Williams and Dr Zack Miller, as experts in that field."
"I would happy to go along with that."
"I have nothing against ferrets, but I would think that even a small risk that rabies may be spread by even such an exotic source as this needs us to give further pause for thought and consideration, rather than simply rushing ahead with a proposal about which at least one Member State still has serious reservations."
"Mr President, we should recognise that this report is a celebration of the fact that the war against rabies is being won across Europe."
"This is a disease which has filled people with fear and horror for many years and it is a delight to see the reality of the decline in statistics which shows that the disease is now being eradicated."
"I am also pleased, as Mr Whitehead has indicated, that the suffering and grief felt both by pets and by pet owners when animals have had to be put into quarantine for lengthy periods of time is now being replaced by passports and tattoos, so this is good news."
"On a technical point, I look forward to hearing the Commission's response on the amendments which have been moved about the legal basis for this directive."
"I am also delighted that the basis for the European proposals are those which have already been applied in Britain."
"As Mr Whitehead has said, I have learnt, like he, a great deal more about ferrets than I knew a month ago."
"I am sure the Commission has too."
"I am sure in fact that the Commissioner is a great ferret fancier: if he has not got a house already full of ferrets then I am sure that the many newspaper articles about the virtues of ferrets have encouraged him to fill his house with ferrets I have no doubt they will make charming and affectionate pets and I look forward to them taking their place alongside cats and dogs at the earliest opportunity."
"The decision we made in committee, just a couple weeks ago, about whether ferrets should be included on the list and have passports or not, was one of the most difficult that I have ever made."
"The reality is that ferrets seem to have caused no particular problems."
"One French ferret apparently seems to have been the cause of all the concern about whether ferrets can cause rabies."
"I am sorry about this, but I look forward to a situation where the blood test for rabies antibodies can be verified and approved by the Standing Veterinary Committee and the scope of the regulation can be extended to encompass ferrets at the earliest opportunity."
"In the meantime, we have to accept that if we are to put the fight against rabies as our first priority, then ferrets should not be included on the list at the present time."
"But I look forward to ferrets having the right to roam across Europe, but not just yet."
"Mr President, I will start where my colleague finished."
"I am not particularly exercised about ferrets one way or the other I have to confess, but I rather like the line Mr Whitehead took: we should look again and maybe ask some of the experts."
"There are many of us who are not very up-to-date in terms of what can or cannot be done on ferrets in relation to immunity testing."
"I would not like the job myself."
"I must confess a conflict of interest at the start."
"When I return from Brussels or wherever, be it a Thursday evening or Friday morning, the greatest welcome I get is from my collection of dogs - at least in terms of the noise they make and the length of time."
"Yes, the rest of the family are delighted - a quick ""Hi Mum"", - a head goes up and you might get a hug and then back to the TV or whatever they were doing - but 20 minutes later the dogs are still running round in high excitement."
"So I can really empathise with those who feel passionately about the need to be able to bring animals freely throughout Europe subject to the conditions being laid down today and I welcome the report here before us."
"The Commission measures proposed to allow for the easier movement of cats and dogs within the EU, and a selection of other animals that are classified as pets as well."
"However, the Environment Committee did give the ferrets a knock and that is where it stands subject to perhaps investigating what my colleague Mr Whitehead has said."
"I welcome very much, as others have said, that we can celebrate the success of the anti-rabies vaccination campaign which has allowed us to get to the point we are at today and which allowed initially the UK, Ireland and Sweden to change their quarantine system, thereby giving us the template that the Commission now proposes to extend effectively throughout the EU."
"We must be on guard though about bringing pet animals in from third countries, because any cases of rabies which are found in the EU at the moment come from third countries where rabies is still endemic."
"Let us be very careful about border controls in relation to importing again this horrible disease particularly to countries that are now rabies-free."
"As part of the measures proposed by the Commission, animals will have to be identified by electronic transponder or tattoo, and provide evidence that they have been vaccinated and that their immunity has been checked more than six months prior to travel."
"I have problems with any continuation of the use of tattoos, and the Environment Committee is of the same view."
"I also have problems with ad lib use of transponders rather than standardisation of the transponder and this view is also supported by the Federation of Veterinarians of Europe, the FVE."
"They feel very strongly that only a standard microchip should be used."
"Remember it is 8 years down the line."
"We have plenty of time to sort this out and get things in order."
"The report before us is based on a Scientific Veterinary Committee report written in September 1977."
"This was before the agreed ISO standards 11784 and 11785 came into being, and therefore, before there was true compatibility between products from different manufacturers."
"Since the introduction of standards which can be specified in legislation, as done in the UK pet statute, all ISO standard readers can read all ISO standard microchips."
"Initially, we also thought that microchip numbers could be changed."
"It has never been demonstrated that this can be achieved and technical advice from engineers involved in microchip design and manufacture indicates that it will never be easy or even possible to achieve."
"We must bear in mind that more modern advanced microchips are being designed with authentication programmes which will be even harder to change fraudulently."
"However, the value of the benefit in changing a microchip identification number in a pet animal is unlikely to ever be so great as to warrant the effort and the cost involved."
"Tattoos, however, are much less satisfactory."
"They are difficult to read in small species such as the cat, they are difficult to read in breeds where the ears are cropped, they are difficult for regulatory officers to read in aggressive or apprehensive individuals and they are relatively easy to erase and to change fraudulently."
"I will therefore be supporting very strongly Amendment Nos 6 and 7, even though the need to retrieve the name and address of the owner off the microchip is in some doubt, but I go for a standardisation of the chip, and only the chip not the tattoo."
"Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Evans, and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for their report on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on the animal health requirements applicable to non-commercial movements of pet animals."
"This assembly is well aware of the importance of this issue which concerns all European citizens who are travelling either for holidays or for longer stays with their pets and do not want to leave them behind."
"I do not mean that citizens cannot today travel with their pets, but the different regulations applicable in the Member States to movements inside the Community, as well as movements from third countries, are definitely difficult to understand and somewhat discouraging."
"It is therefore time to establish a common set of rules applicable to the entire European Community, because this issue is directly linked to the free movement of European citizens when they own a pet."
"The centre of gravity of this proposal is of course the rabies risk linked to movements of cats and dogs, the two major domestic carnivore species involved in the transmission of this fatal disease."
"On this essential issue, the proposal is based on the recommendations of the International Zoo Sanitary Code, on reports of the Scientific Veterinary Committee and on the conclusions on panels of international experts consulted on the assessment of the rabies risk linked to movements of domestic carnivores."
"I am most satisfied that the report supports the Commission's general approach on this fundamental question of public health."
"There is unanimous agreement on the safety of the technical provisions relating to the management of the rabies risk, even if a few points of disagreement remain and may need some further clarification."
"Allow me now to address in detail the amendments proposed in the report."
"I will begin with the amendments the Commission cannot accept."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 5, 12 and 13 relating to the legal base of the proposal."
"The report concludes that Article 152(4)(b) of the Treaty is sufficient because the essential aim of the proposal is to protect public health."
"This is indeed true at this stage, nevertheless the Commission considers that measures relating strictly to animal disease with no impact on public health could be necessary in the future, and a double legal base with Article 37 is therefore necessary."
"I was asked by one Member earlier if we have we enough legal base or enough information to prevent other diseases in animals."
"This is one of the reasons why Article 37 is included as a legal base."
"I am aware from other proposals brought before Parliament that there is a general reluctance in Parliament and in the Environment Committee to support Article 37 as a legal base for provisions in conjunction with Article 152, probably because Article 37 is not a co-decision article."
"But I would ask Parliament to reconsider its view in relation to this particular amendment and consider the question in the light of the need for animal health considerations being relevant, as one Member mentioned."
"Hence the need for Article 37 rather than Article 152."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 7 because it goes far beyond the scope of the proposal which is movement between Member States and from third countries."
"This amendment provides an obligation for all Member States in relation to the generalisation of electronic identification of all cats and dogs and the establishment of a database to trace any stray or lost animal."
"On the classification of third countries, the Commission proposal adopts the same conditions for imports from certain third countries whose rabies status is equivalent to that of the Member States as those which apply for internal movements."
"Amendment No 10 suggests imposing on this category of third countries the criteria provided in the International Zoo Sanitary code for the recognition of a rabies-free country."
"This is not consistent with the conditions applicable to internal movements."
"A number of Member States are not rabies-free countries under this definition, even if rabies in domestic animals is under control on their territory."
"This would be a discrimination which is not scientifically sound, and therefore Amendment No 10 is not acceptable."
"Finally, the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 14."
"This amendment would delete ""ferret"" from the list of species which may be moved inside the Community with no veterinary conditions."
"The Commission proposal was based on a risk analysis which concluded that this species has no significance in the epidemiology of rabies in Europe."
"I understand the special concerns with regard to this species because it is a carnivore and does bite, but the simple deletion from the list in Annex I, Part b is unfair to this species, as the only reason is that it belongs to the carnivore genus."
"I should say to Mr Davies that I have discovered quite a lot more about ferrets than I knew yesterday and some of my meetings during the day today, including some of the exotic entertainments engaged some Member States, might account for some of interest that Mr Davies supports."
"I would have been more open to the creation of a new category for ferrets with the requirement for vaccination, which is possible, but no post vaccination test can be foreseen."
"The amendments submitted by the rapporteur and committee, but rejected, were heading in that direction and would have reached, in my opinion, a solution acceptable to everybody."
"The Commission can accept six amendments: Amendment No 4 concerning the commitment for the future on a revision of the regulations applying to commercial trade species;"
"It was with great interest that I discovered in Amendment No 6 a real pro-active position in favour of a generalisation, in the short term, of the electronic identification complying with ISO standard of animals moved between Member States or from third countries."
"Therefore I can accept this amendment."
"In summary, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 13 and 14."
"On the other hand, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 4, 8, 9, 11, 15 and 6."
"To conclude, I wish to once again thank Mrs Evans for her excellent report and her support to this important proposal."
"Thank you, Commissioner Byrne."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Veterinary medicinal products"
"The next item is the report (A5-0119/2001) by Mrs Doyle, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Commission communication to the Council and the European Parliament on availability of veterinary medicinal products [COM(2000) 806 - C5-0105/2001 - 2001/2054(COS)]."
"Mr President, I welcome the Commissioner to the House."
"On welfare, therapeutic and economic grounds, it is essential that European veterinarians have access to the fullest possible range of veterinary medicines to treat all food-producing animals, while at the same time keeping consumer health protection at the top of all our agendas."
"Requirements for the placing of veterinary medicinal products on the market have been harmonised since the early 1980s when Council Directive 81/851 was adopted."
"A series of availability problem have arisen, compromising animals health and welfare across species."
"There is a need for urgent short-term solutions as well as for a broad review of all the legislation involved."
"This is what the Commission proposes and I fully endorse it."
"No veterinary medicinal product can be used in food-producing animals unless maximum residue limits, MRLs, are set up for its active substances."
"A recent evaluation of the EU product licensing procedures observed, and I quote, ""significant concern in the veterinary sector about the decreased availability of established medicinal products for food-producing animals as a result of the introduction of the MRL requirements."""
"The issue was brought to a head at the end of 1999 with the expiry of a transitional period for fixing MRLs for established drugs."
"In many cases, the lack of adequate economic return has been an important factor in the failure of sponsoring companies to commit the necessary resources to generating the data necessary to satisfy EU regulatory requirements for fixing MRLs."
"Many pharmaceutical companies have been spending up to 25% of the research budget in defending their products."
"In its communications the Commission announces a number of short-term measures, the extrapolation of MRLs, and medium-term actions such as incentives for industry, more flexible rules for the use of products and the revision of the existing legal instruments."
"They announced these measures to increase the availability of products."
"These actions are to be welcomed and, in particular, the extrapolation of MRLs between species that could help to maintain on the market many products intended for minor species."
"The MRL problem gives rise to greatest concern in these minor food-producing species, such as horses, goats, rabbits, fish, bees - minor in terms of their economic importance for the pharmaceutical companies, hence their lack of defence of the various veterinary products required."
"But major species have also been affected."
"In my own country, Ireland, there is no legal local anaesthetic to use on cattle at this point in time."
"Every country can point to a major species where a drug has been taken off the market, not because it is not available somewhere in Europe, but because there has not been a marketing authorisation for that particular Member State."
"Hence, the point I am making - and the Commission also shares this view - is that we need a pan-European system whereby a product authorised properly in one Member State can be used throughout the EU."
"I would also encourage Member States to develop this system as quickly as possible, because it will be part of the short-term resolution of the crisis, and I use that word advisedly, that exists at the moment with the availability of veterinary medicines on the ground."
"Many new Member States have been pressing the Commission for some time to deal with the availability problem, taking particular account of the unique situation of horses."
"None of the other minor food-producing species I have mentioned exhibit similar features as the length of the life span, sections of the industry not being oriented towards food production, high monetary value of individual animals and the recreational and sentimental value."
"A further complication is that three DGs are involved in all of this: ENTR, SANCO and indeed AGRI."
"In December 1999, DG SANCO proposed to allow the veterinary use of substances without MRLs in horses, provided records of treatment are kept and horses do not enter into the food chain before six months after use."
"Provisions relating to the equine passport were modified through Decision 2000/68 but it subsequently ran into legal problems."
"Passports are now obligatory for all horses and contain a new annex for recording of veterinary treatments."
"Directive 81/851 and Council Regulation No 2377/90 are however still to be amended to allow such use."
"I am very aware of the concerns of the horse industry, particularly the thoroughbred industry, and I do not have to remind the Commissioner that if a full and up-to-date range of therapies is not available, there is a real risk that foreign investment in stud and training establishments throughout Europe will be lost to third countries."
"Having said that, it cannot be ruled out that any horse could enter the food chain at the end of its useful life and therefore safeguards are necessary to cover this aspect, as I have already mentioned."
"In conclusion, I would urge the Commission to ensure that as quickly as possible we have a short-term resolution to the crisis for minor food-producing species in relation to the availability of state-of-art veterinary medicines."
"It is a welfare issue, it is a therapeutic issue, it is an economic issue, and it is in every Member State of the EU."
"We urge the Commission to move as quickly as possible to amend the necessary regulation, to allow extrapolation, the use of passports for horses and to resolve the problem."
"Like the rapporteur, I come from a country where we do not eat horses - people ride them but they do not eat them, the same as in the UK - and therefore I find it difficult to comprehend."
"But I suppose there are other traditions in Europe, like eating foie gras, which is distasteful, because you also have to consider how the animal is reared, in humane conditions or not, how is the animal transported etc. With foie gras it is a much more cruel exercise and much more distasteful than eating horses because, at least in most cases, the horses have a better life than the unfortunate geese."
"But it is clear that in some European countries horses are produced for human consumption - in the Benelux countries, France and Italy, there is quite a large consumption of horsemeat - and we have to take this into account."
"As far as I can see, no distinction has been made, either by the Member States, or by the EU legislator, between horses raised for the purpose of meat production and horses raised for recreational purposes."
"In relation to the access to medical and veterinary products for horses, we also have to take into account the whole issue of animal welfare problems."
"When we look at horses that have been used for recreational purposes that end up going into the human food chain, it is essential that a precautionary approach is taken to ensure that public health and consumer protection take priority."
"Even though horses are not initially reared for human consumption, they do end up in the human food chain."
"It is extremely important we have viable and traceable means to ensure that farmers observe any preslaughter waiting-time periods, in particular concerning recreational horses entering the chain for human consumption."
"It is an extremely important issue because although it will not affect people in Ireland and the UK - because we do not eat horses - it will in other countries."
"It is important that there is a balance between animal welfare and the need for consumer protection."
"On behalf of the Commission, I would like to thank Mrs Doyle and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for this report."
"There are many different perspectives to be reconciled."
"Unfortunately, no satisfactory solution has yet been found."
"The communication aimed to present the Commission's view on the problem of veterinary medicine availability and noted with satisfaction that the committee and the rapporteur share the general concerns of the Commission on this issue."
"This communication clearly does not bring a direct solution; however, it outlines the options for further action in both the long and short term."
"It is important to point out that the current veterinary and pharmaceutical legislation provides a framework designed to ensure, amongst other things, the optimal protection of consumer health."
"This legislation is currently being reviewed."
"This review will provide a timed framework to further address the availability problem for all animal species concerned in a global manner."
"Any proposal for change to ease the access to the market of veterinary and pharmaceutical products, or to facilitate the use of certain medicines by veterinarians, will be in the interest of animal health and welfare."
"However, it goes without saying that any of these proposals will have to be compatible with the objective of consumer health protection."
"With this end in mind, I am cooperating with colleagues, Mr Byrne, in particular, and I expect the legislative proposal to be finalised within a few months."
"This will allow an in-depth discussion with the European Parliament and the Council on all relevant matters."
"Obviously, these legislative changes will take some time."
"The Commission has therefore also announced its approval of the principle of extrapolating maximum residue limits established for some species to other species."
"Such an exploration would only be possible under certain conditions."
"While we recognise that extrapolating maximum residue limits cannot be a global solution, we believe that it can represent a practical improvement of the situation, particularly in the short term."
"However, it also raises the complex technical issues, in particular the link with the possible illegal use of certain substances."
"Thus, a need for appropriate analytical methods of control will have to be considered."
"I am hoping that the further work in close cooperation between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission will lead to a balanced solution, offering a framework for genuine benefit to animal health, while maintaining a high level of consumer protection."
"Thank you, Commissioner Liikanen."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.10 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Mr President, as you know, today is the eleventh World Press Freedom Day."
"Many of our fellow Members would certainly wish to take this opportunity once again to state their solidarity with this struggle, a struggle, furthermore, which is proving successful, because, according to the Reporters sans Frontières association, fewer journalists are being imprisoned and fewer media outlets are being censured than a year ago."
"Nevertheless, the list of sources of pressure and oppression against journalists is a long one."
"Amongst the states which 'Reporters sans Frontières' accuses, such as Burma, Syria, China, Ethiopia, Tunisia and many others, we can now increasingly add various mafias, terrorist groups and fundamentalist movements."
"Just in the last few days, we were saddened to learn that Brice Fleutiaux, the French reporter who had been held hostage for several months in Chechnya and on whose behalf we intervened, was unable to overcome the depression that affected him as a result of his incarceration, and took his own life."
"I therefore believe that this Day must be an opportunity to give impetus to our collective commitment to this essential element of democracy."
"That is indeed the case, Mr Wurtz."
"We have certainly taken account of the statement you have just made."
"I have taken the floor today to call on the Presidency to send a letter, or take any other measure it deems appropriate, with regard to what is happening to Afro-Colombian communities on the Pacific coast of Colombia at the moment."
"Together with a group of other Members of Parliament, I wrote to Colombia in December, because these Afro-Colombian communities were being threatened. The day before yesterday, seven members of these communities were murdered."
"I am in possession of the details of the names and ages of the victims. However, the most serious aspect of this situation is that hundreds of other members of these communities are still being threatened."
"We do not have the time to write to Mr Pastrana again."
"I therefore believe that it falls to the Presidency of Parliament to raise awareness of this problem and ensure that these killings cease."
"I appeal to you, Mr President, to arrange for letters to be sent from the Presidency to Mr Pastrana and to the European institutions to draw attention to the situation and to try to prevent even worse abuses."
"Thank you very much Mrs González Álvarez."
"As you often play a leading role in defending human rights in America and elsewhere, I am sure you will understand that Parliament is always very concerned about problems of this nature."
"I will pass the matter to the Presidency, so that it can approach the government of Colombia and efforts can be made to tackle and resolve this very serious matter."
"Stability and convergence programmes"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0127/2001) by Mr Katiforis, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the annual assessment of the implementation of the stability and convergence programmes."
"Mr Katiforis has the floor for seven minutes."
"Mr President, the stability and convergence programmes being evaluated today by Parliament constitute the second updates of the original programmes first presented in 1999 by the 14 Member States, with the exception of Greece, which submitted its first programme this year."
"Allow me to start with Greece' s programme, which addresses circumstances with which, as is to be expected, I am perfectly familiar."
"The programmes form part of the control and discipline mechanism of the stability agreement, an agreement on budgetary prudence, the two main objectives of which are to ensure that the budgetary deficit does not exceed 3% each year and, secondly, to achieve a balance or surplus over the period of a full economic cycle."
"If anyone had said back in 1993 that Greece would achieve these objectives in just 7 years, they would have been laughed at."
"Greece' s middle name was inflation - 13% in 1993 - and deficit - over 14% of GDP in 1993."
"It was the example to be eschewed in the European Union."
"Few believed that it would be able to resolve these problems."
"Yet, by the end of 2001, Greece - and the Council agrees with this - is expected, instead of a deficit, to have a surplus of half a percentage point of GDP, rising to 1.5% in 2002 and 2% in 2003."
"Also, instead of 13%, inflation is expected to be a mere 2.3%."
"I appreciate your allowing me to dwell on these figures a little because Greece' s espousal of the culture of price stability and budgetary stability was perhaps the jewel in the crown of this policy throughout Europe."
"The spectacular turnround by this Member State, which succeeded in meeting the Maastricht criteria, is a typical example of the general climate of monetary and budgetary stability which has prevailed in Europe thanks to everyone' s efforts to support the single currency."
"The motion put to the House by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs acknowledges and commends the achievement of budgetary discipline and price stability."
"It points out that inflation was slightly above the ceiling set by the European Central Bank as the result of outside influences (oil prices, depreciation in the euro against the dollar), rather than internal economic weaknesses."
"It also points out that a balanced budgetary position, and hence monetary stability, can only be achieved in the medium-term on the basis of a robust European economy centred on a high rate of growth in production."
"The average rate of growth was 3.3% in 2000 with Austria at 3.5%, Finland at 5.2%, Greece at 4.1%, Ireland at an astounding 10.7%, Luxembourg at 8.3%, the Netherlands at 4.5%, Portugal at exactly the European average of 3.3%, Spain at 4% and Sweden at 3.9%."
"Unfortunately, these rates of growth are unlikely to continue."
"High oil prices, high interest rates and the slowdown in the American economy have caused initial forecasts to be revised downwards to between 2.4% and 2.8%."
"So we cannot expect the same level of comfort or budgetary surpluses this year as we enjoyed in 2000, not that this means that there will be deficits."
"The main thing is to be well organised and to use public money to support growth, especially if we bear the long-term targets set in Lisbon in mind: full employment within ten years, an increase in the working population to 70%, an average rate of economic growth of 3%, reform of the social state and a European economy at the forefront of the knowledge-based economy."
"The stability programmes presented indicate that the Member States are aware of these needs."
"They have used their surpluses to repay public debt, reduce taxes and increase public investment and, in the longer term, to stabilise the state pension system, which has also become an important consideration, with some resources being directed towards a reserve fund."
"All these ways of exploiting strong fiscal positions are worthwhile and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs supports them, but not to the same degree."
"The Council considers the reduction of public debt as the main priority; it does not object to public investment, provided that it does not interfere with reducing debt, and it appears to oppose tax reductions."
"We, on the contrary, consider the achievement and the manner of use of primary surpluses not as a matter of dogma but as a matter of political expediency, to be judged according to current conditions and the needs of economic management."
"In the current situation, characterised by the menace of a serious recession in the US economy, as well as the persistent need to raise the rate of growth in Europe, debt repayment as well as tax reductions seem to us of lesser importance than financing public investment, naturally in balanced budgets, not deficits, both for supporting flagging growth and for pushing forward those structural changes necessary for the transition to a modern, technologically pioneering, full employment economy in Europe."
"It should not be forgotten that the absorption of high rates of unemployment presupposes the consistent achievement of a 3% rate of growth, a target which cannot be said to have been met on a permanent basis in our economy."
"Finally, I should like to address a request to the Commissioner, because the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is concerned about the Union' s continued failure to make available to the appropriate committee in Parliament the detailed technical evaluations of each programme and it reiterates its call for a more harmonised timetabling of submission of the programmes by the Member States in order to improve comparability, calling in this context for full and timely involvement of the European Parliament."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking Mr Katiforis for his report."
"What exactly is this report about?"
"In May 1998, resolutions were passed making economic and monetary union a reality."
"At the time, economic and monetary union and the introduction of a European currency were irreversible."
"What were they based on back then?"
"First, the independence of the European Central Bank, in order to safeguard monetary stability and, secondly, the Stability and Growth Pact, the purpose of which was to ensure that the European currency cannot be jeopardised by the budgets."
"Because our first objective in introducing the European currency - and this is particularly true of my Group - was a stable currency for Europe."
"We now have before us Mr Katiforis' s report on the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"We must remember what this Stability and Growth Pact calls for."
"It calls for balanced budgets and for countries which are still overly in debt to achieve a surplus."
"At the time, when we were discussing the Stability and Growth Pact against the backdrop of the Maastricht Treaty, the important thing was not to exceed a new net debt level of 3%, which was the entry condition at the time."
"Today, the important thing is to achieve a balanced budget or a surplus."
"So what news on this front?"
"The first item of news is positive: in the euro zone, i.e. in the twelve countries which have introduced the currency, which we also refer to as the European home market, we have on average, I repeat on average, balanced budgets."
"That is one very good point."
"On the other hand, however, we must face the facts."
"We achieved this objective in a period of growth which we shall be unable to match next year, namely with growth of 3.4%, i.e. in a fat year for the purposes of economic policy."
"The Bible exhorts us to save in fat years for the lean years ahead."
"Secondly, there were the UMTS licences, which gave our finance ministers a windfall."
"Thirdly, we must bear in mind that we have age pyramids in store for us and that we need to make provision for the expenditure in store for us here."
"I am firmly convinced that we have failed to grab this opportunity, we have failed to make proper use of this positive climate."
"What especially worries me is that some countries still have a very high level of overall debt and that, in some cases, these debts are still somewhat short-term in structure."
"We must face up to these risks."
"Which is why we also need to call for the consolidation efforts which have started - and which are impressive in some countries but insufficient in others - to continue."
"I have to say that my own country, Germany, gives me cause for concern, because our rate of growth is below the average in the euro zone."
"Nor have we managed to balance the budget, despite the huge windfall from UMTS licences in Germany."
"Now to my group' s stand on the Katiforis report."
"We can support it, as it now stands."
"However, we are concerned about two proposed amendments, both on the same subject, namely that investments should be excluded when calculating the Stability and Growth Pact margins."
"We agree that investments are needed and that budgets should be restructured towards greater investment, but within the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact, which is why, unfortunately, we shall have to vote against the Katiforis report if these proposed amendments attract a majority in the House."
"Mr President, my Group backs the rapporteur, who has clearly illustrated that the convergence and stability programmes are extremely valuable when it comes to forging real economic policy in the European Union in general and the euro zone in particular which is a matter of common interest."
"We see the outlines of economic policy on the one hand, but we see the stability and convergence programmes on the other."
"I should also like to remind the House in this context that the Stability and Growth Pact has predominantly been geared in the past towards achieving stability."
"It did, however, always include growth factors."
"From this point of view, the rapporteur' s approach is the right one, indicating as it does that it makes sense to use investments, both private and public, in order to achieve a real knowledge-based society of the future in the European Union."
"If these public-sector investments are used for the benefit of information technologies, other new technologies and a better, modernised infrastructure in the euro zone and the European Union, then this is the right way forward."
"From this point of view it is also very important that we restart the debate on the quality of public finances."
"Luckily, the Commission has presented a paper here which will need to play an important part in future discussions in connection with stability and convergence programmes."
"Because we must ensure when evaluating the state of public finances, which is also our job, when analysing the content of the convergence and stability programmes, that we identify the right trend, that we identify the right development, but that we do not lose sight during our discussions of the possibility of steering in the opposite direction."
"Mr von Wogau, you referred to possible dangers."
"You pointed out that advice in the Bible on lean and fat years should still be seen as relevant by financial policy-makers in the European Union."
"Any analysis of public finances, however, must also consider what impact expenditure may have on monetary policy."
"We therefore need to work with sound public finances in the euro zone because a poor financial situation could jeopardise monetary stability."
"Windfalls have not been spent on consumption as in past years; they have also been used to reduce debt and for investments."
"We must also consider how this sort of economic policy coordination can be used to guarantee social and employment policy as well as monetary stability."
"Here too there is both an obligation and a challenge for the countries in the euro zone, the pre-ins and future candidate countries alike."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate provides us with an opportunity to consider the present state of the European economy. Although this was generally encouraging in the year 2000, and we have enjoyed high growth rates, job creation and monetary stability, many hard questions have now to be asked concerning the development of these factors."
"Consequently, considerable pressure will be exerted in some countries, as is already the case in the European Union as a whole, to move towards more expansionist policies."
"Obviously, such a move could come into conflict with the commitments given within the stability pacts relating to Member States."
"These are the sections highlighting the need to maintain budgetary discipline and to avoid undertaking to reduce taxes, a promise often given in the run-up to elections, unless corresponding balancing measures are adopted. We also endorse something Mr Katiforis is constantly stressing, namely that there should also be balancing measures for productive investments."
"I would like to end by highlighting the need to maintain this coordination and the agreements established in the stability programmes. I also wish to point to the need to strengthen control of economic and monetary policy."
"We believe this is still unduly fragmented. Obviously, the capabilities and coherence of the management will be put to the test when it is presented with greater problems in the future."
"Mr President, as Mr Katiforis said introducing his admirable report, the facts before us reveal a state of affairs which nobody would have predicted a decade or so ago."
"It is a matter of great satisfaction to everybody in Europe and in this House that this should be the caseso, although I dare say it is wise to be, as both he and Mr von Wogau are, only cautiously optimistic."
"Pride often comes before a fall and we had better not be too proud too soon."
"I agree very much with what Mr Katiforis said about the question of public investment."
"The United Kingdom seems to have adopted an attitude of quite excessive horror about public investment, and I noticed that in yesterday' s Guardian newspaper Mr Bob Kiley, who ought to know, was predicting that the London Underground for which he is responsible, will, because of the Government' s insistance on the 'public-private investment partnership' whereby only private financiers are to come forward to invest, make the Tube worse and more expensive than it would have been under a programme of sensible public investment."
"I only wish that Mr Katiforis' words would be attended to in my own country."
"As has been said in the course of the debate, there is a matter of serious concern about the future pension liabilities of all the Member States."
"I speak with a certain interest since my own next birthday will be my sixtieth and I would be very glad, therefore, if we were to carry Amendment No 4 recommending the creation of special funds to deal with the future overhang of pension liabilities as that is one of the troubles that may beset us."
"But I welcome the report on behalf of my group and give Mr Katiforis our thanks and support."
"Thank you very much Mr MacCormick. We would like to wish you a happy birthday in advance, and trust these problems will have been resolved by then."
"Mr President, I did support Mr Katiforis' s efforts to give a bit of an impetus to our resolution on economic policy."
"In the end, however, the report that we voted does not provide any real options and that is why my Group does not support it."
"The Union' s economic policy stands out for its passivity and its dogmatism."
"The Council, the Commission and the Central Bank are quite content and will not move an inch and the European Parliament has not managed to take up the challenge."
"Our economic policy is demonstrating passivity in the face of a situation that is growing worse and in the face of the criteria that we would have to meet to ensure the sustainable development of the European Union."
"The Central Bank tells us that, in the short-term, it should not intervene, since it is concerned with the medium-term."
"With regard to the medium-term, however, it refers us to the structural reforms."
"To put it plainly, monetary policy and budgetary policy must serve neither regulation of the present economic situation nor sustainable development."
"This is clearly absurd."
"What, however, do we say about it?"
"We do not manage to come up with anything significantly different, despite Mr Katiforis' s efforts for public and private investment, highlighting the current situation of under-investment."
"In his explanatory statement and as he has repeated this morning, Mr Katiforis insists on the fact that public investment must take precedence over the concern to reduce public debt."
"The position we have finally adopted, however, is dogmatic with regard to public finances and to the stability pact."
"Mrs Randzio-Plath has spoken this morning, and not for the first time, on the quality of public finances and taxation."
"I think that this is the way forward."
"The reality of the situation, however, if you look at all of our resolutions and texts, is that they are all concerned with reducing taxation and with reducing public and social spending."
"We are not succeeding in implementing this line of reform, which is intended to bring about a qualitative improvement."
"Take, for example, our resolutions on reducing social security contributions coupled with wage moderation."
"Our social and public spending contributes to keeping workers poor."
"We are subsidising low-paid jobs and when it comes to expenditure, we know that massive public investment is needed and that public money is essential to make this investment, but we do not want to suffer the consequences."
"It is the structural reforms that are given the most prominence, reforms that were conceived solely as a form of deregulation, as a sort of panacea, whereas in reality, the new problem, which is the new economy, is an organisation of the market designed to achieve sustainable development and social cohesion."
"This requires a large contribution from public funds."
"We talk about lifelong training, but we have no policy in place in this field and where aid for energy policy is concerned, we have made no progress at all."
"The same thing applies to transport policy and as for an industrial policy, we simply have none."
"All of this would require a real increase in investment."
"Ladies and gentlemen, if we wish to give economic policy its rightful place in Europe, I hope that, in addition to the first strategies that I mentioned just now, but which have not achieved success, we can prove that we are up to the task of making it a reality."
"Mr President, I support economic cooperation within the European Union."
"It is important if the internal market, and more particularly the single currency, is to operate effectively."
"From an Irish perspective the stability programme is central to the budgetary process."
"A most recently updated programme adopted last December was framed against a prospect of strong but moderate economic growth and in the medium to long-term the Government intends to continue to run significant budgetary surpluses reflecting economic good sense and our obligations under the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Needless to say, I fully support the policies being pursued by our Minister for Finance."
"We believe that government debt in Ireland will be reduced to around 25% of GDP by the year 2003."
"We are allocating at least 1% of GDP annually to build up the pension reserve fund so as to provide for our ageing population."
"In relation to price inflation, which is one of the issues addressed in the Council' s recommendation to Ireland, it is important that we are clear on the following key statistics: the latest figures show that inflation as measured by the harmonised European index has fallen from 6% last November to 3.9% this year."
"Our inflation rate is now lower than that in a number of other EU Member States."
"In conclusion, as regards the future of Ireland within the European Union, we are fully committed to the operation of the internal market and to the single currency."
"We want to make both these key projects a real success within the Union, and we support enlargement."
"I am actively canvassing for a yes-vote in the referendum which I hope will be carried."
"Mr President, over the past year, we have seen a slight improvement in the budgetary situation."
"That was, however, not due to the policy adopted but rather to incidents and unexpected strokes of luck, such as stronger economic growth and the auction of UMTS."
"The favourable economic tide should have been used to bring about reforms."
"There is not so much a need for new initiatives as there is for the implementation of politically-inspired objectives."
"The areas which require attention are clear: reforms on the labour market, fiscal reforms, liberalisation of the utility sectors and greater incentives for entrepreneurship."
"At 2.6% in March, inflation is still far too high. Interest rates cannot be lowered as a result."
"Whether you like it or not, the ECB' s objective is price stability."
"Moreover, the real interest level is low enough to offer an incentive for growth."
"The risk of price increases upon the introduction of the euro is another reason for the European Central Bank to maintain interest at its current level."
"Both growth, wrongly expected by some from the ECB, and a better functioning internal market, will need to be achieved in and by the Member States themselves."
"The call for more coordination of the economic policy is then not the most effective approach."
"The stability and convergence programmes are right to confine themselves to the monetary policy."
"In short, the rapporteur' s call for an acceleration of the structural reforms receives my unqualified support."
"Mr President, we have all seen the European indicators."
"Economic growth in Europe is slowing down. The reasons include rising oil prices and higher interest rates, which are already dampening company profits."
"We now have a choice of several measures designed mainly to bring about higher rates of economic growth in Europe."
"Under no circumstances, however, should we simply increase public investment."
"We need more forwards on the European economy team."
"There are too many defenders on the playing field and too many reserves who never even see the ball, which is why I think that, first and foremost, we need to improve the framework conditions for our working population."
"Overly high tax rates must be reduced so that it pays to work in Europe."
"National budgets must be reorganised mainly by reducing bureaucracy rather than adding to the burden on our people."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, may I start by pointing out once again that there is a connection between the 1 January 2002, when notes and coins will make the euro a tangible reality for all our citizens, the Maastricht criteria and the Stability and Growth Pact."
"That we now have a stable euro for the whole of the euro zone is due both to the steady hand of the European Central Bank and the fact that the Stability and Growth Pact was the right pact."
"For me, reducing debt means taking responsibility for the future."
"For me, reducing debt and reducing the deficit each year mean a radical change of policy, because for years now we have sold the future down the river in our economic and budgetary policies, using the young generation in each country as packhorses, rather than lifting the burden from their shoulders and opening up future prospects through balanced budgets and surpluses."
"The Stability and Growth Pact is therefore a question of responsibility for the future."
"On the other hand - if we are to be perfectly honest - it is a really successful binding framework to guard against covetousness and opportunism in day-to-day politics."
"It is also an important framework to guard against political misconduct in day-to-day politics and it is also an important framework for a proactive financial, budgetary and economic policy debate in our Member States."
"Since the euro, since the Stability and Growth Pact, budgetary policy is talked about far more openly, the deficit is talked about far more openly, the connection between budgetary, financial, economic and structural policy is talked about far more openly and the necessary reforms are being implemented proactively in order to achieve a different objective."
"One group is not being played off against another, which is why I am delighted - and I trust that I shall not be misunderstood now that several growth figures are back for discussion because they are being revised - that we are also debating the Stability and Growth Pact and the convergence criteria in the Chamber at the moment, because it shows our people and the public - including politicians - that changes to growth figures do not mean change to the stability and convergence criteria."
"The Stability and Growth Pact is not a day-to-day short-term political football and it cannot be changed as and when it becomes difficult to implement and take the next step."
"Nor is there any place for lassitude in making adjustments."
"I should like to call on everyone to put an end to the lassitude which has set in."
"More structural reforms are urgently needed because we need to move from one-off effects to sustainability."
"We need to reduce taxes, but not at the expense of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"We also need to ensure that lip service - and this comment is addressed to the Council - to more radical reforms in pensions and extending the three pillar model at European level is at last followed by deeds so that we can continue on this path to success."
"Mr President, I want first of all to welcome Giorgos Katiforis' s report."
"It is regrettable that some aspects were deleted in committee and perhaps all those may be restored in today' s vote."
"I would particularly welcome the proposal for a special pension fund by Member States."
"It is an issue which has been addressed in Ireland over some years and has now been put in place."
"Substantial amounts of money are now in a fund which will guarantee pensions long into the future, and this is a very positive development."
"I make that positive point because I am going to be quite critical of the Irish Government' s position in relation to the broad economic policy guidelines."
"For the first time ever an EU state was criticised unanimously, indeed reprimanded, by Ecofin."
"This was unfortunate, not because it was not necessary, but because we should not the EU find ourselves in such a position that simply feeds euro-scepticism in Europe, particularly in the country which is so reprimanded."
"Now the Commission has published its guidelines for 2002, all Member States, including Ireland, should openly negotiate its position, make it clear to the public at home what their position is, so that when the time comes and budgets are being implemented based around those guidelines, the public knows exactly why that is being done."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the action taken by the Commission and Ecofin against Ireland was hasty and excessive."
"It has damaged the EU and EMU - not just in Ireland, as has been pointed out previously."
"It has put additional wind into the sails of the opponents of EMU in the countries outside the euro zone."
"'That is how much the national freedom to determine one' s own financial and tax policy is worth,' the opponents of EMU in my homeland cheerfully chuckle."
"You will no doubt soon hear Herman Schmid express something similar."
"There is an alarming tendency towards complete centralisation within the Euroland countries."
"The relative weakness of the euro against the dollar seems to have triggered a number of excessive reactions."
"Obviously, there is a common monetary policy, but financial, budgetary and tax policy must not and cannot be managed in detail from Brussels."
"EMU is an instrument for increasing the economic strength of Europe and therefore a certain amount of acceptance is required of the fact that all euro zone countries do not move at exactly the same rate simultaneously."
"The next time that we get a case like Ireland' s, I hope, Commissioner, that the Commission will think carefully first."
"EMU must not become a straightjacket for Europe."
"Mr President, Mr Schmidt is absolutely right."
"I do indeed intend to point out that now that the economic climate is changing - for undoubtedly the American trends will also have an impact in Europe - then naturally a corresponding change in economic policy is required."
"I thus agree with the many speakers, headed by the rapporteur Mr Katiforis, who have shed light on the need for public investment in education, research, environmental improvements and the like."
"It seems as if, as Mr Herzog also pointed out, there is a dogmatic opposition to such change."
"Despite the fact that the economic reality is changing, policy has to remain fixed."
"In this situation, it is important for individual countries to be able to act more freely, and here I understand Olle Schmidt' s concerns."
"I am in fact very glad that my own Member State, Sweden, has not signed up to EMU and thus has a freedom to act which means that the country can conduct a more realistic economic policy with regard to the changes in economic trends."
"Mr President, there has been a marked slowdown in the rate of growth in the EU economy."
"The Commission and the IMF have revised growth forecasts from above 3% to 2.8%."
"The rate of inflation is 0.3 of a percentage point above the 2% ceiling."
"We all know why this is."
"Exploding oil prices, agricultural problems, the depreciation in the euro."
"Our export-orientated Member States in particular have been hit by the hard landing in the US economy."
"The own initiative report by Mr Katiforis, which has been clarified as the result of numerous amendments proposed by the PPE-DE Group, underlines the importance of controls on stability and convergence programmes to economic collaboration in Europe."
"There is absolutely no cause for the passivity which Mr Herzog referred to."
"Reducing government debt must continue to be our top priority. We also need, however, targeted investments in information networks, technology and research and development."
"This will bring us closer to the very ambitious objective set in Lisbon of making Europe the most competitive, dynamic, knowledge-based economy."
"Most importantly, we must redirect our efforts towards education and training."
"For me, lifelong learning is far too often a set phrase and far too seldom a requirement, conspicuous by its absence from curricula and syllabuses."
"Mr von Wogau and Mr Karas have already spoken about the stability of the euro and agreed how important the steady hand of the ECB - and Wim Duisenberg - was; the euro has remained stable, all the political demands of the various camps notwithstanding."
"What I am interested in is structural stability."
"Our Member States should make use, in their economic and social policy, of benchmarking procedures and exchanges of best practices."
"However, it is the opposite of this - namely poor practices - which my country is currently delivering."
"Germany is bringing up the rear when it comes to growth in the euro zone at under 2.2%."
"Chancellor Schröder' s days of talking it up and laughing it off are finally at an end!"
"Faced with a lack of success with employment, one reason being that the programmes are not effective enough, he is trying to deflect attention from his own mistakes by slagging off the unemployed in general as good-for-nothings."
"Anyone who tries to lump social spongers and shirkers - and they undoubtedly exist - together with the hundreds of thousands who have been desperately looking for work for years is making criminals out of victims and that is totally irresponsible."
"This example shows that, with better data networking, we know full well where the shortcomings lie in each Member State."
"They can no longer be swept under the carpet, they are in the spotlight of European public opinion."
"No country in the EU will get on without budgetary discipline, without permanently reducing debts or without substantial structural reforms and the aims - competitiveness and stability - are well worth it."
"Mr President, the European Institutions have made budgetary balance a priority, but this phrase, like all the calls for budgetary prudence, serves to conceal the fact that what we are reducing is budgetary expenditure intended for public services and social protection."
"At the same time, we are not using any of the expenditure for helping large employers in various ways."
"If the Member States, as well as the European institutions, stopped giving such huge amounts to large employers, the resultant savings would enable public services to be developed and would, at the same time, reduce unemployment through the consequent taking on of staff in public hospitals, transport and public education systems, whilst maintaining a surplus budget."
"Clearly, however, there is no likelihood of this happening, because the European institutions and the Member States exist to serve the large employers and not the majority of the population."
"Many items in the report attest to this."
"When, for example, it dares to express satisfaction with the fact that unemployment has fallen from 9.6% to 8%, this represents around 15 million men and women forced into poverty in a region which happens to be one of the wealthiest in the world."
"By the same token, the report gives its approval to anything that increases flexibility and competitiveness, especially of labour."
"It quite clearly acts as the spokesperson for interests of employers alone rather than for the whole of the working population."
"We shall, of course, be voting against this report."
"The British Conservatives, like other centre-right parties across the European Union, are committed to properly-funded and high-quality public services and, if elected in June, to a massive increase in public spending of around GBP 62 billion on essential services like schools and hospitals."
"We therefore welcome paragraph 6 but we have reservations about the rest of the report, in particular paragraph 4, because we cannot agree that the 'golden rule' is a good example for Europe to follow."
"It is merely one of the many ways in which Gordon Brown succeeds in fiddling the figures."
"This report and the Stability and Growth Pact in the convergent programmes are clear evidence of the link between tax-and-spend policies and monetary policy."
"The pact applies to all EU Member States but the legal penalties are only applicable to those states in the euro zone: that is at the heart of our reservations about this report."
"One of the reasons why we oppose the United Kingdom joining the euro zone is because we wish to keep the power to set taxes, budgets and spending decisions in the hands of democratically-elected national politicians."
"Within the euro zone it is not surprising that constraints have been imposed on public spending decisions because if you have, to all intents and purposes, a joint bank account you are affected by the spending decisions of others and you can expect to want some control over those spending decisions."
"The recent example of Ireland is a salutary reminder that by joining the euro a country takes on more than a single interest rate: its tax-and-spend decisions will no longer be decided solely in national capitals."
"It is a prospect which most people in the United Kingdom view with disquiet, the prospect of following a budget by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Ecofin, the Commission or the ECB informing that Chancellor that he or she is not permitted to increase spending on schools and hospitals and those services which are of such huge value to the people of the United Kingdom. This has already happened in Ireland and it could happen in the United Kingdom."
"But I would urge that the real route to economic prosperity in Europe is, as Mr Karas eloquently stated, structural and economic reform which will lead to sustainable prosperity, an increase in employment and a reduction in unemployment."
"Mr President, I would first like to express my satisfaction with the report, initiated by Parliament, on the stability and convergence programmes prepared by Mr Katiforis."
"In March the Ecofin Council completed its assessment of the third round of programmes we presented."
"Increased monitoring of budgetary policies, following implementation of the stability and growth pact, is having very positive and beneficial results."
"I am not sure whether, as Mr Karas stated, this is a means of establishing political stability, or simply a way of maintaining a clear commitment as regards public deficits."
"The Member States have improved budgetary consolidation though close cooperation."
"The latest figures show that ten of the current Member States anticipate that their public accounts will balance or show a surplus."
"All, apart from the United Kingdom, will have balanced their budgets by 2004."
"Public debt is decreasing significantly, and this year we expect it to fall below 60% in eleven of the fifteen Member States."
"I therefore believe we have made significant progress and, as Mr Katiforis said, I think we have achieved economic stability in Europe in budgetary terms."
"It is true that, although the task of restructuring public finances has enabled us to make significant progress, it poses a number of problems relating to long-term sustainability and the standard of public finances."
"Basically, the Commission insists that progress must be made on both counts."
"We must continue to strive to reduce the present deficits and to balance public budgets at the earliest opportunity."
"There are still a number of cases of excessively high debts. These must be reduced, above all in order to tackle future budgetary problems."
"In this regard, I would like to highlight aspects of the matter pointed out by a number of speakers."
"I refer amongst others to Mrs Randzio-Plath, who mentioned the need to improve the standard of public finances. Others spoke along the same lines."
"When we speak of the standard of public finances, we are referring not only to problems in the short-term, but also to those in the medium- and long-term."
"In the short-term, these obviously relate to the fiscal reforms which will improve the administration of taxes. In the medium-term they concern all matters related to improved public expenditure."
"I will refer to public investment, as set out by Mr Katiforis in his report, in a moment. Of course, there is the long-term problem of our ageing population, which should obviously be one of our main concerns at present."
"The medium-term strategies defined by the Member States in their programmes clearly indicate their priorities. This enables us to reconcile the different views so as to improve coordination of our budgetary policies."
"However, I would like to refer in detail to some of the problems raised by Mr Katiforis in his report."
"I wish to make some specific comments on the very important subject of public investment, to which Mr Katiforis dedicates a substantial part of his report."
"Firstly, I agree absolutely with him that, during the period of budgetary consolidation in the 1990s, many Member States reduced public investment, sometimes inappropriately. Secondly, it is true that the improvement in the situation should allow priority to be given to public investment."
"We would then be in line with the undertakings given in Lisbon. Their underlying aim is to improve our potential for growth."
"My third point is that public investment is not incompatible with private investment. Different types of investment can work alongside each other and can be interlinked."
"There is also scope for innovative financing methods. Often, there is no reason why the public sector should act in isolation as has traditionally been the case."
"In giving greater priority to public investment, which I fully support, we must not however forget the other side of the coin: greater public investment does not necessarily mean increased deficit."
"We believe that the problem should be resolved by redirecting certain types of expenditure and keeping public deficit under control."
"In our opinion it is crucial for the public deficit to be controlled through budgetary discipline. It is essential to balance the books in the medium-term."
"It is true that measures such as the golden rule implemented in the United Kingdom are useful insofar as public investment can logically be financed thorough debt or deficit. However, such debt or deficit must not exceed the agreed limits."
"Hence, encouraging public investment does not equate either with uncontrolled debt or with a significant increase in public expenditure."
"However, the Commission would obviously not endorse an increase in investment which could exceed deficit levels or current predicted expenditure levels."
"Paragraph 10 of the motion for a resolution refers to improved harmonisation of the timetable for presentation of Member States' programmes."
"We agree on this and have always felt it necessary to update programmes before budgetary procedures."
"We have stressed this point and will continue to do so. We trust that in the future we will at least be able to ensure that the programmes in question will be updated at the same time as budgetary procedures are initiated."
"Mr Katiforis also refers to the need to have the Commission' s documents available."
"That is a long-standing debate."
"We in the Commission do believe it is important for Parliament to have access to as much information as possible. Nonetheless, we also feel that the nuances or minor differences between the Commission' s proposal and the Council' s final decision are irrelevant as far as public opinion is concerned."
"We think the debate should focus mainly on those features eventually adopted by the Council. For that reason we feel that making earlier documents available would complicate rather than simplify the process."
"I will now turn to Paragraph 9, which deals with the Commission' s macroeconomic forecasts. As you are aware, these are prepared independently of the programme assessments."
"They are drawn up twice a year and published when they are ready. We have just brought out the latest ones, for the spring."
"They were forwarded to Parliament on 25 April. They point to a number of interesting developments which have also been mentioned today."
"Our position on the Irish matter is well known. Quite simply, all that happened in Ireland was that current regulations were applied."
"Another development worth mentioning is the reduction in growth as a result of the situation in the United States."
"I note that some of you, ladies and gentlemen, have floated the idea of a change in budgetary policy as a positive contribution to improving growth."
"As we see it, given the 2.8% predicted growth taken into account in the Commission' s forecasts, there is still plenty of scope for progress through the existing stability programmes."
"The Commission therefore continues to emphasise the need for the successful completion of these stability programmes. This does not mean, however, we do not believe that automatic stabilisers might prove helpful in a context of lower economic growth."
"These were the issues I wanted to bring to your attention."
"It only remains for me to thank Mr Katiforis for his work and to express my appreciation to all of you for your contributions, criticisms and suggestions."
"Thank you again."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The vote will take place at 11 a.m."
"The debate is closed."
"Internet II"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0116/2001) by Mr Harbour, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the Next Generation Internet and the need for an EU research initiative."
"Mr Harbour, the rapporteur, has the floor for seven minutes."
"It gives me great pleasure to present this report to the House on behalf of the Industry Committee."
"This is an own-initiative report by the Industry Committee and therefore it is a privilege to work on what are a relatively select number of these reports and to be the custodian on behalf of my committee."
"I would like to take the opportunity to thank all the colleagues who have contributed to this report and those who helped me in industry and in the Commission to make sure that we covered the ground thoroughly."
"I was pleased that the final report reflected all those contributions and was adopted unanimously by the committee."
"I hope that it will get the same level of support from the House today."
"This report sends a strong political signal to the Commission and Council that this Parliament wants this crucial area - the evolution of the Next Generation of Internet and electronic communication - to be reflected in the crucial decisions on research support that are about to made in the context of the Framework Six Programme."
"I know that a number of colleagues who will contribute here today are also actively involved in this programme."
"I would like to address the three key questions that I tried to answer in my report: Why is this so important?"
"Why do we use the word initiative in presenting this to you?"
"What do we want to look at and how are we going to achieve it?"
"First I think the strategic importance of electronic communications and the Internet are increasingly well understood by everyone in this House."
"But what is the contribution for Commission and publicly-funded research?"
"This report argues that there is a strong case for supporting pre-competitive work in the next stages of the evolution of this technology and that pre-competitive work will underlie the future competitiveness of all the industries and service providers who are engaged in this crucial business, and governments as well."
"With the adoption of the GSM standard in mobile telecommunications, we have seen how important pre-competitive work is in setting in place the standards, protocols, and architecture for the next and evolving stage of communications."
"It is clear why we should do it but what do we need to do in that context?"
"We need to anticipate the technologies that will be needed in a world where the capacity of the whole distribution system for electronic communications is going to be far larger than it is today."
"That investment is going in now and will continue to go in, so we should plan for a world with a very large amount of bandwidth capacity: that is the jargon we would use for saying the carrying-capacity of the wires or the airwaves that are communicating users to users and users with service suppliers."
"The architecture that we should develop will be very different from the architecture we have today where carrying-capacity is constrained."
"One of the core areas proposed in this report is to ensure that we use the research network that the Commission is already funding - the Géant network - to use that effectively by supporting projects that will exploit that very high carrying-capacity research network in anticipation of the whole infrastructure evolution that in future will be driven by the market place."
"That is the core of the system architecture, but alongside that there are other public policy areas where we want to do research."
"Issues of security and data protection are clearly important."
"They are becoming more and more important as our personal data are so easily and quickly circulated."
"It is also becoming more important because, in the wireless connected world, we will increasingly have more devices feeding information about ourselves, houses and cars into the system."
"There will be a new type of personal data that is being used in a benign way to monitor the operation of our car and the security systems in our house, but if somebody could accumulate and collect that data it would be a far from benign use of it."
"Data protection therefore needs to be thought of differently, encapsulating data together so it cannot be amalgamated in an unauthorised way."
"We need to think about the new opportunities afforded by wireless technologies, how the amount of information carried in our personal devices or mobile phones can be used in commercial transactions, but also about carrying our health records around with us in case of emergency and about areas where highly confidential data will be distributed."
"We also need to think about the new products that will allow wireless technology to carry things like video broadcasts, access to streamed broadcasts that could be passing through and around us: how, for example, could we access our local television station wherever we are in the world, and how would we pay for that?"
"That technology is something that will give us a real competitive advantage."
"I have just sketched out the 'what' areas of my three questions, so let me conclude by saying 'how' we would like to move this forward."
"This is a contribution to the debate on research policy in Framework Six Programme and our vote today will enable that to move at exactly the right time into the ongoing strategic discussion process."
"We need to ask the Commission, in taking this forward, to look at building a network of excellence around these technologies."
"Although this is one of the areas contained in the Commission's plans, it is clearly a priority for this particular field of technology."
"We are also looking for the sort of integrated projects involving the public and private sector that the Commission envisages in its proposal."
"In conclusion, I warmly commend this report to the House today and I would just emphasise again the importance that Parliament attaches to ensuring that the Commission takes this forward in its future strategies."
"Mr President, I should like to start by thanking Mr Harbour for his excellent report."
"I am not just flattering him, I really mean it."
"My congratulations on his report which contains both a comprehensive evaluation of the Commission initiatives and many of his own suggestions."
"I should also like to thank him for his open-minded attitude to our positions, suggestions and proposed amendments."
"Similar thanks go to the Commission, which really has proven over recent years that it is able to start its own European initiatives in an extremely important sector and implement them internationally."
"We have to deal here with opponents - perhaps I should say partners at international level rather than opponents - who are very very strong in this sector, especially the United States."
"It is becoming more and more important for us to come up with our own ideas on what future prospects we want to give the Internet sector as a whole."
"So heartfelt thanks to the Commission - and the Council - on their innovation-friendly approach to this sector."
"I should like to pick up on a few points addressed by Malcolm Harbour."
"This initiative is concerned primarily with what should happen in the area of future research on the Internet."
"I think it is important here to progress beyond the Commission' s previous initiatives and anticipate the future."
"Malcolm Harbour mentioned this."
"What does that mean, anticipating the future in the Internet sector?"
"It is tough terrain because forecasts are hard to make in both this and many other sectors."
"Here, however, we are dealing with a sector which is moving very very fast, which is regulated but where it is increasingly important that we look ahead and decide what standards will be needed in the future."
"The other question which keeps cropping up is exactly how this sector is perceived and understood by the people, by consumers as a whole."
"It is becoming more and more important here to create real confidence, so that we do not just have the technology, which is fantastic, we do not just have clever and intelligent regulation, we do not just have standards which anticipate the future, we also have people and consumers who are ready and willing to invest in this sector, not just by making telephone calls, but by using it in future to conduct their transactions."
"We shall need to invest much much more in this sector than we have done in the past."
"If we are to create real confidence, I should like to call on the Commission to do more here."
"To close, my request, my plea to the Commission is this: please bundle all the initiatives which you have started in the Internet sector into a single, cross-sectoral initiative with a real, overall, conclusive concept."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, Erika Mann' s last words really struck a chord with me."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for the excellent cooperation in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy which culminated in this own initiative report."
"Mr President, there is too little investment in ICT across the entire European Union, both by industry and by the government."
"Take, for example, the sixth Framework Programme: EUR 3.6 billion has been earmarked for ICT, but that is far too little."
"For let us consider what is needed to turn Europe into the world' s most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy, as was agreed in Lisbon."
"First of all, we need a good infrastructure, of course, and I am taking a wide-angled view on this."
"Based on my liberal belief, this does not, of course, primarily require government involvement."
"At European level, however, there is naturally a need for a high-speed, trans-European research network, and that is where the European Union comes in a big way, as my fellow MEP pointed out a moment ago."
"I would urge the Commissioner to show more ambition in this area."
"There is also a need for good quality content."
"Once again, the lack of capital is a huge barrier, especially to innovation."
"The content sector consists of fledgling companies and medium-sized companies that wish to export, and due to the turbulence on the market, there is little willingness to provide risk capital."
"Moreover, Europe displays strong regional differences in the supply of capital."
"This situation puts Europe at a disadvantage compared to the United States, where three to four times more risk capital is being invested in digital content and in Internet-related activities."
"That now leads to innovation, more economic growth and, obviously, to employment."
"The public sector should play a more significant role in improving the situation by combining supply and demand in the European Union."
"Finally, Mr President, for the first time in history, technology is driving constitutional law."
"That is why I am asking the Commissioner why the topic ""citizens and governance in the European knowledge-based society"" , for which EUR 225 million has been earmarked in the sixth Framework Programme, does not fall within the same category as ""technologies in the information society"" ."
"Mr President, the government itself will also need to adjust to the information society."
"Mr President, I welcome the report insofar as I think it is important to keep developing new technologies."
"I think it is important, above all, to give as many people as possible the means to communicate freely with whomever they wish, as and how they please."
"People must be allowed to choose for themselves in matters of information."
"This alone brings us up against the main obstacle to this free network, to free communication."
"There has already been a great deal of talk here about consumer confidence."
"However, I think that this expression alone is most telling."
"Consumer confidence means simply wanting to create confidence so that consumers believe that communications are secure."
"Privacy is a different concept; it means that communications really are secure, which is why I should like to stress again that privacy should be the real objective, i.e. really guaranteeing that communications are secure."
"There is one obstacle: monitoring is being driven further and further forward, including at European level."
"It is often argued that there are now new Internet crimes or old crimes which are now being committed over the Internet."
"However, the measures being taken in response are based on the belief that these crimes can be contained using state monitoring methods - as if."
"At the same time, most measures are only able to frighten off the really stupid offenders."
"They will not do much more than that because most of those who commit crimes in cyberspace also know how to protect themselves against monitoring."
"The question of data protection is addressed in Articles 10 and 13 of the report."
"However, it is partly restricted by calling for protection for data with financial or health implications alone."
"I think privacy is important for all data."
"Everyone has the right to choose for themselves in matters of information, which is why our slogan should be: down with monitoring, up with privacy."
"Mr President, I fully support legislation to upgrade the quality and standard of telecommunication infrastructures within the European Union."
"The changing nature of work today entails a knowledge of, and access to, new modern telecommunication facilities."
"However, any changes to our telecommunication infrastructures must be fair and balanced."
"It is imperative that new entrants to the marketplace are not permitted to cherrypick the larger and more lucrative urban areas for the use of these important new technologies."
"There must be a strong commitment by all governments to ensure that equivalent telecommunications are provided in both urban and particularly rural areas."
"This commitment to universal access for urban and rural areas must be intrinsically included in policies pursued by various telecom regulators operating in the marketplace."
"New technology can contribute enormously to the implementation of effective rural development policy, and it will be a key factor in the creation of vital new employment in rural areas and in addressing the problem of the urban/rural imbalance which is a priority issue for this Parliament."
"I welcome in particular the work of European Commissioner for Consumer Protection, David Byrne, in devising new mechanisms to govern consumer protection rights for people who enter into contracts over the Internet."
"Electronic business is now one of the more significant drivers of both successful business development and national economic development."
"It provides a fundamental new way of conducting commercial transactions and has far-reaching economic and social implications."
"Mr President, the new Internet generation is making many interactive applications possible."
"It should not be technology, but the user' s need that plays a key role in this."
"The Harbour report, however, is very technology-led."
"The public task consists of more than providing infrastructure."
"The rapporteur failed to mention that the government also has the task of finding out how the new Internet can benefit the public."
"First of all, technology can contribute to greater social cohesion, for example due to the fact that the replacement of standard activities leaves more time for human contact."
"As this will not happen of its own accord, we need to look into the applications that could strengthen social cohesion."
"Secondly, legislation on safety and content is insufficiently highlighted."
"Safe infrastructure is important, but technology often does not rule out incorrect use."
"Consequently, the rapporteur should have had more consideration for the international implications of new technology and for existing and new legislation."
"Finally, in order to narrow the knowledge gap, it is necessary for all groups of the population to be able to learn to use new technology."
"The needs, conditions and infrastructure required must be identified for weak groups."
"In that way, the integration of new technology can take place as early as at the development stage of new applications."
"Specific groups can then receive additional support."
"In a nutshell, the applications deserve more consideration than is evident in this report."
"More emphasis on the listed policy aspects is required if we want to create a knowledge-based society which involves the entire population."
"Mr President, first can I congratulate Malcolm Harbour, the rapporteur, on his own-initiative report on the Next Generation Internet: the need for an EU research initiative."
"The degree of support for the report is indicated both by the fact that it was adopted unanimously in committee, and by the fact that there are no amendments."
"The House certainly appears to be fully in support."
"In the Socialist Group, we particularly support the high priority given to making sure that we include in the Sixth Framework Programme work on the Next Generation Internet, and that we develop a broad-banded infrastructure capability and a new super fast trans-European research network."
"We want to make sure that EU research initiatives complement market-driven research, thereby avoiding conflict or duplication."
"There are, however, at least four areas that are in need of clarification: first, in paragraph 2, we talk about the need for pre-competitive research."
"We agree that it should be pre-competitive, not uncompetitive, which may be a different term."
"The model we see is the Japanese model on research cartels where people work together during the development of a new technology before they go off and compete with each other when it gets close to the marketplace."
"Secondly, in paragraph 7, we talk about it being technologically neutral."
"That is fine, provided that is not an excuse for inaction where we wait for the technology to be determined."
"We need to feed into that process and be flexible, but we also need to be active."
"Thirdly on system security, it is clear that we need to be able to protect this Internet generation, and the next one, in terms of enabling people to engage in cash transactions and to transmit confidential information."
"I hope that the Commission will look at both the technology and the legislation that is needed to ensure that the necessary levels of encryption can be put in place to protect the public, without aiding the criminals."
"Finally, the key issues of universal access."
"The Commission will have to ensure that we achieve this and that it is available to everybody, and not just those living in urban areas."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Malcolm Harbour on an unusually well-informed report which addresses many important issues."
"This report also addresses the fact that the society of the future will be a mobile Internet society, and I believe that we Members are, in a way, guinea pigs as regards whether or not this mobility will work."
"The report also shows the rapid rate of change that we are seeing in this area, the points of departure for the capital market being among the things that have changed since Mr Harbour' s work was completed."
"The only thing that I would like to say to the Commissioner today is that I hope that the Commission' s organisation is sufficiently flexible to be able to take account of the need for cooperation between its different areas and to be able to react quickly to the changes required."
"I also feel that account must be taken of this issue in the White Paper on European Governance."
"Better coordination of the Commission' s activities is needed, as Mrs Mann also mentioned."
"It is also evident that the Internet will lead to challenges for administrations, with open competition between administrations becoming the guiding principle - and the Commission will have to cope with this competition."
"The admirable report by Malcolm Harbour invites us to look at our research initiative and we particularly welcome and support that aspect."
"One point always needs underlining."
"The kind of research needed here will include scientific research - research in physics, research in IT - but will also include socio-economic and legal research because of the points covered, particularly in paragraph 13, where we are dealing with these vital issues of privacy and data protection."
"We will need to make sure that we have the regulatory mechanisms right and deal properly with the risks and threats as well as getting the technological fixes done correctly."
"Can I also underline a point arising out of Clause 9 which Mr Hyland made: I am just back from a visit to the Outer Hebrides during the constituency week."
"We can, with these technologies, cancel the disadvantages of the periphery and we can therefore turn round the age-old tendency of depopulation of our remote areas provided that we make available, for example, abundant low-cost expanded high band-breadth infrastructures with access on equitable terms."
"We must ensure that the outlying places are brought into this."
"Mr President, first I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Harbour, for his excellent initiative."
"The Commission very much appreciates the continued interest which the European Parliament and its Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has expressed in the development and establishment of an information society in Europe."
"Indeed, in drawing up its reports on the Next Generation Internet, the industry committee has given a clear indication of the vital importance of the future development of this networking infrastructure."
"The timing of the foreseen adoption of this report is very well chosen since the Commission is currently preparing the forthcoming communication of specific programmes implementing the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development in which issues included in Mr Harbour's report will be addressed."
"Next Generation Internet, will be realised through developments in both technology and policy."
"For Europe to remain competitive, it is first of all imperative to ensure a rapid and continued growth of the Internet as the key infrastructure for the global knowledge economy."
"It is equally important for new policy measures to be taken as required in order to cope with the rapidly evolving development of the Internet world."
"We have a number of instruments and resources - e-Europe, European research areas, the RGD Framework Programme, e-content, Ten Telecom, structural funds - to ensure a rapid development of the Next Generation Internet."
"Appropriate coordination of our activities with those of the Member States and other European institutions will ensure that ambitious targets are pursued to the benefit of all Europeans and that access to new services is guaranteed also to those with special needs such as the disabled and the elderly."
"As the main instrument available in Europe, the Framework Programme will support the research towards the development of the Next Generation Internet."
"That work is already being supported through the current Fifth Framework Programme and will be strengthened in the Sixth Framework Programme."
"Let me give some examples of our support to the Next Generation Internet: first, a strategic initiative on the IBV6, the next generation protocol, has recently been launched by the Commission and an industry-led task force has been created."
"This will contribute to the rapid and continued evolution of the Internet and will also ensure that Europe's competitiveness in wireless technologies is not jeopardised in the long-term."
"Moreover, through IBV6, Europe will be ready to provide the required connectivity to those billions of devices that will constitute the nervous system of the future information society."
"Secondly, significant success towards the deployment of new electronic infrastructures has been achieved through the Géant project, a pan-European network covering both EU and associated countries."
"Thirdly, the Commission takes good note of Parliament's call to be more ambitious in implementing the Géant project, as various Members have just indicated."
"The aim is to provide highly advanced connectivity and services in Europe's national research and education networks at a level that allows them to play a leading role in cutting-edge research allowing the Géant to involve from 2.5 gigabits to 10 gigabits per second and thereafter to 100 gigabits per second in the coming years."
"Fourthly, playing a central role in global cooperation with similar regional activities world-wide, for example the Internet II initiative in the United States, CANET4 in Canada and so on, Géant will provide the multiplier effect from which major infrastructural projects benefit."
"In the Sixth Framework Programme for RTD, and of course our continuous liberalisation of telecommunication markets, the Commission is seeking to ensure that the infrastructure needed to support development of Next Generation Internet services in Europe is available."
"It will directly support the research needed to allow development of new technologies in areas such as photonics, advanced software and hardware, and interfaces etc. Those research activities have to address important new requirements among which enhanced security plays a prime role."
"The security issues will also be tackled in the upcoming communication on security of electronic networks that should be presented in time for the Gothenburg European Council."
"Finally, let me stress that we are in full agreement with Mr Harbour and with his report in considering that the Next Generation Internet is strategically important to Europe."
"We have a unique opportunity ahead of us to develop a networking infrastructure for the benefit of the research community and the European citizen."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11.00 a.m."
"Company accounts"
"The next item is the report by Lord Inglewood (A5-0130/2001), on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC as regards the valuation rules for the annual and consolidated accounts of certain types of companies[COM(2000) 80 - C5-0106/2000 - 2000/0043(COD)]."
"In yesterday's Financial Times, Arthur Levitt, a former Chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission wrote ""Investors, public companies, accounting firms, stock markets and regulators around the world today face one of the great challenges for the global financial system's future: how to fashion an enduring system of comparable, uniform and high-quality financial reporting that is accepted just as much in Europe as it is in the US, and in developed countries as in emerging ones."
"He continues ""The explosive growth of markets and economies makes developing such a system an imperative. All agree that there is simply no other way to ensure the efficient allocation of capital on a long-term and global basis."""
"This proposal is part of the European Union's wider response to the challenges described by Mr Levitt and, in particular, it deals with the problem of relatively new types of financial instruments, for example, derivatives and hedge funds."
"This directive requires Member States to permit or require all or certain companies to adopt fair value, as opposed to historic cost accounting, where it is appropriate to do so and in the manner spelt out in the directive."
"It creates a flexible regime and allows Member States considerable discretion in line with the application of the principle of subsidiarity, according to the circumstances as they see it."
"It is intended as a first step towards establishing an accounting regime across Europe which meets the requirement of a modern global market place and which, in particular, will provide those who read company accounts with the kind of information they will want and should be entitled to know."
"The proposal in front of the House today, together with the amendments - all of which were agreed unanimously in committee - are the result of close collaboration between myself, on behalf of the Legal Affairs Committee, and the Council and Commission, in an effort to reach an agreed formulation which could enable this directive to be dealt with in a single reading."
"I believe that this work has been brought to a mutually satisfactory conclusion and I commend it."
"Mr President, the report before us is undoubtedly not the most exciting of those we are to discuss in this sitting. However, in saying this, I am not of course referring to Lord Inglewood' s excellent piece of work."
"Much can be achieved when, as a result of the codecision procedure, the European Parliament' s work improves the Commission' s proposals at a highly technical level, as it has in this instance. This not only makes a positive contribution to the process of drafting regulations, it also enhances the prestige of the European Parliament."
"As I said a moment ago, this report does not give rise to keen argument. That does not mean, however, that it lacks significance from a technical point of view."
"The proposal to update the directives on accounting is not only very important, it is in fact essential if the transparency of company accounts is to be improved."
"Traditionally, the valuation rules for company accounts stipulated that assets be valued at cost price, referred to as the historic value."
"This criterion was therefore invoked in the directives on accounting, as is logical in order to prevent the manipulation of accounts to present an inaccurate picture of a company' s status."
"The aim was to prevent company directors from skilfully revaluing entries under assets to produce a distorted impression of the state of their business."
"Incidentally, certain accounting irregularities which are not tolerated in company accounts, have been sanctioned in relation to the public accounts of a number of Member States, to allow them to join the euro. In this instance, the euphemism 'creative accounting' has been used in place of 'irregularities' ."
"However, these accounting criteria relating to historic value were not cast in stone. Furthermore, the financial markets today are highly complex and the use of sophisticated financial products is increasing."
"This fair value, included in the proposal for a directive that we are to approve, is obviously not as fixed as permanently as the historic value, given that its limits are much more loosely defined. Its inclusion requires more precise instruments, as provided in the proposed amendments we will support."
"I now give the floor to Commissioner Bolkestein."
"I would point out to the Commissioner that his time allocation runs until 11.00 a.m."
"My message to you is therefore: go for it."
"Mr President, I assume that you want me to focus on the topic in hand until 11.00 a.m. and that I am not being given the floor to talk about all kinds of other things, for example, Chancellor Schröder' s latest document on architecture of the future Europe."
"You want me to confine myself to today' s topic."
"I am in a generous mood, Commissioner, but go ahead."
"Mr President, I know my place, and we can therefore make a start on this subject matter."
"May I reply as follows to the two interventions made, and in particular to the rapporteur."
"As you may know, accounting is a European invention."
"Five hundred years ago, Mr Lucia Patchioli, an Italian monk, developed the fundamentals of book-keeping which are still used today."
"However important historic awareness may be, becoming historical is generally not a very positive notion."
"This is what accounting in the European Union should not become."
"The basic directive which deals with accounting, the fourth company law directive, is now more than twenty years old - it dates from 1978 - and although the directive forms a sound basis for accounting in the EU, it is hard to neglect substantial changes in business practices: capital markets, futures, stock options, leases, the Internet and the euro are all phenomena that, for the most part, did not exist in 1978."
"Indeed, accounting has evolved to reflect these changes in business practice."
"In 1995, the Commission started to be actively involved in the work of the International Accounting Standards Committee."
"This involvement was concluded by the recently proposed regulation on International Accounting Standards (IAS), which I hope to discuss with this Parliament shortly."
"At the moment, the Commission is also preparing to update the accounting directives: we will be presenting a proposal before the end of this year, as outlined in the Commission's communication on financial reporting in the European Union."
"If you hear me talking about the proposed regulation and the modernisation of accounting directives, you may wonder why we need this proposal amending the accounting and bank accounts directives, thereby enabling the use of fair value for certain financial instruments."
"Why do we need that proposal at all?"
"In recent years several Member States have introduced national legislation that allows their companies to use International Accounting Standards."
"However, Member States cannot enact national laws that are not compliant with EU legislation, so IAS can only be applied to the extent that there are no conflicts with the accounting directives."
"The fair-value concept, introduced in IAS, constitutes such conflicts and the proposal takes that conflict away by introducing fair value into the accounting directives."
"A contrario, without this proposal, companies which at present use IAS could no longer do so when, from the financial year 2001, fair value becomes mandatory under IAS."
"I should like to point out that the introduction of fair value in the accounting directives is in strict alignment with International Accounting Standards and does not allow the use of fair value beyond that."
"Accounting is a technical and perhaps even esoteric issue."
"Nevertheless, it is important to highlight the most important elements of this proposal."
"The proposal defines fair value and those financial instruments that can be fair-valued in accordance with IAS."
"Secondly, the proposal also lays down rules for Member States to define the scope of companies that shall be permitted or can be required to use fair value."
"A Member State can, for example, permit or require fair value only for listed companies."
"Thirdly, the proposal also requires that all companies disclose information on derivative financial instruments - options, swaps, futures - in the notes on the accounts which may have a significant impact on the financial position."
"However, small companies can be excluded from this disclosure."
"One of Parliament's amendments seeks to include banks within the scope of the proposal."
"The Commission supports this amendment from the point of view of a single EU market."
"Banks and other companies compete for capital on the same capital market."
"Comparable financial statements are a crucial element allowing an efficient allocation of capital to companies and ensuring sufficient investor protection."
"The Commission carefully examines the amendments to its proposal and, in this instance, supports all proposed Amendments Nos 1 to 32."
"In conclusion, I hope that Parliament and the rapporteur will contribute to prevent accounting in the EU becoming historical."
"We want it to be up-to-date and forward-looking."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place in Strasbourg."
"(The sitting was suspended at 10.50 a.m. and resumed at 11.00 a.m.)"
"Mr President, I wish to make a brief point of order."
"I was due to leave for Washington on Tuesday with the Delegation of Coordinators of the temporary Committee of Enquiry on 'ECHELON' , which was to make an official visit to the United Nations from 9 to 11 May."
"The United States Ambassador to Brussels has now informed me that my visa has been refused for political reasons, that the file had gone to Washington and the United States Embassy advised me to cancel my trip with the delegation."
"If it were possible, Mr President, I should like Parliament' s Bureau to take this matter up with the American authorities, as Mr Wurtz, Chairman of the GUE/NGL Group has already done, because I think it would be a scandal if the United States government could decide on who should be a member of a European Parliament delegation."
"(Applause from the left)"
"Mr Krivine, I have taken note of your important statement."
"I hope that it will be passed to the Bureau as quickly as possible, so that we can clear up this matter properly, which is indeed extremely serious."
"I rise on a point of order."
"You will no doubt be aware of the serious problems concerning the provision of secondary education in my region of Northamptonshire."
"With me today in the public gallery is a mother of two from Earls Barton near Wellingborough whose eldest son is due to enter secondary education in September."
"He has recently petitioned this Parliament because his Local Education Authority has failed to allocate him a place in any of the schools of his choice in his local area, even after what can only be described as a flawed appeals process."
"This is the same Local Education Authority that, until last week, was failing to provide any education or school places to 20 children in the same area."
"Will the President please write to the British Government to clarify how this sits with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, especially Article 14(3), the right to education, which I believe specifically covers Lucy Payne's case and the concerns of many other parents across Northamptonshire."
"Mr Heaton-Harris, Parliament takes note of the issues you have raised and the competent authorities shall be informed as quickly as possible."
"Mr President, we have been informed that a press conference, organised by Mr Vattimo, took place this morning to promote an Italian book which is clearly libellous: a book which has already been condemned in Italy, a book which libels a member of the Italian parliament."
"In my opinion, the left is, once again, displaying its tendency here to exploit the institutions for the clear purposes of Italian electoral campaigning."
"I would like to ask you, Mr President, who authorised the use of the room for these purposes."
"I know that the title of the press conference was changed so that the room could be used, in the sense that the reference to the electoral campaign was removed from the title, but the subject of the conference was clearly the Italian electoral campaign."
"Mr Gawronski, we shall indeed investigate the content of that meeting."
"I want to come back to the point Mr Krivine raised in relation to our ECHELON delegation to the United States."
"This is an extremely important and serious issue."
"What is happening is that the United States has decided to refuse entry to a democratically-elected Member of this Parliament for political reasons."
"This is completely unacceptable."
"Who are the United States to decide, for political reasons, that a democratically-elected Member of this Parliament is not allowed to enter?"
"The United States clearly has double standards: they have allowed many others to enter, including Gerry Adams and Nelson Mandela, with various pasts."
"Now they are deciding because they do not like the politics of a specific Member of this Parliament that they are going to refuse entry."
"This is a diplomatic issue and one that must be raised urgently."
"Mrs McKenna, I think that Parliament has noted the seriousness of the statement that Mr Krivine has just made."
"The matter shall be followed up thoroughly."
"Mr President, I would like to start by asking the Presidency to pay greater attention when Members are asking for the floor. This is the fourth time that I have been unable to speak."
"Moving on, I would like to draw the attention of the President and of Parliament to the events in Italy, where our fellow Member, Emma Bonino, together with other Members of the European Parliament, is on a thirst and hunger strike to secure the right to media coverage during the electoral campaign."
"Alongside Emma Bonino are handicapped people such as Luca Coscioni as well, who is abstaining from painkillers in order to capture the attention of the President of the Republic."
"It would be appropriate for the European Parliament to set up an observatory to monitor the Italian elections, in order to see whether an effective information flow is truly guaranteed to all in a problematic election campaign such as the Italian campaign."
"We have taken note of your statement."
"Mr President, I have been informed that Mr Gawronski spoke a few minutes ago in condemnation of the fact that a press conference was organised - I organised it myself - on freedom of information, in which a book was discussed which Mr Gawronski describes as libellous."
"This book does nothing more than draw attention to all the documents underlying, amongst other things, a request for waiver of the parliamentary immunity of Mr Dell'Utri and Mr Berlusconi, a request which lies before Parliament."
"This is not a libellous book at all; it is a book which brings to the attention of the European Union documents which are of interest also and precisely for Parliament, for us to consider when we debate - I do not know when - the request for waiver of the parliamentary immunity of our fellow Members, Mr Dell'Utri and Mr Berlusconi, who should, at last, be brought to justice for these matters."
"I would like to ask a question about the use of Parliament's facilities by the PPE-DE in relation to the elections in the Basque country."
"Could you please pass this request on to the Presidency."
"I would like a straightforward answer about the use of this Parliament's facilities."
"Vote"
"On behalf of the Commission, I should like to confirm the Commission's position on the two amendments proposed to the common position."
"Amendment 1 would allow BSE-free Member States to act unilaterally against imports of live animals."
"That is against the principle of Community rules and superfluous since the common position includes harmonised rules for the marketing of animals in the light of the BSE status."
"Amendment 2 would make it more difficult to establish a clear epidemiological picture of the incidence of BSE in contradiction to Parliament's resolution of last November."
"For those reasons, and also with a view to putting in place the proper legal framework for the control of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies..."
"(Applause, calls of ""encore!"") .... transmissible spongiform encephalopathies without delay, the Commission cannot accept either of these amendments."
"I hope that my pronunciation of this word with which I am not very familiar was clear to Parliament."
"(The President declared the common position adopted)"
"Report (A5-0318/2000) by Mr Cashman, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents [COM(2000) 30 - C5-0057/2000 - 2000/0032(COD)]"
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Report (A5-0125/2001) by Mrs Evans, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on the animal-health requirements applicable to non-commercial movement of pet animals [COM(2000) 529 - C5-0477/2000 - 2000/0221(COD)]"
"Relating to Amendment No 4"
"As regards Amendment No 4, the wording of the final version is different to the proposal adopted in the committee."
"This wording is more far-reaching."
"At the end of the original version, the wording was ""with the aim of trying to achieve harmonisation""; in the new version it says ""with the aim of harmonising""."
"Relating to Amendment No 14"
"I would like to propose an oral amendment whereby the word 'ferret' is moved from Part B in Annex 1 to Part A."
"(Since more than 12 Members were opposed to voting on the oral amendment, it was not put to the vote)"
"Mr President, Mr Arvidsson has twice tried to point out a difference in Amendment No 4."
"You have not said anything but you intimated that Amendment No 4, as passed today, is different from what it was in committee."
"At least, so you intimated."
"I assume, just to clarify matters, that we are going by what was submitted today."
"Mr President, I agree with the European Farmer Coordination and I believe that the root of the mad cow disease problem lies in intensive methods of animal production and the misguided policy on foodstuffs pursued by the European Union ever since the creation of the CAP in 1962."
"The best way to prevent the transmission of encephalopathies is to promote the controlled production of milk and beef. Such production would be based on local pasture and fodder."
"The quality of what is produced would be more important than the quantity. If these huge fodder imports are not investigated, the European Union will continue to act as a factory processing imported vegetable products to produce animal products."
"This state of affairs results in an enormous financial burden and a range of problems, relating to surpluses, quality, health and the environment. These have been described by other Members on numerous occasions."
"Fortunately, the majority of European herds are not contaminated. In particular, these include animals fed on grass and natural fodder produced on the farm itself, and not raised on industrial foodstuffs."
"These are the very animals the CAP has been ignoring for 40 years, and which we must now promote in order to protect the health of the people of Europe."
"Mr President, it is no fault of mine if - probably because there has been a lot of talk about my dream of Mrs Roth-Behrendt during this past month - I dreamt about her again last night."
"It was a more restful dream than the previous one."
"Mrs Roth-Behrendt was in good health and leading an army of pensioners who were waving placards bearing the words ""Long live Mrs Roth-Behrendt""."
"I went up to them and asked them why they were carrying placards saying ""Long live Mrs Roth Behrendt"" and not ""Long live Mr Fatuzzo""."
"They replied: ""We are pensioners who like to eat well, to eat steak with Brunello di Montalcino wine."
"Mrs Roth-Behrendt is ensuring that the beef we eat is healthy and we therefore admire her and are celebrating her victory""."
"Thus, I could not fail to vote for the motion."
"Debates of recent months have highlighted and prioritised the public health aspect of European and national food policy of which BSE is the most significant."
"Therefore, future agricultural and environmental policy must reflect our experiences in this crucial area of food production."
"Failure on the part of Member States to fully conform to new guidelines and regulations must not be tolerated."
"Food is an internationally tradeable product and with consumers crossing frontiers on a daily basis, nothing short of a co-ordinated and common approach to food safety as spearheaded by the EU will restore consumer confidence in the entire food chain, and while there is a cost factor, particularly for farmers, it is I believe strongly in the interests of agriculture and individual farm families, that full confidence is restored as quickly as possible in all agricultural products."
"Member States have taken positive and expensive steps to deal with BSE."
"The foot-and-mouth outbreak, which does not present a health risk, has to some extent overshadowed the very genuine steps taken to finally eliminate BSE from the European herd."
"The action taken was scientifically based and I believe we are close to bringing this public health scare to a successful - and with strict adherence to production controls to a permanent - conclusion."
"While acknowledging the weight of the scientific evidence on the connection of BSE and CJD with the use of meat and bonemeal, it must be borne in mind that the level of BSE infestation proportionate to the individual herds in Member States is significantly small and is of course confined to a relatively short production cycle."
"Animals infected or at risk are now considerably reduced in numbers."
"We must never again experience the traumatic events of recent months and the understandable consumer concern with regard to food safety."
"Cashman report (A5-0318/2001)"
"Mr President, in order to decide which way to vote on Mr Cashman's extremely important report on public access to the documents of the Parliament, the Council and the Commission, before I left for Rome, I discussed the matter with my mother, who is very interested in the proceedings of the European Parliament."
"She said to me: ""That is very interesting, but what is the Council?"
"It is never mentioned on Italian television."
"What is the Commission?"
"It is never mentioned on Italian television."
"I know what the Parliament is because you have become a Member of it."""
"I therefore concluded that, in addition to having access to documents, it would be a good thing for the European citizens to know something about the European Parliament, the European Council and the European Commission."
"The Danish Social Democrats have today voted for the report by Mr Cashman on a proposal for a Regulation regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents because we believe that an acceptable compromise has been reached and because we believe that the forces that wish for much greater openness and access have achieved more in the negotiations than the countries and forces that have sought to maintain closed systems."
"At the same time, it is our assessment that we would not have achieved a better result by letting the matter go to a second reading."
"In our assessment of the compromise, we attached particular importance to the principles that, as a starting point, all documents should be included, including internal documents, that the number of exceptions should be reduced, and that these should be well-founded, that requests should be dealt with more quickly than was originally proposed and that it should be established that Danish authorities will continue to deal with requests for access to documents in accordance with Danish rules."
"If a system is to enjoy our citizens' confidence, it is not sufficient for it merely to be open under the rules. Instead, it must also be experienced as being open."
"A great deal of work remains to be done here by citizens and the press, who must use the new rules actively and who must also test the limits of these new rules."
"It is our hope that the coming years will show all the forces that are sceptical about transparency that it benefits not just democracy but also the institutions' own internal work for the public to have access to the documents being worked on."
"We have voted against the report ""Public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents"" because despite its promising title, it seeks less to extend opportunities for access than to regulate them and thereby give the institutions the right to restrict public access."
"The institutions concerned would actually retain the right to class as 'confidential' documents in fields as diverse as ""defence and military matters, international relations, economic, financial or monetary policy and public security"" as well as ""documents concerning court proceedings, inspections, investigations or financial audits"" ."
"In other words, more or less everything can be classified as secret."
"There would appear to be even less public access to the documents of the European institutions than is permitted in some Member States."
"In this field, as in many others, the least we should do is to narrow the gap between the least anti-democratic practices and those which are most transparent."
"The fact of the matter, however, is that there is no reason for any document from the European institutions to be concealed from the public."
"We are in favour of the full publication of every document, every agreement and every treaty, as well as parts of all the speeches that are today made behind closed doors, of all the dealings kept secret and all the lobbying, which have led Parliament, the Council or the European Commission to take a decision or issue a directive."
"At the International Journalists' Day on 3 May, the European Parliament is approving rules that will close off access to a large number of documents from the EU."
"The GUE/NGL Group dissociates itself from the result of the closed negotiations and we have today voted against the compromise between the European Parliament' s two biggest political groups, the Council and the Commission."
"The rules concerning openness in the EU were negotiated behind hermetically sealed doors, and the result unfortunately shows that the institutions of the EU consider citizens to be opponents rather than fellow-players."
"The rules concerning which documents can be excluded from public access are so unclear that it will not be difficult to keep secret almost any document at all."
"Internal documents are not defined and are to be kept secret if their publication would have a decisive influence on a decision-making process."
"Member States may demand that documents be classified and, into the bargain, require that they not be recorded, without it being made clear which rules this is to take place under."
"Documents concerning the EU' s foreign, defence and security policy can be kept entirely out of the public domain and documents concerning internal security can similarly be kept secret."
"The rules will be of consequence in all the Member States, with national opportunities to create greater openness in the political process of the Member States now being subject to the Union' s common rules."
"Public debate on the matter has been virtually non-existent, and the closed process under which the rules came about has hardly helped the project to move the Union closer to its citizens."
"The result gives the impression that the rapporteurs have hidden under the cloak of the Swedish Presidency in the hope that openness and the interests of public access to official records were covered by virtue of the Swedes' long tradition of open government."
"However, it is obvious that the Swedes decided on a course of appeasement that has secured consensus in the Council rather than safeguarding citizens' interests."
"In other words, the Swedes have helped legitimise the Regulation rather than defending citizens' interests, and today the European Parliament has followed suit."
"The Commission and the Council can sit back with satisfaction, and the European Parliament has negotiated on the basis of its own interest in achieving access to a range of confidential documents without guaranteeing that a single document will be delivered."
"This cannot be said to be in the public interest, and it is now clear that the public has been held hostage in a struggle concerning the European Parliament' s own interests in which the European Parliament, in the end, decided to sacrifice the hostage."
"We have voted in favour of Mr Cashman' s report on new clearer rules for citizens' access to official documents in the EU' s institutions."
"The compromise that has now been adopted by the European Parliament is an important step along the way to increased openness and improved efficiency in the institutions."
"Moreover, the new rules are clearly better than the lawless situation in respect of public access to documents that currently prevails."
"At the same time, we nonetheless see a number of problems with the new rules on public access to documents."
"Sensitive documents that are classified as secret, for example with reference to general security, are exempted from the principle of public access and do not need to be logged."
"The author of a sensitive document is the person who decides whether the recipient may make it available to others."
"These rules are in total conflict with the Swedish principle of public access to official records that has characterised Swedish government for over 250 years."
"The Swedish Presidency has asserted that the special rules concerning sensitive documents will only cover documents concerning foreign and security policy."
"However, we see a great risk that sensitive documents may very well also come to include documents that concern other areas, such as the Schengen cooperation and the common policy on refugees."
"Moreover, we are concerned that the Swedish constitution, with its roots dating back to 1766, will come under threat as a result of unclear EU rules."
"The introduction to the Regulation states that the purpose is not to change existing legislation in the Member States."
"At the same time, the Commission forced through the deletion of a reference to national legislation right at the last minute."
"Nonetheless, we presume that the Commission will keep its promise and maintain the Member States' right to take decisions independently concerning the provision of documents."
"Throughout the decision-making process, the Commission has worked against increased openness and access for its citizens in order instead to defend the classifying of documents."
"This suggests that the old-fashioned Commission is still characterised by bureaucracy and an unwillingness to change."
"Hopefully the new Regulation on citizens' access to documents is an important step on the way towards even clearer rules capable of forming a basis for a modernised administration in which openness and access are a matter of course."
"The Regulation states that the rules will be reviewed in January 2004 at the latest."
"We are voting in favour of the report today in the conviction that this is just the first step towards a more open EU."
"The ELDR Group will be pushing the issue further."
"My colleague, Michael Cashman, has done a first-class job in preparing his report on public access to documents held by the EU institutions."
"He makes it clear that in principle all documents held by Council, Commission and Parliament must be accessible to EU citizens."
"He is right to acknowledge that some exceptions to open access will need to exist, for example, to protect public and private interests."
"However, he is right to limit the grounds for exceptions to the bare minimum."
"I believe he is also right to say that the institutions need 'space to think' and therefore some informal documents should be excluded from his proposal in order to allow the free exchange of ideas."
"The extent of disclosure of information is not determined by the quantity of unimportant or non-controversial information made available on the Internet."
"What is at issue is precisely documents, the authors and customers of which are able decide that their content of even their existence is kept secret."
"We may adopt this proposal, but we are still a long way away from disclosure as it is known in the Netherlands and Scandinavia."
"The currently proposed form of restricted disclosure could even be a means of systematically protecting documents from priers, which are now hardly accessible to society."
"Those in favour of the compromise do not seem too keen either, but they still call on everyone to vote for the proposal."
"Their main arguments are that the outcome without the compromise would be even worse, and that they expect that something better will come up after the 2004 evaluation."
"Those opposing disclosure have not spoken out in the debate at all, but without such opponents, difficult negotiations behind the scenes would not have been necessary and we would have been able to vote on a better outcome today."
"Incorrect and hasty preparations have created a situation in which the moderate advocates of disclosure are voting in favour and the radical advocates are being forced to vote against."
", in writing."
"(FR) Whilst we share the rapporteur' s objective of transparency and whilst we acknowledge his good intentions, we did not vote for the amendments to the text proposed by the Commission."
"The best is the enemy of the good."
"The amendments would create too broad a scope and would eliminate all the elements of flexibility contained in the Commission proposals."
"Furthermore, they would make the new regulation retroactive, which we consider contravenes fundamental principles of the law."
"Ultimately, a strict application of the amended text would result in excessive bureaucracy, involving the classification of documents, registers, appeals procedures and the need for the Union to recruit new officials."
"The democratic nature of the institutions will only be more effectively safeguarded with the Commission' s original proposals, which we consider to be reasonable and quite sufficient."
"Article 255 of the Treaty does not require any more to be done."
"I have abstained in the vote on public access to the documents of the European Parliament, Council and Commission."
"The compromise drawn up under the Swedish Presidency means that the EU will, for the first time, have a principle of public access to official records; that accessibility of documents rather than secrecy will now be the general rule."
"From a Swedish perspective, I fear that the agreement reached between the EU' s three institutions will lead to a weakening of our principle of public access to official records and legislation dating back to the sixteenth century."
"This applies especially to Article 5 concerning the requirement of consultation with the EU authority concerned if a Swedish authority considers it unclear whether or not secrecy rules are applicable."
"In such a situation, I fear that Swedish authorities will practise self-censorship and will not wish to go against the instructions given by the EU authority, because they do not want to come into conflict with the European level."
"If so, the EU legislation on the principle of public access to official records would lead to a deterioration of the access to public documents in my home country of Sweden."
"Following a short but intensive process in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, the European Parliament has accepted a compromise proposal that was negotiated by certain parliamentarians, the Council through the Swedish Presidency, and the Commission."
"We are aware that this is a difficult and sensitive area in a number of ways, for example because of the fact that it must be possible to classify certain documents and exempt them from public access and because of the fact that the rules for openness and public access vary widely between the Member States."
"However, we regret the way in which this matter has been dealt with in the committee, i.e. through a process that is not described in Parliament' s Rules of Procedure and has not previously been the practice."
"The result has been that a conciliation was negotiated between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission as early as during the first reading, without individual parliamentarians or the public being given opportunity to follow the process."
"This is remarkable for a matter that deals precisely with openness and public access."
"The Verts/ALE Group believes that the issue of openness deserved a longer discussion process in which the citizens of the EU could have followed the progress of the matter better."
"Evans J report (A5-0125/2001)"
"Mr President, you who pay great attention to my explanations of vote know that I have a guinea pig at home, who is also affected by this regulation."
"I tried to ask him what he thought of the regulation."
"He moves very quickly - which is why he is called 'Schumi' , after Schumacher - but he did not reply."
"However, I decided that he must support this directive because he told me that he wanted to come with me too to provide a little domesticity - being, of course, a domestic animal - at the European Parliament."
"He is, I have to say, somewhat concerned because, should he have children, the baby guinea pigs would not be able to come with him, but he concluded: ""I cannot expect the European Parliament to take care of everything!"""
"My only concern in voting for the motion is the following: I hope that, in the future, what happens in the film 'Planet of the Apes' , when the apes do to us humans what we do now to our pets, will not come to pass in everyday life."
"Would it not be better to abide by the precautionary principle and just treat animals a little better, without all these injections and electronic chips?"
"This report raises certain questions."
"First of all, with regard to the legal basis that is the combination of Article 37, on the organisation of the agricultural markets, and Article 152, on phytosanitary and veterinary measures."
"Article 152(1)(2) only states that ""Community action, which shall complement national policies, shall be directed towards improving public health..."""
"There is no mention of harmonisation."
"Then, there is the question of the added value of the Union: without any harmonisation of health policy, the fight against rabies has produced very good results in Europe, enabling quarantine measures, for example, to be lifted in Sweden and the United Kingdom."
"Finally, there is the question of the financial implications for pet owners of the proposal for a regulation: tattooing carried out by a vet costs around FRF 150 whereas fitting a microchip will cost between FRF 400 and FRF 500 francs."
"Tattooing, which has been tested in health and veterinary practice in France, has the advantage of being immediately readable, thereby making the search for the animal' s owner straightforward and rapid and does not require any reading equipment."
"This proposal would require the standardisation of transponders (Standard ISO 11784) and of reading equipment for the microchips (Standard ISO 11785)."
"In any event, the person responsible for the animal must not be responsible, when checks are carried out, for the equipment needed to read the microchip."
"Following the eight-year transitional period, both methods of identification - tattoo and transponder - must coexist."
"The owner must be given the choice of which method of identification he or she prefers."
"As for those who are pressing for the widespread use of transponders for reasons of animal welfare, we feel that that is another debate altogether."
"For all of these reasons, we oppose the text."
"Swoboda report (A5-0132/2001)"
"Mr President, you are also aware that I am the National Secretary of the Pensioners' Party, which elected me to this Parliament from Italy."
"Now then, on 1 May, I was on a pleasure trip to Macedonia, where I met an elderly Macedonian shepherd whom I stopped to talk to about pensions. I told him about this document and this cooperation upon which we have just voted."
"(I voted for the motion.) We discussed the matter and he - his name is Alexander, Alexander the Macedonian, that is - asked me: ""But is there any mention in this cooperation agreement of the pensioners of Macedonia?"""
"""No,"" I replied, ""it does not mention them."""
"""Well then,"" he continued, ""if you get the opportunity to present an explanation of vote, say that these cooperation agreements must concern themselves with the way the pensions of the State of Macedonia are managed as well."""
"The Swoboda report on the conclusion of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is far from satisfactory."
"Europe should, in the current situation, bring all its political and economic weight to bear, particularly on ensuring that the various key players take part in a genuine round of negotiations."
"The European Union could seek to have the constitution amended so that it recognises the Albanians as a constituent people of the Republic and to make it easier to acquire Macedonian citizenship."
"The Albanian language should be recognised as an official language of Macedonia, from primary school to university and also in the public services."
"Greater internal autonomy could be given to the regions which have an Albanian majority."
"Albanians should also be given better access to public sector jobs, in which they are currently under-represented."
"If none of these measures are implemented, there is a danger that tensions between the two communities will worsen in the short-term."
"Furthermore, criminalising one community in the eyes of the other by calling it 'terrorist' only further muddies the waters."
"Rather than pursuing this policy, as the report suggests, Parliament should encourage the Macedonian government to negotiate with the parties representing the Albanians, in order to find constitutional solutions, which will enable a lasting peace to be achieved in Macedonia."
"For these reasons, we will not be voting in favour of this report."
"The European Union is claiming to be a factor for stabilisation in the former Yugoslavia. This pretension is both dishonest and vain."
"It is dishonest because rivalry between great European powers has contributed in a major way to the collapse of Yugoslavia and to the conflicts which preceded the collapse or which have resulted from it."
"Air operations in Serbia and Kosovo by the major powers, particularly the European powers, have not improved and, in fact, have worsened the climate of inter-ethnic hostility that has been fostered and cultivated by nationalist organisations."
"This pretension is vain because, despite the ""enhanced presence and strong commitment by KFOR"" of which the recommendation boasts, the activity of armed groups seeking to cut off and control the community of their own nationality and to terrorise the nationality that they have declared to be their enemy is continuing and growing worse."
"It is not our intention to endorse the diplomatic and military operations undertaken in the Balkans by the great powers because, rather than bringing peace to the region, they are helping to increase the people' s suffering."
"Although the peoples of the Balkans have been paying for the prejudices of the political leaders of their own ruling classes with their blood for over a century, they are paying an infinitely higher price for the actions of the major European powers."
"Consequently, we voted against the recommendation."
"Four small countries in Europe are multilingual."
"They are Belgium, Switzerland, Moldavia and Macedonia."
"In part of the country, a large majority of the inhabitants speak a language which is the same as, or related to, that in the neighbouring country."
"The same applies to another section of the population, but involves a completely different language."
"In many cases, the inhabitants dislike the fact that they are being cut off from their same-language neighbours and wonder why they are still part of a state which unites them with another area of which they can hardly understand the language, if at all."
"Anyone who wants to keep such countries united, must ensure that there are no second-class citizens, no winners or losers, nor subordinates."
"This can only be done if the people are governed and educated in the majority language of their part of the country."
"Since the Macedonian government has not yet come to this realisation, it is driving part of its inhabitants to despair."
"It does pride itself on the presence of Albanian ministers, but does not ensure collective equality as it is in place in Belgium and Switzerland."
"Granting financial aid now and promising the country EU membership could lull that government into thinking that it need not solve that problem, and that it can ignore the anger of a large section of the population."
"By granting this premature aid, we are inciting unintended state violence."
"Cederschiöld report (A5-0120/2001)"
"Mr President, I am sure that I will always remember you for your kindness."
"I have to say that you are right: indeed, I have not yet mentioned my eldest daughter, Elisabetta."
"Before leaving to come to Brussels, I discussed with her this document on the forgery of the euro, and she said to me: ""You will see that you will no longer have to change Italian lire into Belgian francs, French francs or any other European currency."""
"""You are right,"" I replied. ""This measure on the euro will be wonderful for us Members of the European Parliament."""
"Then, a moment later, a thought occurred to me and I said to her: ""But what if, when I get to Brussels, they ask me for a euro with a Belgian face on and they will not accept a euro with an Italian or a Greek face on, and so on and so forth?"""
"In other words, would it not be better for the euro to be the same on both sides?"
"One of the lessons that I have learned from yesterday' s debate on protecting the euro from counterfeiting is that the European Union and the various governments concerned are committing a serious error of judgment on the introduction of the single currency."
"At the moment, they are giving the public neither a financial guarantee against the risk of counterfeit euros, nor financial aid for adaptation measures, as if this were a straightforward operation of replacing one set of notes with another."
"This is not the case at all."
"We are facing a quite exceptional and hazardous operation, which involves both replacing all coins and notes and at the same time changing all the points of reference."
"If we are to succeed in this exceptional undertaking, to reassure the public and to give them support, which is essential, exceptional means must be provided, with, of course, the corresponding budgets."
"Admittedly, these budgets would probably prove to be very high. They would not satisfy the Maastricht criteria for public deficits."
"This is a paradox about this operation which we have to accept."
"In order to resolve this paradox, we could first of all consider removing the budgets for the introduction of the euro from the calculation of the 3% deficit."
"This would clearly be a definitive operation."
"We would then have to find the money, at a time when economic growth is, of course, slowing down in Europe and when tax revenue will be falling."
"We could put forward various ideas on this matter, including that of levying a 'special introduction of the euro' tax on the profits of large companies, since they will be the main beneficiaries of the single currency."
"In any case, I maintain my conclusion that it is dishonest and irresponsible to act as we are today, attempting to shift the cost of introducing the euro onto hundreds of thousands of 'little people' who cannot fight back."
"This 'technical' debate, is reminder to us all that the euro will be here soon, in less than eight months, and that it does not really look today as though the European public, and even companies, are fully prepared for this great 'upheaval' ."
"People are going to suffer a tremendous shock, but I am not worried about the final outcome."
"A currency is merely an instrument that will, admittedly, have consequences for a necessary fiscal harmonisation, but which will, above all, only have real meaning within a Europe that has democratic and effective political institutions, so that the currency is a tool that can be used for implementing political decisions."
"This is why the forthcoming months will be vital for Europe, first of all with the introduction of the euro on 1 January 2002, the first new Members to join the Union on 1 January 2003, the European elections in June 2004 and lastly, the 'definitive' reform of our institutions by the end of 2004."
"Mrs Cederschiöld' s report rightly emphasises the considerable risks of the euro being counterfeited ""when euro notes and coins come into circulation"" and consequently entering the race for the ""title of the world' s most counterfeited currency"" at the time that ""internal frontiers are abolished, thus allowing criminals to move around freely throughout the European Union"" ."
"We must now face the consequences, which were deliberately played down when we should have addressed them properly, of taking political decisions favouring the introduction of the euro, which now appear to be very serious for the everyday life of our citizens."
"We all know that it was not necessary for the euro to become an active currency."
"There was no financial need for it."
"This is a purely political decision, which stems from the desire to completely eradicate national currencies."
"If our recommendation had been accepted for the euro to be chosen, not as the single currency, but as a common currency with precedence over national currencies for certain uses likely to develop in line with the real needs of society, as a complementary currency and not as a substitute currency, we would not be facing this enormous problem of counterfeiting today."
"Our rapporteur is legitimately concerned about the authenticity checks which banking establishments will clearly have to carry out."
"I am surprised and shocked, however, that no proposals have been made specifically to help future victims of euro counterfeiters."
"It is the duty of those who have made the political choice to introduce the euro, in other words, the most traumatic choice they could inflict on our citizens, resulting in the sudden and total loss of the yardstick by which they establish different values in their everyday lives, to accept full responsibility for the consequences of their decision."
"(The speaker was cut short pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"The risk that attempts may be made to counterfeit the euro currency when it begins to circulate in the form of coins and notes is very high."
"The euro currency is already an international reserve and a transaction currency."
"The euro will be in open competition with the dollar for the title of the world' s most counterfeited currency, unless we all make concerted efforts to ensure that the counterfeiters are defeated."
"The euro currency does run a particular risk of being counterfeited at the time when it is introduced into circulation and during the period when it will circulate alongside national notes and coins."
"I am referring primarily to the months of January and February of next year when many people will be unfamiliar with the actual make-up of the euro notes and coins."
"The arrangements for protecting the euro against counterfeiting must involve all EU Member States, EU institutions and all relevant international organisations."
"A comprehensive legal framework must be put in place which can be operated in a uniform manner across all the territories of the European Union."
"The fact of the matter is that the only international instrument which is designed to prevent and punish currency counterfeiting is the Geneva Convention of 1929."
"The Convention is fairly ineffectual in its purpose."
"That is one of the reasons why Member States within the European Union have adopted different pieces of legislation to guarantee that criminals who commit counterfeiting are vigorously punished."
"EU leaders were correct in Nice last December when they stated that an effective system to protect the euro against counterfeiting must be adopted as soon as possible this year."
"The arrangements for protecting the euro against counterfeiting will be based primarily on information which will fall into two categories."
"The first of these concerns technical information such as data collection, manufacturing methods and the technical features of counterfeits."
"The co-ordination of this information will be the responsibility of the counterfeiting analysis centre which has been set up under the auspices of the European Central Bank."
"The second concerns police information which is intended to assist in the gathering of data relating to counterfeiting at both strategic and operational levels."
"The introduction of the euro and the disappearance of national currencies will ensure a shift from the protection of certain national interests to the protection of a Community interest."
"This will involve developing forms of co-operation and co-ordination between the key players and the Member States which will be responsible for combating any counterfeiting of the euro."
"This will clearly involve banks, the police and judicial authorities as well as the relevant EU bodies and institutions such as the European Central Bank, OLAF and Europol."
". Conservative MEPs have supported this report even though we do not believe that the euro is appropriate for the UK."
"We do, however, want it to be a success in the hands of those who have accepted it and we recognise the fact that since its arrival, the City of London has handled the 'lion's share' of currency transactions in the euro."
"Consequently, many jobs depend upon the safe dealing in that currency and we therefore support this initiative in protecting against counterfeiting."
"Cederschiöld report (A5-0121/2001)"
"I do not support the legalisation of ecstasy, cannabis or other synthetic drugs such as LSD or amphetamines."
"The UN Convention against the illicit traffic of narcotic drugs prohibits the use, manufacture and distribution of ecstasy, LSD and amphetamines and this policy position must be fully upheld."
"The World Health Organisation has referred also many times to the unquantifiable damage that such drugs can do to the users."
"We cannot and must not support the creation of a drugs culture in our society by legally permitting the use of soft and synthetic drugs."
"This is the overwhelming view of the vast majority of European Union Governments as well as being the strong opinion of the European Parliament."
"For example, some people seek to contend that the use of ecstasy should be deemed as being quite normal in society."
"I find this contention difficult to support, particularly in the light of the fact that there has already been a vast number of deaths, both in Ireland and across Europe from the use of ecstasy."
"Let us be clear about one thing."
"The long-term effects of the use of ecstasy are still very much unknown."
"Ecstasy is a drug that certainly is a cause for depression but it may also cause memory impairment as well as other illnesses."
"We cannot and must not support the creation of a drugs culture in our society by legally permitting the use of soft and synthetic drugs."
"While the European economy is performing strongly, we must equally ensure that key social problems such as drug abuse are combated in a structured and streamlined manner."
"That is why monies must always be put aside for the development of youth facilities in disadvantaged areas that suffer from drug abuse or which are likely to suffer from drug abuse in the future."
"To combat drug abuse there must be a partnership approach put in place involving police authorities, social groups, voluntary organisations and local authorities."
"Continued publications outlining the damage that narcotic and synthetic drugs can do to users must also be welcomed."
"The trade in synthetic drugs is often a case of organised crime."
"Enough reason to fight it and to coordinate and intensify the investigation activities at European level."
"That is why the Group of the European Socialists has voted for Mrs Cederschiöld' s report."
"However, a number of members of my Group were less satisfied with the underlying Swedish initiative proposal."
"Its highly technical content rendered it particularly impenetrable; it is also insufficiently clear how this very detailed proposal now fits in with the EU strategy on drugs policy as a whole."
"Why should we send the confiscated samples criss-cross through Europe if we can exchange analysis protocols?"
"Little else has been clarified on the coordination front of the proposal with the Commission activities."
"It is also regrettable that it appeared impossible to use the laboratories in question for quality control from the point of view of preventing health risks for the users."
"These members of my Group would like to see a few changes in future."
"Nevertheless, in this highly technical policy proposal, they did not want to create the impression, by voting against, that they back the problems surrounding the synthetic drug."
"Nuclear safety"
"The resolution tabled in the European Parliament on nuclear safety fifteen years after Chernobyl highlights the gravity of this major accident and its consequences for health and the environment. The resolution takes care not to endorse the replacement in Ukraine of 'Russian and old' nuclear power stations with 'Western and modern' nuclear power stations."
"It recommends a long-term policy which specifically includes energy savings and the use of renewable energy sources."
"It questions the reliability of the 'risk model' used by the official agencies."
"These measures are all in the right direction."
"Even today, however, the European authorities have not really learnt the lessons from this disaster."
"The resolution itself does no more than recommend the closure of 'at risk' nuclear power stations."
"The causes of the accident, however, were not primarily technological ones. What Chernobyl shows above all is what happens when a nuclear power goes into crisis - a social crisis rather than a technical one."
"The accident was not, therefore, specifically Russian: it has universal significance and unveils one of the great lies peddled by the apostles of nuclear power."
"These 'nucleocrats' act 'as if' our societies could for centuries manage a form of energy that presents an immeasurable risk and will never experience a crisis."
"The lessons from the last century and the current chaos in the world suffice to show how irresponsible this premise is."
"Doyle report (A5-0119/2001)"
"Mr President, Mrs Doyle - who is a member of the European People's Party - invited me to dinner: in real life, not in a dream!"
"We talked about this measure which is so important, and we each ordered two horse steaks."
"""But this steak smells like medicine!"" I said to her."
"""Or rather, it smells like anaesthetic: in fact, I can't taste it' s flavour any more."""
"""Bravo, Mr Fatuzzo,"" said Mrs Doyle, ""this is why I am requesting that we make it possible to treat animals that cannot be treated at the moment because we cannot use medicines on them."""
"""Yes, but the meat tastes awful,"" I said."
"""Couldn't we stipulate that animals which fall ill have to be treated but not eaten?"""
"At a time of huge food scares, with dangerous consequences for the health of consumers, some of whom have even died, one would have expected greater sensitivity on the question of food safety."
"Yet, the report calls for veterinary medicinal products for which no maximum residue limits have been established to be excluded from the ban on the use of these products in feeding and fattening food-producing animals."
"We disagree with this derogation, nor do we accept the spurious argument that pharmaceutical multinationals supposedly have no interest in developing suitable veterinary medicinal products."
"On the contrary, we emphasise the need to adopt and comply with ever stricter control procedures throughout the entire animal food cycle (feedingstuffs, medicinal products, processing of foods of animal origin etc.) so that the system for producing foods of animal origin can be controlled as tightly as possible."
"Not, of course, that we are labouring under the misapprehension that controls which fully guarantee the safety of the food produced are possible in a capitalist system."
"Nor do we agree with the rapporteur' s call for a pan-European licensing system for medicinal products."
"Such a system would basically abolish the control mechanisms and services of the Member States, which are responsible for controlling marketing applications for medicinal products, as they will be forced to accept licences issued by another Member State."
"For these reasons, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece will be voting against the Doyle report."
"Katiforis report (A5-0127/2001)"
"Mr Katiforis' document on the implementation of stability and convergence programmes affects pensions, as we are all aware."
"Therefore, as representative of the Pensioners' Party, I would like to stress how important it is for pension funds to be managed properly in the States of the European Union."
"Many of the European Union's States use a part of workers' salaries to pay their pensions, which is set aside and then returned when they are pensioners."
"I therefore call upon all 15 governments of the European Union to keep these funds safe, manage them well and make sure that they give good returns, for we all have the right to a sufficiently high, substantial pension which is enough to live on."
"Mr President, the Christian Social Union supported the Katiforis report in the final vote."
"I should, however, just like to point out that we voted against item 4."
"We agree with the objective of the report per se, which is to reduce budgetary deficits or even, if possible, to achieve a surplus."
"This is contradicted by item 4, which approves of new debts, even within the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"In the final analysis, our message should be that this 3% should not be used up - which might well be the case - and that our objective is still to achieve a surplus."
"Parliament should do everything it can, especially on the eve of the introduction of the euro, to ensure that the euro remains stable and this should be the message that it sends out."
"The Katiforis report is yet another attack on the incomes and rights of workers in a bid to promote the interests of big business."
"The recipe described for a low rate of inflation is wage restraint and fiscal prudence, rather than limiting the profits made by monopolies."
"It alleges that 'structural reform' and liberalisation make a contribution to development (obviously of big business, not the workers)."
"The report calls for harmony between the social partners and the further development of flexible types of work to allow ""structural reform to continue speedily [with the] structural changes intended to increase flexibility and competitiveness in all factor, product and labour markets""."
"It recommends more flexible markets, starting with the job market, and calls for trades unions to ensure there is 'harmony' in collective bargaining, i.e. to accept flexible forms of work as the norm, the dismantling of their achievements and increased poverty with no conditions attached so that the European monopolies can earn more and be more competitive."
"It avoids explaining why, despite the increase in the rate of growth and the huge reduction in the cost of labour, there has been no concomitant reduction in unemployment which, it agrees, is extremely high."
"It considers the application of stability and convergence programmes to be extremely important and welcomes Greece' s first stability programme, which demanded and, in fact, still demands continuous programmes of increasingly strict, unilateral, barbaric and inhumane austerity."
"It is a policy of job insecurity and increasing unemployment and poverty among workers, a policy to disenfranchise the rural population and increase the profits of the ruling class in our country."
"According to the obligations imposed by the stability agreement and the strict recommendations accompanying the reports by the Commission, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Greece, the austerity policy needs to be stepped up, the reversal in employment relations and in the social and welfare system needs to become the norm and privatisation needs to continue at an even faster pace."
"The Katiforis report confirms that the European Parliament supports the application of stability and convergence programmes, the coordination of anti-grass roots measures between Member States and Community guidance and supervision."
"The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece are voting against this report which promises more poverty for the workers and new mega-profits for big business and which is intended to undermine everything the workers have achieved."
"However, the best response is for the workers to take to the streets in the various countries of Europe and in Greece in huge, mass, rallies and strikes against these barbaric measures and programmes."
". (PT) Through this report, the European Parliament is delivering its assessment of the second updates of the original stability and convergence programmes established by the Member States in 1999."
"Instead of encouraging a change of direction in the economic guidelines we follow, however, the downward revision of the economic growth rate and the slowdown of the world economy are calling for more of the same: to pursue and step up fiscal prudence, especially the reduction of public expenditure and wage moderation as a means of guaranteeing the objective of price stability, to which the European Union is, unacceptably, continuing to subordinate all its economic guidelines and social policies."
"The rapporteur adheres closely to this philosophy, following the Lisbon strategy, in particular the objective of creating, within a decade, the world' s most dynamic and competitive economy. It is, therefore, not surprising that he calls for wage moderation and links the establishment of ""suitable wage policies"" to tax reductions, which is in line ""with the structural changes intended to increase flexibility and competitiveness in all factor, product and labour markets"" and that he considers that ""structural reforms and liberalisation"" can make a ""decisive contribution"" to the objective outlined in Lisbon."
"I have therefore voted against this report."
"It is nevertheless worth pointing out something positive, which is the rapporteur' s approach to investment, particularly the importance of public investment, which was completely ignored by the Commission, with regard to a variable that is crucial for the sustainability of economic growth and for creating employment."
"We shall be voting against the Katiforis report, every point of which we disapprove of."
"First and foremost, we reject its stubborn promotion of wage policies that are ""suitable to the maintaining of wage moderation"" ."
"We feel instead that the growth we have regained is fragile and could well be destroyed in the rush to implement such recommendations."
"We should instead try to ensure that, throughout Europe, wages increase at the same rate as the per capita GDP."
"We are also opposed to the socio-liberal policy of tax reduction."
"It would be much better to concentrate the resources freed up by excessive growth on increasing welfare budgets and on fighting against poverty caused by long years of the prevailing economic liberalism."
"We recommend that we should fight these ""structural changes intended to increase flexibility"" , which the report claims it approves."
"Pursuing this path is the best way to stifle growth and to increase unemployment."
"We feel instead that we should implement a social policy at European level based first and foremost on the establishment of a system of minimum wages and collective labour agreements."
"Harbour report (A5-0116/2001)"
"Yesterday afternoon, Mr Mario Mauro, my Italian colleague from the European People's Party, organised a meeting on the future of the Internet."
"I had already prepared the explanation of my vote for the motion, but I altered it after taking part in his meeting, which, moreover, was extremely interesting, as his meetings always are."
"However, half way through the meeting, Mr President, Mr Mauro used an example."
"He said: ""You see, the Internet is a tool, not an end in itself."
"For example, here is a glass."
"Can you see this glass?"
"It is to be used for drinking."
"If, however, I pick it up and smash it over Mr Fatuzzo's head,"" - this is exactly what he said - ""Mr Fatuzzo's head will be in pieces and the glass will not have been used for drinking""."
"He used this example to explain that the Internet must be used properly, not abused."
"I agree with him for, apart from anything else, it is not difficult to realise that if I had not voted for the motion 636 glasses would have been smashed over my head."
"Our vote against this report is not an expression of opposition to the development of the Internet or to any kind of technical progress."
"Underlying the general considerations, however, various paragraphs hint at subsidies for private companies in this sector."
"This is suggested particularly in the report' s support for ""partnership research ventures with the private sector"" ."
"As we are opposed to any direct or indirect subsidy seeking to use public money to generate private profit, we voted against this report."
"The own-initiative report that we have been discussing today seeks to persuade the European Commission to ""give an EU research initiative on the nextgeneration Internet and new communications infrastructure(and associated electronic communications) a high priority in the 6th Framework research strategy"" ."
"As rapporteur on this subject, I had an obligation to speak and I wished to emphasise that the European Commission' s proposal on the new FPRTD has taken account of this requirement, since the second priority, of the 7+1 priorities, focuses on technologies for the Information Society."
"It was clear that a sector that represented such considerable progress would be given a prominent place in this multi-annual programme."
"I largely approve of the report' s requests, whilst at the same time deploring their excessively liberal tone."
"The rapporteur often forgets that these new technologies must exist, first and foremost, to serve the public."
"He is right to say that EU and Member State resources should focus on pre-competitive projects, with the objective of ensuring a powerful EU presence in theglobal development of next generation Internet and new communications infrastructures reinforcing the EU's role in Internet governance."
"In this context, I would point out that our Parliament voted, in the part-session of March 2001, for the Carraro report, which focused on the place that the Member States and the European Union should occupy within ICANN [the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers] - a private, non-profit company that has produced several key Internet systems - and which recommends opening up this system to developing countries."
"I am delighted that the Harbour report takes up these two points again."
"Like Mr Harbour, I support the strategy of seeking to promote the 'centres of excellence' referred to in the Commission' s proposals for creating a European research area, even if, I repeat, this concept needs to be clarified."
"I think it is a good idea that one of these centres should specialise in electronic communication, but we have not yet reached that point!"
"With regard to the rapid creation of a super fast trans-European research network with a capacity of 100 gigabytes per second, this is, of course, an essential prerequisite to achieving an economy that is competitive, dynamic and knowledge-based, as defined in Lisbon."
"I shall take this opportunity to repeat insist on the fact that super fast Internet must benefit all strata of society."
"This is what I would have liked to see in my report on Universal Service and the new communications networks."
"Unfortunately, my amendments on this subject were rejected, largely at the behest of Mr Harbour!"
"It is right that Parliament should assert the need for research into the next generation Internet, considering the huge capabilities that this tool can provide for citizens and firms, especially in a Europe that needs to consolidate its presence on the Web."
"The proposal for a resolution, which I support, must, in addition, stress certain points, which will make it possible to better define a future scenario which, considering that the sector evolves extremely rapidly, also changes extremely rapidly and includes certain discoveries that demand abrupt changes and rethinks."
"However, with regard to bandwidth, it is appropriate to study the possible role in the future of the Internet of the use of satellites for two-way telecommunication as well and the use of terminals for DTT."
"Those who are concerned, for example, with mountain regions know that some technologies lend themselves better to use in isolated areas, where technologies such as cable are difficult, and that the new technologies are absolutely crucial to avoid marginalisation in places where it would be even more serious than elsewhere."
"There are many areas to cover, ranging from the widespread local use of microwave systems to interactive 'broadband' services, from the need to make the Internet more user-friendly by making it possible to access it without a computer, to the aspects of network security, which have already been studied on a number of occasions."
"The great caution needed is clear."
"Evidence of this is, for example, the explosion, which has already happened in the United States but also in some European countries as well, of the myth that the dot com market will develop exponentially."
"Then there is the sensitive but key subject of standards to regulate the Web, intended not to restrict free space but to prevent abuse and improper or even vandalistic use."
"Finally, it must be remembered that the Internet must combine the globalisation process, which is an inherent part of its development, with the need for multimedia services at regional and local levels, thus providing that proximity and closeness to the citizen that is a genuine asset and must be enhanced."
"That concludes Parliament' s agenda."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.50 a.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 3 May 2001."
"Statement by the President"
"Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, even during the election campaign in the Basque region, ETA terrorists have been active in Spain. On 6 May, the President of the Popular Party in the region of Aragon, Manuel Giménez Abad, was assassinated in Zaragoza, and on 11 May, a car bomb exploded in Madrid, injuring thirteen people."
"On my own personal behalf and on behalf of the European Parliament, I immediately expressed our deepest sympathy and our sincere condolences to the family of Mr Giménez Abad."
"I have also assured the Spanish authorities of our support."
"One thing at least emerges clearly from the results of the elections held in the Spanish Basque region: the Basque people, who turned out in force to cast their votes, have rejected violence."
"I can only hope, now, that this message will be heard by all the political powers."
"I shall now ask you, please, to observe a minute' s silence."
"(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)"
"Agenda"
"The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 10 May pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed."
"As far as Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday are concerned, no amendments have been proposed."
"As far as Thursday is concerned:"
"With regard to topical and urgent subjects of major importance, two amendments have been proposed."
"On Human Rights, it is proposed that the second sub-item, 'Guatemala' , should be replaced by a new sub-item, 'Human rights situation in Cameroon' ."
"This amendment was tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance."
"(Parliament gave its assent) Still on the subject of Thursday, 'Illegal exploitation of natural resources in the Democratic Republic of the Congo' , it is proposed by the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left that this item should be replaced by a new item, 'Floods in France' ."
"Madam President, in voting as we did just now as a group on the Cameroon question, we were assuming that other groups would help us in raising Guatemala, the position of Rios Montt and the very serious human rights violations next month; we should also like to propose that this topic, major reports and the situation in Congo be dealt with next month, since we are directly involved as the EU and it appears that next month will be possible."
"In that case we can deal now with the serious situation regarding the floods in France."
"We therefore agree with the substitution proposal."
"Madam President, I have a point of order concerning the death penalty in the United States."
"I should like to ask you, if you have not already done so, to write to the President of the United States, Mr Bush, to ask that the death sentence against Tim McVeigh, the extreme right-wing terrorist bomber in Oklahoma, be commuted to life imprisonment."
"This is on the basis of our longstanding opposition to the death penalty in the United States but in this particular case it is reinforced by the increasing evidence that the bombing was not carried out by a crazed lone bomber but as part of a conspiracy by the extreme right-wing Aryan Republic Army."
"To execute him at this stage would be to frustrate the search for truth and justice and serve the interests and ideology of the very people implicated in the crime."
"Madam President, you mentioned the elections in the Basque Autonomous Community."
"The Spanish Reconquista of the Basque Autonomous Community has not succeeded. We, Euskal Herritarrok, have paid for that."
"Yesterday's elections have been a rough competition on who is best to fight our political option."
"It is therefore not astonishing, if we appear as losers."
"The real failure, however, is that of the Spanish nationalists, the PP and the Socialist Party and the very government of Señor Aznar."
"They have not achieved their goal of ousting Basque nationalists from the autonomous government."
"The election results give us a clear message."
"A large majority of the Basque people is urging political parties to come back to the 1998 agreement of Lizarra for a breakthrough from the actual situation."
"The European Union can no longer consider this issue as an internal question of the Spanish Kingdom."
"Madam President, every time there is a killing in the Basque Country or in Spain, and this House carries out its dignified ritual of condemning these criminal acts and holding a minute' s silence, we are forced to listen to an MEP, a specialist in funeral addresses, taking the opportunity to spread his propaganda on a programme which we would respect if it were not tragically accompanied by crime and murder."
"It is an unworthy and, above all, completely pointless exercise which is going to convince no-one in this House."
"I would ask him to apply his energy and his speaking skills, if he has any, to convincing his friends to stop their murdering."
"Thank you very much, Madam President."
"Madam President. I wish to congratulate Mr Berlusconi on his splendid victory in the Italian elections."
"I hope that Mr Michel, the current Foreign Minister of Belgium, and his fellow travellers, the left-wing European press, will now shut up and respect the democratic choice of the Italian people with no more calls for Austria-style sanctions or interference by the EU."
"I should like to remind the new Italian government of the commitment made by the previous government of Mr Amato and supported by all the MEPs of the governing coalition here in this House to end the shameful perpetual exile of the Royal House of Savoy and allow them to return to their country of origin by amending the Italian Constitution as soon as possible."
"Madam President, I should like to raise a particular issue pursuant to Rule 44 (5) of the Rules of Procedure on priority questions, which the Commission must answer within three weeks."
"I tabled a priority question to the Commission on 15 February 2001 on the work of the national land register in Greece."
"It is the only issue on which there is serious political disagreement between the Commission and the Greek government."
"The Commission should have answered me by about 10 March. It has not done so."
"Parliament' s services have sent out four reminders."
"On 19 March, 2 April, 18 April and 2 May. The Commission has still not replied."
"This being the case, I should like you to raise this matter in connection with this question in particular and the need for the Commission to keep to the timetable for questions which we raise in general."
"Madam President, now that the Italian elections have taken place and we can no longer be accused of electioneering, I would like to know whether you have received a new petition from the Spanish Supreme Court in relation to the waiver of Mr Berlusconi' s immunity and whether you are going to deal with it without further delay, since this document has been confirmed in eight judicial decrees, including one from the Constitutional Court which, as you know, is the highest judicial body in Spain, higher than the Council of State."
"The Supreme Court has the competence to approach this House directly to demand that a petition be processed."
"I would like to know whether you have received it, in the terms that I have mentioned, and how you are going to proceed."
"Mrs Sauquillo Pérez Del Arco, I am profoundly grateful to you for having raised this issue, thereby giving me the opportunity to provide Members with vitally important information."
"I have to say that I was dying to mention it, but it would not have been possible for me to take the initiative on this subject myself."
"There is one essential point."
"The Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs wrote to me a few days ago in order to pass onto me the opinion of the Council of State."
"You will remember, ladies and gentlemen, that this was what we were waiting for."
"The Spanish government had raised the matter with the Council of State, and the latter has issued an opinion."
"This opinion, I have to say, confirms the legal caution that I believed we would have to exercise."
"In other words, the Council of State takes the view that the request for the waiver of immunity should be sent to us by the Spanish Ministry of Justice, and not directly by the Supreme Court."
"That is the position."
"Of course it is not for me to comment on the positions adopted by the courts of the Member States."
"I think that would lead us away from the matter in hand."
"It is quite obvious, Mrs Sauquillo, that for my part I am waiting to receive this request, one of these days, via the official channels, in accordance with our Rules of Procedure."
"If the appropriate authority, which in the view of the Spanish Council of State is the Ministry of Justice, if, as I say, the Ministry of Justice sends me a request for the waiver of the parliamentary immunity of the Members in question, and of other Members as well, I shall of course refer it immediately to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, after having announced it in Parliament."
"I believe that matters are clear at the moment."
"Moreover, for many of us they have always been clear."
"They have been the subject of a certain amount of controversial debate, which I personally regret."
"However, please believe me when I say that I harbour absolutely no resentment whatsoever against any individual Member."
"Madam President, if I understood you correctly, the Spanish Constitutional Court has confirmed your opinion, and ruled that requests for the lifting of immunity, even from the Spanish Supreme Court, must be addressed to you through the Spanish government."
"There was some controversy over whether the stance you took was necessarily correct."
"In the light of the situation, I should like to address a further question to Mrs Sauquillio: Do you know whether the dossiers are already on their way here?"
"Have you been informed that the dossier is being sent to you again?"
"Yes or no?"
"Secondly, did I also understand you correctly as saying that you intend asking the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs to deal with the matter as soon as the documents arrive?"
"Will you be doing that directly, or will you be informing Parliament first?"
"On the basis of what you yourself have said, you ought first to inform Parliament when you have received the file, and only then could you involve the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs."
"That would mean that we could not expect the matter to come before the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs until after the next plenary session."
"That is why I am asking you quite specifically: will you be passing the files to the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs as soon as you receive the dossier irrespective of the plenary session, I mean the files on the presumed suspect Mr Berlusconi and the file on the presumed suspect Mr Dell' Utri?"
"There are, after all, two cases here."
"Thank you, Mr Schulz."
"First of all, I should like to thank you for having taken note of the Council of State' s decision and of the fact that the decision in question, that is to say the opinion of the Spanish Council of State, confirmed the legal caution which I had exercised."
"When I said that I harboured no resentment, I was referring to certain Members in particular."
"To some extent I was thinking of you, because it is true that you have had some very harsh words to say. However, that is all forgotten now."
"I shall now reply very frankly and very clearly to your questions, and to the first one first."
"Have I received a new request, via the official channels, from the Spanish Government?"
"The answer is no."
"So far, I have received nothing."
"Secondly, when I do receive such a request, I shall simply follow Rule 6 of the Rules of Procedure, which says that any request addressed to the President by the appropriate authority of a Member State - it is clear, therefore, that the authority is the appropriate one - that the immunity of a Member be waived shall be announced in Parliament - that is the rule - and referred to the committee responsible."
"This being the case, I can confirm that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs is currently looking to see whether all this can be trimmed down and amended."
"You may not think that this is the best way to proceed, but for the time being, Mr Schulz, you will understand that I am applying the Rules of Procedure, as voted for by this House."
"That is the position, and I think I have made it very clear."
"Madam President, I should just like to ask you whether it would be possible for you to pass on to us quickly the letters which you have received and to which you have just referred, so that we can see the exact wording."
"Do you mean the letters from the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs?"
"By all means, in fact I thought that they had already reached you."
"Of course, we shall see to it immediately."
"Madam President, I am delighted to be able to tell the House, which adopted a resolution on 5 April, during our last session in Strasbourg, calling for the release of Mr Tsiakourmas, who was kidnapped in Cyprus, that the kidnappers have released him."
"I am sure that Parliament' s steadfast and almost unanimous decision helped to bring about his release."
"I should like to thank all my fellow Members for voting in favour of this resolution."
"I only hope that his release marks the beginning of a change in the behaviour of his kidnappers and that they allow Turkish Cypriots to contact their Greek counterparts, because then the irregular situation in Cyprus would be resolved very quickly."
"Thank you, Mr Katiforis."
"Manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco products"
"The next item is the report (A5-0162/2001) by Mr Maaten, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text for a European Parliament and Council directive on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco products [C5-0086/2001 - 1999/0244(COD)]."
". (NL) Madam President, this is already the third time that we have discussed this topic and the Council and Parliament spent an exciting night bringing things to a conclusion."
"It will surprise no one that the discussion in our Conciliation Committee that evening was dominated by the judgment of the Court on the tobacco advertising directive."
"There are many legal aspects attached to this and the question is whether we can now be certain about all the legal aspects that were raised."
"No, of course not."
"After all, we were dealing with a different case with different provisions attached in that judgment by the Court, but we certainly believe that we acted in accordance with the spirit of the Court' s judgment, and no more could be expected of us."
"Agreement was reached on the export provision, so that from 2007 onwards the same criteria will apply to tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide as to products sold within the European Union."
"In that sense things have been brought into line with the judgment of the Court."
"I am also happy to see that this topic has now also been raised in the World Health Organisation."
"We have reached agreement on the publication of ingredients and on the common list of ingredients."
"An extraordinarily important and pioneering provision."
"Ultimately the internal market is best served by a common regime in the field of ingredients and testing, as is public health."
"It is also important from the point of view of a possible future assessment of less harmful tobacco products."
"In relation to the regulation of snuff, for example; it is no secret that I personally belong to the minority here who felt it could perfectly well have been sold in the European Union, but we shall come back to that in the report of the Committee at the start of the next parliamentary term and probably also in relation to other, less harmful tobacco products that are still being developed."
"This topic will definitely be a political challenge to us all."
"We have reached agreement on warnings."
"In our view there can be no question of a ban on tobacco products and whether one likes it or not smoking is an individual, adult decision, as long as one does not harm others, provided it is based on adequate information."
"The consequences of smoking are so serious that consumers must be properly warned and we are now going further - though to my taste still not far enough - in the direction of the Canadian legislation, which is more intelligent that what we have been able to achieve so far in the European Union."
"I am very gratified that Member States have agreed to the option of printing pictures if they so wish and call on the Commission, when it comes to more detailed regulation at the end of 2002, to look closely at what has been developed abroad, for example in Canada."
"Then there is the matter of misleading descriptions."
"Large cigarette manufacturers, such as Philip Morris, agree with what Parliament and the Council were trying to achieve on this point."
"Naturally a misleading description, whether a commercial brand or not, cannot be allowed on the market, but legally it is a difficult business, perhaps particularly when it concerns a word like ""mild"" ."
"In the Conciliation Committee we finally opted for the formulation proposed by the Council which is based on the cosmetics directive and I believe that in so doing we have chosen a sensible path that is also legally sound."
"I should like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation of the Council."
"Although the Portuguese Presidency worked on this in the preliminary stages and the Swedish Presidency in the final phase, I have the greatest appreciation for the French Presidency, which played a crucial role on this point and also for the Commissioner."
"Perhaps I may for once breach protocol and also mention John Ryan who has been active for years in the Commission on this matter and has played a crucial part."
"My thanks also to the parliamentary delegation for their patience during this odd conciliation night and to Sabine Magnano and Klaus Beyer for their administrative support, but I should like to single out Renzo Imbeni, our delegation Chairman that evening, who dragged away our major points from the jaws of hell or at any rate from the jaws of the Council."
"I also believe that the participation of non-governmental organisations and of industry was positive."
"They were able to achieve a lot with their contribution."
"It was a remarkable conciliation."
"I have three concluding observations."
"In the first place, Parliament, the Commission and the Council gave a joint press conference which was a novelty and a positive experience."
"I should like to mention the rapid decision-making."
"In scarcely a year we managed to get this controversial and complex legislation carefully onto the statute book."
"Where are those slowly grinding Brussels and Strasbourg wheels that are always talked about?"
"Finally, the final result is, I believe, better than either the joint position of the Council or the final text of Parliament."
"This shows that the codecision procedure with equal involvement of Parliament, despite its cumbersome nature, is nevertheless the best way of reaching decisions in this Union."
"Madam President, as the rapporteur has already said, this is not the first time that tobacco has been on the agenda."
"We have discussed it on a number of occasions."
"It is a thorny problem because various conflicting interests are at issue, especially those of health and of industry. These in turn involve largely small and medium-sized businesses, which form the heart of the economy."
"Jobs are also at stake."
"It is good that the Commission should have come up with a new directive and should have taken the initiative in the health field of doing everything possible to combat the consequences of smoking, for example by reducing nicotine content, banning harmful substances, by warnings and better labelling, by highlighting the danger of passive smoking and through product information."
"In the field of the harmonisation of the internal market, it wants to do its utmost to combat different starting positions and to remove trading obstacles, by, for example, stating nicotine content, and by further harmonising policy on warnings and product information."
"I hope that we can really achieve reciprocal recognition of testing methods."
"Exports to third countries are a sore point."
"Personally I take the view that what we regard as inadmissibly harmful to the inhabitants of the EU should not be exported to other countries, even if they have no legislation in that field."
"I deplore the fact that this may have adverse consequences for employment in certain countries."
"I would like to observe, however, that in my view more jobs have been lost through restructuring or the closing of companies by the industry itself than from political regulation."
"For that reason I am for the time being reasonably optimistic."
"I also believe that we have reached a reasonable compromise on transition deadlines."
"As regards the legal basis, I would point out that this directive builds on three existing directives."
"I therefore assume that we have a good legal foundation, having listened to, among others, the legal advisers of Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"In conclusion two more general observations. The first is on young people and smoking."
"I would welcome it if the Member States could strengthen their efforts to advise young people against starting smoking, for example through pricing policy or, for example, by making points of sale unattractive and inaccessible or by prohibiting the free distribution of cigarettes on café terraces or near schools."
"That is not universal."
"A second observation concerns the subsidies on tobacco."
"On the one hand we have this directive aimed at discouraging smoking which points out the health dangers, but at the same time Europe continues to give huge subsidies for tobacco growing."
"It is my view that these should be gradually phased out."
"Finally, I should like to compliment the rapporteur on the end result and thank him for the successful cooperation."
"Madam President, we have reached the final stage of this major directive."
"The agreement reached in the Conciliation Committee endorses the rapporteur's excellent work and consolidates the climate of cooperation established in this House on a matter which is so very sensitive for the European citizens."
"The text upon which we are about to vote is a considerable improvement on the text proposed by the Commission and an even greater improvement on the situation prior to that."
"For once, the rules harmonising the internal market have given greater consideration to the health of the European citizens than to the interests of the large manufacturers."
"This text is, once and for all, a significant example of how the European Union intends to respond to the citizens' ever-increasing demand for protection of their health."
"We hope fervently that other sectors, such as the food safety sector, will soon follow suit."
"Without plunging straight into a discussion on the content of the agreement, I would like to stress two key points."
"The first is the extension of the obligation to apply tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide ceilings to cigarettes intended for third country markets as well."
"This measure was at the centre both of the debate in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and of debate in Parliament."
"Some people, protecting the interests of exporting companies, maintained that this act would certainly not represent a Union contribution to the improvement of world health, while others took the line that what is harmful to Community citizens is also harmful to third country citizens, making clear, at the same time, the need for a sufficiently long transitional period to give operators in the sector the chance to convert to other production areas."
"We advocated the latter approach, and the text adopted in conciliation takes this line."
"The second key point concerns the definitive regulation of the substances added to tobacco products."
"Indeed, in addition to being used to achieve the characteristic flavour and aroma of a certain product, these substances serve to increase the dependency of smokers."
"Our directive will mean that, not only will manufacturers and importers of tobacco products have to declare the exact composition of products placed on the market but they will also have to justify the inclusion of every single ingredient."
"Moreover, by 2004, the Commission will have to present a proposal defining a common positive list of authorised ingredients."
"These are not minor measures. Along with the banning of descriptors and the increasing of the area devoted to medical warnings, these measures can genuinely make a major contribution to the fight against smoking."
"Madam President, it is customary in this House to congratulate rapporteurs at length and I often think that this is something of a waste of time when we have so few seconds at our disposal anyway."
"Surely it is axiomatic that rapporteurs do their work well?"
"However, I should like to make an exception for Mr Maaten."
"Because this report proves that if one plays an active role as a rapporteur and hence also takes consultations with the Council and the Commission very seriously and makes a point of getting people together around a table, one can actually succeed."
"That is of course also dependent on the Commission and the Council."
"That is why it is gratifying that we can present this example at the end of the Swedish Presidency."
"In fact you could take this report into the schools and say: Look, this is an example of the way in which a European directive can be produced through consultation between the Commission, the Council and Parliament."
"I wish that were the case on more matters."
"Now to come to the point."
"I have been in politics for quite a time and when I first took part in framing legislation on limiting advertising and on warnings on cigarette packets, it was actually seen as something completely absurd by many of my colleagues."
"Since then the fight against tobacco addiction and the regular use of tobacco has become universally accepted."
"Still, there are differences."
"I remember that on the first occasion when I went to Sweden for a meeting - I still smoked at the time - the smokers were put in a separate room together, where of course it stank terribly."
"That was where you had to smoke, but it did not taste good at all."
"Smoking was completely forbidden in the meeting room itself."
"There was a sign, and I had never seen that before since I came from a culture where meeting and smoking were as it were associatively linked."
"I now observe that the social pressure on smokers has increased in most countries and that great progress has been made thanks to the campaigns, despite scepticism about them many years ago."
"The number of non-smoking train compartments must be increased everywhere."
"More and more we insist on using and meeting in non-smoking areas."
"Nevertheless social pressure must be stepped up to a point where young people especially do not start smoking, and women to not take up smoking either."
"It is painful to see that despite the campaigns so many people are still starting to smoke."
"I experienced first hand that giving up smoking is a lot more difficult than starting."
"Having said this I hope that the strict regulations that run counter to the spirit of the lobbyists and their interests, will be followed up, and I believe that the measures proposed by Mrs Martens to abolish the subsidising of tobacco growing might give a healthy impetus."
"Mr President, as we are all aware, smoking tobacco has many serious effects on public health."
"It is important to note that these do not just affect smokers themselves, but also those who spend time in smoky environments, those with allergies as well as many others."
"Smoking also leads to substantially increased health care costs in many countries."
"In our capacity as politicians, our task is to warn of the risks of smoking, to reduce the harmfulness of tobacco products and to attempt to get rid of misleading marketing."
"I consider that the conciliation we have achieved with the Council of Ministers is an obvious step in the right direction in this area."
"In the GUE/NGL Group, we are, for example, particularly satisfied with the requirements for a lower tar content, the limit values for nicotine and carbon monoxide, clearer warnings and the requirement for companies to list additives."
"We see the results in these areas as major progress."
"In two areas, we would have liked measures to have been taken more quickly, but we feel that we are at least on the right track."
"This applies to the ban on misleading brand names, for which no date has been set for implementation, something which we would have liked to have seen."
"This will have to be a future task."
"There is at least one commitment in this direction for the future."
"We would also like there to have been faster progress regarding export bans on tobacco products that are not approved under EU rules."
"It is rather embarrassing that it is all right to export what we consider to be dangerous to health in our own countries."
"We should have preferred to have seen these products banned simultaneously in the EU and for export, but at least a ban has been set for the year 2007."
"Earlier in this conciliation, Swedish snuff was discussed, and we believe that a good solution has been arrived at in this area too."
"It means that the exemption under which Sweden may keep its traditional snuff will be retained without the market in other EU countries being opened up."
"We believe that other EU countries have the right to refuse this product if they wish to forgo it, which no doubt a number of them will."
"Overall, we are very satisfied with the result of the conciliation and feel that the rapporteur has done a good job."
"If we were to be slightly critical, we could say that the EU has problems of credibility when it comes to its tobacco policy as a whole."
"Possibly EUR 1 billion per year is still spent on subsidies for tobacco cultivation."
"If we are to make our work on combating the harmful effects of tobacco smoking more credible, it is perhaps time to start phasing out these subsidies."
"Mr President, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this very important subject."
"I congratulate the rapporteur for his handling of this report through three readings and lengthy negotiations with the Council in the conciliation process."
"The final text which we will vote on tomorrow is to be welcomed as the fruit of successful negotiation."
"The House has made it clear from the beginning that we expect strict rules to be applied in the whole area of producing, packaging and marketing cigarettes and other tobacco products."
"It should be noted that 80% of first-time smokers in the EU are below the age of 18."
"Statistics suggest very clearly that in the EU smoking kills half a million people annually."
"Cigarette smoking is the cause of fatal diseases amongst a quarter of all smokers."
"Smoking causes 85% of all cases of lung cancer and half of all premature deaths among life-long smokers are caused by the use of tobacco."
"The new regulations being proposed will be a significant step forward."
"Member States have been attentive to the concerns expressed by Parliament and have taken the most important aspects of our recommendations on board."
"In Ireland smoking kills six times as many people per year as road accidents, work accidents, murder, drugs, suicide and Aids combined."
"Seven thousand deaths occur in Ireland each year from tobacco-related illnesses and one third of these occur before the age of 65."
"Twenty-five per cent of all heart-related diseases are caused by smoking."
"In conclusion, these are astonishing statistics which I am confident this Parliament will continue to work to reduce."
"Mr President, in the time it takes me to make this speech an estimated four people will die in the EU as a result of smoking."
"Smokers are less long-lived and their health is less good."
"Smoking is therefore a serious threat to public health."
"Reason enough to discourage smoking then."
"However, many people already smoke."
"In Northern Europe these turn out to be people with low educational attainment and lower incomes."
"Because of the addictive effect giving up proves very difficult."
"Unfortunately it is still the case that many young people start smoking."
"The policy of tobacco manufactures expressly targets this market by giving cigarette smoking a tough and sporting image in advertising."
"Once the tobacco industry has won over a young person, it is generally assured of another regular customer."
"Customer loyalty is further strengthened by increasing the addictive effect through additives that facilitate the absorption of nicotine."
"In addition the tobacco industry tries, through the use of misleading messages like 'mild' and 'light' , to create the impression that the tobacco products concerned are less harmful."
"The directive at present being finalised is an adequate response to the above-mentioned problems."
"I should also like to thank Mr Maaten from this platform for his great commitment and for the result achieved."
"The Swedish Presidency also ensured that this file was processed quickly, for which it earns my praise."
"However, when in December last year Parliament had approved 32 amendments on second reading, things looked very different."
"There were disappointed noises from the Council."
"Obviously it had not been expected that Parliament would want to change so much in the common position."
"Indeed, the Netherlands Minister of Health felt that the European Parliament was weakening the directive."
"However, I believe that most amendments were an improvement of the common position."
"It is reprehensible that this Minister should have criticised the 'questionable' role of the European Parliament on the grounds that Parliament was dancing too much to the tune of the cigarette industry."
"It is true that the cigarette industry lobby was working flat out, but obviously with little success, and just as well too."
"The European Parliament even wanted to make the warning message on a packet of cigarettes more forceful by replacing the general warning 'smoking kills' or 'smoking can kill' with more confrontational texts like: In the EU half a million people die each year from the consequences of smoking, or smoking causes cancer and heart diseases or passive smoking is harmful to those around you, especially children."
"In fact that is more accurate, since no one dies immediately as a result of lighting up a cigarette."
"Unfortunately, however, these texts from the Council were not changed."
"Other unhealthy results of smoking included blackened smokers' lungs and rotten teeth."
"Therefore I see no objection to confronting smokers on cigarette packets with what they are doing to themselves and to their environment."
"It is precisely the intention that confrontation should have a preventive effect."
"I am therefore gratified that Council has adopted this idea from Parliament."
"I also support a ban on misleading messages, such as 'mild' and 'light' ."
"Another positive point is that in the preamble attention is drawn to additives which heighten the addictive effect."
"Although an outright ban on the adding of ammonia or ammonia compounds would have been preferable."
"Finally, Mr President, I again feel obliged to emphasise that European policy is inconsistent."
"On the one hand the use of tobacco is discouraged, on the other over EUR 1 billion is spent annually on tobacco subsidies."
"I feel that many more roll-ups will be made before these subsidies, which now simply go up in smoke, are reduced to zero."
"Mr President, I would like to say that I think that this is a very important matter that we were dealing with today and that we must decide on tomorrow."
"I believe it can be said that there is no greater killer on the grounds of lifestyle than cigarettes."
"It was good that the industry did not succeed in getting Parliament and others to falter in connection with the legal basis."
"Now, we will actually obtain a reduced nicotine content and tar content in cigarettes, and we will also obtain some rules on the additives that the industry has used to date."
"These are substances that have helped to make cigarettes even more habit-forming than they would be without these substances."
"In actual fact, it is quite incredible that this method of production has been accepted until now."
"It is good that we are going to do something about it."
"I would also like to point out the new labelling rules - the new rules on warnings on packets."
"I believe that the rules that we will now have will make it difficult for consumers of cigarettes - and new potential consumers of cigarettes - not to be aware that cigarettes are actually very harmful to health."
"It is also good that we will obtain some rules on the specific positive designations that it has been possible to use for cigarettes, such as 'mild' and 'light' ."
"This should have happened earlier, but it is good that there will now be rules."
"I believe that these types of designation are very misleading and give a false impression."
"They create a false sense of security among consumers."
"Finally, I would like to mention exports."
"We have had a discussion concerning what I will call export hypocrisy in this matter."
"It cannot be right for us in the EU to sell cigarettes outside our own region that we believe are so damaging to health that they should not be used by our own citizens."
"There will be a transitional scheme for these exports."
"I do not think that this was necessary, but it was, of course, a political compromise."
"At any rate, we can be pleased that there is a time limit of a maximum of three years on this hypocrisy."
"I believe that, all in all, this is a good day for EU health policy, and one with which we can be very satisfied."
"Mr President, it has taken nearly a year and a half to conclude this tobacco directive, and I wish to thank the rapporteur for all his hard work."
"This piece of legislation will have a dramatic impact."
"It will transform the way in which cigarettes are sold in Scotland, the UK and the whole of the European Union."
"The directive will reduce the most addictive and dangerous substances in cigarettes; it will ban the use of misleading descriptors such as 'ultras' , 'lights' and 'milds' and it will introduce giant health warnings."
"Through the work of MEPs we have also been given a guarantee that the Commission will draw up new rules on the use of picture health warnings on cigarette packs by December 2002."
"After decades of deception and misinformation from the tobacco industry, the message about the true cost of smoking will finally start to hit home."
"As we all know, smoking is the biggest cause of preventable illness and disease across the European Union."
"Over half a million people in the EU die needlessly each year from smoking."
"In fact, someone diagnosed with lung cancer has an average of between three to ten months of life left."
"At the end of this month there is the World No Tobacco Day."
"There is no better way of celebrating this than by the coming into force of this new directive next year."
"At this point I should like to encourage colleagues to sign the written declaration for an EU No Tobacco Day."
"However the battle against big tobacco continues."
"I look forward to the new proposals for a tobacco ad ban which the Commission will be introducing shortly."
"One life lost due to tobacco is one life too many."
"Mr President, honourable Members, it is with great pleasure that I reply to this debate on the report of the Conciliation Committee concerning the tobacco products directive."
"This directive is the culmination of several years of hard work by the Commission on the basis of the best scientific advice."
"We have developed and proposed a qualitative step forward in protecting public health, working within the confines of the legal basis for completion of the internal market."
"The directive before you today will represent a significant improvement on our current legislative position and fill many of the gaps, which have made the current rules ineffective."
"The present directive will put the European Community at the forefront of efforts to control the death and disease caused by tobacco consumption."
"In this way, the addiction of future generations of young people has been taken seriously, and a framework created to reduce the enormous harm caused by this product."
"I need hardly remind Parliament of the level of health damage from tobacco to our population which exceeds that from more widely debated causes."
"The World Health Organisation estimates tobacco-related deaths in the Community to be more than half a million a year."
"This does not include the number of smokers who suffer from serious and debilitating illnesses, such as respiratory disease and heart disease."
"This makes tobacco control the most import tool in reducing death and disease in our midst."
"I must here compliment Parliament and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Maaten, whose amendments have substantially improved and completed this measure."
"The Commission was happy to accept many of these amendments."
"Mrs Maes, in her contribution to Parliament, made a statement that this was a textbook example of cooperation between the three great legislative institutions of the European Union;"
"I would echo that, but refer also to the role of the Court of Justice in its judgment in the case relating to the advertising directive."
"I would go further and, say echoing what Mrs Maes has said about this being a textbook example, that this issue - the story of tobacco and the legislation of tobacco - both in the first advertising directive that I am bringing forward soon and this particular directive, is worthy of close examination by any serious student of the European Union or law student."
"It provides a clear example of how all the institutions can work well together in formulating policy and bringing forward that policy in the form of valuable legislation within the confines of the competences laid down in the treaties amending the Treaty of Rome, and will allay the fears of anybody who has concerns about the European institutions becoming too powerful, because the lines of demarcation are clearly set out by the Court and respected by the institutions in respect of this legislation."
"In short, this is a textbook example as Mrs Maes has said, worthy of further study by young students."
"This directive recasts several existing directives from the late 1980s."
"We have used this proposal to update and complete existing instruments on the basis of scientific developments, including, for the first time, several important harmonisation measures."
"I should like to mention the setting of a reduced tar ceiling in cigarettes and the creation for the first time of a ceiling for nicotine and carbon monoxide."
"These ceilings will directly attack the agents in cigarettes responsible for cancer, addiction and cardiovascular disease."
"We are not, however, aiming at producing a safe cigarette, since such a product cannot exist, but simply to reduce the most dangerous product constituents."
"Importantly, these rules now apply to all imported products and to all products manufactured in the Community."
"Thus, we will not export products, which are considered inappropriate for our citizens."
"Equally, given the significant amount of smuggling, we do not run the risk of unsafe exports coming back onto the Community market."
"I have been particularly upset at the cynical efforts of the tobacco industry to use the spectre of job losses to threaten this measure."
"The same threats were also expressed when the original tobacco directives were adopted in the late 1980s."
"They were not true then and they are not true now."
"There is no room for double standards for our own citizens and for others when we are talking about an addictive and deadly product."
"Another innovation in this text is to require the declaration of additives in tobacco products - potentially the most important single measure contained in this legislation."
"Currently we do not know what these additives are at Community level and, more importantly, why they are added to the product."
"Manufacturers and importers will in future be obliged to declare these constituents."
"We will then move towards preparing a legislative proposal when these data are provided."
"This will be done before 31 December 2002."
"I am happy to say that preparations for this consequent legislation, arising from the furnishing of this data, will be undertaken during my mandate as a Commissioner."
"In the meantime, Member States remain free to protect their consumers."
"Another important component of this directive is the substantial increase in the size of health warnings on packaging."
"They will be increased to ensure that consumers are fully informed of the health risks they run and, for the first time, information will be provided on how to get help to stop smoking."
"The previous rules were worded too loosely and the new directive makes sure that the warnings will be printed in colours that are clearly readable and cannot be disguised as at present."
"As a result of an amendment from this House, the introduction of colour photos on warnings is to be introduced for the first time."
"This will greatly increase the impact of these warnings."
"In recent years research has shown the importance of avoiding misleading product descriptors on tobacco products which may make the consumer believe that a particular product is safer than another."
"This directive introduces a requirement not to use such misleading terms on tobacco products."
"As such, it aims to protect smokers and non-smokers alike from misleading representations of the dangers posed to them by such products."
"In order to provide a mechanism to keep these rules up to date, we have also included a provision for regular Commission reports and a committee procedure."
"In a previous declaration when the first reading took place, I undertook to consult with tobacco experts in drawing up this report and any subsequent proposals."
"I can inform you today that work is already under way to reconstitute the Commission's Advisory Committee on Cancer Prevention and to create its working group on tobacco."
"However, I must draw your attention to the difficulty the Commission envisages in respecting the deadline imposed in Article 5(3) of this text, which leaves little time to consult these committees and subsequently to adopt rules for the use of colour photographs on warnings."
"In the coming weeks, I also hope to meet my undertaking to present a new proposal on tobacco advertising and sponsorship."
"This will replace the directive annulled by the Court of Justice last October."
"I also regard the Community's legislative activity as complementary to that under way in the World Health Organisation Framework Convention on tobacco control."
"I welcome the presence of an observer from the European Parliament in the Community delegation, appropriately Mr Maaten, which early this month met in Geneva when the second round of negotiations for this convention took place."
"Finally, let me again express my appreciation for your support and confidence in ensuring the rapid adoption of this important directive and for the words expressed in respect of the Commission's involvement."
"I should like to play tribute in particular to Mr John Ryan and the significant contribution he has made to this issue over the years."
"I hope it will be seen in coming years that this directive is a keystone of our efforts to reduce the damage to health by smoking."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Tuesday, at noon."
"Animal nutrition"
"The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (A5-0136/2001), by Mrs Paulsen, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council Directive amending Council Directive 95/53/EC fixing the principles governing the organisation of official inspections in the field of animal nutrition and Council Directives 70/524/EEC, 96/25/EC and 1999/29/EEC on animal nutrition [13724/1/2000 - C5-0047/2001 - 2000/0068(COD)]"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Council has accepted most of the proposals approved by Parliament during the first reading."
"We have succeeded in getting the most important issues of principle through, for example, that the user stage, that is, those who feed the animals, is also to be covered by the controls."
"This is a success, since approximately two-thirds of all animal feed in the European Union is produced on farms."
"However, what the Council - and possibly also the Commission - has not taken note of is the fact that we have replaced the word 'contaminated' with 'contain undesirable substances' ."
"We are not, in fact, playing with words here. The term 'contaminated' must be defined in purely scientific terms with reference to substances and/or bacteria that have been added from outside, whereas 'contain undesirable substances' also includes those substances that are formed naturally, e.g. in the course of storage, when fat oxidises and mycotoxins are formed."
"There are lots of substances that are clearly inappropriate in feed, but which do not come from outside."
"They have arisen in natural processes which really should not have taken place."
"Hay should not be allowed to go mouldy, since this makes it downright dangerous."
"I have reintroduced all the amendments to the effect that 'contaminated' should be replaced by 'contain dangerous substances' ."
"We have also reintroduced Amendment 24 from the first reading, which deals with Community controls."
"In this case, the Council referred to a conciliation made with Mr Staes after we had started working on the report in the first reading."
"I have now changed the amendment to include the wording of the TSE regulation that was approved at the first plenary session in Brussels."
"We should endeavour to create legislation that is clear, consistent and easy to grasp."
"That is why I have chosen to copy the wording of the TSE regulation on Community controls word for word."
"It is easier for those who have to deal with the laws and who have to comply with them if at least the standard provisions that recur in directive after directive are worded the same."
"I think that this is very important."
"Mr Staes will submit an oral amendment in this area which involves a certain expansion, and which I am able to approve."
"It is of crucial importance that we get a comprehensive control system throughout the Union."
"Creating good laws throughout this food safety chain that we are now working on does not involve particularly great difficulties, but it does involve hard work. The big problem comes with control and compliance."
"Good laws are all very well, but they are just words on paper unless we have effective control and compliance."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. We now have before us the Council' s common position on amending the directives containing basic rules for the performance of official inspections of feed and concerning animal nutrition."
"Mrs Paulsen has at the end again made the reason for this clear."
"The crises and scandals of recent years have made a revision of the rules concerning feed an urgent necessity."
"Amending the directive will harmonise the conduct of official feed inspections in Europe and enshrine them in law."
"Member States will now be obliged to introduce appropriate emergency measures to deal with serious risks involving feed."
"The Commission is empowered to adopt temporary precautionary measures if animal nutrition products manufactured in the EU present a serious risk to humans, animals or the environment."
"Member States are obliged to inform the Commission immediately and in full of any case of contamination."
"This will ensure that the Commission is able to act at once."
"Member States must also prepare an annual report of all incidents and irregularities involving feed and forward it to the Commission."
"The Council has accepted the European Parliament' s core demands for comprehensive feed inspections, namely the use of a generic term covering all products intended for use in the food and feed chain down to the final consumer."
"These were included in the common position."
"This took account of the intensive debate in the European Parliament."
"At this point I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Paulsen, sincerely for her handling of this difficult task."
"However, the Council was unable to comply with Parliament' s call for the directive also to be extended to changes that occur as a result of faults and flaws in the manufacturing process."
"Mrs Paulsen has just referred to this."
"For that reason, the rapporteur has retabled the corresponding amendments from the first reading in the slightly modified form required, as she has described."
"The report was accepted unanimously by the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"The adjustments made to the tabled amendments were necessary in order to bring them closer to the corresponding articles of Directive 1999/29/EC on undesirable substances and products in animal nutrition."
"They were also brought into line with the corresponding article of the TSE Regulation on Community inspections."
"Acceptance of the amendments would create a uniform, clear and transparent inspection system tailored to the new requirements of the time."
"Mr President, I also wish to congratulate Mrs Paulsen on her diligence in preparing and seeing through this report, and to echo a previous speaker who said of Mr Maaten's report - but it is equally true of this one - that it is a model of the second-reading procedure."
"We are gathered here with a reasonable unanimity in the committee, with a very modest number of amendments but with an absolute certainty that we want to press our point."
"If codecision is to have any meaning, that is a position we will maintain to the end."
"I am putting the position of my group in the absence of Mrs Roth-Behrendt who, as some will know, is in hospital in Berlin."
"I saw her last week in Berlin and I am sure she is making a rapid recovery and would wish all to know that her heart remains in our proceedings in these matters of food hygiene and food safety."
"There are only six amendments which the House has to consider tonight: five from the committee as a whole and the sixth tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance."
"My group supports all of them for one simple reason: we surely should have learned by now the lesson that precision and targeting of possible dangers in animal feed is of the essence of the precautions that we need to take."
"Over the last two or three years we have seen enough of the dreadful practices in parts of the animal-feed industry, sometimes practices that were already illegal according to the rules of those days."
"They need to be tightened up quickly."
"Precision is at the heart of what Mrs Paulsen has had to say to us today."
"Precision in language most of all: the word ""contamination"" is not satisfactory when it is used in the phraseology of the food authority proposals, which we will be discussing shortly."
"It is not sufficient where we need to be able to have a further process of scrutiny and inspection of damaging materials that may be inserted very early on into the manufacture of animal feed."
"I am very glad that one important principle is enshrined in this report as it goes through to the next stage: animal feed should be taken as seriously for all of us in our own interests as human food."
"The two are more or less indistinguishable, both in their effects on human kind and on the animals with whom we share this planet."
"There is an election going on in Britain and yesterday I was doing my stuff on the doorstep in a country village."
"People were asking whether veterinary inspections were secure and safe and could possible be self-policed."
"I have known and represented that place for 30 years."
"Ten years ago you would never have heard these considerations."
"The fact that they are now paramount argues the case for this report."
"Thank you very much, Mr Whitehead."
"I would ask you to give Mrs Roth-Behrendt our best wishes for a speedy recovery."
"Mr President, Commissioner, on behalf of my group I would like to thank my colleague for her very creditable work."
"The purpose of my speech is mainly to state that we support the amendments the rapporteur has tabled."
"They are most justified with regard to the users of animal feed, the farmers."
"The term ""official inspections"" used in the title of the report is a very telling one, as there has been no comprehensive system of official inspections, the consequences of which have been dire."
"Furthermore, the way the inspections are defined and described, including the notion of all ""products for animal nutrition"" , is, in my opinion, excellent."
"The amendments also emphasise the need to take account of faults and flaws in the production process."
"This is also only right."
"One or two amendments likewise very aptly stress the importance of inspections."
"For example, the notions of 'country of origin' and 'Member State of destination' and co-operation between them, with all their attendant obligations, are described."
"Co-operation and inspections must be conducted transparently, including checks made in Member States as mentioned in Amendment No 5."
"This amendment also states that experts should be provided with ""all the assistance necessary for carrying out their duties."""
"Such definitions and specifications make excellent terms of reference for this directive, its implementation, and its monitoring."
"Finally, I would like to make one point, Mr President."
"We will recall from recent history such matters as dioxins and the use of swill in animal feed."
"We are moving towards an enlarged EU."
"The future Member States are predominantly agricultural countries."
"It is therefore excellent that the vital matters that are in our hands - such as that of official inspections - are to be straightened out first."
"Mr President, I join in the compliments to the rapporteur for her dedication."
"Animal feed or, more appropriately, the ingredients used in its manufacture are understandably central to the regulations governing food safety and consumer protection."
"This Parliament and the Commission have certainly burnt the midnight oil putting in place controls which must eliminate for all time the reoccurrence of BSE or the dioxin scare, which has cost farmers and the food sector dearly and caused so much worry to consumers."
"We have learned an expensive lesson but one that marked an important turning-point in EU food production and one from which we can benefit in the long term."
"There is no place for dissidents in this new regime and those found in breach must be strongly disciplined."
"While it is not a time for apportioning blame for what has happened, I believe farmers were by and large innocent victims of sections of an unscrupulous animal-feed sector, some of which resorted to the use of sewage sludge as an ingredient in animal feed, while others continued to use illegal meat and bone meal."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank Mrs Paulsen and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for the broad support given to this Commission proposal concerning controls on animal nutrition."
"I am also grateful to this Chamber, because adoption of this proposal will mean the fulfilment of one of my first commitments to improve food quality and safety."
"As you know, the proposal was articulated on three main issues."
"The first is the obligation for Member States to have contingency plans in place to deal with feed emergencies."
"Secondly, it will provide a legal basis for the adoption of safeguard measures for products originating within the Community."
"Thirdly, it will provide a system to exchange information in the field of animal nutrition, with particular reference to a rapid alert system."
"The common position adopted by the Council last February, which was also endorsed by the Commission, improved the Commission proposal."
"The three main issues of the proposal were properly addressed in the common position, which also includes many of the suggestions made by Parliament in first reading."
"I am satisfied that this agrees with the most fundamental parts of the common position."
"Concerning the amendments tabled for this Parliament, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3 and 4, which will improve the clarity of the text."
"The Commission can also accept Amendment No 5, because it takes into consideration the evolution of other important legislation in this sector, such as the TSE regulation approved by the European Parliament at the last Parliament part-session."
"In principle, the Commission accepts the legitimate expectation of informing the European Parliament on the inspection results."
"However, the way Amendment No 6 is drafted cannot be accepted because it does not foresee informing the other Member States for the sake of consistency."
"I understand that it was intended to put forward an oral amendment to include this reference; and if that, is done, I am in a position to accept that amendment too."
"If that oral amendment is tabled, it will take the place of Amendment No 5."
"So be it, the Commission can accept that."
"In summary, I am pleased to say that the Commission can accept Amendments No 1, 2, 3 and 4."
"Amendment No 5 is accepted while Amendment No 6 is not accepted unless in the form that I suggest, which I understand Parliament may put forward."
"The five amendments to the Paulsen report are correct in terms of the principles and I hope that the Council will also agree that they deserve to be incorporated in the final directive."
"Goodwill has been shown for this dossier by all the institutions and I hope that the final directive can be approved quickly."
"I am grateful for the constructive approach taken to this dossier by the European Parliament."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Tuesday, at noon."
"Mobility in teaching and training"
"The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (A5-0115/2001), by Mr Evans, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council Directive on mobility within the Community for students, persons undergoing training, young volunteers, teachers and trainers [13258/1/2000 - C5-0029/2001 - 2000/0021(COD)]"
"Mr President, this report comes from a Commission proposal presented in January 2000, a proposal drafted under Articles 149 and 150, which called on the Member States to foster the mobility of people undertaking a course of study, a period of training, voluntary work, or work as a teacher or trainer in another Member State, whether on a Community programme or not."
"When this recommendation from the Commission was presented to Parliament, it was very quickly clear that it was a flawed document and indeed the Commission accepted this itself."
"Perhaps with hindsight it might have been easier if we had rejected it some 18 months ago and started again, but we did not and I and colleagues have worked hard to present something to Parliament and to salvage something from it."
"At our first reading in Strasbourg last October, Parliament voted amendments which I felt would improve the quality of the text, and I announced some of the irregularities and flaws to which I alluded a moment ago."
"We also sought to extend the scope of the original proposal, for example to include researchers, as had been requested by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"Thirdly, we called on the Member States and the Commission to set targets and precise goals to measure the progress towards the goals that had been set, i.e. to set indicators to monitor them."
"Colleagues may recall this report came before Parliament at a particularly sensitive time for the Commission."
"I understand that it was anxious to match action with resources and for that reason it rejected all those amendments that required it to take follow-up action."
"It did not reject all the amendments, only those that asked it to take follow-up action, something that is particularly important."
"It also rejected anything related to researchers, which I understood."
"Since then, I have had lengthy deliberations and negotiations with Commission staff, whom I thank for their time, with the French Presidency, which prioritised this report, and indeed latterly with the Swedish Presidency, which has equally been generous with its time and energy."
"We looked at ways to cover the following important areas: the nature of voluntary work and administrative, financial, linguistic and cultural obstacles to mobility."
"The common position which has now been arrived at contributes to the clarity of the text, particularly where it deals with third-country nationals."
"It rejects, however, most of Parliament's amendments on social security and social protection rights, areas that we felt were crucial for interest groups, for students, teachers and others."
"This is why we have had to make a few amendments to the common position."
"I presented six amendments at second reading, which refer in particular to the action plan that stemmed from the Nice Summit, which it is important to refer to because it clarifies many of the points that we wanted to raise."
"I have asked for some follow-up action from Member States."
"I have looked at ways in which we can reduce the administrative costs of implementing this recommendation."
"I have clarified, I hope, the follow-up action that is expected of the Commission and removed an unnecessary and potentially harmful qualification in the common position."
"All of these amendments are admissible and I have had discussions again with the Swedish Presidency to make certain that they are in line."
"There will be one or two small technical points that I would like to bring up tomorrow as oral amendments, just to clarify the text and for the sake of linguistic consistency."
"I want to make the report unambiguously clear so that it can go through and Member States are absolutely clear what is expected of them."
"As a result of this report we will be taking a few, albeit tentative, steps towards creating mobility for those in education, teachers, students, academics and others, so that they can actually move from one country to another within the European Union, make that a reality and take a first step forward."
"Mr President, we have previously discussed the tobacco directive, a very controversial topic involving many conflicting interests."
"We are now debating a report about which in my view there is very little difference of opinion."
"In the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport the report was unanimously approved, and I should like to compliment the rapporteur, Mr Evans."
"I am happy with this report."
"It further strengthens the joint position and has also taken account of the conclusions of the Nice Summit."
"The mobility programme gives students, teachers, volunteers, placement students and others the opportunity of gaining experience abroad."
"With an internal market that is operating more and more efficiently, in which people increasingly go and work in other countries, and with an increasingly multicultural society that is extremely important."
"That experience may lead to increased knowledge of various languages and cultures, even in European countries."
"Perhaps even more importantly, Mr President, it has been shown that participants, develop a greater sense of Europe, the European intellectual tradition and the importance of European cooperation."
"For that reason also it is a good and extremely important programme."
"That is why it is a pity that, as we know, there are quite a few obstacles facing those wishing to avail themselves of the mobility programme."
"Barriers, for example, in the field of social security, medical expenses insurance, residence permits, recognition of study credits, language problems, etc."
"At the first reading a first initiative was taken towards measures that would remove these hindrances."
"In the joint position, I feel, a good compromise was reached and in any case it is another step in the right direction."
"It was possible after all to further improve the text of the recommendation."
"There are further guarantees that Member States will not use the freedom of manoeuvre offered by the treaty in such a way that the free passage of individuals is, in practice, unnecessarily impeded."
"I should also like to seize this opportunity to highlight yet again a problem that has existed for years, and has been known about for years, and about which complaints are heard whenever one visits one' s constituency, and that is the enormous bureaucratic maze facing anyone wishing to use this programme. There is a mountain of red tape."
"I am therefore glad that the report on which we are voting this week provides for an evaluation, a report on the implementation of the programme and the measures taken by Member States in this area."
"I hope, Mr President, that the cumbersome working practices and procedures will be included in this."
"Finally, I welcome the Commission' s intention to make such a recommendation for researchers."
"As the rapporteur has already said: they experience the same obstacles and I am delighted that the Commission hopes to be able to present a recommendation on the subject shortly."
"Mr President, the reason why I am taking the floor is because of my pleasure at the result that has been achieved."
"This is a great day for education policy throughout Europe."
"The adoption of this recommendation must inevitably lead to greater mobility of students and others in education, and the mobility of students is of the utmost importance for the continued development of the European Union."
"The more people that move to another country for a period - whether for education or for work purposes - the greater will be the understanding between our peoples at a human, cultural and professional level."
"Understanding is the 'glue' that is required to bind the European Union together."
"The greater the mobility of students and others, the more strongly this 'glue' will be able to hold the European project together."
"The second major gain is that we will see better adaptation of the workforce to the international labour market and to the labour market of the future, which will be characterised by flexibility and the ability to adjust."
"It is quite simply essential for Europe to meet these requirements if we are to hope to keep up with the other major economic players on the global stage."
"The Americans have a very high degree of mobility among students and among their workforce."
"This is undoubtedly an area in which we can learn something from the United States."
"I must therefore say thank you - a big thank you - and congratulations to Mr Evans, who has done some very substantial, first-rate and persistent work in connection with this report."
"I will also allow myself to express pleasure at the fact that this recommendation is directed at people in the applicant countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"It is of the utmost importance that young people from the applicant countries also participate in the EU' s education programmes."
"In this connection, it might be asked whether the EU' s education programmes are adequate."
"We should look at whether they can be made more efficient and possibly expanded, so that more young people can go and study abroad."
"All young people should try to study in another country sooner or later in the course of their education, and it is also similarly important for teachers and volunteers to receive inspiration from elsewhere."
"We are on the right track with this proposal from Mr Evans."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the unanimity in committee shows that, overall, we are satisfied with the progress made since our last debate on 4 October last year."
"The tabled amendments refine the draft further, making it clearer and more up to date."
"We are still, however, far from our goal in everyday practice."
"We must do all we can to get the agreements translated into action and to make the freedoms which we advocate as a basic principle of the European Union an actual part of the daily lives of all people, not just young people, in Europe."
"Colleagues, it is true that citizens have already been enjoying greater mobility since the internal market was introduced, but there is still a long way to go."
"We must continue to dismantle all barriers to freedom of movement."
"Equal rights and benefits, recognition of periods of study abroad, promotion of multilingualism, promotion of information exchange and the dismantling of administrative and financial obstacles must be translated into reality and not just written down in the action plan."
"A previous speaker has pointed out that we still have not reached our goal in the matter of taxation, the recognition of health insurance, employment and social law, social security and the mutual recognition of academic qualifications."
"I therefore call for a greater application of the EU principle of non-discrimination in all these areas, too, because mobility also needs underpinning socially with some minimum standards so that persons who are mobile are not disadvantaged in other ways."
"Mr President, mobility is one of the subjects that the Commission holds dear."
"We attach fundamental importance to it, as Members of this House have said, from the point of view not only of the personal enrichment of the individual but also of the creation of the great European family."
"To be mobile is to get to know other people, to work better together having studied together."
"Mr Evans, I should like to thank you so much for the work that you have undertaken, for your commitment and for your efforts to find solutions to problems that are not always easy, owing to the institutional barriers which, unfortunately, prevent us from making progress as rapidly as all of us would wish."
"The European Parliament has proved to be extremely cooperative."
"In addition to Mr Evans, I should like to thank all those members of the committee who have helped to ensure that Parliament, the Council and the Commission would together be able to find solutions at the end of a long process."
"The text of the Council common position on which Parliament has to vote is the result of a long debate between the three institutions."
"I think that the final text reflects the efforts of all those involved in the question of mobility in Europe, even though I agree with those Members who say that a text is not enough, and that it must be followed by specific actions."
"However, by continuing the debate on the recommendation, I think that we are nevertheless progressing along the lines proposed at the Lisbon and Nice Summits, which recommended that education and training policies should play a major role in European economic growth and social renewal, and which therefore made mobility one of the key elements of those policies."
"It is also from this viewpoint, Mr President, that we should understand the action plan for mobility approved by the Nice Council, since it provides an operational supplement to the measures laid down in the recommendation and constitutes the expression of a new commitment to mobility on the part of the Member States."
"On the subject of commitment, I should like to assure this House of the commitment of my colleague, Mr Busquin, who is actively working to ensure that mobility for researchers develops along the same lines."
"Before I set out the position that the Commission intends to adopt on the occasion of this second reading, I hope you will permit me to refer back to the amendments adopted by Parliament at first reading, since your rapporteur has mentioned them."
"I am pleased to be able to say that both the Commission, in its amended proposal of 9 November last, and the Council, in its proposal of 19 January, have accepted, either in whole or in part, the great majority of those amendments, particularly those intended to improve the quality of the text in order to reinforce Community action."
"The text of the common position thus incorporates 40 of the 56 amendments approved by Parliament at first reading."
"Now, at second reading, Mr Evans is proposing six amendments to the common position, on which I shall now comment."
"Some of these amendments, namely Amendments Nos 1 and 3, add an explicit reference to the action plan for mobility as a new legal act covering the area of mobility."
"They are therefore intended to create synergy between these two initiatives."
"Synergy implies the agreement of the Commission as well, because we are in agreement with both these texts."
"Nevertheless, in the recital amended by Amendment No 1, I should like to add a reference to the Nice Council, which was originally provided in Amendment No 3."
"This is actually a very small correction that in no way changes the content."
"I also agree with Amendment Nos 2 and 4 which provide clarification regarding the action taken in response to the recommendation, in particular with regard to the timing and content of the reports by the Member States and the Commission on the implementation of the recommendation."
"I also believe that the greater detail sought by Parliament in Amendment No 3, regarding the profile of the members of the group of experts, are entirely relevant."
"Finally, I support the point of view of Parliament' s Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, in proposing to remove the time specification of - and I quote - not exceeding, in principle, one year, in the definition of the mobility and activities of volunteers, in Amendment Nos 5 and 6."
"This results in a more flexible form of words, whereby the mobility referred to by the recommendation is the mobility of limited duration which appeared in the Commission' s original proposal."
"So you see, Mr Evans, the Commission is able to accept the six amendments proposed at second reading, subject to a slight change to the wording of Amendment No 3."
"In my opinion, this convergence of the viewpoints of Parliament, the Commission and, I am sure, of the Council too, show that we are all heading in the same direction."
"I should also, Mr President, like to thank Parliament, which has always understood the importance of mobility, and which has always demonstrated its willingness to cooperate throughout the process, even at difficult moments. Is that not so Mr Evans?"
"We have reached an agreement which is not a political one, but is one that concerns the fundamental needs of our students and teachers."
"I should also like to remind the House of the important role assigned to Parliament in Community initiatives on the subject of mobility, such as the communication on the new European employment markets which makes provision, amongst other things, for the setting up of a high-level task force on qualifications and mobility, or the Social Agenda, which recommends the modernisation of the rules in order to ensure that workers' social rights are retained in the context of mobility."
"I should like to draw this latter text to the attention of those Members who have quite rightly pointed out that one of the major problems that still remain to be solved concerns the area of social affairs."
"Finally, I should like to make it clear to you how much I am committed, on behalf of the Commission as a whole, to the rapid implementation of the mechanism provided in the recommendation."
"This mechanism will enable us to ensure that there is follow-up action, in the form of joint action by the Member States."
"In saying this, I hope I have responded to the legitimate concerns that Parliament has expressed throughout the procedure, regarding truly effective follow-up action."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at noon."
"New technologies in tomorrow's education"
"Mr President, the report which I have drafted as rapporteur for the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport is based on a Commission text published in January 2000 entitled ""Designing tomorrow' s education: promoting innovation with new technologies""."
"As you know, the European Council moved very fast after that with the conclusions from the Lisbon Council in March, containing positions on the transition to a competitive, dynamic, knowledge-based economy, and the initiatives of the European Council in Santa Maria de Feira on e-Europe and e-Learning."
"In a sense, therefore, this Commission text has been overtaken by events."
"In another sense, however, it has given the Committee on Culture of the European Parliament an opportunity to lay down a number of general guidelines relating to the policies of the European Union, which is not just an economic and monetary area; it is also an area of education and the European Union has a role to play in establishing a learning society."
"These general - shall we say - principles and positions are contained in the report which I have drafted and I shall try briefly to set out the ten commandments of what I think are the most important points."
"One: the European Union is not the driving force in the world here; it is lagging a long way behind, especially behind the United States; educational establishments are under-equipped in information and education technologies and, in this sense, we need to sound an alarm so that they go into top gear."
"An alarm which will result not just in our imitating the United States, but in a model for incorporating these technologies which is based on the political principles of the European Union."
"Two: information and communication technologies give rise to numerous risks of discrimination, inequality, exclusion and a new north/south divide in Europe, this time at technological level."
"There is a risk of inequality between countries, between regions, between social groups, between minors and adults, between men and women, between pupils and parents and between private and state schools."
"All these risks must be taken into account so that we design a knowledge-based society inspired by principles of justice, cohesion and equality."
"Three: although we agree that the European Union should be proactive in this area, we must not lose sight, in parallel to these efforts and as we coordinate the efforts of the Member States, of the individual identity of each country and of the cultural identities and diversity which exist in the European Union, especially its linguistic diversity."
"There is a discrepancy between major and minor languages; we do not want one or more languages to hold sway over the others and we need to consider the specific difficulties of the minor languages which do not use the Latin alphabet."
"Four: it is important that we help to provide the means needed so that these technologies can be easily disseminated, which means cheaper access, special measures such as preferential charges, tax incentives for equipping educational establishments and intervention to reduce telecommunications prices, especially the cost of accessing the Internet."
"Five: we must not confine these technologies to primary, secondary and tertiary and traditional forms of education; we must also consider adults, lifelong learning and all the people outside the formal education cycle and process, as well as taking account of the huge role of these technologies in combating unemployment."
"Six: we need a humane model which is not based on information overload and which can be combined with pupils' need for free time, with cultivating the imagination, with creativity in all sectors and with developing social conduct in school."
"Not technologies that individualise, isolate and alienate pupils."
"Seven: special attention to teacher training so as to prevent computer rooms in schools turning into museums."
"Eight: not just processes emanating from above, but interaction with society owing to the wide range of circumstances and the complexity of the problems involved."
"These processes should not just put computers in schools and parents' associations, psychologists and teachers should take part in them."
"Nine: due to the rapid advances and changes in these technologies, we must study questions of budget, technological infrastructure and educational continuity."
"And ten: the Commission, which has taken important initiatives - especially Mrs Reding - should perhaps study the results of these technologies in schools, the role of the Structural Funds, exchanges of experience between Member States etc. more closely."
"Finally, Mr President, I should like to say that several Members may perhaps have reservations on various points; I personally have reservations about Paragraph 23 on the general acceptance of the Bologna agreements; however, this report was adopted by a unanimous vote in committee and I hope that Parliament will do likewise."
"Mr President, I am sure across this House, and between Parliament, the Commission and the Council, we all agree education is important."
"President Kennedy said of America: ""Our progress as a Union can be no swifter than our progress in education."""
"If that was true for America then, it is certainly true for Europe now."
"I am sure we also all agree that education's prime responsibility lies with, and within, the Member States. We should not forget that prime responsibility for education rests with students and scholars themselves."
"We should also do our best to give as much autonomy as we can to schools and colleges."
"The question we have to address is: what can Europe do?"
"What can we add to the educational business?"
"The very existence of this debate shows that in the European Parliament, and indeed with the Commission and the Council, we have been pushing for more attention to be paid to the role of Europe in education."
"The prosperity of our Continent depends upon the level of education offered to our citizens."
"The other reports we are debating this evening deal with the present and the future."
"My report deals primarily with the past."
"Some of it is critical, but it is critical of what happened in the past rather than what is happening now."
"My report is: White Paper ""Teaching and learning - Towards the learning society""."
"That is a very impressive title, but I am not too sure that the report was that positive."
"After Lisbon and Stockholm, we are left in no doubt as to the importance Europe places on developing a knowledge economy."
"I am sure that with Commissioner Reding and her team future Commission activity in response to the increased priority for education agreed at the Lisbon and Stockholm Summits will be better than that detailed in my report."
"I am afraid that after reading the Commission Communication, I finished with not much more of an idea as to how far Europe had actually come towards the learning society, and which direction we wished to go."
"Sadly, I found the document vague, indicative of a lack of any real action over past years, although there were some notable exceptions."
"The main objectives which the Commission tried to attain in the implementation of its White Paper seemed laudable: developing employability and boosting knowledge potential."
"I am not quite sure what was meant by helping to build a people's Europe - that seemed to be a vogue phrase of a few years ago."
"Unfortunately, the Commission's report did not really detail any concrete progress made by the Commission in the five objectives set out."
"It was rather enthusiastic, but vague in terms of the impact of certain actions."
"What we and the public - and certainly we as the budgetary authority - want to know is how much was spent?"
"How much of it was new money (as opposed to funds already in existing programmes)?"
"What was the European added value?"
"What results were achieved?"
"And what lessons were learned for the future?"
"I ask the Commission to ensure that we have that information so that in future we as the budgetary authority can press for more funding for this very important work."
"There are certainly many projects mentioned which are worthy of further exploration: the European credit transfer system, for instance."
"But as the debate we had earlier this evening shows us, 40 years on from the start of the EU, 15 years after the Single European Act, we cannot yet say there is mutual recognition of academic qualifications across Europe"
"There are some things that can and should be done at a European level."
"Europe with its richness of linguistic diversity presents problems as well as strengths."
"I would say: let us be realistic, rather than too idealistic."
"Can we ask the Member States to insist that nobody goes into higher education, unless they have a qualification in a modern language other than their own?"
"Because in some Member States that is not yet a requirement."
"We certainly need to do more work on IT, but that is being addressed in other reports. I will not deal with that."
"The single market requires a much more mobile workforce than we currently have."
"Mobility in Europe is less than half that of the United States."
"We must make our workforce more mobile, and that means more resources at a European level for careers advice and for work experience."
"I am quite sure that the careers services across Europe do not have enough resources to alert students to the opportunities in the single market of Europe."
"I would say, however, that it is not just the Commission that can do things."
"Let me suggest one way in which this Parliament could help."
"We support, of course, educational exchanges of Erasmus, Socrates and so on in the European Educational Institute in Florence, but not enough students get the opportunity to experience Europe."
"I have long thought that the EUR 100m we spend every year on the use of this building for one week a month is a terrible waste of resources."
"I suggest that we give some thought to turning this building into a European university."
"That would be good for the students of Europe, the City of Strasbourg, France, this Parliament and Europe."
"Mr President, at the risk of going back over some of the ground already covered by Mr Alavanos, I would like to contribute to the debate, in particular by using my speech to describe certain aspects of the scenario in which we are currently placed and which I feel e-Learning will influence by placing the spotlight on two fundamental elements. Moreover, I see these elements as the principal merits of the two Commission documents: the communication and the action plan."
"A correct interpretation of the principle of subsidiarity: the e-Learning action plan has succeeded in finding a niche in the sensitive debate on the use made by the States of their national education systems, demonstrating that the term 'European educational area' is a realistic, positive concept in which we must have confidence without fear of undermining the cultural identities of our countries."
"Moreover, the subject of new technologies is certainly one which we can develop further to enhance these common elements."
"The second positive element lies, in my opinion, in the fact that the e-Learning action plan favours a positive and - I would add - social approach to certain typical effects of globalisation."
"In this sense, I must say, the action plan goes some way towards allaying some of Mr Alavanos' concerns, for there is no doubt that it provides for opportunities for access to the knowledge-based society as a way of avoiding imbalance, and, I would add, it gives new meaning to the concept of cooperation between public and private institutions."
"In fact, to some extent it enhances and focuses on the distinguishing feature of e-Learning, which is that a nation's education systems and teaching methodologies will always be more important than any other system, even systems of government, and they must therefore receive the benefit of the greatest possible input from all the players in the establishment of a welfare community."
"In any case, before turning to any specific aspects, I am anxious to thank the Commission, particularly Commissioner Reding and her collaborators, for their willingness to help, and the members of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities for their extremely valuable contributions in recent months."
"I have to say that, of the more specific issues covered by my report, that which receives the greatest focus is teacher training."
"I would like, as far as is possible, to illustrate the importance of this subject with an example."
"When Dante makes his journey through hell and purgatory, he is accompanied by a guide: Virgil."
"Virgil is a person with the highest moral attributes who, however, at the time, also has at his disposal all the best that the technology of classical culture can provide."
"For example, he uses the technology and technique of metaphor, and he does so in order to bring Dante to greater knowledge, to a greater and better understanding of the meaning of the world in which he lives."
"Well then, if we do not now place European teachers in a position to make proper, realistic use of new technologies, we will be turning them into pseudo-Virgils, that is Virgils who will not be capable of guiding Dante - the Dante who is each of their pupils - along the path which will lead him to purification and knowledge, because they do not have access to the new metaphors, the new structures, the new digital technologies that can provide an educational system which is, at last, free from the constraints of a culture which is not infrequently disjointed and disordered."
"It is in this sense that the issue of teacher training is absolutely top priority, and the endeavours perceptible on some of the pages of the action plan are certainly to be increased and recompensed."
"They are to be increased and recompensed because it is the responsibility of all of us to realise that the effect of the e-Learning action will not just be reform of parts of our education system but genuine reform of the way we think."
"We will have to find a way to explain why this progression is necessary within the Union's education systems and how very necessary it is."
"In order to do this, I feel that the endeavours we make, including in terms of the budget and of clarifying the aims of the budget, will certainly have to be considerable."
"I would like to end by thanking our fellow Members once again and entrusting to them the heart of our message, in particular, which is that, as I have stressed, the new technologies are a tool, they are a means - not the end - but a means that is absolutely essential right now."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. I am standing in today for Mr Gargani, who is staying in Italy for reasons you will understand."
"In this major debate on education we have added a question to the Commission and the Council - unfortunately the Council is unable to be present - because we believe that now, when everyone is suddenly talking about a European educational area, the European Parliament that has always talked about it and fought for it, but which has always been blocked by the Council of Ministers, cannot simply look on while it, the elected representative of the citizens, is bypassed in matters which are very important and which we have been advocating for a long time."
"I think it was indecent - perhaps that is too strong a word - improper to ask Parliament on 8 February for an opinion on the future objectives of general vocational training systems that was presented to the Council just four weeks later."
"Things cannot be allowed to continue that way!"
"That is why we called for this debate and why we are asking to be properly included in the discussion in future."
"We are all of the opinion that this report on general vocational training in the European Union is a major step forward after the Lisbon Council because it sets concrete objectives and defines the future role of general vocational training."
"This is an issue that affects all Europe' s citizens."
"I repeat once again, this is something we have said all along."
"As Socrates rapporteur, I fought for this together with my colleagues, ultimately without success."
"If success is coming at this late stage, I am grateful."
"We must, however, always bear in mind that this is an area of policy that we cannot carry through without the support of the Member States."
"It involves matters that can be tackled only in the context of subsidiarity."
"We can give examples, we can make a synopsis of how things look in one country or another."
"Perhaps the Member States can learn from each other."
"There is no need to keep reinventing the wheel."
"We cannot, however, do very much more in these fields."
"We should like to stress that the open method of coordination that the European Council called into being at its Lisbon meeting and in whose context this report was prepared must not be allowed to prevent the institutions provided for in the Treaties from fulfilling their roles."
"In our opinion, the general consideration of the future role of general vocational training in the context of the open method of coordination must have regard not only for the contributions of the Member States, but also, and, above all, for the contributions of the European Parliament and the Commission, while safeguarding the principle of subsidiarity."
"We reiterate that the conclusions drawn by the Stockholm European Council and the strategic objectives that were formulated can form the basis for a working programme for the coming decade."
"These things cost money, however."
"I should like to remind you, ladies and gentlemen, that we cannot always confine ourselves to fine words, making grand final communiques and calling on the Commission to act."
"At the end of the day, we all stand there and say: I hear the words, but I have no faith in them because the money for all the things we want to do is not there."
"So I hope that the Heads of Government, having realised that education is tremendously important in the European Union, far more important than many still think, will spend more money on it."
"I should like to point out to the Commission and the Council that we insist that, in the spirit of inter-institutional cooperation between Council, Parliament and Commission, the European Parliament must be involved in producing the follow-up report and in all the measures arising out of it as part of the long-term working programme."
"I am sure that the Commissioner will do that."
"I only hope that this will be passed on to the Council and that it will likewise follow in Mrs Reding' s footsteps."
"I also hope that we can work together on the things laid down in this working programme."
". (NL) Mr President, Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I expect I am stating the obvious when I say that education and training are becoming increasingly important in a modern knowledge economy, if we in Europe are to continue to compete with industrialised parts of the world."
"I shall limit myself to the recommendations contained in my written opinion."
"Firstly: in education more attention should undoubtedly be paid to training in information technology both for pupils and for teachers."
"Students deprived of such a preparation run the risk of exclusion from the development of the new economy."
"We still lag far behind the United States as regards the use of information potential in education and business."
"Since no less than a quarter of newly created positions in the last decade are related to the information society, we must realise that students require thorough preparation."
"We must therefore also aim for optimum use of government investment in the use of technology."
"Secondly: attention has been repeatedly drawn to the need to bring students closer to business in order to train tomorrow' s entrepreneurs."
"Thirdly: the setting up of many more second-chance schools has become necessary, as the current number is far too low."
"Two pilot projects are planned for Spain, France and Germany - the large countries - but the Commission says nothing about the other countries."
"In view of the size of the large countries, five projects would be desirable while for smaller countries, at least two projects should be planned."
"By increasing the number of pilot projects, it might be possible to make the second-chance schools a more effective tool for strengthening economic and social cohesion and combating social exclusion more successfully."
"Finally knowledge of languages, one of the principal European aims."
"Our rapporteur, whom I thank for his report, believes that even knowledge of two languages would be a success."
"In my opinion, I stated that I should like to go a step further."
"In order to promote integration and the opportunities for students in the labour market, in my view knowledge of three languages should be regarded as a minimum."
"Why?"
"Because quite a few Member States have more than one official language."
"Belgium has three."
"Learning the official languages of the countries of which the students are citizens is obviously essential for their integration into the work process but an extra language in addition to the official languages is highly desirable."
"If we look at the most recent survey of knowledge of languages carried out by Eurostat, we see that less than half, only 45%, of citizens of the European Union can conduct a conversation in any but their native language."
"So there is a great deal of work ahead of us, but that is equally true of the rest of the issues raised in this instructive debate."
"Mr President, the importance of lifelong learning in creating a learning society is fundamental to meet the challenges of economic and social change and sustainable development that we face today."
"In the light of recent job losses across Europe, retraining and education will be even more important in helping to adapt the skills of workers to enable them to find new jobs."
"For this to be effective sufficient resources have to be made available."
"Lifelong learning has a much wider significance than that: it is also important for personal fulfilment and as a means of developing responsible citizenship, encouraging people to play a full part in their community."
"So it can help break the cycle of poverty and unemployment."
"Through informal and non-credited learning it can also be a very effective way of involving both adults and young people in the most disadvantaged areas, who are those most threatened by social exclusion and poverty but who often have very negative attitudes towards formal education and so are least likely to benefit from it."
"Unfortunately, the Commission's White Paper ""Teaching and Learning - Towards the learning society"" missed the opportunity to produce a comprehensive report, including examples of good practice, which would have been of great value to all those working in the field."
"It does not contain enough information on how effective or cost-effective various actions were and there is little information on what was done to target specific groups such as women, elderly workers, immigrants, families in disadvantaged areas, the long-term unemployed and disabled people."
"So whilst there are universities, colleges and community groups as well as regional and local governments across the EU carrying out excellent and pioneering work in this field, this report does not really reflect that."
"Therefore I agree with the rapporteur that even as an interim report, on what was after all an ambitious White Paper, this is a disappointing summary of progress on this most important issue."
"I hope future reports will be more positive and can be useful tools in themselves for those working in education."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the Committee on Budgets has attached the greatest importance to this matter, the e-Learning initiative, because of the great contribution it can make to European citizens enjoying, through appropriate training, better living and working conditions in the new information society."
"I would remind you that, under the broad economic guidelines for 2002, adopted on 3 April, which are an important political instrument in budgetary matters, specific consideration is given to the e-Learning initiative as an important stage in the process of achieving the strategic objective established by the Lisbon European Council. This objective was to create a knowledge-based economy capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion."
"In this context, I would ask the Commission to look into the possibility of laying down a more suitable legal framework, which will genuinely complement the action of Member States in this field. This is also the approach adopted in the opinion of the Committee on Budgets, annexed to the Mauro report."
"I would state once again that an initiative as important as this justifies the creation of a specific programme with its own legal basis. It therefore seems insufficient to use existing programmes, such as Leonardo, Socrates, Culture 2000, research programmes and Structural Funds, as sources of funding for the new initiative, which should stand on its own in terms of funding too."
"At the same time, we take the greatest interest in the way in which existing preparatory action is implemented in this field in this year' s budget, that is the budget for 2001."
"Lastly, I wish to congratulate Mr Mauro on his excellent work."
"draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities. (DE) Mr President, in the matter of e-Learning I think we must above all realise that we are entering an entirely new world, that we are exploring new things and should not therefore keep to well-trodden paths."
"The Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities has once again found that women are still largely excluded from the Web."
"Internet activities and everything that goes with the New Economy are still not the brave new world so far as women are concerned, as, incidentally, was also noted recently at a major international conference in Hamburg."
"Eighteen countries contributed their experience."
"There is a digital discrepancy."
"The ratio of women to men on the Internet is in the region of one to four."
"It is true that access is improving, but among people beginning their studies there are still only around 20% women compared to 80% men."
"When it comes to the formation of Internet-related companies, the proportion of women is still vanishingly small."
"We are therefore calling for new access to be created specifically for women, for special software to be developed for women, because they use the Internet differently and because women are still lagging a long way behind in qualifications."
"If we want to act on the resolutions of the Lisbon Summit and create a knowledge-based society, we must pay particular attention to women."
"We must, for example, abandon coeducation in some matters."
"We must tread new paths here."
"I think it is particularly important that we catch up with the Americans."
"Here, too, we find that American women already have much greater access to the Internet."
"In some fields they have actually overtaken men."
"I think we still have a good chance of achieving something here with our action plan."
"I therefore ask that, in formulating the action plan, particular attention be paid to developing a greater and more specific involvement of women."
"Mr President, if I have understood you correctly, you are inviting me to reply to the oral question."
"I shall reply later to the discussion on the reports."
"I should like to thank Mr Gargani, who is represented today by Mrs Doris Pack, for his oral question concerning the specific future objectives of our education and training systems."
"Above and beyond the question of who received what and when, or which report has been drawn up, Mrs Pack has said something of fundamental importance."
"She said that the European Parliament was the originator of every campaign to ensure that education is something other than a regional and national element and to ensure not only that the European dimension of education should be a matter for discussion, but that its beneficial effects should be recognised."
"We are almost there, Mrs Pack, because since Lisbon there has been a sort of silent revolution, an enormous step forward."
"However, even though we have made this enormous step forward, we must not forget that many structures, especially national structures, have remained in the old world, which is not so old as that, since it dates from only a year or two ago. We still have difficulties, therefore, in achieving a balance between the old-fashioned concept of subsidiarity and the concept of a subsidiarity which is very well able to collaborate with European interests."
"What I am doing, with your help, is performing a sort of balancing act, by trying to take a very big leap forward, while at the same time trying not to destroy the confidence of certain people who look askance, and with a critical eye, at any possible encroachments upon subsidiarity."
"Having said that, I should like to give a clear reply to the question raised by Mr Gargani."
"It is true that the European Council in Lisbon asked the Education Council, and not the Commission, to give general thought to the specific future objectives of our education systems and to submit a report to the European Council in spring 2001."
"It is the Commission' s responsibility to ensure that the Council makes progress, even though the Commission itself was not specifically asked to do anything."
"In the final analysis, however, it was the Commission which prepared the work of the Council."
"Perhaps it was because of the initial difficulties that Parliament did not receive the documents in question in time to enable them to react."
"It received the documents afterwards, immediately afterwards."
"We have learned a lesson from this situation, which was not the fault of anyone in particular but is inherent in certain procedures."
"This is why I think that in future we ought to operate slightly differently."
"After all, ladies and gentlemen, we are aware of the time limits."
"The Heads of State and Government took the decisions at the European Summit in Stockholm, on 23 and 24 March 2001, on the basis of the text adopted by the Education Council on 12 February."
"It will simply be a question of continuing with the work. In other words, nothing new will be incorporated into the structure."
"There will be new material in the texts, I hope, but not in the structure, because now there will be follow-up action."
"Each time, the Education Council will prepare for the summits."
"The next Education Council, due to take place on 29 November 2001, is already preparing for the Barcelona Summit."
"Under the Spanish Presidency, and therefore in the very near future, before the Barcelona Summit, there will be another meeting of the Education Council."
"This being the case, Mr President, I very much hope, with all my heart, that Parliament will undertake to prepare to meet these time limits."
"You know very well that I have tried to inform and involve Parliament in our current thinking regarding the follow-up to this report, and I can honestly say that I shall pay attention to any thoughts which the European Parliament would like to share with me during the course of this year."
"This is why I always insist that Parliament should be asked for initiatives on this subject, and believe me, at every Council I repeat to ministers how important the elected representatives of the people are in this area."
"I hope that the collaboration based on the continuation of the relationships that are about to be established will operate in such a way as to ensure that full consideration can be given to the contribution of the European Parliament."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to make four points."
"Firstly, I should like to say that the ambitious goal Socrates has pursued for years, the creation of a European educational area, is now almost reality - and I hope it will soon be embodied in the texts."
"The Council, the Councils of Feira, Lisbon, Stockholm and now also of Nice, have stressed the importance and role of education and training in society and for the knowledge society."
"I should like to underline that today education and training are, first of all, the European Union' s most important political priorities; secondly, they are a political challenge and an economic challenge, because we all know that without education and training we cannot offer young people training places."
"Thirdly, they are an opportunity to further develop Europe' s linguistic and cultural heritage and give it European added value."
"The second point I want to address is that the Commission and Council really seem to be both maximalists and minimalists. Maximialists in the strategies and political ambitions they develop on paper."
"On the other hand, however, the European Union and, above all, the Council, is a very great minimalist when it comes to actually giving these great projects financial resources."
"Then it is always the Commission or Parliament or whoever that come in for criticism, but never the people who with great pomp and ceremony announce to the great councils how important training and education are."
"If they would provide the money for it the next day, we would all, especially our citizens, be very grateful."
"The European Union has, in fact, always been mean in the budgets for education."
"I should like to remind you all of the dreadful Conciliation Committee marathon over the little bit extra we wanted for Socrates."
"I hope that the revision of this Socrates programme that will probably take place within the next two years will also bring Socrates a little more money."
"I am pleased, and Parliament can be pleased, that there is now an e-Learning initiative."
"We have heard, as Mr Costa Neves has said, that Parliament, represented by the Committee on Budgets, is pressing for this not to be at the expense of any existing programme."
"These programmes have their purpose!"
"They have the financial resources for that and nothing else!"
"I therefore believe that if we say that e-Learning is important, and we stress that it is, then there must also be a programme with the proper financial resources."
"The third point is that I regret and deplore the fact that we were not sufficiently involved in the general matters; I said so earlier on Mr Gargani' s behalf."
"We really must be responsible for the system' s specific objectives, we must help to bring this about and inter-institutional cooperation must be ensured."
"I assume I am reflecting what you said, Commissioner, you understood it that way and you will include it in future."
"My fourth point is this: In view of the debate on enlargement and the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, we need our work in this European Union to be genuinely visible, we need a European educational area that is visible to the citizen."
"This means it must be really accessible to the citizen himself, and the citizen needs to be permanently involved in these programmes through the representation of his MEPs."
"We need the directives, we need ambitious objectives, we need measures, we need action programmes, with their own funding, of course, and if we do all that in education, then we shall not need so many Commission and Parliament information campaigns any more because we shall have reached the citizen where he is."
"I hope we can go this way together."
"Mr President, first of all I commend all the reports before us which go some way to defining our common aspirations for the future of educational systems in the Union."
"They also make clear some of the issues which we now face in developing such systems."
"The first issue is the European educational area which hovers above all the reports rather like a question mark, and we undoubtedly have a variety of views on this: there is no doubt whatsoever, and this is without prejudice to the concept of subsidiarity, that we need to coordinate our education policies in the Union in pursuit of the Lisbon goals."
"If we do not do this, we cannot attain them: it is as simple as that."
"We need to have a coherent understanding of what constitutes good and what constitutes bad practice."
"We need to have an understanding about teaching and learning models, how we want to employ them, and what values we want to impart through them."
"We need to understand that this will involve considerable change, because of the new styles of education systems that we need today."
"We need to learn from best practice."
"We need therefore to have up-to-date hard and soft statistics to ensure that we can provide the most valuable benchmarks so that our systems match the very best."
"These reports also point to the development of educational content."
"At the risk of courting controversy I would remind you that Cisco Systems and Microsoft are already in our schools providing content."
"We need to make sure that they are providing the sort of content that we want to see in our schools."
"We need mobility."
"It is not just the key to a successful European single market, it is the key to a successful Union in its social and political content as well as its economic content."
"The mobility report has made considerable progress on this, but, how long has Bologna been around and yet failed to gain widespread application?"
"How do we ensure equal access to mobility for all people when Member States do not have equal access to language skills?"
"I would argue that for universal access to mobility we need to have universal access to language teaching and learning."
"Here, as elsewhere, new technology is one of the keys to unlock all of these solutions."
"We can install all the hardware and all the infrastructure we like all over Europe, but unless we have the educational systems to teach people skills in schools and in life-long learning, we will not be able to make the most of them."
"Mr President, Mrs Reding, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is to become, in the words of the Lisbon and Stockholm declarations, the most dynamic and competitive knowledge economy."
"The fact that today we are holding here this combined debate on the new technologies and mobility in education, shows that the European Union is really willing to work seriously towards this and in so doing we underline that importance."
"The three reports on e-Learning by Messrs Mauro, Perry and Alavanos are excellent."
"I should therefore like to thank them warmly for the work that they have done."
"My group, the ELDR, attaches great importance to the e-Learning project for both pupils and teachers."
"Better equipping of all teaching and training institutions, high-quality content are all components that contribute to a higher participation in the labour market."
"Obviously the exchange of best practices can play an important part in this and we at the European level can provide a stimulus."
"It goes without saying that we must not limit ourselves to mainstream educational institutions."
"Lifelong learning, even after one has withdrawn from the active employment circuit and training opportunities in the new technologies outside mainstream institutions, must both be encouraged."
"I have made that observation on more than one occasion."
"The socially and physically deprived must be involved and everyone must be given the guarantee that their efforts will be rewarded with qualifications that are recognised everywhere in Europe."
"This is important for the internal market."
"I shall follow the plan of action closely myself and I insist that we are given regular thorough reports and analyses."
"One final point I should like to raise is: in the report on the future objectives of education and educational systems, there are extensive references to the use of ICT."
"However, it is careless of the Commission and the Council to have omitted to submit the report to Parliament."
"Although it was agreed in Stockholm that in education and other fields the method of open coordination would be used, it testifies to a great lack of democracy and transparency if that implies that the Council sends the reports to Member States without Parliament having any say."
"Surely the European Parliament, with its directly elected membership, is the obvious body to involve in open coordination."
"I understand, however, Commissioner, that you have meanwhile repented."
"I should, however, like to state clearly that my group feels that the European Parliament should have an input in the follow-up report and we must be very closely involved."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate our rapporteurs and thank them for the many ideas they have thrown up, on which we shall vote in concrete reports."
"We live in a time of rapid change, but we cannot allow one half of mankind or perhaps a minority of human beings to keep up and others not. So that the whole question of democratisation confronts us with great problems regarding the technology we are discussing."
"The previous speaker spoke a little while ago about lifelong learning."
"I read a plea for calling it instead 'learning as you live' ."
"In fact I prefer that."
"Because lifelong learning seems to be a mammoth task, while 'learning as you live' stimulates our curiosity everyday anew."
"For children it should be 'learning as you play' ."
"Also through the playful use of the materials available to ensure development, access to information, learning how to learn."
"In that connection I was struck by a complaint by one of those odd teacher figures at a school in Flanders who objects that he has now equipped his school with 200 computers and ensured that all those classes are accessible, but that there is no regulation governing the status of staff."
"There is no such thing as a statutory framework for ICT coordinators."
"It seemed an excellent idea to put this to you."
"Because if we simply go hammering on about infrastructure and not about the right way of using it, do not ensure the user-friendliness of teaching material in the educational environment and do not actually make it available and keep it up to date day by day, then it will all come to nothing."
"I remember the time when language labs were introduced into schools ; it was a great, fashionable surge and all self-respecting schools had such a language lab."
"You should go and see what a shambles they have become, and you are bound to wonder for how long they were actively in use."
"I therefore feel that we should be given the facts: what is the position now?"
"It is said that in Flanders there is a computer for one pupil in every ten."
"I wish that were true, I hope it is true, but what do we want to achieve, where do we want to be in five years' time and in ten years' time?"
"I hope there will not be a gulf between people who can keep up and those who cannot."
"Mr President, teaching and learning for a knowledge-based society, a citizens' society, European added value and other similarly pompous expressions of dubious import are sprinkled liberally through the reports under discussion in a bid to conceal the real substance of the reactionary, anti-educational reforms of the education systems advocated in the White Paper."
"Luckily, a wave of protest has risen up against this policy in numerous countries of the European Union."
"In Greece, huge demonstrations by students, pupils and teachers against this reactionary policy to dumb down education have given rise to an explosive situation, rectors have resigned and universities have been occupied or even closed."
"The trend towards mass education in the 60s, 70s and 80s has now been replaced by a new model in keeping with the latest demands of big business, which wants a constant supply of cheap, semi-skilled labour and a small, highly-qualified elite."
"What is being advocated is a new type of vocational training dictated by the immediate demands of the capitalist market, while scientific knowledge and specialisms are being shifted into expensive post-graduate study which few can afford."
"Knowledge is giving way to skills, i.e. reading, writing, arithmetic and elementary use of computers, together with skills which will allow young people to adapt easily to capitalist restructuring, while teaching them to be well-behaved workers and citizens."
"Educational establishments are called on to become more responsive to fast changes on the job market."
"Abandoning wider subjects and, in general terms, a wider education in favour of skills which will make them employable deprives children - especially children from working class homes - of the rudimentary knowledge they need in order to function as active, thinking citizens and, as factors of social progress."
"Big business is trying to penetrate education, mainly in the aim of creating new profitable business activities, witness the reference to the famous link between schools and companies."
"The reports under discussion, especially the Perry report, not only fail to oppose the guidelines in the White Paper, their sole criticism is of the delay in implementing them."
"Mr President, the people of the European Union must fight and overturn this anti-educational policy, they must secure their basic right to a free, high-quality, universal state education which is sensitive both to the productive requirements of each country and to individual vocations and talents."
"We, as members of the Communist Party of Greece, shall do whatever we can to foster this."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the Commission, the College of Commissioners and, especially, Mrs Reding, for the work they are doing to break down the barriers caused by restriction and the principle of subsidiarity, with a view to creating joint programmes which move beyond this very concrete world in which the education system is developing."
"I believe that one of the most complex aspects of the history of Europe - where the same phenomenon is being repeated - is the tendency towards convergence and fragmentation, the tendency to come together and then move apart, to divide up into a thousand pieces."
"We are living in an era in which there is once again a process of inward-looking nationalism which is opposed to globalisation - clearly a misunderstood concept - and this process tends to divide States and regions."
"Culture and education are the main victims, since they become confined within their own borders."
"However, certain programmes can only be carried out from above."
"Furthermore, the principle of subsidiarity is being wrongly interpreted and, in my judgment, is largely being distorted by States and many regions which use it to increase their own power and - it must be said - to enable the State apparatus to exercise control over thought and the education system."
"Of course the State must provide free education for all, but it must not exercise absolute control."
"Let us imagine that aeroplanes could only fly as far as the provincial, regional or national borders."
"Well, in education we are endeavouring to prevent our cultural knowledge from travelling beyond the border and the result is clearly a broken and fragmented project."
"I therefore praise, applaud and believe in the idea that we must support the Commission' s vision through ideas, articles and resources, since the Commission is the only supranational body able to act in this field."
"I believe that one of our first debates should be on subsidiarity, because there is plenty of legal literature on subsidiarity and not just this current popular interpretation of it."
"Furthermore, I believe that Europe is simply a common way of thinking or, at least, a capacity to communicate."
"In this respect, I believe - and I would also like to praise the forum which has recently been initiated with companies - that we will not be able to implement this project without private initiative."
"Since their powers are limited, the States cannot act beyond their own borders."
"We are now witnessing exactly the same phenomenon in the regions: each region is creating its own intranet (and they are all very proud!), or rather their egonet."
"The result is therefore a product which is the sum of many things, but the whole is never the sum of all the parts."
"I therefore ask for a debate to be opened on the principle of subsidiarity, in order to analyse the extent to which this often limits the freedom of our citizens."
"The companies are the only ones able, with the help of the Commission, to implement projects which fly like eagles above the mountain tops and have a global vision."
"I believe that a European spirit of convergence, and not one of fragmentation, is our only hope of ensuring that this programme is completed and is not a source of endless frustration."
"We must make sure that in two years' time we are not talking about what we wanted to do but were not allowed to."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, it is no coincidence that we are now having a joint debate here on a number of extremely important reports."
"It is not coincidental at all, because it all concerns the question: are we going to take a new initiative or not."
"What is the issue?"
"In Lisbon, we took a number of important decisions with a number of concrete objectives."
"The question now whether or not we can realise those objectives?"
"That is what today' s debate is about."
"Let me make two observations before I start, two things I find really regrettable."
"Firstly, and that is understandable in a way, I note the absence of a debate on lifelong learning."
"That will come later, Parliament will have its say on this, but I regret its absence because the concept of lifelong learning is, in fact, a very important concept that should be an overarching framework for the things we are discussing this evening."
"I feel the lack of that debate."
"I also often feel the lack of links to the concept of lifelong learning in a number of the reports."
"This is understandable because of the timing."
"The second point a great deal less understandable and I will return to it shortly."
"Is it not strange that we should be debating education here and do not breathe a word about the Bologna Declaration on the eve of the Prague Summit."
"We simply have nothing to say on the subject, have we?"
"Let me return to a number of reports before us, very briefly."
"Mr Perry rightly said that his report tends to be about the past and to a much lesser extent about the future and the present."
"Rightly, but we can nevertheless learn a great deal from it."
"Mr Perry is absolutely right when he says that the Commission has not achieved its objectives."
"The objectives were not concrete, they were not quantifiable, there were no indicators and where is the European value added of that White Paper?"
"Let us reflect on that for a moment."
"Let us try to define what European value added is."
"We are again on the eve of a debate on the future of Europe."
"Certainly there is talk of the debate on 'demarcation of competence' ."
"Definitely very actively in Belgium on the eve of the Laken Conference."
"However, what is 'demarcation of competence' ?"
"What is the debate when we are discussing education?"
"It is about subsidiarity."
"But then let us define that properly and for goodness' sake don' t let us beat about the bush, we do that all too often."
"In the report of the Council on the future of education and training systems, there are number of interesting points, and a number of objectives, which I can support, but once again they are vague objectives, no indicators, no methods of measurement and then we are occasionally in danger of becoming bogged down in endless palaver, and we must absolutely not do so with the debate that we are now conducting, following the lead of Lisbon."
"If we do not succeed in moving towards open European coordination with the European employment guidelines as an obvious example, I do not think we will make any progress."
"In my previous life, I worked for the Flemish Minister for Employment."
"Well, in that Ministry, people toiled to implement the European employment guidelines."
"I wish that the education ministries in all the Member States would toil over a number of concrete objectives in order to convert them into policy, then we would have a true European educational area."
"To return to Bologna."
"It is terribly embarrassing."
"I am scarcely, if ever, addressed as an MEP on European educational policy, except in respect of Bologna."
"I have received piles of letters and e-mails."
"Am I supposed to say, I am sorry, it was an intergovernmental method, the European Parliament has nothing to say about it?"
"I would ask you urgently, Commissioner, to take joint responsibility with us for it, because the Bologna Declaration is not just about a number of concrete objectives, but also about the democratisation of education and lifelong learning."
"If we are unable to make that link I believe we will be missing a chance."
"Mr President, I welcome the paper on the e-Learning initiative and congratulate the rapporteur on its content. E-Learning is becoming increasingly important."
"Until now perhaps less weight has been given to it in relation to education. It is, however, becoming increasingly apparent that our children's future is indeed a digital future."
"Therefore preparing for the use of information and communication technologies is becoming increasingly important."
"The training of teachers in this field is a top priority."
"I fully support this. But my concern is that once teachers return to their respective schools they return to find that very little ICT facilities are available for them."
"More often than not they find that they cannot communicate the knowledge acquired through training courses back to the children and make use of ICT in their classes because of lack of resources."
"Without the necessary tools to meet the aims of the e-Learning agenda, the goals of the Lisbon Summit will not be achieved."
"Having no direct jurisdiction over education in the Member States, how will the Commission ensure that these goals are being met and that Member States' governments will provide schools with the necessary equipment to realise these aims?"
"Another problems is that technology is advancing at such a rate that it has become necessary to update computer equipment every few years."
"This has been, and will be, an added problem for schools working within very tight budgets."
"It is equally important to make training and education in the information society available to all individuals throughout their lives to realise job opportunities and for personal development as well."
"This is important and reflects the trend and the decrease in heavy industries in favour of the service industries which rely heavily on digitally-literate personnel."
"Let us reduce the gap between Europe and the United States."
"Let us create an e-Europe which is accessible to all."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. I am glad we are discussing so many reports together because it brings out so clearly how all the questions raised are interrelated as they impinge upon education policy and our lives."
"The various aspects of education policy cannot be separated any more than the subjects can be divided into different curricula with each defending his own the strongest."
"I think this debate shows that very well."
"I find myself in a pleasant situation today because my country, Austria, leads the field in Europe for schools networking in connection with e-Learning and the new media."
"Sixty-one percent of schools - that is 3 860 schools - in my country are connected to the Internet, including secondary schools, of which there are about 1 000."
"One thousand and ninety already have their own Internet sites."
"All universities are interconnected via the academic computer network and in that way also have access to the TEN 155 European high speed research network."
"I am pleased about that, but at the same time it is not enough."
"It is a correct and important trend that we have started, but more needs to be done and I am therefore very pleased that the Commission and the Swedish Presidency have started the European School Net, the e-scola initiative."
"Only last week we saw how computers and the Internet are actually being used in teaching, to improve the quality of teaching and create new oportunities for learning with the objective of using the compiled teaching and learning materials and practical examples in the future and making them more widely available."
"Commissioner, I thank you for your persistence in this matter."
"We are on the right road together."
"The destination is known, but we still have a long way to go."
"This brings me to a number of points in the debate."
"Firstly, the concept of subsidiarity."
"I am an ardent champion of the subsidiarity principle and I come from a country with a very marked degree of federalism."
"However, I also call on all Member States not to use the principle of subsidiarity as an excuse - as often happens - for failing to take necessary steps towards Europeanisation."
"For me, subsidiarity in this context means being close to the citizen, serving their essential interests regionally and individually, fulfilling necessary common European tasks, so we can face global challenges and fulfill our responsibility towards the younger generation."
"Secondly, education, as this example also shows, is not an end in itself, but education from school to lifelong learning to catering for the new stage in life that is old age is the prerequisite for achieving our goal of a knowledge-based economy that is number one in the world."
"Education policy is therefore the key to the success of economic policy."
"Education policy is the prerequisite for today' s young people holding their own on tomorrow' s labour market and for our fulfilling our role as Europe in worldwide competition."
"I should therefore like to say to Mr Korakas, who thinks protests against these objectives are already beginning, that we as politicians must do all we can to tell people that this development is happening and we have to prepare ourselves for it."
"Three points, therefore, to finish. First, as Mrs Martens wanted to say, it is not only about providing computers."
"There is also the ethical question: How are we to use what computers make available to us?"
"The ethical question of their benefit is, like their handling, an important task for educational policy."
"We must also see to it that no new social time bombs are created between those who know how to use them and those who do not."
"If education fails to take the correct social action, that may become the new class war."
"I therefore also call for industry to sponsor schools so that all can have the computers they need."
"The next point is lifelong learning."
"Let us do our best to see to it that senior citizens are not forgotten when it comes to training, because only by so doing can we attain the European objectives, keep pace with world competition, make enlargement a success and avoid setting off a new social time bomb."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we want the EU in ten years' time to be the world' s most competitive economy, with nobody being excluded."
"We want to develop Europe in such a way that all people feel they are involved. For that reason it is natural that education should play a prominent role in the Union' s strategy."
"Good social policy will not prevent exclusion if the issues of equality of education and its high quality are ignored."
"Investing in education and its availability will mean that the human resources that exist will be made effective use of."
"It will not then just be a matter of finding talented people and giving them the encouragement they require, necessary as that is: it is just as vital to ensure that everyone is provided with basic knowledge and skills."
"At the same time, education should help young people and adults too to discover their strengths and to achieve success."
"In February the EU Ministers for Education adopted a report on the concrete objectives of educational systems in the Member States."
"The work is to continue."
"A follow up report is to be presented at the European Council meeting in spring 2002."
"We in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport are pleased with this development."
"The Committee has been stressing the importance of a European debate on education for a long time now."
"We are, however, sorry that Parliament has been passed over in the preparatory work until now."
"This is not so much a matter of prestige as one of existing resources being underused."
"I am convinced that Parliament' s involvement in setting targets for education will bring with it an important European angle on the issue."
"Although education is covered by the principle of subsidiarity, not only does improved competitiveness need to be taken into greater consideration in the educational policy of different countries but also the point of view of individuals."
"European educational policy must be developed in such a way that it supports the movement of Union citizens and their mutual interaction."
"Mr President, it seems to me that we have overlooked the obvious in the procedures applied to the subject of the future objectives of education systems and to a previous subject, i.e. the quality of school education based on indicators."
"What we have overlooked is the enormous interest of the Committee on Culture and Education in these matters, which will be crucial over the next decade and which are crucial to the future of Europe."
"As you know, the European Parliament closely monitors and supports every single initiative and action on the part of the Commission, be it e-Learning, student mobility, language learning or the quality of education systems."
"We feel that the open coordination method proposed in Lisbon will help to promote the numerous new ideas needed in Europe in order to improve education and flexibly promote best practices."
"However, this method must go through the proper parliamentary channels if it is to secure greater agreement and transparency and avoid confirming the powerful objections of those who consider that the open coordination method breaks the rules."
"Mr President, in Europe today, education has increased in importance beyond all recognition."
"In particular, lifelong learning is becoming more important to people's everyday lives, whether as regards access to opportunities to employment, or in using ATM machines to get cash, or having to go on-line to get banking and other services because local public services are being closed down in an era of competition and liberalisation."
"That is why it is important at this juncture in the European Parliament that when we speak about education we make sure that it is all-inclusive."
"Of course, we must pay due attention to people who are at present within the formal education system, and improving the Erasmus and the Escola programmes and other similar programmes is vitally important."
"However, we must not forget that we are now in danger of creating a new class of technologically illiterate people, who will be denied access to this new, wonderful information highway and society which we are creating."
"So, over the next ten years - as my colleague has said - the area we should focus on is ensuring that people now in middle age are given the tools of knowledge, information and education in order to be able to live in the altered world which will be coming about."
"I offer my support to the reports which have been submitted."
"I know that the Commissioner will be most innovative in bringing forward new ideas for e-Learning and for education."
"Mr President, much has been said, and indeed, much has been well said."
"I should have preferred to see a number of ministers sitting here listening to what Parliament had to say on subjects such as the European surplus, or observing the principle of subsidiarity while creating a European policy."
"I believe it is very important that ministers should hear with their own ears what the elected representatives of the people have to say."
"First of all I should like to thank Mr Perry for his report on the White Paper."
"The White Paper dates from 1995."
"That is a long time ago."
"The revolution, if there was one, Mr Perry, happened last year, over the past twelve to fifteen months, in other words, since Lisbon."
"Since 1995, the ideas put forward, mainly by the European Parliament - and here I agree with Mrs Pack that the initiator of all this policy was undoubtedly the European Parliament - have been put into practice, at least in part."
"On the recognition of educational qualifications, I am well aware that much remains to be done, but the system of credits within universities has started to work."
"As far as mobility is concerned, I know that in practice we have not made much progress yet, but a decision on mobility was taken at the Nice Summit."
"We now have something definite to go on, which is much better than simply the grand ideas that we could discuss five, six or seven years ago."
"As for language proficiency, things are moving in the Member States, thanks, amongst other things, to the European Year of Languages 2001, as a result of which everyone is discussing the subject, local authorities, parents, and teachers themselves."
"There is a change taking place beneath the surface."
"We can therefore expect to see this change making itself felt in the everyday practice in our schools."
"With regard to investment in education, this is an area in which I would let subsidiarity prevail, and I share the regrets of those Members who say that fine words should be followed up with budgetary resources."
"Yet there is no doubt that either most of the ideas proposed in 1995 are now being put into practice, or else we now have the tools with which to push them forward."
"So I am not as pessimistic as some Members of Parliament on this point, because I have seen, and I have felt, that the situation has been developing since the Lisbon Summit."
"A fundamental change is taking place. Of course, it is too slow, but at least things are moving, and that in itself is a major step in the right direction."
"On the subject of lifelong learning, 1996 certainly represented one of the first steps forward in this area."
"I presented my memorandum on what Mrs Maes calls 'learning as you live' ."
"It would be marvellous to be able to implement this idea, but it is not the Commission who will be putting lifelong learning into practice in the Member States and in the regions."
"The Commission can encourage, it can push, it can come up with ideas, but when it comes to implementation on the ground, that is up to the Ministers for Education, not to mention the trades unions and the social partners."
"A whole new system of informal training schemes will have to be created in most Member States."
"Well, I can assure you, ladies and gentlemen, that in ten years' time we shall still be talking about lifelong learning, and we shall probably have taken a few small steps forward, but we shall not have succeeded in finding a definitive solution to the problem."
"As for information technologies, I shall come back to this subject in detail later, but here too an enormous amount has happened, from the highlighting of the problem to the recognition that practical action was needed."
"Look at the Netdays Europe initiative, look at the E-schools."
"Of course, at the moment there are only a thousand of them."
"There really ought to be five thousand, ten thousand, a hundred thousand. I am well aware of this."
"These thousand schools, however, represent experience on the ground."
"I should like to thank not only the European Parliament, which is pushing things forward, but also all those people who are working 'at the coalface' , with a great deal of idealism, often alone, with very meagre resources, putting their hearts into it because they believe in progress."
"They are remarkable people, and I think we should say thank you to all those who, on the ground, are helping to put our ideas into practice."
"The e-Learning action plan is also helping to change things."
"Lastly, we are now in the middle of European Year of Languages 2001."
"I have already said this, but I will repeat it. We must learn the languages of our neighbours as well as our own mother tongue."
"Those who are doing nothing about it are beginning to have a guilty conscience."
"That, at least, is a start."
"We must continue to nurture that guilty conscience."
"Some Members have mentioned subsidiarity."
"As far as I am concerned, the interpretation of subsidiarity is very clear."
"I respect it, but I want to create a European added value, networking, the exchange of information, and the dissemination of good practice."
"I should like to draw your attention, ladies and gentlemen, to the studies made of the quality of primary and secondary education."
"This is a revolution!"
"Could you have imagined, in 1995, that ministers would ever have agreed to let strangers come and check up on their quality levels in education?"
"Never!"
"Yet this is now being done."
"The system is still not perfect, but comparisons make it possible for ministers to identify their strengths and weaknesses, and they are making efforts to correct any shortcomings."
"As regards financial provisions, the White Paper does not contain any."
"In spite of this, we have drawn up an impressive number of pilot projects, which we have funded and which have often provided the basis for reforms on the ground."
"In recent years the Commission has wanted to play, and has indeed played, the role of an incubator of ideas, a driving force."
"In this respect I am thinking of the pilot projects on second-chance schools or the European Voluntary Service."
"As far as second-chance schools are concerned, I had my doubts."
"I went and had a look at them and I was most pleasantly surprised."
"They are not intended to replace national education, but rather to solve social problems, and the results are excellent."
"The staff is very committed, they believe in what they are doing, and what they are doing is rescuing young people."
"It really is extraordinary."
"The project was recently the subject of an assessment, Mr Perry, which will shortly be referred to Parliament."
"This assessment confirms the great success of the pilot project and the thirteen schools."
"For instance, the index measuring the failure rate is only 6%, whereas in institutions or similar projects the failure rate is between 30 and 50%."
"So you can really see that progress has been made. In any case, I should like to see this system, which has proved its worth, being introduced in more Member States."
"The objectives set out in the White Paper were incorporated into the Luxembourg Process, the Cardiff Process and the Social Agenda."
"As you know, from now on education ministers will be taking part in debates on social issues, on the same footing as ministers for social affairs and ECOFIN."
"This represents an enormous amount of progress. It has not had any noticeable effect yet, but the main thing is to be present and to make a contribution."
"The views of the education ministers have been expressed in the demands they have addressed to the European Council."
"So, ladies and gentlemen, it is up to us to define the new priorities, to launch multi-annual programmes, to open up new debates, and to issue new challenges."
"I believe that we are on the right track, and we have every reason to be positive and optimistic."
"However, this does not mean that we can assume that we have achieved everything already."
"That is far from being the case."
"Nevertheless, the machine is in motion and progress has been made."
"In 1995, all we had were grand ideas, but no practical action on the ground."
"Now, we are making progress."
"I should just like to say a word or two about Bologna."
"At the first Education Council, which I attended, I found that Bologna was only the subject of an intergovernmental procedure."
"I made sure that it was incorporated into the Community context by associating the Commission with the process, on a joint basis with the ministerial troika."
"Under the Swedish Presidency, I recognise that the time has come for fresh progress, and I am convinced that the ministerial conference in Prague will enable us to make that progress."
"I have already been in contact with the Belgian Presidency, because here too there has been some follow-up action, with a view to continuing in this direction."
"Now we are waiting for the Prague ministerial conference, and then the Belgian Presidency will take over again."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I can well imagine that the European Parliament will be preparing an own-initiative report, for example after the Prague conference."
"It is not always necessary to wait for the Commission to draw up a report before you act."
"Parliament has the right to take its own initiatives."
"Use that power, so that we can hear your voice."
"With regard to the e-Learning reports by Mr Alavanos and Mr Mauro, I should like to thank Parliament, its rapporteurs and its committees, many of whom were involved, for the support that they have given me on this issue right from the beginning."
"Mr Alavanos and Mr Mauro have done a remarkable job, Mr Alavanos earlier, and now Mr Mauro."
"This is of vital importance, because here too this process helped us considerably at crucial moments, in defining the concept of e-Learning immediately after the Lisbon Summit, and in formulating the e-Learning action plan, immediately after the last European Council."
"I should like to respond to the three fundamental messages not only expressed by the rapporteurs but also discussed by the Members of this House."
"The first is the principle of access for everyone."
"You know that immediately after the Lisbon Summit the e-Learning plan gave rise to various initiatives in some Member States, aimed at installing computers in the classroom."
"However, a computer in the classroom is not an end in itself."
"A computer is only a machine, a tool."
"It has to be possible to use that computer, and the fact that it exists does not mean that it is being used."
"In my opinion, therefore, we must never separate the tool from the person who is using it."
"In short, yes we must equip schools, but we must do more than that."
"We must equip schools but we must also have electronic communication centres in our local authority areas, because it is not only those who go to school who have to participate in the information society."
"There are also those who have left school."
"Exchanging scientific information, enhancing the services provided by libraries, creating an accessible European educational network and specific services, these are all essential measures to combat social exclusion."
"Yet social exclusion will continue to exist if, in order to lend more weight to the statistics, we merely install computers without providing teachers with appropriate training."
"I have paid careful attention to the report on the position of women and the special training that they will need, in view of their quite different approach to the new technologies."
"I believe that we need to take this into consideration."
"We must also train our teachers."
"We have discussed this issue a great deal in recent weeks."
"Teachers are the key to the success of e-Learning."
"Yet most of them are not equipped to use computers, and to ensure that those computers, and this software, this content, constitute an aid to learning."
"It is essential to convince them that they can teach differently by using new technologies."
"On this subject I should like to quote a phrase used by Mr Rocard, the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, when he reiterated the argument that a radical reorganisation of education is called for in terms of physical space, time and substance."
"We are faced with a new world, and there are not many of us who realise what that means."
"I would like to say here and now that this new world will happen not only as a result of participation by the public services but also as a result of the world of industry becoming more responsible."
"This is why, last week, I organised the first e-Learning summit in Brussels, in partnership with both the public and the private sectors."
"That summit was wonderful, because it provided a platform for some amazing exchanges, and at the same time it demonstrated how the private sector is becoming more responsible, the businesses, and the know-how that exists in this area."
"The ideal situation, of course, would be one in which there was symbiosis between the two."
"Though policy decisions have to be taken by those who are responsible for policy-making, the implementation of those decisions could well be the result of interaction between the knowledge of the private sector and the educational knowledge of the public sector."
"These two types of knowledge, working together, could be highly effective."
"The idea has been suggested, and I hope that it will be followed by specific projects in this field."
"This brings me to another subject."
"Yes, Europe is showing the way, but these theories are not put into practice in some ivory tower in Brussels."
"They are put into practice in our regions, our towns and our villages."
"The method used should be the 'bottom-up' method."
"In other words, though policy decisions have to be taken somewhere, they have to be implemented, not from the top downwards, but rather at grass-roots level."
"Any contribution towards getting specific local projects off the ground will be welcome."
"So you see, ladies and gentlemen, we are standing on the threshold of a great adventure."
"Things are moving on all sides, though admittedly not always in the right direction, but then we are learning lessons as well."
"People sometimes ask me for something more specific, but there is already much that is specific at ground level, and this has been the case not only during the past year or so."
"Specific projects implemented under our Socrates and Leonardo programmes have generated many of the features that we are now finding in our education systems."
"Basically, these were programmes which you wanted, for which you, together with the Commission, sought and obtained serious funding, and which, despite all the administrative problems which you regularly bring to my attention, are positive elements."
"So, dear colleagues, we have had the right idea for many years now."
"We are travelling together in the right direction. We are taking giant steps forward, much more rapidly than anyone could have imagined two or three years ago."
"There are a few small problems here and there."
"Let us tackle them together, but tackle them in a spirit of optimism, because things really are improving."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The Presidency is pleased to note, Commissioner, that you repeatedly address MEPs as ""dear colleagues"" , which demonstrates the nostalgia you feel for your recent times as a Member of Parliament."
"Although I was not here during the last legislature, I would like to point out that this nostalgia is reciprocated and that the MEPs also miss your magnificent contributions when you sat in this House."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Tuesday, at noon."
"I am also pleased to inform you that, to conclude this debate, the Presidency has received a motion for a resolution B5-341/2001, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, on which the vote will be held on Wednesday at 11.30 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 8.43 p.m.)"
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"All our voting cards on these rows have been removed."
"It may be a plot by the PPE-DE Group to win the next vote, but something has gone wrong."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy met in the Chamber last night."
"I am sure that the voting cards will now be returned."
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, I was present yesterday."
"I spoke in the plenary sitting, yet my name is not on the attendance register."
"We will certainly rectify this."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Broad economic guidelines for 2001"
"The next item is the report (A5-0165/2001) by Mr von Wogau, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission's recommendation for the broad guidelines of the economic policies of the Member States and the Community in 2001 [COM(2001) 224 - C5-0169/2001 - 2001/2081(COS)]."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the first of January 2002 will mark the start of a momentous chapter in the history of European integration, when twelve sovereign states exchange their national currencies for a common European currency."
"From that moment on, the people of those twelve Member States will use the same notes and the same coins."
"It seems appropriate to find a term to describe this new stage in the integration of national economies, a stage which is characterised by a common market and a common currency and which is surely unique in the economic history of the world."
"We propose the use of the term 'European home market' as a synonym for Euroland or the euro zone."
"This European home market already has a common monetary policy."
"Since European economic and monetary union came into being on 1 January 1999, this policy has been in the hands of the European Central Bank."
"Today, however, we are faced with the challenge of formulating appropriate common economic policies for the European home market."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs agreed by a clear majority that these economic policies should be based on the principle of a socially committed market economy."
"The main instrument for the coordination of economic policies at European level is the procedure laid down in the Treaty for establishing the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines."
"The European Parliament has hitherto played a subordinate role in this procedure."
"I therefore believe it is absolutely essential to provide for a greater degree of participation by the European Parliament in future."
"Another flaw in the procedure is its lack of flexibility."
"Recommendations are made on the basis of predicted economic trends."
"If, however, current economic data diverge from the forecast values, these recommendations lose some of their validity."
"The Member States must therefore be given some leeway to respond quickly to unexpected changes in economic indicators."
"The Guidelines are not legally binding, but it is certainly accurate to speak of the political binding force of the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines."
"Although there is no disputing that defects must be corrected in everyone' s interest, a certain margin of discretion should exist here too."
"I believe there is a need, for example, when assessing a Member State' s economic policies, to consider the extent to which particular trends in that country will affect the euro zone as a whole."
"Economic growth in the European Union has slowed down since last year."
"The Commission has now revised its predicted growth rate of 3% and has lowered its expectations to 2.8%."
"Other observers expect even lower growth rates."
"On the basis of these forecasts, we consider a figure of between 2 and 2.5% for this year to be entirely realistic."
"In view of the general slowdown in the world economy, I believe it is crucial that the European Union should look to its own strengths."
"How profoundly the bleak global economic climate will affect us is largely in our own hands."
"Particularly in view of developments in the United States and Japan, responsibility for the world economy falls on the European Union, and we must shoulder that responsibility."
"What is the present state of play in the European Union?"
"As far as inflation is concerned, current forecasts indicate that prices are set to rise by more than 2% in two consecutive years, thereby exceeding the bounds of price stability as defined by the European Central Bank itself."
"External factors, however, such as the increase in oil prices, are playing an important part in this development."
"In this difficult environment, the European Central Bank is doing an excellent job."
"But it must continue to do everything in its power to avoid squandering the reserves of trust that have been vested in it."
"That is why we welcome its steady-handed policy, which we encourage it to keep pursuing."
"At this point, however, I must cast doubt on the consistency of last week' s interest-rate cut with this approach."
"In the domain of budgetary policy, most Member States have managed in the course of the past year to achieve the balanced budget prescribed in the Stability and Growth Pact."
"This, however, has been done with the aid of the proceeds from the sale of licences for the operation of universal mobile telecommunications systems (UMTS) as well as low interest rates and the increased tax revenue generated by accelerated economic growth."
"Some of the Member States, however, have not capitalised sufficiently on these favourable economic conditions to reduce their public deficits and their national debt."
"In view of the changes in the ageing pattern of the European population and the strain these are likely to put on the pension system, it is crucial that sufficient financial room for manoeuvre be created."
"Full use must be made, for example, of the potential for spending cuts in every area."
"This should not undermine the role of public investment, but such investment must be made judiciously in pursuit of defined strategic aims and must not be made at the expense of priority private investment."
"Looking to our own strengths also involves continuing the structural reforms of the Member States' capital products and labour markets."
"The Stockholm summit failed to reach agreement on a firm timetable for the liberalisation of the European gas and electricity markets."
"I very much regret that."
"Nevertheless, we should make every effort to secure the liberalisation of the remaining state monopolies."
"This is essential if we are to achieve our avowed aim of making the European Union the most competitive and dynamic economic area in the world by the year 2010."
"At the same time, it is imperative to push ahead with the completion of the internal market."
"I need cite only two major examples in this context: firstly, agreement must be reached at long last on the Community patent; secondly, Community rules on public procurement should be applied to defence procurement too, wherever their application is warranted."
"Particularly at a time when the European Union is taking steps to establish a common defence policy, the ring-fencing of national defence markets is inefficient, anachronistic and quite simply too expensive."
"The introduction of the euro on 1 January will affect the entire population of the European home market."
"If we want it to benefit the people of Europe, we need an economic policy that accords with the principles of social justice and market economics."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I could not fail to endorse Mr von Wogau' s last sentence."
"On the whole, however, I do not believe that his report is as balanced as he presented it here."
"First of all, on behalf of my committee I must criticise the lack of opportunity we were given to cooperate on this report, to engage in proper parliamentary discussion and to draft an opinion."
"Public acceptance of the euro and of European economic policy, Mr von Wogau, will not simply depend on the coining of a new term such as 'home market' or the like."
"It will take a bit more than that to convince people."
"This point is emphasised in the opinion which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs adopted by a large majority."
"Let me cite some examples of the interaction and evidence of reliability that are needed."
"Of course we need stability, but, as you well know, we also need more extensive investments in education and science."
"We call for an increase in the activity rate, especially with regard to women, yet we do not provide sufficient childcare facilities throughout the Union."
"We have naturally looked long and hard at demographic trends in all 15 Member States and now in the applicant countries too, yet our health services and our care services for the elderly still leave much to be desired."
"Growth alone, as our committee noted very clearly, cannot guarantee the quality of jobs."
"All of these improvements are necessary to ensure that our economic and monetary policies win the approval of the general public and of the working people of Europe."
"I am pleased to see that some Member States - and I believe this is underestimated by the Commission and its Economic Policy Committee - are working to improve and intensify the participation of employees in economic life, as demonstrated by the legislative bills that have been introduced in France and Germany, for example."
"It is also interesting that a number of Member States have already responded to the proposals that Parliament and the Commission have been making for some time - they are not being tabled for the first time today - such as the long-overdue opportunity for older employees to upgrade their qualifications rather than being more or less squeezed out of the labour market with the aid of statutory provisions as in past years."
"Lastly, let me point out that our committee was scathingly critical of the Council' s dilatory implementation of the Lisbon strategy."
"The economic policy of the Union must clearly be consistent with the principles of its employment policy and the social agenda."
"I wish to thank my fellow committee members for the flexible and constructive manner in which they dealt with the drafting of an opinion in such unusual circumstances."
"Mr President, Mr von Wogau, with characteristic expertise, has produced a balanced report on guidelines for the Community' s economic policy."
"His consistent support of the doctrine of the social market economy as the most suitable common socio-economic model for the Community only deserves our thanks and our endorsement of the ideas he has put forward."
"The social market economy, however, does not mean adhering to outdated structures or building resistance to change on the pretext of preserving social services and jobs."
"Neither is this plea made in Mr von Wogau' s report."
"On the contrary, Community structures have to be continually questioned and modernised if we want to realise the solemn promise made at Lisbon of a Europe as the most competitive, knowledge-based area in the world."
"The signs are bad, however, and in some respects getting worse."
"I do not accept that staff should not be told about structural changes and job losses as early on as possible, but if there is any intention of evolving a directive from the Marks & Spencer case, one that would essentially slow down the conversion of companies, I am against it."
"I am astonished at Germany' s official negative attitude - one I have only read about in the newspapers, it is true - towards the directive on mergers and takeovers, and at its aim to provide companies with artificial tools that will prevent the merger of companies which are aspiring to greater efficiency."
"Like Mr von Wogau, I am tired of speaking about the much too slow deregulation and opening up to competition of the energy sector, transport sector and the Post Office in many different Member States."
"Nor, apparently, will the position regarding air transport become clear for years to come, and internal bolts have been drawn to prevent the advance of genuine, pan-European public procurement, which will tend to have a hampering effect on the real efficiency that results from genuine competition."
"The UMTS auctions were an unfortunately good example of how governments are also managing to shoot Europe and themselves in the foot in the building of an eEurope."
"Mr President, well-balanced public finances, control of inflation and the monitoring of employment indicators are certainly important, even essential, but it is just as essential to clean the skeletons out of many of the national cupboards and put an end to the continued furtive glances from electorates."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr von Wogau' s report contains a very positive assessment of the prospects for the European economy, given the somewhat uncertain prospects for the global economy as a whole at present."
"The rapporteur and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs have taken the usual care in drafting this report and I should like to thank Mr von Wogau for his efforts."
"The Commission recommendation for 2001 was drafted when the rest of the world was going through a particularly difficult patch."
"We have seen a recurrence of monetary crisis in the developed countries, such as Argentina and Turkey."
"We have seen the technological bubble in the new economy burst in the United States."
"This has not been without a knock-on effect in Europe, in that numerous companies in the United States have cut back or shut up shop in Europe in an effort to reduce overheads."
"Generally speaking, the problems in the global economy have seriously reduced the prospects for the European economy, to 2.8% for 2001 and 2.9% for 2002, according to the Commission' s latest figures."
"The main questions for the European economy, for the European institutions and for the Member States remain the same, despite the change in the international environment."
"The questions are whether economic policy innovations and methodology are sufficiently well designed to protect the economy of Europe from external disruption and give the European economy the chance to embark on the high road to sustained and stable economic development in the medium and long term."
"There can be no doubt that permanently high rates of growth are vital; they are the sine qua non if we are to reduce what are still unacceptably high rates of unemployment and boost European competitiveness."
"The unemployment situation is not unrelated to the question of competitiveness; they are connected because an economy without full employment cannot be called a competitive economy because it is wasting a large part of its potential."
"How can we achieve a higher rate of growth?"
"The report tells us that we can only rely on monetary stability, a prudent budget and logical wage demands which take account of price stability."
"Most of the committee believes that mobilising the market will only increase investments in what are exclusively market tools."
"That is why the report calls on the Member States to speed up the structural reforms of capital market, product and labour markets and expresses its regret that there is no timetable for liberalising the energy and gas markets in Europe."
"I should like to add here that, if and when this liberalisation comes about, the Member States must heed the lessons learned from the upheavals in the United States."
"Privatising major sectors is no easy task."
"The report also calls for greater efforts to complete the internal market."
"Of course greater effort is needed to complete the internal market, especially the internal market in financial services, because we certainly need a much more dynamic stock exchange in Europe."
"However, none of this alone will trigger a high rate of growth in the European economy."
"Structural reforms are needed; we must not neglect public investment, which has been neglected in the past, and we must do this by stimulating public investment, because we are lagging way behind."
"My job was to present Parliament with the report on the economic guidelines for 2001."
"I have warned that, although the crisis in the American economy could endanger us, we are now taking this crisis seriously and, if we are to avoid succumbing to upheavals in the international economy, it would be illogical to neglect any weapon; most importantly, it would be illogical to neglect the weapon of public investment."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, as Mr von Wogau has pointed out in the presentation of his report - which has my Group' s full support - we are at an historic moment, with the culmination of the process of introducing the euro so close, but we are also, as has been said, at a delicate moment for the European economy. The forecasts, which were rosier some months ago, have had to be revised downwards."
"This obviously leads to the question of what is the correct way to try to overcome this situation and ensure solid and sustained growth."
"In this respect, Mr von Wogau' s report contains many elements which should be taken into account, but I would like to highlight some of them which we have already stressed. There are some which we have in fact mentioned in various debates."
"The first is the need for Member States to remain rigorous and resolute with regard to the commitments established in the respective stability programmes: we are worried that there may be flexibility - in the field of deficit and public debt - with regard to those issues intended to ensure that objectives are achieved and complied with."
"We would also like to mention the need for better and greater coordination of economic policies - you know that we are not satisfied with the current level of coordination, and this Parliament has stressed this on many occasions - and we would like to stress the issue of structural reforms and the need for flexibility in certain markets which affect the productive structure of the European Union, such as the labour market, and, obviously, the process of liberalisation in certain sectors also considered to be key sectors."
"Mr President, the Commission' s recommendations to the Member States are loaded with all the usual European Union dogmas, with the emphasis on reducing national debt."
"This basically equates to cuts in public and social spending."
"Mr von Wogau' s report takes the same approach."
"There is a self-satisfied air about this that I find quite disconcerting, given the worsening economic situation, and a refusal to consider the conditions needed to promote sustainable development."
"The declared ambition is to follow a programme of stability."
"The European Central Bank' s primary goal is to ensure price stability."
"The European Central Bank still refuses to lower interest rates, because it is obsessed with the threat of inflation, which is still on the horizon, and the President of the Bundesbank recently reminded us that the European Central Bank is not responsible for either growth or employment."
"The report reiterates the European Union' s goal to be more competitive and more dynamic, which is a worthy objective, but the proposals on the resources needed to implement this remain within the realms of dogma. These include adjusting pension systems to take account of budgetary restrictions, fully exploiting the potential for spending cuts in all areas, although the euphemism given to the public is 'creating an appropriate environment to foster investment in terms of the labour market' , without forgetting, of course - and this is the perpetual icing on the cake - liberalisation in the outstanding sectors."
"There is no mention of our obligations towards Community level services of general interest."
"Basically, we are continuing to use the same old strategies, namely the anti-inflationist credo, the number one priority."
"We all know the consequences of this approach."
"The report shows no hesitation in stressing the progress made in reducing levels of unemployment in some Member States, and highlights the need to continue reform of the labour market."
"It would be worthwhile assessing the nature of these newly created jobs, which are most often insecure."
"How can you possibly strive for improvements in unemployment whilst totally disregarding the strategy of the large and generally profitable European companies, which keep a close eye on financial criteria and make many of their employees redundant on the pretext of maintaining competitiveness?"
"Although this stretches the credibility of the European social model, we are coming up against obvious reluctance to take the necessary measures to protect employees."
"There is no mention of the social policy that is essential to consolidating growth. No mention of businesses' social responsibilities."
"Once again, this sort of economic policy does not tally with the desire to achieve sustainable development, which would require a dynamic of public investment and organising a market with strong industrial ambitions."
"The necessary capital does exist."
"There is an urgent need to control the reality of the financial market and that is why my group, in the process of discussing this report, is revisiting the European Union' s economic policies and proposes to introduce a tax on speculative buying in order to control them, to reduce their volatility and most importantly to raise resources to invest in society and the environment."
"This report, and the situation of the European Union in general, show once again that it would be beneficial to make the EU' s political, economic and social decisions part of a genuine democratic process, which could be established in each country, after wide-ranging consultation with civil society in Europe."
"Mr President, according to the von Wogau report, the introduction of the common currency marks a new step in integration."
"A step which is costing money while the benefits are yet to become apparent."
"Like the euro coin, the new step has two sides."
"On the one hand, economies which are ahead in the economic trend are in need of an increase in interest so as to dampen down inflation."
"This is now impossible."
"On the other hand, countries which are lagging behind need a boost with a lower rate in interest."
"That too proves to be impossible."
"Whichever way you look at it, it marks the loss of one of the instruments required for a healthy economy."
"Greater coordination is not the answer."
"Something else is needed to balance the loss of national monetary instruments: structural reforms - familiar to us all, yet a rarity - such as a more flexible labour market and the further breakdown of state monopolies."
"These could restore the value of the euro, more so than an unexpected change in interest rates."
"The most recent fall in interest rates of the European Central Bank came a day before it was known that, at 5.3%, Dutch inflation had reached its highest level in almost 20 years."
"That illustrates the seriousness of the problem."
"Those reforms should make Europe more innovation-friendly."
"However, many subsidies and other incentive schemes only distort the market and are often harmful to the environment."
"If we are to launch these reforms with a vengeance, I fear the worst for Europe' s competitiveness."
"My final point concerns the environment."
"Despite the favourable economic climate, little has been done about the strategy for sustainability."
"Economic growth, a fall in employment and environmental integration must be better coordinated."
"Since the economy has grown more rapidly than expected, more ambition in this field should be a matter of course."
"Let us therefore declare this a cornerstone in our policy."
"The European Parliament will be given its opportunity at the end of May, and the European Council in Gothenburg in June."
"Indeed, a new step in integration can only live up to its name if the integration of the environment and economy actually gets off the ground."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this report by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs will not go down in Parliament' s history for its clarity or significance, both in terms of its form and its content."
"Let us quickly look at its form."
"In Article 5, you mention, and I quote, 'the political priority to improve the quality and sustainability of public finances' ."
"Would public finances thus be unsustainable, because they are short-lived?"
"In Article 10 of your resolution, you stress, and I quote, 'the importance...of public investment, which must, however, be targeted and based on strategic objectives,' - that is true - but 'which must not drive out private investment, which has priority' ."
"What sort of contradictory statement is this? One that is designed to please everyone and achieve nothing!"
"As for the report' s content, you demonstrate a commitment to the social market economy, a subject close to the heart of the CDU party."
"This is not the view France takes."
"Judging from the relatively poor performance of the German economy over the last 40 years, why should we adopt this approach? Why should France, for example, abandon the industrial policy which has transformed it into the leading European country in its strategic sectors?"
"This has all been achieved without using any monetary tricks, as used by the deutschmark, which was overvalued by 15% when the euro was introduced, or when East Germany was estimated to be worth USD 350 billion, whereas at reunification, it was only worth USD 100 billion at the very most. This has all been achieved without drowning ourselves in everything European, which is what eventually happened to the aerospace company that was taken over by Aérospatiale-Matra - one of the world' s former leading companies in aeronautics and space engineering - despite the fact that Matra is half the size, and these two companies were then both swallowed up by EADS."
"This is certainly great news for France, which having once had a majority stake, is now a minority partner once again!"
"Should we thank the frenzied Mr Chirac for this outcome, or Mr Jospin, the pacifist, or Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot, who did at least try to clear up the mess made by the other two?"
"What use, therefore, is this report, which does not criticise any of the euro zone countries directly and which does not even mention the de facto devaluation of the European currency, the collapse of which continues to be a cause for concern?"
"Mr President, in the debate on his report on the broad guidelines for economic policy in 2001, Mr von Wogau advocates the idea that, once the euro coins and notes have entered into circulation next year, the 12 countries that have joined the single currency would form a high-level integration zone that would be called the 'home market.'"
"This home market would be managed in accordance with the principles of the social market economy which, as noted in the explanatory statement, were successfully applied in Germany after the war."
"I firmly believe that trying to reconcile social justice with the market is a concern shared by all the countries of Europe."
"All countries should, however, be free to follow the path that is most suited to their character, enhanced by mutual coordination, but the instrument of Brussels should not be used to impose a single formula upon them."
"I also believe that there is a huge misunderstanding surrounding the concept of the home market."
"There is a risk of this expression implying that the European economies are managed by a single political authority."
"This is not the case today, however, and as for the future, the Treaty of Maastricht makes no such stipulation either."
"According to the Maastricht model, the single currency, which is managed by the European Central Bank, coexists with many national political authorities."
"If some countries see matters in a different light, it would be better if they stated this clearly to the public in their own countries before the end of the year and to arrange the necessary referendum."
"Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, in my contribution to this debate I should like to clarify a few points which, I believe, are in need of clarification."
"First of all, Karl von Wogau' s report is not a school report card on the progress of the Member States' economic policies."
"This report by Karl von Wogau is a report on the economic guidelines for the future and an analysis of the status quo."
"I am therefore very grateful that Karl von Wogau chose the term 'home market' in connection with the introduction of euro notes and coins, because the single currency is the greatest integration project of the present-day European Union."
"The introduction of euro notes and coins will be a clearly visible reminder of our European home, a reminder that will be given to all the people of the euro zone whenever they handle the single currency."
"It is also positive that this concept of a home market will also remind the public so tangibly of the political integration project that underlies the introduction of the euro, since this could provide an extremely powerful impetus for the political pursuit of economic progress, employment and European integration."
"A second point is that I fail to understand how, in this day and age, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs can still try to present capital and growth as the enemies of employment, which came across to some extent in Mrs Weiler' s speech."
"This is why it was necessary once again to put the concept of a socially committed market economy at the heart of this report."
"I should like to extend the concept into that of a socially and environmentally committed market economy."
"What do we mean by that?"
"We mean that we are opposed to the treatment of growth and employment as two completely separate issues."
"That is why we have pledged ourselves to the Stability Pact and to growth and employment."
"A socially committed market economy encourages social responsibility, ecological sustainability and an education policy rooted in the principle of lifelong learning."
"Let me finish with an appeal to the Council. The Broad Economic Policy Guidelines require us all to work together."
"Since the report says that the EU market in financial services must become an integrated, efficient market, and since we are forever stressing the important role played by pensions and by accelerated procedures, I have to say to the Council that the Ecofin Council, at its last meeting, certainly paid further lip service to the principles that are involved here but, when it came to company pensions and the Lamfalussy report, betrayed those selfsame principles."
"The Broad Economic Policy Guidelines can be implemented with the active support of the Council."
"Now is the time for it to act."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have a few comments to make about the report by our fellow Member, Karl von Wogau."
"I believe that when discussing the coordination of economic policies, the debate that we are holding today and the vote that we will take on this report are still our main cornerstones, on which any comments should be based."
"From this point of view, I cannot resist the pleasure of repeating a warning."
"These broad economic guidelines are still our primary analytical and working tools for arranging the coordination of economic policies."
"We can only regret the fact that once these broad guidelines have been adopted, they will no longer be part of the national debate."
"I urge all our colleagues in the Member States to take these broad guidelines into account when they draw up national budgetary and fiscal guidelines, because otherwise there will be no genuine coordination of economic policies."
"We shall soon have the opportunity to come back to this subject, when we discuss the communication by the Commissioner."
"I have three comments to make on the main thrust of the proposal submitted to us today by our fellow Member, Karl von Wogau."
"The first comment is to express my pleasure at what the report says on enhancing this tool and on the prospect of a convergence of the fiscal and budgetary policies of the Member States, particularly and primarily of those belonging to the euro zone."
"I have taken note of the consideration given here to the importance of economic stature, which should be taken into consideration when considering sanctions against a Member State."
"I imagine that this will take us back to the debate that we had last year on the situation in Ireland."
"I believe that the decision taken on Ireland is not exceptional."
"This decision was expected, it was legitimate and it was fortunate."
"Even so, if we have to consider the importance of economic stature in various situations, we will then have to look at how Mr Berlusconi will implement his economic policy and whether this is compatible with the broad guidelines that we are finalising today."
"Mr President, I would like to make one comment, if I may, on the reform of the labour markets."
"If this involves carrying out structural reforms, by amending the Directive establishing a European Works Council, on the information and consultation of workers, we can only support this."
"Lastly, with regard to liberalisation, I think that experience both within and beyond Europe suggests that we should be extremely careful in maintaining access to public services, in parallel with these changes."
"Mr President, joining together the words 'social' and 'market' , as you are doing, is not enough to improve the economy."
"The workers, the working majority of the population, do not base their judgments on your words, but on the difficulties in their own lives and they understand all too well that what you are calling the 'the social market economy' is making 15 million men and women redundant in the European Union, which is actually one of the richest regions of the world."
"Your social market economy, in other words, means wide-spread job insecurity and an increase in the number of workers who, even here in France, are paid FRF 4 000 or 5 000 per month and much less in other European countries, whereas shareholders, who do nothing, take their share of the dividends from the massive profits made by these companies."
"So the market economy that you are glorifying in your report is a stupid, unjust and inhuman economy, which works by concentrating wealth amongst a small minority and by making the majority' s living conditions worse."
"You are daring to assert that competition provides considerable protection against the abuse of power."
"However, it is by bringing about competitiveness and competition that the boards of directors of large companies such as Danone, Michelin, GEC-Alsthom, Péchiney, Marks & Spencer and many others can perpetrate this particularly horrendous abuse of power that involves laying off some of their workers, completely closing down factories, which sometimes means that an entire town will become deserted, just so that their shareholders are guaranteed some extra dividends."
"You claim that you want to overcome, and I quote, 'the democratic deficit in European economic policy' , but the first step you must take in order to overcome this deficit would be to deprive large employers of their divine right to get rid of all the people who work to improve their existence and you would do this by banning employers from making collective redundancies and forcing them to deduct from profits and from dividends, stored up by shareholders, whatever is necessary to safeguard all the jobs that are at risk."
"Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, I would like to start by replying to the previous speaker, for I too am dissatisfied with the term 'social market economy' . There is no need for the word 'social' ."
"In my view, the market economy, with its rules, is not only the climate in which the fundamental economic right of people - the freedom of contract and trade - is guaranteed, it is also the economic environment which is most conducive to the generation of wealth and employment."
"Turning now to Mr von Wogau's report, I would like to make a few specific points: I have a positive comment to make on point 12, for example, which takes quite an encouraging view of the work of the European Central Bank."
"I would like to expand on this."
"Without going into a detailed analysis of the choices made regarding interest rates or monetary policy, I feel that this is one occasion when it must be stressed that the attempt by the governments and also by many political groupings present in this Parliament to force the European Central Bank and President Duisenberg to work towards goals, which are not the most suitable for supporting economic growth, must be opposed."
"There are such wide gaps between the various European economies in terms of productivity and efficiency that, in my opinion, this is the area that we need to concentrate on if we want to secure a competitive future for the economies of the leading countries, for we will certainly not achieve this by taking the deceptive shortcut of lowering interest rates."
"A second point on which I would like to focus relates to point 8, which concerns the need to adapt pension systems to changes in demographic conditions."
"I believe that, in this matter, the European Parliament must call strongly, first and foremost upon the Member States but also upon the Commission, in so far as it is able, to adopt a more responsible approach."
"Their responsibility is to achieve, through radical reforms and as soon as possible, a pension system that is financially sustainable and fair towards future generations."
"Currently, in a large number of countries - such as Italy, for example - the pension contributions of workers, particularly young workers, are being used irresponsibly to finance the pensions of people who are 54 or 55 years old, who may well be doing two jobs, an illegal job or an undeclared job."
"In my opinion, this must be a priority for Europe, a priority of economic efficiency but, first and foremost, a priority of fairness towards all generations."
"There are countries, such as Italy, in which obligatory pension contributions exceed 30% of income, although the people paying these contributions will receive much lower pensions."
"With regard to another issue, the labour market, we must be firmer in our demands on the European countries."
"It has been said in this Chamber that there is a risk of causing job insecurity, but I believe that precisely the flexibility and substantial use of flexibility tools in the labour market, together with a re-evaluation of the rules governing permanent employment, re-establish a balance between atypical employment, precarious employment and permanent employment. This is necessary because it is the only way to achieve an increasingly balanced labour market."
"Lastly, I would like to make a point on a subject which is just as problematic - I would not go as far as to say critical but certainly problematic - the prospect of political economic policy coordination mechanisms aimed at bringing about convergence of fiscal and budgetary policies."
"In my opinion, we need to focus on the fact that convergence of fiscal and budgetary policies has to be one of the European Union's objectives."
"I feel that having different contrasting models, different solutions to observe, doing, so to speak, a little benchmarking - and the case of Ireland is, in my opinion, a negative precedent - is a positive, not a negative thing for the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the economic growth of the Union is evidently threatening to grind to a halt."
"Lip service is paid time and again to the principle of supporting small and medium-sized businesses, but the fact is that we give them far too little support, even though they are the engine of our economy and the guarantors of European jobs."
"If we really want to help them, we must do all we can to ensure that changes are made to the economic conditions in which they operate."
"This means that our administrative systems and regulations must be modernised and simplified."
"Deep cuts must be made in non-wage labour costs, which are vastly excessive."
"These measures must be consolidated by means of an extension of the Maastricht criteria on budget deficits and debt levels to include a cap on administrative expenditure."
"No Member State' s administrative expenditure may on any account exceed 8% of its GDP."
"If this savings potential were realised, the absolutely crucial process of tax reform could be financed, and the engine of our economy, the small and medium-sized businesses, could be primed up to remain in perpetual motion."
"Mr President, the von Wogau report understandably makes no mention of the Commission's criticism levelled at the UK's Labour Government."
"Chancellor Brown, no doubt with the general election of 7 June in mind, decided to promise considerable increases in public spending, particularly on health and education, threatening, without tax rises, to breach the stability and growth pact agreements and to raise the proportions spent by the public sector beyond the desirable current 38% level of GDP."
"Mr Berlusconi's new government and promised economic package may also be problematic for the Commission, but it is particularly rich for the British Chancellor to reject this criticism from the Commission as interfering in sovereign British fiscal affairs, while at the same time making active plans for a referendum to join the euro, subject to his arbitrary five economic tests, which make no mention of the constitutional issues behind EMU, which are dear to British Conservatives."
"Once the UK is in the euro zone, we will have even less fiscal autonomy, and I do not know what politically - as opposed to legally - binding guidelines really mean in practice, as we are forced to harmonise our taxes upwards to avoid so-called unfair tax competition and avoid distortion in Mr von Wogau's proposed European home market."
"That is a name that I, as a UK Member, object to, as it suggests that the three states remaining outside the euro, of which my country is one, are not at home in Europe's single market; so I would strongly suggest that euroland or euro zone is much the preferred label and I wish the zone every success for the future."
"Although I personally have a problem with the term 'social market economy' , as we in Britain associate it with social democracy, the description in the report rightly encapsulates the vision of a dynamic, deregulated, competitive, free-market economy that is sensitive to the needs of the environment and the labour markets, which I clearly welcome."
"However, I am not so sure whether the comments regarding the European Central Bank's first two years are exactly correct."
"It has not been a great success, and they are still muddling through and remain somewhat opaque in their decision-making process."
"This was clearly demonstrated by the quarter percent interest rate reduction last week which came across as panicky and a knee-jerk reaction to the downturn in the American economy and seemed to fly in the face of their own monetary and inflation targets as well as many speeches by Mr Duisenberg."
"On another matter, I too call on the EU to implement rapidly the suggested liberalisation of the energy, post, airport and railway sectors."
"I personally also support the single sky initiative."
"Mr von Wogau was right: Europe will not become a fortress and overall, in spite of all the problems in the world, its prospects look relatively rosy in these uncertain times."
"Mr President, I too believe that a socially committed market economy with sound environmental credentials is a good model on which to base the economic policy of the European Union, provided it can continue what the Lisbon process set in motion, namely the integration of economic, employment, social and financial policies, thereby paving the way for the development of a genuinely sustainable strategy and for the implementation at long last of a balanced and appropriate policy mix in the European Union."
"Sadly, the broad economic policy guidelines still contain too little in the way of qualitative and quantitative targets that could inspire us to think beyond the narrow confines of tax cuts and spending cuts."
"I believe that a new debate on the quality of public finances in all Member States, which the Commission has gratifyingly initiated, can enable us to move more freely along the road to a form of investment-led growth that will create employment."
"That is essential too."
"In my opinion, the broad economic policy guidelines must focus more sharply than hitherto on investment-led growth and on motivating people to enhance their employability."
"At the moment we are confronted by a certain degree of pessimism in the European Union."
"I do not believe that a sustained slide towards recession is threatening, but every possible step must be taken to ensure that the recent developments in the United States do not become such a risk to the European economy that the European Union is powerless to contain it."
"I should like to emphasise that the broad economic policy guidelines, the aims of our economic policy, do not apply to the euro zone alone but to the entire single European market, the home market of the European Union, and that is how it should stay, because what we do not want to let ourselves be split in two but rather to go on growing closer together."
"We in Europe, however, must not slide into another recession for want of initiative, into a slump that destroys what we have achieved, namely the lowest level of unemployment for ten years."
"Let me therefore re-emphasise that, compared with other regions of the world, we invest too little in research and development and in education and training, and even in the realm of infrastructural investments, which this House has so often commended and demanded, we are still lagging behind."
"Besides monetary stability and sound budgetary policies, it is also imperative that we find innovative ways of achieving social stability and a stable employment situation."
"This is what the Lisbon process requires of us."
"I regret that we have not seen even more new ideas emerging during the Swedish Presidency of the Council."
"But I also bitterly regret that we do not have more transparency and democracy."
"The participation of the European Parliament in the macroeconomic dialogue, in the formulation and adoption of the broad economic policy guidelines and in the preparation of other processes connected with Lisbon and Stockholm is indispensable."
"If need be, we must use the next intergovernmental conference in 2004 to lend weight to our demands."
"Mr President, in discussing the broad economic policy guidelines I am particularly mindful of my own country's run-in with the Commission in recent months, a situation handled badly in my opinion by both the Commission and our own Minister for Finance."
"As we face a referendum on Nice on 7 June next, popular opinion in Ireland is one of amazement at the response to the economic miracle that has been performed."
"It has allowed one of the poorest, underdeveloped and most peripheral regions of the EU to catch up and surpass many of the strong economies and, to quote, 'realise our economic and social potential and ensure the welfare of our people' as our Taoiseach said at the time we were voting on whether to join the then EEC or not in 1972."
"It is not what the Commission did but how it did it that I question: decisions behind closed doors, badly communicated and with no parliamentary input."
"Please let us learn from that."
"I know and appreciate why Commissioner Solbes was concerned about what was considered an inflationary budget and at 5.6% this remains a serious concern."
"But the bald choice was between maintaining our social partnership and some semblance of wage stability through tax cuts at a time of exchequer plenty; and wage stability is the most important part of the Irish stability programme."
"In a word, in a country that is in a catch-up position, the classic economic model, a one-size-fits-all economic model, is a bad fit."
"Economic forecasting is not an exact science. Nor is it within sole EU control."
"We are part of a global economy. It is subject also to the forces of nature, to animal and plant diseases."
"Witness the havoc BSE and foot and mouth disease have caused, even in Ireland where we have had only one case of foot and mouth disease."
"The successful efforts to ring-fence the disease are forecasted to take over 2% of our growth this year."
"In the matter of economic forecasting I am increasingly concerned about the behaviour of the ECB which appears to be reduced to reading the tea-leaves in the bottom of the cup."
"Is the ECB part of the problem or the solution?"
"I fully support the recent reduction in interest rates to support growth, but questions have to be raised about the way the ECB decides policy and communicates it to the financial markets."
"In the context of statements from senior officials in recent weeks, the ECB has left itself open to accusations that it bowed to pressure from the US, or worse panicked, in the face of contradictory economic models."
"The way the recent reduction, only the second since the ECB was established in 1998, was handled, has seriously damaged its credibility."
"Not for the first time I find myself questioning the competence of senior officials of the ECB, even when I agree with what they are doing."
"Too much megaphone diplomacy, too little consideration or understanding of the impact on the markets of what they say."
"Too much post hoc justification of the fact and about-turns in policy."
"We expect and demand better."
"Perhaps the recommendation procedure should be directed towards them, Commissioner, or are they subject to any checks and balances?"
"Perhaps we need after all to revisit the debate on vaccination for foot in mouth policy."
"Thank you Commissioner Solbes."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon."
"Electrical and electronic equipment"
"The next item is the joint debate on two reports by Mr Florenz, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection:"
"(A5-0146/2001) on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment [COM(2000) 347 - C5-0415/2000 - 2000/0159(COD)],"
"(A5-0148/2001) on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment [COM(2000) 347 - C5-0414/2000 - 2000/0158(COD)]."
". (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, over the past few months I have very frequently been asked why we actually need a directive."
"Is it the creation of a workaholic official of the EU or of a lonely Member of Parliament who is keen to have a directive on this subject, or is it not perhaps the consumption patterns of the European population, who in recent years have displayed extraordinary devotion to the purchase of electronic equipment?"
"The reason is precisely the latter!"
"We generate six million tonnes of electronic waste products in Europe every year."
"The volume of electronic waste is growing at a rate of more than 3 to 4%; indeed, I believe it has now reached the 5% mark."
"In about ten years' time, we expect this electronic scrap heap to have doubled in size."
"Electronic scrap is spirited around in Europe and left in fields, in meadows, in woodland, in ditches or wherever."
"It is not only an environmental hazard but also a waste of raw materials, because we all know that computers contain valuable components, which really ought to be recovered and ultimately be subject to systematic reuse and recycling targets."
"This is why I believe it is only right and proper that this directive should see the light of day."
"Another reason why this is especially important is that we have already taken the first steps in this direction with the end-of-life vehicle Directive, which differs from the proposed directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment in that the recovery of electrical and electronic waste involves hundreds and thousands of manufacturers, whereas the salvaging of vehicle components concerns only 50 or 60 manufacturers."
"For this reason, it is very important that we reach consensus on this directive in the House and with the Commission too, because this directive will have repercussions."
"And if it has repercussions, it must also have a guiding influence."
"Environmental policy must not be an end in itself; it must have an aim - not only an environmental aim but an aim for companies too, because companies are part of our society, a fact which is just occasionally forgotten in my committee."
"We are operating in several categories; after all, we have ten different waste streams, each with its own distinct recycling target."
"But let me begin with a few words about the points in my draft which the committee endorsed, for example on the date of the entry into force of this directive, which must not be delayed until 2005 or 2006."
"My children would ask me why I travel to Brussels to work on a directive if the results of that work are not due to be presented until the year 2006 or whenever."
"We said that the Member States would have to be true to their proclaimed principles and put the directive into force 30 months after the completion of the parliamentary process."
"After a further 30 months, companies should be working in accordance with the directive."
"I believe this is the right approach, and I think it likely that the Commission will go along with this line."
"The Commission was somewhat lax on the question of targets. How many kilograms do we want to collect every year?"
"We are calling for a fundamental ban on the disposal of electrical and electronic items as unsorted waste."
"Some participants in this discussion, particularly those from the world of industry, claim that it is a senseless proposal."
"I maintain the exact opposite."
"We must reach a point at which it is prohibited to bin an electric shaver, because the general refuse bin is not where it belongs."
"Although this is stating the obvious, many people have not yet grasped the message."
"The law of diminishing unit costs also dictates that we must no longer have waste equipment scattered around our continent in future."
"We must concentrate it in order to reduce the cost of recycling."
"This is why we have introduced a ban on the disposal of electrical and electronic waste as general refuse and a binding annual target of six kilograms per head of population rather than subscribing to the non-binding target proposed by the Commission."
"I believe that this is a warranted step in the right direction."
"We have also devised a preferential arrangement for the retail trade."
"We all fully agree that a commercial outlet, if it sells an electrical appliance or an item of electronic hardware, must take it back."
"But we also know - or at least those who have been town councillors will know - that our shops are located in tightly confined premises in the centres of our towns and cities and do not have the capacity to build even a small shed for the storage of old television sets, not to mention the fact that such a facility would most probably have to be made explosion-proof too."
"We are proposing that end users should be able to surrender their old equipment absolutely free of charge."
"However, it need not automatically go back to the place of purchase."
"Although the retail trade is responsible, the consumer is free to take the used item straight to a general collection point."
"I believe that this is a good alternative. It is designed to protect traders, because if we impose stringent building requirements on them, they will very quickly move to greenfield sites."
"But that is precisely what we want to avoid, because we want to maintain the appeal of our town and city centres."
"This is an important point which, unfortunately, is far too often overlooked."
"We believe that the responsibility of manufacturers, like the transposition of the directive into national law, should not be subject to a five-year transitional period but should take effect only 30 months after the entry into force of the directive, together with an arrangement whereby producers are allowed, on a voluntary basis, to show users the cost of collecting, treating and disposing of historical waste in an environmentally compatible way."
"The specialists know what historical waste is."
"The term refers to those items of equipment that are already in circulation, some of them unbranded or 'orphan' products, the origins of which are unknown. They may have come from bankrupted companies or from retail giants which put them on the market just before Christmas to make life difficult for smaller traders."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the processing of this historical waste must be collectively financed."
"There is no alternative."
"Anyone who thinks that the processing of historical waste could be individually financed is dreaming."
"I do believe, however, that it is right to make provision for individual financing in the case of new equipment."
"There can, of course, be exceptions in some domains where this is not possible."
"But I should very much like to reward those who make an effort and develop a product that can subsequently be recycled for the good of the environment."
"These are the regulatory instruments at our disposal."
"It is all about rewarding, not penalising."
"And at this point, I should like to make a plea to the Council, whose representative is sitting in front of me here: please take this idea on board and urge the Council to support an arrangement which favours individual financing."
"There are also, of course, a few points which my honourable friends and colleagues on the committee did not accept or to which I am opposed."
"As far as the recycling target is concerned, I believe the committee has been somewhat over-ambitious."
"Let me say to my honourable colleague that raising a target from 40% to 50% in Parliament is an easy game to play."
"It is just about the easiest thing on earth."
"But how are the actual waste flows to be organised, how is the market to be persuaded of their benefits, and how are companies to have access to these waste flows in a market economy? These are the really crucial questions."
"For this reason, the Commission' s proposed target is surely a reasonable starting point."
"My own view is that we should keep the Commission' s target rather than opting for the excessively high target proposed by a majority of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"There is a dispute about lighting equipment."
"The main protagonist is discussing the matter at this very moment with other protagonists."
"I believe that lights should be covered by this directive, but they should not be subject to a recycling target."
"The fact is that we do not have a single document explaining how dismantled and dissected lamps can be recycled in such a way that their components can be reused."
"I should not like to set a directive in motion without being able to assess its impact."
"After three years, when we have some experience, we should then set a target for lights."
"In my opinion, the Commission has made a good proposal, which we shall be happy to adopt."
"One of the points at issue in the House is the question of the time at which the manufacturer' s responsibility begins."
"The Commission has proposed - and the Council takes a similar view - that manufacturers must take back their products from the collection point and meet the cost of that operation."
"I support this initiative."
"One reason I support the initiative is because there are some Members of this House who take the view that we should ultimately compel manufacturers to come and collect used toothbrushes from our bathrooms."
"I have three children, and those children certainly have enough moral responsibility to take their equipment - computers, radios or whatever - to a prescribed place at the end of its lifetime and to dispose of it properly there."
"I do not believe we should be pursuing a policy that always assigns responsibility to a third party and never to ourselves as consumers."
"The end users are to be able to hand in old equipment free of charge to their retailer and even have it collected in cases where they are buying a replacement."
"But they have a responsibility if they only intend to dispose of the waste item."
"They must take it to the collection centre in their town or city."
"You may call me old-fashioned, but I believe there is a certain educational aspect in all of this."
"I recall our impassioned debates in this House about the throw-away mentality."
"Those who were most vociferous then are either no longer here or are no longer prepared to stand up and speak out."
"The throw-away mentality is an important factor which must also be taken into account when financing is discussed here."
"We have heard a host of interesting proposals on this subject."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection is a heterogeneous committee, but it renders a valuable contribution in helping to ensure that this Parliament of ours, which is not a 'normal' parliament, plays an increasingly large and important role as a 'normal' parliament."
"For this I should like to express my sincere thanks to all my fellow committee members and to all others who have been involved in our work."
"Mr President, waste from electronic and electrical equipment is now one of the fastest growing waste streams in the European Union."
"It is estimated that this waste stream, which constitutes 4% of municipal waste today, will increase by at least 3-5% every year."
"Electronic and electrical equipment is one of the largest known sources of heavy metals and organic pollutants in the waste stream."
"Without proper pre-treatment, the highly toxic components can contaminate soil and groundwater, as well as pollute the air."
"This directive can therefore be seen as one of the basic instruments for an integrated product policy, where the whole life cycle of a product will be taken into consideration and eco-design will be promoted."
"The need for business to adapt to a changing agenda, taking more account of environmental concerns, is widely accepted; it is also accepted that countries and industries which innovate more quickly will end up being more competitive than those which delay."
"The guiding principle behind the directives is the Extended Producers Responsibility."
"The objective of this is that by making producers financially responsible for their products when they become waste, an upstream effect is created, which leads to design for the environment, considering the durability, reparability or upgrading, disassembly and recycling of the product."
"In addition, through the eco-design, the reuse of resources and separate collection, hazardous substances contained in the waste stream are prevented from entering the environment in an uncontrolled way."
"The directive also applies the principle of the internalisation of external costs."
"The costs of disposal, - which up to now have been borne by local authorities, usually as part of waste disposal -are to be internalised and provision made for the reuse, recycling and de-manufacture of this equipment."
"The ultimate aim is waste prevention."
"The principle of manufacturer responsibility for end-of-life electrical and electronic products is not disputed."
"Producers must be responsible for the products they bring to market. However, they can only be responsible for their individual products."
"We have had some debate about collective and individual systems, which the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has gone into in detail."
"We in the Committee on Industry have tabled some amendments with regard to the availability of spare parts and also to distance-selling and labelling, which we would ask the Commission to take into consideration."
"We are also very concerned with the health and safety of workers dealing with recovery of WEEE and this needs to be more carefully considered than previously when transposing the directive."
"With regard to the restriction of hazardous substances, some members of industry say that we should focus on large equipment and not small equipment. But the concentration of hazardous substances in small equipment is up to four times higher than in large equipment."
"Furthermore, small equipment definitely needs to be separately collected to prevent it from ending up in municipal waste, where hazardous chemicals are not controlled."
"In principle, the proposal to substitute lead, mercury, cadmium, etc. is welcomed."
"However, the Committee on Industry has asked for a structured review process, and I believe the Commission should look very closely at this."
"All stakeholders should have the opportunity to submit data as the basis for an early review, including environmental and consumers' associations, because it is in all our interests that this directive works effectively."
"I would ask the Commission to take this very much on board."
"The Committee on Industry has also asked for an exemption for lead in high-temperature melting solders and lead in glass and electronic components."
"This is because of the technical difficulties in providing alternatives."
"I have discussed this in committee with the Commission and, once again, we have to look closely at the technical possibilities here."
"Mr President, in order to construct a Europe which respects the environment, it is a political and legislative priority to ensure that the business community is fully involved in the task of environmental protection."
"In this context, the directives we are discussing today are essential legislative instruments which contribute to preserving our environment by persuading businesses in the sector to internalise the cost of certain environmental impacts and to adopt a committed position without abandoning their market objectives."
"Mr Florenz' s work is commendable and I must congratulate him on it, since he has managed to create some proposals for directives which find a balance between the interests of consumers, the environment and businesses in the sector, interests which are very difficult to combine."
"I would like to mention the Member States' obligation to achieve a recovery rate of six kilos per inhabitant, since I believe we should take account of the existing differences between the Member States."
"It is clear that Germany, for example, does not produce the same amount of residue as other countries, such as Greece, Portugal or Spain."
"Furthermore, the lifespan of each piece of equipment is significantly different between Member States, which exacerbates that problem."
"I would like to repeat that it is appropriate to apply an implementation co-efficient to the recovery obligation in order thereby to balance and harmonise the obligation, depending on the Member State in question."
"I would also like to highlight the importance of Article 7, which deals with financial responsibility."
"For the sake of greater fairness, individual financial responsibility seems logical, but I very much agree with the solution contained in the report of leaning towards individual responsibility without closing the door to the application of collective responsibility in certain cases."
"With regard to the exceptions for lead solder, I believe that it should be maintained, because I believe that the use of substitutes could create a greater environmental problem or jeopardise consumer safety."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, rapporteur, a number of people will emphasise the importance of this Directive, and they will continue to do so in future."
"People do not ask me why we are voting on this Directive; many people ask me to do this as quickly and effectively as possible."
"I myself come from a country where a number of rules on this subject matter are already in place."
"I should explicitly like to thank the rapporteur for the sterling work he has done and for the excellent improvements he has made to the Commission proposal."
"The key issue in this connection, which he himself has highlighted, is the obligation to collect all electrical and electronic appliances and to establish higher and more stringent collection objectives before 2006."
"The principal goal of this Directive is enshrined in Article 1."
"First prevention, then re-use, then recycling and, lastly, energy recovery."
"It is this hierarchy which is not being respected in the Commission proposal, for prevention is being shifted to another directive and re-use of whole appliances is not being recognised."
"The rapporteur has also relegated a number of aspects to energy recovery instead of recycling."
"The best way to prevent waste is to change the eco-design of these products."
"That is why the instrument of individual producer responsibility, financial responsibility, is so crucial."
"The re-use of whole appliances is important too, not only in terms of the environment, but also from a social point of view."
"Indeed, it creates more employment opportunities for semi- and unskilled workers, and the products become more accessible at lower prices."
"Needless to say, this Directive must also guarantee that waste is not exported to third countries, except with a view to re-use, and only if it can be ensured that the same high objectives and standards will be respected in those third countries."
"Banning hazardous substances is the best preventive measure which we can take."
"Moreover, this is also important in terms of the health of workers."
"In fact, the Directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment forms part of the prevention objective stated in Article 1 of the Directive on discarded electrical and electronic equipment."
"That is why I was so keen on combining the two Directives."
"We have also been familiar with the problem of heavy metals for a long time."
"Alternatives are available for most of them, whilst the Commission provides for exceptions for a number of them."
"I do not believe it is up to Parliament promptly to provide for exceptions over the space of a couple of days."
"There is also the disadvantage that decisions of this kind are sometimes too much inspired by lobbies."
"Let the Commission go about its business and produce an amended version of the exceptions to heavy metals in two years' time."
"Finally, I should definitely like to mention the discussion on brominated flame retardants."
"It has become a discussion between believers, such as myself, convinced of the harmful effects on the environment and health, and non-believers."
"What I find important is that, for many, this discussion has led to a greater appreciation of the harmfulness of these products."
"A ban in 2006 is impossible."
"The amendment tabled by my group asks for producers to demonstrate by 2003 that these products are harmless, and I hope that this can be achieved."
"Mr President, more than thirty years ago an organisation called 'Friends of the Earth' was born in my country."
"I seem to remember a publicity stunt that featured an enormous mound of bottles which were no longer going to be returned for refilling but were simply going to be dumped in a landfill site."
"I was twelve or thirteen at the time and that publicity and the photographs on television woke many of us up to the concerns we still have for the environment and drew our attention to the waste of resources attached to so much of our way of living and our manufacturing processes."
"I am sorry that so many years later my own country is one of those which is trailing behind the countries of the rapporteur and the Commissioner in improving its recycling rate."
"So I am pleased that we have this European legislation, and indeed the whole waste strategy of the Commission, which is forcing individual countries like my own that are recalcitrant and bow too easily to industry pressure on their own doorstep to recognise and put into practice the principles of sustainability."
"These countries are very happy to talk about these principles on a wider stage but are reluctant to put them into practice on their own doorstep."
"The principle here that the producer should accept responsibility for the whole life of the product and ensure that the problems caused by that production are not passed on to future generations is one which we should embrace very strongly."
"So I welcome this legislation and consider it important that industry in my country and perhaps countries elsewhere should recognise that if it does not seize the opportunity to modernise its processes and live up to the high environmental standards then it will lose out on market opportunities across Europe."
"Two dilemmas have been pointed out concerning lead and brominated flame retardants."
"I put this one question to the Commissioner about the issue of low-cost, low-energy light bulbs: Is it better to have them recycled but to put up the cost, or is it better to keep down the cost, encourage their use and perhaps tackle the other serious environmental problem of global warming a little bit more rapidly than we might otherwise be able to do?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to congratulate Mr Florenz warmly on his report."
"He has got the message, which is individual financial responsibility for the manufacturers of new television sets and refrigerators."
"Costs must not be passed on to consumers."
"Only if manufacturers themselves are saddled with the extra costs for re-use and recycling will they gain the financial incentive to design their electrical and electronic products in such a way as to ensure that they can be re-used more easily and in a more environmentally-friendly manner."
"Parliament unanimously supports this principle of individual financial responsibility."
"This is how we can make the market economy more ecological."
"That is why I urge the Swedish Presidency to include this principle in the common position; if not, a conciliation procedure will become inevitable."
"I should once again like to congratulate Mr Florenz."
"If there were more Christian-Democrats like him, we would see black-green coalitions emerge in Europe."
"I only have one point of criticism, namely brominated flame retardants."
"The Commission, along with the majority in Parliament, only want to ban 2 of the 70 brominated flame retardants."
"These two are disappearing from the market anyway, but all 70 should be banned."
"They are toxic and non-biodegradable."
"In human milk, the quantity of these hazardous substances is doubled every five years, and that has been the case for the past 25 years."
"The incidence of these substances in people working in the recycling industry is 70 times higher."
"There are safe alternatives, namely aluminium hydroxides and phosphate esters."
"Japanese firms, such as Sony, have already decided to stop using brominated flame retardants."
"Politicians now need to follow suit."
"Mr President the two proposals we are now discussing are an important step in reducing the quantities of waste from electronic products."
"Instead of household equipment and computer parts ending up being dumped, as often happens at present, we are laying the foundations for all EU Member States being able to collect them separately and recycle them."
"The basic idea of the recycling proposal is that the polluter must pay."
"It is not good enough that the cost of collecting and recycling products should not be a burden upon the consumer."
"The cost must be a part of the product' s overall cost and price."
"It is therefore important that the collection and recycling cost should be an integral part of the product' s price and not a separate, visible charge."
"Only when the cost is integrated is the actual environmental cost integrated into the price."
"It is also important that every company should have to pay the costs of its products."
"Such a system does not prevent practical cooperation in connection with collection and recycling."
"Individual financial responsibility on the part of companies is both fairer and more efficient than collective financial responsibility."
"An individual system for new waste benefits those manufacturers that use the best materials and construct those products that are simplest to recycle."
"This will favour more environmentally-friendly products and provide a major impetus for product development."
"The rapporteur has made efforts to try at an early stage to get the various political groups to compromise on quite a few important areas."
"That is something we really appreciate, and we also believe that, as the work continues, it puts Parliament in a stronger position in relation to the Council of Ministers."
"We obviously support the objectives of an increase in both the proportion of collected products and the proportion of the collected products which it will be possible to recycle."
"When it comes to the second proposal for a directive, concerning a restriction upon the use of hazardous substances in electronic equipment, we believe that the committee' s proposals could have gone further."
"That applies especially to the possibility of banning various flame retardants."
"Recently, there have been quite a few alarming reports about the way in which these substances accumulate and about the dangerous effects on health to which they can give rise."
"We also think that it needs to be possible right now for individual countries to make tougher demands upon this type of product."
"The Commission has recently objected to the fact that the Swedish Government wanted to impose tougher environmental requirements regarding hazardous substances in connection with the purchase of 400 000 computers."
"We think it is completely unacceptable that the Commission and the EU' s purchasing regulations should at present, in this way, be preventing countries from imposing tougher environmental requirements and, by so doing, supporting product development in this area."
"Mr President, at present, 90% of electronic waste in the EU is being dumped or incinerated without pre-treatment."
"This means that 36 tonnes of mercury, 16 tonnes of cadmium and countless dioxins and furans end up in the environment in an uncontrolled manner."
"In addition, appliances which contain a lot of glass, such as television sets, produce a negative energy yield during incineration."
"Moreover, hazardous substances evaporate or leak when electronic waste is dumped."
"I therefore welcome the two European Directives that address these problems."
"I am also pleased that ambitious percentage levels are being established for recycling."
"However, in this connection, we should bear in mind that recycling is only more environmentally friendly if the waste is pre-treated."
"Furthermore, the success of the Directive stands or falls with the extent to which electronic waste is collected."
"Partly because the quantity of waste is ever increasing, we need to establish a percentage level here too as quickly as possible."
"The return of electronic waste free of charge will be a good incentive."
"The principle underlying producer responsibility is of key importance."
"Indeed, it allows to some extent for re-use and recycling at the end of the life-cycle to be taken into consideration during the manufacture of electronic equipment."
"Needless to say, I could not agree more with the rapporteur on the point that full re-use should remain possible."
"However, the risk of electronic waste being dumped in countries outside the European Union under the pretext of re-use is not hypothetical."
"That is why the Member States need to ensure that only usable electrical and electronic equipment which will actually be re-used is exported to countries outside the EU, as I have proposed in one of my amendments."
"Another amendment concerns the exceptions deleted by the rapporteur from Annex 1 to the Directive restricting hazardous substances."
"These exceptions need to be retained, since they not only concern the medical sector, but are also indispensable and irreplaceable for scientific research in the chemical and physics sectors."
"Mr President, I should like to echo the congratulations already expressed by many of my fellow MEPs to Mr Florenz."
"The Directive that is before us today is an important Directive."
"Why?"
"Because Europe is facing every larger waste streams of discarded electrical and electronic equipment."
"That means, therefore, that a sound, environmentally-friendly solution is very much what is needed to recycle and process this waste."
"I endorse the way in which Mr Florenz has combined all these interests and all these sectors in groups in his report."
"Allow me to dwell on the Directive for a moment."
"First of all, it is in the consumer' s interest to be able to return electronic and electrical waste free of charge."
"Manufacturers thus need to finance the collection from the collection point, as well as the processing, recovery and removal of the waste."
"I back the opinion that manufacturers need to take care of this individually as much as possible."
"Indeed, individual responsibility is also an incentive for manufacturers to design products which are better suited to recycling, and I also share the view that historical waste cannot be left for the individual manufacturer to deal with."
"This was evident in the Netherlands too."
"Historical waste must be financed collectively."
"I support voluntary collection, processing and removal, with due consideration for the environment. This sends out the message to consumers, at the time when they buy new products, that the producers actually took their responsibilities seriously."
"A collective system has been in place in the Netherlands since 1999, with a visible contribution being made towards disposal, and it works very well."
"I support the increase in collection from 4 to 6 kg, for if I were not to do so, it would mean that a great deal of electrical waste would end up on the scrap heap."
"Finally, I hope that the amendments concerning lighting equipment can also be adopted."
"Mr President, I too want to join the chorus of people offering congratulations but perhaps also extend the congratulations to our own shadow rapporteur, Mrs Van Brempt, who has done some truly excellent and demanding work."
"I think we have arrived at quite a good conclusion, even though there are naturally certain points regarding which further requirements could be made."
"What is most important, however, is that we establish producer responsibility, something I perhaps see as the biggest environmental gain from this work."
"I also see it as a success for all the progressive and environmentally aware companies which are, in fact, already working in this way at present."
"They are being given the opportunity to continue to develop their ecodesigns and to manufacture their products in ways that are more in accordance with environmental considerations than the ways used by many other companies."
"Both Mr de Roo and Mr Sjöstedt have spoken about hazardous substances, but I nonetheless wanted to mention brominated flame retardants."
"It is rather annoying that we have not succeeded in making further progress on that issue."
"It is scientifically proven that these substances are dangerous, and there is scientific evidence of the health aspects."
"Flame retardants and their residues can be found in mother' s milk in places as far away as Greenland, among the Inuit, where the levels are more often than not much higher than those recommended by the WHO."
"It is odd that we are so hesitant and so afraid of doing anything about the problem that we confine ourselves to dealing with just two flame retardants."
"We know that the substances are hazardous."
"We know that they affect children' s concentration."
"We also know that people can experience other types of disorder, such as weight loss, as a result of ingesting these substances and in spite of never having asked to have them in their bodies."
"The directive on hazardous substances is based on Article 95, and the directive on waste consisting wholly or partly of electrical or electronic products is based on Article 175."
"That is something I cannot understand."
"When we discussed a similar directive on end-of-life vehicles, most people saw that directive as a model for future work on the subject, but memories are clearly quite short."
"I think that this fits in extremely badly with what we are to be discussing this afternoon, that is to say sustainable development."
"In this area, it is again the internal market which is setting the framework for what we are to achieve in the environmental sphere, and countries are punished for taking the lead."
"I think that that is wrong."
"Mr President, we have before us an important directive and a sound report."
"If all Member States were to develop a system such as we are defining here, I think that would be a huge step forward."
"Member States that have devised systems which are now working should be able to retain those systems, in my view."
"I am pleased that that is possible."
"I think it is important in the region that I come from, too."
"I therefore consider that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has produced a sound compromise, thanks to the constructive obstinacy on the part of our rapporteur, as well as a number of other people."
"I regret - indeed, not everyone can be 100% satisfied with a compromise - that the visible removal contribution has to go."
"We are asking consumers to behave in a responsible manner, and that is why they need to receive backing."
"I have tabled an amendment concerning re-use, which I think is an excellent idea, except if there are new products which, on environmental balance, score more points."
"I therefore hope that I can count on the support of this Chamber for this amendment."
"In addition, recycling centres, which I also welcome with open arms, and which receive subsidies for their work - with good reason - should not only be allowed to cherry-pick, but should also ensure that recycling establishments do not only get the dregs."
"I assume that I can count on the support of this Chamber for that too."
"Mr President, I would like to join all those who have thanked the rapporteur here."
"He could actually be called Mr Producer Responsibility, as this was the second historical directive, the second historical achievement, in which the producer' s responsibility will be significantly incorporated in the European Union' s environment and product legislation."
"In this way we are also moving towards a new phase in environmental policy, which is one of already taking account of the demands of the environment at the product design stage."
"I have found that, as a result of this directive, large companies are now discussing how, for example, GSM telephones could be lighter - although they are certainly light already - how they could be easier to dismantle, and how all the harmful substances could be removed and then responsibly sent off as treatable waste."
"I would like to return to these harmful, hazardous substances."
"Our group would have liked to see rather more determined action to try to get rid of especially hazardous chemical substances."
"I will mention one example. Much has been said about product safety, which is a very important issue, and fire safety particularly so."
"There has been discussion on whether halogenated flame retardants should be banned in future."
"In our opinion, it is quite obvious that they are toxic, as they have, for example, led to a situation where mother' s milk contains double the amount of these halogenated chromium compounds every five years."
"There are alternatives to them, and we would like to see them banned more quickly and companies in this way being encouraged to start using harmless alternatives without, however, compromises being made with regard to product safety."
"Mr President, I too would like to heartily congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Florenz."
"We have here a well-balanced, excellent report on a subject which, together with the directive on scrap cars and vans drafted earlier by Mr Florenz, will from now on serve as a model for other similar legislation."
"For that reason, the decisions we now have to take are particularly important."
"I am particularly pleased that the committee adopted my amendments, which clarify the meaning of producer responsibility."
"This will have an immense impact on the quantity and quality of electrical and electronic waste being generated, greater than any other possible decision Parliament could make with regard to scrap and waste."
"It will create incentives for more ecologically friendly design and innovations before products have even come onto the market, and will therefore lessen the environmental burden of products for their entire life cycle."
"This is an enormous change with regard to earlier ways of thinking, in which the focus was on the repair and prevention of environmental damage only at the stage of a product' s life when it was in fact merely waste."
"In exactly the same way, we should examine Annex II on requirements for the treatment of waste."
"If the directive requires printed circuit boards to always be removed, for example, it will not create incentives for the development of materials used in printed circuit boards. Under the directive, they will have to be removed in any case."
"Instead, by mentioning a substance that is contained in a component that has to be removed, we will create incentives for developing components that do not have these hazardous substances in them."
"Only this sort of approach will act as any real incentive in eco-design."
"This is the intention behind Amendment No 77."
"In a similar manner, we must create incentives for the development of alternative waste treatment methods, so that the environmental burden resulting from them is as light as possible."
"The amendment I tabled with this in mind had already been adopted in the Annex by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, but the corresponding amendment to the Article is contained in Amendment No 76 submitted for the plenary sitting."
"Mr President, the European Union is making legislation that clearly shows the rest of the world that the conflict between concern for the environment and economic matters is not unavoidable but can be settled through considered legislation."
"Only this can provide a real chance for sustainable development, in which the EU can be a global pioneer."
"Mr President, I would also like to join the ranks of those who are saying thank you to Mr Florenz and the other speakers."
"I think they have done a really good piece of work."
"As regards the ban on hazardous substances, I am pleased that it is now being proposed that we bring forward this ban."
"I personally would have liked to see us have all flame retardants included from the start, but I think this is an issue that we must try to continue working on. With regard to dealing with waste, I think there are three crucial points."
"The first is that we must have the waste arising in these contexts separated from other unsorted waste as soon as possible."
"This requires a strategy plan in the individual countries, and it also very much requires us to have effective labelling so that we can identify the products in question."
"The second central point is naturally producer responsibility, and I can only agree with what many of the speakers have said concerning this point."
"It is important that we find a solution to this issue in relation to the entire life cycle of the product and that we also have provisions adopted concerning the financing of producer responsibility."
"As far as possible, the financing should take place on an individual basis, so that it can be used in the development of cleaner technology as a competitive parameter."
"I believe this may become one of the most important points of all."
"I would like to end by asking the Commissioner a question."
"I come, of course, from a country that has already implemented somewhat more restrictive rules in relation to hazardous substances."
"Since we are talking here about an internal market directive on hazardous substances, I would like to ask whether a country such as Denmark will be forced to rescind its more restrictive rules until the restrictive rules also enter into force in 2008 or 2006, depending on the year finally decided on for this phasing out of hazardous substances."
"It will naturally be very unfortunate for us if we are forced to return to poorer rules for a period, only to have the bans reintroduced at a later point in time."
"Mr President, allow me to begin by thanking Karl-Heinz Florenz."
"The fact is that he has studied, analysed and discussed no fewer than 334 densely printed pages - 70 pages on hazardous substances and 264 pages on end-of-life equipment."
"This is clearly a subject of great complexity, but it is also a very important one, because it affects all the people of the European Union."
"Our concern is to press ahead with waste separation and to ensure that electrical and electronic equipment is disposed of separately from household waste."
"This is a very important issue."
"We know that we currently have about two billion such items in Europe and that some 210 million of them are disposed of every year."
"This, when all is said and done, represents six million tonnes and generates costs of approximately EUR 40 billion."
"When such an amount is involved, we are duty-bound to consider who should meet the cost and in particular how that cost can be most efficiently and effectively controlled in accordance with market principles; we must ensure that the chosen strategy is the cheapest one for taxpayers and consumers and the best one for the environment."
"We know that there is a huge volume of historical waste."
"Sixty-six per cent of all these electrical appliances and items of electronic hardware are more than ten years old, while about half of them come from households."
"This is why compulsory collection targets are so very important."
"It is also the reason why we have been so firmly committed to the six-kilogram target."
"We want recycling to be conducted in a truly systematic manner and on a scale which ultimately makes sound economic and budgetary sense."
"What is important to me about bans on particular substances is that we must only replace such substances with demonstrably better, sustainable and, most importantly, scientifically tested alternatives."
"This is an area in which the Commission must act, on the one hand to prevent damage and on the other hand to choose the best option in ecological terms."
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Florenz and our shadow rapporteur, Mrs Van Brempt."
"In this debate, I would like to outline three aspects which I believe to be of the utmost importance, namely prevention, the role of the Member States and fire safety."
"The aim of the directive is to prevent environmental problems."
"It seeks to promote eco-design."
"Producer responsibility is the key word in this connection."
"Producers can do a great deal, such as providing sustainable products and ensuring that appliances can easily be repaired, for example within the space of half an hour."
"They could use special colours in the case of hazardous components, so that these stand out upon disposal at all times."
"Also, in order to make the consumer more aware of the waste issue, I would call for the introduction of a histogram that illustrates the extent to which waste can be recycled."
"There has been a great deal of discussion about the role of the Member States."
"This proposal outlines the salient points concerning the collection of discarded appliances and the funding of recycling."
"With a view to subsidiarity, Europe should not want to lay down, to the last detail, how the basic principles should be transposed."
"It is a different matter in the case of product standards and the use of hazardous substances."
"Here, it is important for us to retain the internal market."
"In my view, it would be unacceptable if we were to encourage all Member States to go ahead and set their own standards."
"The internal market forms an important basis of European cooperation."
"It is our task to ensure that products traded on the internal market all meet the highest standards in terms of the environment and safety."
"Finally, I should like to spend a moment on an important issue, namely that of fire safety."
"It is our duty to ensure that public safety is guaranteed."
"Even if this involves hazardous substances, unfortunately."
"However, we need to reduce the harmful environmental effects of flame retardants to a minimum."
"If clean alternatives are available, we should use them."
"From an environmental point of view, I therefore call for a ban on a few brominated flame retardants."
"We must pull out all the stops, where possible, to develop and use environmentally-friendly alternatives."
"Mr President, may I also add my thanks to Karl-Heinz Florenz, who has presented a very good report."
"What we are working towards is the environmentally-friendly disposal of old electrical appliances and, if possible, material recycling."
"Parliament attaches the utmost importance to the polluter-pays principle, which comes across very clearly in this report."
"I do believe, however - and here too, the Florenz report strikes the right tone - that great care must always be taken to establish precisely how these principles can be applied in each specific sector of the economy."
"Even the collection of appliances or small components requires the use of energy and can in itself be harmful to the environment."
"It is therefore important that we provide for derogations in the case of components which contain no hazardous substances, such as light bulbs, that we always look at the whole ecological balance and then consider whether it is appropriate to collect these things separately and use them for recycling or whether such action is perhaps not justified on environmental grounds."
"For this reason I believe that Amendment No 65 takes us in the right direction."
"We must apply the polluter-pays principle correctly."
"I see a problem in this respect at one or two points because, in the case of historical waste in particular, we are not talking about the polluter-pays principle when we say that all those who are operating in the market at the present time have to foot the bill for those who were perhaps manufacturing some product twenty years ago."
"Great care must be taken here, since not every segment of this market is transparent."
"We became aware of this in the committee."
"To illustrate the problem, let me mention that I devoted myself particularly to household light fittings, since large numbers of them are produced in my constituency."
"The manufacturers say, with some justification, that it is surely not consistent with the polluter-pays principle to expect present-day manufacturers to pay for the recovery of a chandelier which has been hanging in someone' s lounge and which was produced twenty years ago by some manufacturer or other who is no longer in business."
"It is not the polluter who has to pay - quite the reverse."
"If consideration is also given to the fact that such products include many grey-market imports from companies which do not adhere to the high European environmental standards - companies in China, for example - it becomes clear that the polluter-pays principle would be turned on its head if we penalised companies for conducting their business properly and being properly registered."
"For these reasons I ask you to support Amendments Nos 65 and 88."
"Mr President, Commissioner, besides the subjects that have been amply discussed, I believe we should take a closer look at two, perhaps three, of the other points that Karl-Heinz Florenz has raised."
"Firstly, I believe that the directive is not solely intended to ensure that products are designed in such a way that they can be easily recycled and to introduce recycling quotas."
"Greater attention should also be paid to two other factors, namely consumers and consumer responsibility, because, when it comes to electronics and electronic waste, consumers have not yet developed the habit of using authorised recycling centres to dispose of their old equipment."
"Things are somewhat different with cars."
"Cars are taken to the scrap-yard."
"This, however, does not necessarily happen to electric toothbrushes or shavers."
"I believe we must step up our efforts in this domain."
"I consider it only right that the Member States should clearly emphasise the consumer' s responsibility for collecting these waste products separately and even spell out the potential penalties for non-compliance."
"A second aspect to be considered is that we are doing something entirely new here."
"This legislation will create waste and material streams that have never existed before."
"We therefore do not know at all how things will be recycled, which material streams will be created and what will happen to them."
"Amendment No 56, admittedly, is only a short motion, but it serves to promote a system of monitoring which will not only indicate the targets that the Member States have set - what has to be achieved - but will also provide precise information on what is actually happening with regard to the targets and on the consequences of our proposed legislation in the real material world."
"We should therefore observe developments closely and take stock after a certain time in order to determine whether the material streams that have developed really do match our objectives."
"Mr President, the WEEE directive increases producer responsibility for current and historic domestic waste, electrical and electronic equipment from mobile phones, toasters and PCs to washing machines."
"This waste is growing at up to 5% per year due to technological innovation and market expansion and contains a percentage of dangerous substances that are currently finding their way into municipal landfills, obviously posing clear environmental hazards."
"Hence, the need for the second proposed directive to reduce the risk of impact on human health and the environment of the production, use, treatment and disposal of WEEE."
"The directives deal with producer responsibility, separate collection, better treatment, reuse, recycling, costs, targets, labelling, alternatives to dangerous substances such as lead, mercury, PBB, etc., while allowing some exceptions."
"But let us be sure, with the proper application of the much-toted precautionary principle, that the alternatives are in fact safer from a toxicity and hazard point of view, in every respect including the ability to flame retard."
"Have we an acceptable substitute for lead solder, for example?"
"While I endorse both directives, I have tabled an amendment to Article 15 (4) of the WEEE directive inserting a new subparagraph based on a similar clause in Article 52 of the relatively recent EC Directive 99/31 on the landfill of waste."
"I consider this to be as good a basis as any for taking account of the genuine and practical difficulties of certain Member States in meeting the ambitious collection and recovery targets proposed in Articles 44 and 62 respectively of the WEEE directive."
"Important proposals such as these have to take into balanced account the significant variations in recycling infrastructure, economies of scale, demographics and geographical circumstances in certain Member States."
"It is unrealistic and unfair to require Member States with acknowledged deficiencies in recycling infrastructure and reprocessing capacity - for whatever reason - and which lack reliable data on WEEE arisings to achieve the same ambitious targets within specified short time frames as other Member States which already have all or most of the requisite infrastructure in place."
"It should be borne in mind that the proposed targets are based on the state-of-the-art recycling pilot study conducted in Eindhoven in the Netherlands, which has the requisite infrastructure and population density."
"Ireland, Greece, Portugal, not to mention the accession countries, will have definite problems with the current proposals unless amended."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Mr Florenz for his work in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and the excellent cooperation he has established between all the groups and with the Commission."
"We are tackling the specific problem of electrical and electronic waste for the following reasons. We have heard them before, but I repeat that this is the fastest growing part of the waste stream - indeed, it is growing three times faster than other waste streams."
"Each of us produces on average about 14 kgs per year of such waste."
"By the year 2010, when this directive will be fully operational, electrical and electronic waste will account for over 8% of the entire municipal waste stream."
"Ninety per cent of this electrical and electronic waste is currently landfilled or incinerated with no pre-treatment."
"This means wasted resources, both in terms of the costs of disposal and the poor use of natural resources."
"Electrical and electronic equipment is a major source of certain hazardous substances in the waste stream."
"Just one example illustrates this: 40% of the lead in landfills and 50% of the lead in incineration comes from this type of equipment."
"Lastly, since Member States are already acting in this area, there is a strong case for Community coordination."
"The main aim of the proposals for directives is to prevent electrical and electronic equipment from being landfilled or incinerated."
"To achieve this objective, the directive sets out a range of requirements."
"Member States are required to set up separate collection schemes from households; consumers have the right to dispose of their waste free of charge and producers are responsible for taking the waste from central collection points and ensuring that it is properly treated through recovery and re-use."
"In addition, the directive requires the substitution of certain hazardous substances, such as lead and mercury, by 2008."
"Let me answer some of your questions."
"I shall begin with the question by Mr Davies."
"I understood him to mean that if these light bulbs were exempted, it would mean that they would be slightly cheaper."
"However, there is really no contradiction in collecting these light bulbs."
"It is very important to include them in this kind of system."
"It will still be cheaper to produce an environmentally-friendly light bulb."
"We have not set up specific recycling targets for light bulbs, only for fluorescent lamps."
"I think the producers of these lamps would like to be included in this scheme."
"We are all concerned about brominated flame retardants."
"The Commission considers that there is sufficient evidence to ban the use of two categories of brominated flame retardants, PBB and PBDE - that is against the background of the risk assessments being carried out on them."
"We have enough evidence to be able to ban them."
"We agree that a mechanism to ban new substances should be set up."
"It is of course important, and in line with the Chemicals Strategy, that we allow such a development and add on new substances."
"We admit that today we do not have enough risk assessments and evidence to make a complete list of all the existing flame retardants, including the risks of taking them out of some substances where they prevent fire, etc."
"The review should cover all potential hazardous substances."
"I turn to Mr Lund's question on Denmark."
"Remember that the aim of these directives is to establish a high common level of protection."
"These products are marketed throughout the European Union, and that is why it is necessary to have a high level of protection in the whole of the EU."
"At the same time we know that Sweden, Denmark and other countries which have effective legislation have not been forced to abandon their legislation."
"This is what Sweden and Denmark feared, but it did not happen."
"It has to be looked at on a case-by-case basis."
"This will also have to be done for these substances."
"We want to establish a high level of protection for the whole of the European Union."
"Several Members have mentioned the 'visible fee'."
"The Commission thinks that this amendment is unnecessary."
"A 'visible fee' is possible as long as it does not create trade distortions."
"Nowhere is it said that producers cannot inform consumers of the costs of waste management."
"I think these were the most important questions raised."
"Now we are confronted with a total number of 136 amendments: 100 on the proposal on electronic waste and 36 on the proposal on hazardous substances."
"On the first proposal, overall, the Commission can accept 36 amendments in full, 11 in part and 22 in principle."
"The Commission can accept Amendments Nos 3, 4, 10, 15, 16, 18 to 25, 27 to 29, 36, 39, 42, 43, 45, 47 to 50, 51, 52, 54, 56, 59 to 61, 64, 66 to 68."
"Twenty-two amendments can be accepted in principle: 2, 8, 9, 30, 32, 38, 41, 44, 53, 55, 57, 58, 62, 63, 75, 77, 83 to 86, 95 and 100."
"In particular, as regards Amendments Nos 9 and 35, the Commission can accept that Member States take measures with a view to achieving a separate collection rate of 6 kg per person per year."
"Concerning Amendment No 44, it is important to leave freedom to Member States on how to organise the collection, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle."
"Amendment No 52 may give rise to practical difficulties, but can also be accepted in principle."
"Eleven amendments can be accepted in part: No 6 (second part, in principle), No 11 (second part, except the terms in brackets), No 13 (the text will have to be shortened and simplified), No 17 (second and third parts, in principle), No 26 (except the term 'consumables' ), No 35 (first paragraph, second paragraph in principle, fourth paragraph, seventh paragraph in principle, eighth paragraph, ninth paragraph in principle), No 37 (except paragraph 5), No 46 (second and third parts, in principle), No 70 (except the part referring to printed circuit boards; the entry on capacitors can be accepted in principle) Nos 71 and 80 (the reference to Regulation 2037/2000 can be accepted)."
"On the second proposal, overall the Commission can accept five amendments in full, two in part and twelve in principle."
"The amendments acceptable in full are Nos 1, 9, 12, 13 and 17."
"The Commission can accept Amendments Nos 4, 7, 10, 14, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 25, 26 and 35 in principle."
"As regards Amendments Nos 4 and 10, the Commission agrees that the scope of the directive on restrictions on substances may be broadened on the basis of a proposal from the Commission."
"However, this should be done in accordance with certain principles, not least those set out in the Chemicals Strategy."
"The Commission can accept to advance the date of phase-out from 2008 to 2006."
"Amendment No 11 can be accepted in the part which refers to consumer safety and Amendment No 23 (inclusion of category 10 in the scope)."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Wallström."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"Priority substances in water policy"
"The next item is the report (A5­0135/2001) by Mrs Breyer, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal and the amended proposal for a European Parliament and Council Decision establishing the list of priority substances in the field of water policy. [COM(2000) 47 - COM(2001) 17 - C5­0079/2001 - C5­0021/2000 - 2000/0035(COD)]."
". (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission proposal is based on the common position adopted by the Council for a water framework directive."
"The common position made no provision either for identification of 'priority hazardous substances' or for the gradual elimination of pollution of waters by hazardous substances."
"We must emphasise once again that the European Parliament deserves credit for ensuring that the OSPAR strategy will be integrated into the water framework directive."
"Parliament insisted on integration being treated as a key issue in the conciliation procedure."
"The aim is to eliminate water pollution gradually, by continuously reducing discharges, emissions, leakage and spillage of priority hazardous substances with the target of complete elimination within 20 years."
"Under the water directive, the criteria for the identification of such substances focus firstly on their inherent characteristics and secondly on the definitions contained in the existing international, UN, OSPAR and other lists."
"Of the 32 substances to which the priority classification has been assigned, the proposal lists eleven as priority hazardous substances, a further eleven as priority substances under review and the remaining ten as regular priority substances."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy proposes that the Commission undertake the categorisation of the eleven substances on the 'under review' list in the course of the coming year."
"In this way the Environment Committee seeks to ensure that the Commission does not defer its decision as to whether these eleven substances are priority hazardous substances or only priority substances until the year 2004, when, under Article 16 of the water framework directive, the lists of priority substances are due for revision."
"Through this proposal, the Environment Committee also wants to ensure that Article 16 is actually applied and that the decision on the categorisation of the substances on the 'under review' list is not shelved in deference to industrial or other interests."
"I believe it is crucially important that we the European Parliament should exert due pressure on the Commission."
"One thing we must always bear in mind is that this report only serves to pave the way for the necessary measures and that the framework directive lays down a 20-year time frame for the achievement of the environmental targets in the realm of water protection."
"The Environment Committee also wants to see changes in the COMMPS procedure."
"This should be continually developed and improved."
"In future it should no longer be confined to particular substances."
"For example, it has not hitherto covered those substances for which no data are available at Community level from national monitoring programmes."
"This applies to 60% of the pesticides that are available today."
"Parliament wishes to rectify these serious deficiencies as well as other shortcomings of the present COMMPS procedure, so as to ensure that all substances will be covered in the future."
"Many of the current deficiencies are due to the fact that our policymakers have no data on certain chemicals."
"If we wish to protect our waters effectively against hazardous chemicals, we also need a change of policy on the acquisition of data regarding chemical substances."
"The Commission, in fact, has already set this in motion."
"So you will see that we are striving to reach a solution which the House as well as the Council and Commission will support."
"The central issue in this discussion will be the results of the categorisation of the substances on the 'under review' list."
"The Committee wishes this categorisation to be effected as soon as possible, as I have already stated."
"The Commission and the Council see a feasibility problem."
"That is why I, as rapporteur, have tabled Amendment No 27, in a further attempt to provide the basis for a solution."
"The proposal is that the measures should not be jeopardised by this 'under review' list that the Commission is introducing."
"This, I believe, is our common objective."
"This proposal must not be pushed towards the rear of the catalogue of implementable measures, a move which would prevent us from achieving the environmental aims we have to achieve in order to protect our water resources."
"With regard to the talks that have taken place between the Council, the Commission and Parliament, I hope we have now found a sound compromise, which will enable us to conclude this matter at first reading."
"In other words, it is now up to the Council and the Commission to decide whether they will abide by the outcome of the parliamentary vote, thereby enabling us to start as quickly as possible to introduce real measures for the protection of water resources."
"Mr President, the members of the Committee on Agriculture recognise the great importance that we attach to the control of substances which are used in farming to protect plants and encourage growth, particularly the effects that these have on our water supplies."
"We are, however, disappointed that the Committee on the Environment did not accept our amendments that substances in natural nutrients used in agriculture should not be classified either as priority or hazardous priority substances."
"The Committee on the Environment also did not accept our Amendment No 3 which was to review the procedure for priority hazardous substances."
"The plant protection products Directive 91/414 already has an established procedure to evaluate those substances and decide whether or not they should be used in the Community."
"I would submit that the decisions under that Directive ought to be completed under its agreed timetable before an informed decision can be taken under these new proposals."
"There is no valid reason, given that we are looking at a potential phase-out period of twenty years, for trying to shorten the timetable, and this was the substance of the Committee on Agriculture's proposal."
"We wanted to allow sufficient time to have a thorough investigation and make sure there was an avoidance of errors."
"The original Commission proposal was barely in line."
"Amendment No 20 by the committee and Amendment No 27 by Mrs Breyer run counter to proper investigation and should be opposed."
"Mrs Breyer ought to have mentioned when she was talking about Amendment No 27 that she was speaking about an amendment tabled by herself on behalf of her group and not on behalf of the Committee on the Environment."
"Mr President, I would like to focus on four amendments made to the original proposal submitted by the European Parliament, which had the unanimous support of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"The first of these amendments, Amendment No 3, relates to one of the major innovations in the Commission' s proposal, namely the management of European water resources using river basins and watercourses that irrigate the European Union' s territory."
"On this point, Parliament insists that the Commission take into account the fact that many watercourses and even rivers, such as the Tagus in southern Europe, the Rhine, for instance, in central Europe or the Oder, for example, in northern Europe, are border rivers which are the responsibility of one or more Member States but also of riparian States which are not Member States and, in particular, candidate countries."
"Parliament believes that it is crucial that these non-Member riparian States should be involved in the management process now rather than waiting until they join the EU, which is very likely but will inevitably not happen for some time."
"A second amendment, Amendment No 8, calls upon the Commission to promote the synchronisation of research and of the conclusions drawn within the framework of the two major mechanisms for combating water pollution that have already been implemented."
"The first mechanism is the OSPAR Convention, which focuses on maritime waters but also covers a considerable area of internal waters."
"The second mechanism, known as the COMMPS procedure, focuses, on the other hand, on internal waters but also covers a substantial area of maritime waters."
"In these circumstances, it is easy to understand that the situation could well become chaotic if the Commission does not provide the requested synchronisation."
"Lastly, the third amendment, Amendment No 11, expresses the desire that the Commission, whilst following the COMMPS procedure as a general rule, should not exclude the possibility of the Commission using methods of assessing the harmfulness of certain substances which have already been developed or used in other anti-pollution measures."
"For instance, measures which have already proven to be effective in systems developed for combating air pollution must be used or adapted for combating water pollution."
"I would like to make a final comment, which is to stress the extraordinarily far-reaching importance of the texts submitted for vote by Parliament."
"One of the reasons why Europe has shown exemplary development across the board, one of the reasons for this balanced development and for the high quality farming industry which has always accompanied Europe' s economic development is precisely the fact that Europe has always had inexhaustible - in that they are infinitely renewable - resources of the precious liquid which keeps us alive."
"Both the quality and the quantity of water resources are now at risk from senseless and rapidly increasing amounts of pollution, which has been virtually uncontrollable over the last few centuries."
"All Member States and all regions must take action in this area."
"Mr President, as a result of our work today, the Water Framework Directive, which entered into force in December 2000, will be fleshed out with the listing of 32 specific substances in Annex X. The Group of the European Peoples' Party is in agreement with the proposal from the Commission."
"All the amendments supported by our group help to bring the text of the annex into line with that of the Water Framework Directive."
"The rapid adoption of this list is a matter of priority for our group, because only then will the Commission be able to get down to its main task of formulating proposals for the treatment of every single one of these 32 substances."
"This can then mean banning substances and phasing them out or permitting their continued use, subject to certain conditions."
"The aim, however, is always the same, namely either not to let these substances enter water at all in future or only to let them enter water in weak concentrations."
"The concept of water in the context of the directive covers all water - groundwater, surface water, rivers and lakes, right down to the smallest stream and even perhaps the smallest puddle, and, of course, the sea."
"It goes without saying that this wide range of aquatic environments will require widely differing sets of rules."
"After all, we are not starting from scratch here in Europe, because many of these 32 substances are already covered by the Directive on plant-protection products, the Biocides Directive and the Directive on existing substances."
"Moreover, when the entire body of EU legislation on chemical substances is realigned, we shall be compelled to subject all these substances to thorough scrutiny once again."
"For this reason we should take great care to ensure that there is no duplication of effort, and hence unnecessary expense."
"We can spend the money more fruitfully elsewhere for the benefit of the environment."
"Our aim here is to determine the impact of these substances on our water resources."
"We have learned that the Swedish Presidency is keen to have this matter concluded swiftly."
"We intend to support its pursuit of that goal."
"Our group will not stand in its way."
"Anyone who is seriously committed to the protection of our European waters should adopt the same position."
"Mrs Breyer has already stressed a point that I should like to re-emphasise, namely that Parliament has achieved a resounding success in the creation of the Water Framework Directive and that its fruits are already being harvested today."
"After all, its classification of eleven substances out of the 32 as priority hazardous substances has ensured that their discharge into water resources will be stopped within the foreseeable future."
"But I also wish to thank the Commission for its painstaking work and for the comprehensive information which it has provided and which has been of great assistance to me in my role as shadow rapporteur."
"My thanks are also due to our rapporteur, Mrs Breyer, for all her efforts."
"Mr President, I must first of all welcome this report."
"It has taken some time to get it to the plenary session."
"Mrs Breyer has been persistent, though, and she has worked very hard on it."
"So I think we can now give it our general support and endorse entirely the principles of what is being proposed here today."
"This priority list of thirty-two proposed substances, ranked according to their known dangerous properties, is the right way to start trying to deal with the problem of water pollution."
"However, we also need to consider the possibility of adding to this list or simply changing it using the COMMPS procedure or using other additional information we might obtain in the coming years."
"We do have to consider this list very carefully before action, but that is not an excuse for no action or slow action."
"It is still bizarre to me that nickel is included on this list and that our approach to families of chemicals has unfairly targeted fluoranthene alongside the other PAHs."
"So, clearly further work is needed on this initial list."
"The timetable for action is not really ambitious."
"2020?"
"I really think that perhaps we can go a little faster than that."
"The idea of getting close to zero emissions of these substances is a fairly vague objective and I think some of the European Parliament's amendments today help to clarify this issue."
"But I do not doubt for one minute that this is the way ahead, that these are the steps we have got to take to protect an increasingly important resource, the quality of which is vital to future generations."
"This is a blessing they do not have in other parts of the world."
"In Europe we should count our blessings and care for our blessings; our water resources are one of those very important blessings."
"Mr President, as we look at the world's environmental problems, some of them, such as the loss of habitats and biodiversity, seem to leave us powerless of achieving any solution."
"But it is not all gloom and doom, and within Europe, we are capable of banning the use of chemicals which are toxic, persistent and bio-accumulative and using science to develop safer alternatives, and this directive is good news for that reason."
"The Water Framework Directive was my first experience of the dynamics of the conciliation process between Parliament and the Council with the assistance of the Commission, and I think that Parliament can claim credit for introducing the category of priority hazardous substances which this Directive now puts into practice, but it is indeed a first step on a long road."
"I know the Commissioner has herself many times referred to the sheer number of chemicals still being developed and being put on the market, and suspicion is attached to many substances, not identified as yet, and the process of identification and elimination needs to progress rapidly."
"Can I refer in concluding to the institutional relationship?"
"The Presidency has indicated to group spokesmen that it would like to fast-track this process and see a rapid resolution, and I think that is welcomed by all parties."
"We would obviously like to see action sooner rather than later, but hastily arranged meetings with no time for proper discussion and coordination between parties are not the best way of making laws or securing agreement so I hope we succeed and are able to achieve a vote today which the Council can endorse within a matter of weeks rather than years; but if we do, I suspect that it will be more a matter of luck than design, and I hope we can bear this in mind if we are able to work together with the other institutions of the European Union and achieve progress more effectively and rapidly in future years."
"Mr President, in an opinion by the Council' s Legal Service on the Water Framework Directive, the reduction of emissions down to nearly zero is not deemed to be legally binding."
"If we take the background emissions into account, this will indeed be impossible."
"In addition, in the case of natural gas extraction, for example, a small amount of mercury always ends up in the water."
"Therefore, if mercury is earmarked as a priority hazardous substance, it will be impossible to extract any natural gas in future."
"It appears preferable to me to have a list of hazardous priority substances, the emission levels of which are reduced by 95% to 99%, than to have just one substance whose emission levels are reduced by 100%."
"If the objective of reducing emission levels by 100% is upheld, it will in fact be impossible to identify priority hazardous substances."
"In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I have already criticised the method used for drafting a list of priority substances in water."
"The advantage of this method is speed, but this is counteracted by the fact that a great deal of information was missing at the assessment stage."
"Particularly with regard to metals, the outcome of the method applied can be called into question."
"Nickel is on the list because, in January 1990, it was marked as carcinogenic if it is inhaled in powder form."
"However, this was never proven with regard to nickel in water."
"It would be preferable to await the outcome of an extensive study into nickel in water, currently being carried out in Denmark."
"Furthermore, there are more indications that other metals should be placed on the list of priority substances, such as copper and arsenic."
"I appreciate how difficult it is to assess metals effectively, since the conditions which affect metals to a large extent, such as hardness and acidity, can vary greatly in the European Union."
"Maybe we should therefore opt for a regional, rather than a European, approach as far as metals are concerned."
"Mr President, it is my strong belief - and it has already been expressed by a number of fellow MEPs - that the Water Framework Directive is one of the most crucial pieces of environmental legislation which Parliament has adopted in the last few years."
"However, in order to meet the objective of sound water quality, the Framework Directive is not sufficient, and there is, therefore, a Commission proposal before us to draft a list of priority substances."
"Allow me to begin by saying that I welcome the Commission proposal and Mrs Breyer' s report with open arms."
"The list will be a good, first step on the road to the excellent quality of our water."
"I therefore share Mrs Breyer' s view that, if we want to live up to the obligation under the Directive, we may not, or cannot, make concessions on socio-economic grounds."
"Neither can we, or should we, allow ourselves to be guided by the fact that certain hazardous substances naturally occur in European water."
"I should like to make some observations with regard to three substances."
"I do so as a Dutch person, someone who also wants to be mindful of the fact that our surface water, from the Maas, for example, has to be turned into drinking water at the same time."
"There are three substances which I would highlight and would like to see included amongst the priority substances to be assessed: namely dyron, isoprothyron and symosyne."
"In fact, a recent study of European drinking water and water treatment plants has shown that, due to pollution of drinking water sources by pesticides, the concentration levels of these substances in our water are far too high in Europe, and that puts enormous pressure on the supply of drinking water."
"In my country, it is often the case that wells or springs, or the storage facility in the Biesbosch, have to be closed down."
"I hope that the Commission is willing to adopt the amendments that we have tabled in this respect, and I also make an urgent appeal to the Council to do the same."
"Mr President, Commissioner, when the Commission tabled this proposal, I thought this must mean the implementation of Article 16 of the Water Framework Directive, the definition of priority hazardous substances."
"Let us push this through as quickly as possible, I thought, so that it can be implemented without delay."
"However, when I examined the proposal more closely, I discovered that there was a third category. Alongside priority hazardous substances and regular hazardous substances, we also have the 'three-star' category."
"The Commission evidently has reason to believe that these may be priority hazardous substances but is not sure whether they should be classified as such at this stage."
"The introduction of a 'three-star' category, Commissioner, is surely inconsistent with the Water Framework Directive."
"I therefore believe that we must press for the removal of this 'three-star' category as soon as possible."
"Either they are priority hazardous substances and must be phased out or they are not."
"We cannot accept this intermediate category."
"It covers substances for which there are real indications of serious risk, as in the cases of lead, lead compounds and some herbicides and pesticides."
"The Commission clearly has certain grounds for assuming, Commissioner, that these may belong to the category of priority hazardous substances."
"For that reason, the Commission must eliminate this 'three-star' category as soon as possible."
"It is my view that this must be done before the normal review date."
"Now whether this means that it must be eliminated by 1 July 2002, as specified in the decision we adopted in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, or whether the Commission must table a draft containing supplementary provisions as soon as possible is a question that may be left open for the moment."
"The crux of the matter is that the 'three-star' category must disappear before the review."
"For this reason, may I ask the Commissioner directly whether she can guarantee that the Commission will deliver a final decision on the 'three-star' category as soon as possible, in other words during its present term of office, so that the Council and Parliament can affix their legislative seal of approval?"
"Mr President, the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision which we are debating must be understood within the broader framework of the Directive on water, since its immediate objective is to limit and reduce the pollution of the European aquatic ecosystem, by classifying 32 substances on the list of priority substances, of which only 11 are included in the legal category of hazardous priority substances."
"In my opinion, the list of hazardous priority substances appearing in the annex of the Commission' s proposal should not be altered, and it is necessary to keep it as the Commission drew it up."
"In order to achieve a consensus with regard to classification, cooperation between the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council is, of course, essential."
"In my opinion, only on the basis of the work carried out by the Commission in this field will we be able to create a system of classification which applies clear and comprehensible criteria for the identification of substances."
"We are all agreed on the desire to eradicate water pollution as soon as possible and to this end we must implement a double strategy: in the international field, the ratification of international commitments, especially the OSPAR and COMMPS conventions, although we do not consider it appropriate to expressly mention these agreements in the text of the proposal; at the level of the Member States, to guarantee that the Commission be provided with the necessary means for it to have exact knowledge of the situation of our water masses, so that it can monitor, in a detailed and constant way, the comparable situation between Member States in terms of the development of the quality of our waters."
"Furthermore, it is important to encourage the future Member States of the Union to combat pollution by taking on board the European objectives, especially those countries which share river basins with the European Union."
"Finally, I would like to highlight the exceptional circumstances of certain substances, such as Cadmium and Mercury, whose complete eradication is not possible at the moment, as indicated in Amendment No 2 of the report of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"Mr President, we have finite resources to expend on environmental improvement, even in the developed West."
"Money must be targeted where it will have the most beneficial environmental impact."
"Therefore I welcome this attempt to prioritise substances."
"Testing techniques are becoming more sensitive."
"Minuscule levels of contamination can be detected."
"It is therefore unrealistic to talk about elimination or cessation or even 'close to zero'."
"What does 'close to zero' mean, one, two, who knows?"
"Threshold levels must be set with regard to human health, not using abstract concepts."
"Secondly, the United Kingdom has a specific problem regarding the categorisation of fluoranthene, which is one of the family of polyaromatic hydrocarbons in the top category."
"We have one hundred thousand kilometres of cast-iron water-pipes lined with coal-tar, which contains some fluoranthene."
"No-one is suggesting that the levels present are a risk to health, but these pipes will have to be re-lined unless fluoranthene can be moved into the 'under review' part of the list, along with the other PAHs like naphthalene and anthrocene all of which, incidentally, the COMMPS procedure has found to be less toxic than fluoranthene."
"It would be a waste of resources to have to replace or reline all these water-pipes on the basis of this priority list when the resources could be better deployed in areas of real concern."
"Mr President, Commissioner, in the field of water policy, the final agreement of June 2000 lays down that the Commission should identify, within the class of hazardous substances, certain priority hazardous substances, whose emission, dumping or loss must cease or be gradually reduced within a time limit of 20 years."
"The European Commission has amended its proposal so that, by means of a group of experts, the priority hazardous substances should firstly be identified, and secondly a revision clause should introduced which would apply to some of them and, thirdly, the terminology and final text should be adapted."
"Of the 32 priority substances identified, 11 are proposed as priority hazardous substances, 11 more as priority substances under investigation - all of this within 4 years of the entry into force of the framework directive."
"There is no data on the toxicity, persistence or bioaccumulation of the remaining 10 substances."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, whose three amendments should be supported, points out that natural nutrients should not be classed as priority hazardous substances and, on the issue of plant protection products, there is already an established procedure: Directive 91/414, which should be respected, as well as the decision that it must be adapted at the same time, not before and not later."
"Lastly, the different definitions should be reorganised, such as the hydrographical district or the management of those districts, since that would prevent the various regulations from having differing effects on the same territories and problems, which could happen on applying the DMA, the COMMPS and the OSPAR agreements."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has responded very quickly, and I should also like to thank Mr Adams, who has performed sterling work in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"My thanks are also due to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"As we know, the legislation on chemical substances, the Water Framework Directive and the Directive on plant-protection products already refer to certain dangerous substances, defining and categorising them."
"The present proposal for a resolution and the list deriving from it must ultimately be brought into line with these existing directives."
"Because of its far-reaching economic and legal consequences for agriculture, and for all other sectors of the economy too, the Commission should therefore ensure that the necessary process of identifying these priority hazardous substances is based on hard scientific facts."
"It is imperative to act on a sound scientific basis rather than on the basis of suspicion."
"The Water Framework Directive has given us a time frame that extends to the year 2004."
"We now have a broad consensus on this issue throughout the EU."
"We need not be carried away by our emotions."
"Zero emissions is not a realistic aim."
"We need clarity, built on sound scientific foundations, if we are to take the right action."
"Water, ladies and gentlemen, is one of our most important and most sensitive assets."
"Let us not forget that."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Wallström."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"VOTE"
"Mr President, an error has crept into the printed Swedish version of Amendment No 5."
"In the phrase meaning, 'shall provide the experts with all the assistance necessary' , the word for 'provide' has disappeared."
"In the English version, the wording is correct."
"It would therefore be valuable if the English text were to form the basis for this vote."
"We will ensure that all language versions are brought into line with the English version."
"Mr President, I can confirm, as Mr Byrne indicated yesterday evening, that the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1 to 5."
"We note that there is an oral amendment to Amendment No 6."
"The Commission could not accept the original text of that amendment. However, the Commission can accept this amendment as orally amended in preference to Amendment No 5."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is actually very simple, and the Commissioner alluded to this a moment ago."
"I had tabled an amendment on behalf of my group, whereby I also wanted the information on official controls to be received by the European Parliament."
"I should like to expand on that by an oral amendment. Not only do I want the information to reach the competent authorities and the European Parliament, as stated in my amendment, I also want the Member States to have this information."
"If we adopt this oral amendment, the Commission will be willing to adopt the entire amendment, and I believe I can deliver a positive opinion of vote on this."
"(Parliament accepted the oral amendment)"
"(The President declared the common position approved as amended)"

"Before the vote:"
"Mr President, the Commission accepts the six amendments, subject to a minor reformulation, which makes a reference to the Nice Council foreseen in Amendment No 3, recital 4a, Amendment No 1."
"Mr President, with your permission I should like to move a technical oral amendment, which the Commissioner has just referred to, so that Amendment No 1 reads at the end, ""The action plan for mobility adopted by the Council on 14 December 2000 and also approved at the Nice European Council"", and Amendment No 3 deletes ""agreed at the Nice Summit"", because I have just referred to it in Amendment No 1."

"Amendment No 44:"
". (DE) Mr President, I beg to move that two separate votes be taken on Amendment No 44, because the first part of Amendment No 44 derives from a compromise, while the second part stems from an individual decision."
"For that reason I wish to propose a split vote on the first and second motions in this amendment."
"You put me in some difficulty, Mr Florenz."
"The Rules are very clear about the timing of requests for split votes."
"We have turned down other requests for split votes."
"Because you are the rapporteur it makes it difficult, but I cannot accept the request."
"It should have been in by 9 a.m. today."
"So we have to vote as it stands."

"Amendment No 7:"
"Our amendment relates to the issue of knowing whether or not we approve the European Central Bank' s policy."
"Last week, this policy changed between the time when the report by Mr von Wogau was written and the time when our amendments were written."
"Clearly, we disapproved of the policy the European Central Bank issued the week before last and not the policy that was issued last week."
"I would like Mr von Wogau to clarify whether he supports the policy issued this week or the policy issued the week before."
". (DE) Mr President, may I say to Mr Lipietz that I continue to hold the position on which the vote was taken with regard to these two parts."
"I am not absolutely sure, however, whether last week' s interest-rate cut was entirely consistent with this policy."
"I have to express my personal doubts on that."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE"
"Kessler and Perry report (A5-0088/2001)"
". (IT) I would like to thank Mr Perry, Mrs Kessler, the other members of the Committee on Petitions, the Legal Service and the entire Secretariat, whose work has contributed to the preparation of the valuable document on the future of the institution of the petition."
"The institution of the petition is still the only legal instrument which places the citizens in a direct relationship with the European institutions, and it is therefore the only means of bringing about the Europe of the citizens, who want to recognise the validity of something which is in the process of being created that will serve to further improve the quality of their lives."
"Relations between the citizens are founded on law, and, therefore, the definition of an institutional forum which safeguards the corpus of European law becomes important in terms of giving due value to the diversities which are the European Union's assets."
"The Committee on Petitions has the privilege not only of receiving the citizens' complaints and hearing them directly, if the citizens are present in person, but also of being the epitome of the Parliamentary representativeness which is the very essence of democracy."
"It is my opinion that, during this legislature, we must guarantee the European citizens who assail Parliament with their questions a Parliamentary initiative which not only has moral value but is also effective for the purposes of correct interpretation of Community law by all parts of the institutions, whether central or peripheral."
"Without prejudice to the specific, essential competence of the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance and the Court of Justice, the European Parliament must, in future, fully discharge its role of political legislator, developing effective legislative instruments through proposals to be incorporated into the Treaties as well as other avenues."
"A further measure could be the involvement of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, in order to progress to the practical implementation of this new instrument which will protect the citizens and their rights more effectively."
"- The right of the ordinary citizen to petition the European Parliament is one that was felt to be important enough to be part of the Treaties and I believe that it merits such standing."
"It is an extremely effective way for anyone to make direct contact with the heart of the European institutions on matters which may not be of political importance but which are of consequence to European citizens and residents."
"Some may question the benefit of petitioning Parliament, but the recent success of David Petrie, who had received support from the Petitions Committee and the European Parliament as a whole for his petition, in the Italian courts in gaining equal recognition for non-Italian lecturers highlight what a petition can bring about."
"My co-rapporteur and I have kept this very much in mind in our report."
"We have pushed for this right to be made easier to access and exercise, not only by exploiting new technologies and media but by reform of the procedures which govern petitions once they are received by Parliament and passed on to other institutions."
"The current system for petitioning allows petitions to be submitted electronically, but only as an initial form."
"Follow-up is done via post, and this can obviously create delays in the preliminary stage of proceedings, well before it comes before the committee."
"Alternatives such as electronic signatures and electronic correspondence need to be investigated if Parliament wants to keep up with the increasing number of petitions that are submitted."
"Clearer rules for treatment of petitions once they have been deemed admissible are also urgently required."
"The Petitions Committee can currently ask the Commission for information on a particular subject, but has very little say over the time the Commission or any other institution can take to provide an answer to the committee's questions, or even whether MEPs can have access to those answers once received."
"For example, we in the Petitions Committee are currently considering petitions on the Lloyd's organisation, but are denied the opportunity to view the response given by the UK government to the Commission's questionnaire on the matter."
"If the European institutions and Member State governments are serious about transparency in their working methods, then their treatment of petitions needs review."
"It does not help to see the very behaviour alleged in a petition replicated in its treatment."
"Member States in particular need to pay more serious attention to citizens claiming their European rights."
"The right to petitions should aim to strengthen the concept of European citizenship, protecting the four freedoms of those in the Union and ensuring that European legislation is properly and efficiently implemented."
"As we move into the 21st century, with a Union of possible 28 members and an increasing body of legislation at a European level, the role and process of the petition needs to change in order to maintain its importance and usefulness."
"Maaten report (A5-0162/2001)"
"Mr President, conciliation has led to a number of adjustments being made to the report which can be deemed positive, such as the reduction in the permitted tar content and the setting of ceilings for nicotine and carbon monoxide content levels."
"However, it is to be deplored that this Directive has no legal basis."
"In addition, attention should be drawn to the contradiction that, while restraints are being imposed on the sale of a lawfully permitted product, tobacco growing is still being heavily subsidised."
"The objective of this Directive, namely to protect human health, cannot be achieved by taking excessively protective measures, the effect of which on the consumer has not been proven in any way."
"As a body that is responsible for policy, we should not content ourselves with simply papering over the cracks."
"Mr President, I have not had much sleep over the last few nights because of the Italian elections and because I was trying to follow the results, but I did, however, manage to dream that I was in a Western."
"The two cowboys facing each other were Mr Maaten and Mr Blokland."
"Like heroes such as John Wayne or Pecos Bill, they had challenged each other to a duel."
"At midday - of course - they drew their guns, but, just as they were about to fire, the scene was interrupted by someone telling Mr Maaten to take his cigarette out of his mouth before firing."
"Mr Maaten took his cigarette out of his mouth and said: 'You are right, for I am tabling a document which seeks to make European citizens smoke less' ."
"That convinced me to vote for the Maaten report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am firmly convinced of the importance of provisions designed to eliminate the use of misleading descriptors in the labelling of tobacco products."
"It must be clear to consumers that they are intentionally exposing themselves to a health risk."
"Palliative descriptors such as 'low-tar' or 'light' merely salve people' s consciences and obscure the fact that these products are not the least bit healthier than any others."
"Sadly, however, the Union' s policy is ambivalent."
"On the one hand, it takes a resolute stand for the protection of public health by means of measures such as the present directive, while on the other hand it spends a billion euros on subsidising tobacco-growing in the Community."
"The Union must set itself the aim of pursuing a rational policy."
"However, it is surely well-nigh impossible to explain away this particular contradiction to the European public."
"A reservation is made in respect of the legal basis of this report."
"However, I am voting in favour of the report, since the content is reasonable."
"Bowis, Bushill-Matthews, Callanan, Chichester, Dover, Elles, Evans, Jonathan, Goodwill, Harbour, Helmer, Jackson, Parish, Perry, Provan, Sturdy and Tannock (PPE-DE), in writing."
"We support the intention of the Common Position to secure progressively lower levels of smoking across the EU, and welcome the ban on misleading labelling."
"In particular we welcome the commitment to review the subsidy to EU tobacco growers: we urge that this review, prompted by Conservative MEPs, will lead to this subsidy being phased out very rapidly."
"We are however against the decision to ban the manufacture of high tar cigarettes for export outside the EU."
"It is not for the EU to try to dictate health policy across the globe; the only consequence of such a ban will be to export the jobs of those involved, notably 1000 jobs in Southampton, 500 jobs in Darlington and 200 in Nottingham, while achieving nothing on the issue of health."
"As a footnote, we would like to see a real example being set by EU institutions by calling for a smoking ban to be enforced throughout their buildings."
"With regard to cigarette smoking in general, I believe it is very important that the EU brings forward legislation that prohibits any tobacco product being marketed and targeted towards minors."
"It is clearly the case that if a person chooses to smoke at a younger age, then it is more difficult to kick the habit of cigarette smoking at a later age."
"We all know the damage that cigarette smoking does to people' s health each year within the European Union."
"That is why it is so important that warnings are displayed on cigarette packs outlining the public health consequences for a person' s health as a result of cigarette smoking."
"That is why I support key provisions in this directive today concerning the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco products, including the following:-"
"Thirty percent of the front of each cigarette pack and 40% of the back of each cigarette pack will in the future display public health warnings."
"Misleading terms such as 'Light' or 'Mild' , which in one way or another seek to give the impression that one cigarette does less damage than another, will also be banned."
"The European Union will also impose legal obligations on manufacturers to list all the ingredients included in particular cigarettes."
"However, this is only part of a broader package of legislation which the European Union is going to bring forward in the field of cigarette smoking."
"However, once again the European Union is going to have to be aggressive in the legislation that it brings forward to promote a no-smoking campaign among adults."
"I strongly support the implementation of broader educational programmes designed to prevent young people from taking up smoking."
"Under the Amsterdam Treaty, the European Parliament does have the power of co-decision in the field of consumer protection and public health matters."
"I am fully confident that the European Parliament will invoke our powers under this Treaty to ensure a rigorous implementation of regulatory proposals to reduce cigarette smoking in Europe in the short to medium term."
"(PPE-DE), in writing. (DE) I cannot support the draft directive in its present form."
"Article 3 lays down the concentration ceilings."
"Since these ceilings are supposed to apply to all cigarettes manufactured in the EU, the products destined for export will also become subject to these ceilings on or before 1 January 2007."
"This directive is engaging in overkill."
"The Union should not regulate the manufacture of products for export to countries outside the EU to such an extent."
"In the federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate alone, the tobacco industry achieves an annual turnover of some DEM 1.5 million."
"In the largest city in my region 1 250 people are directly employed by a tobacco company."
"Its suppliers in the region, such as printers and packaging manufacturers, are all small and medium-sized businesses."
"Were the directive to enter into force and the ceilings also to apply to cigarettes intended for export, thousands of jobs would be lost in that structurally fragile region alone."
"Whilst cigarette manufacturers are certainly required to inform and warn consumers, it must nevertheless remain possible to go on exporting products with higher concentrations to countries where higher ceilings apply."
"The serious restriction of export activity that results from this new directive will be severely detrimental to the European economy."
". (DE) Smokers incontestably run a greater risk of contracting lung cancer than non-smokers."
"This is a well-known fact, of which all smokers are only too well aware."
"The fight against cancer is one of the main challenges facing today' s society."
"I myself am actively involved, both inside and outside Parliament, in the struggle against breast cancer."
"However, as I have already emphasised in my comments on the report at the first and second readings, the prohibition methods prescribed in the joint text entail the imposition of unreasonable obligations on the European tobacco industry with no thought for the jobs they will cost and no prospect of their paying dividends by inducing more people in the EU to give up smoking."
"The proposal that EU-manufactured cigarettes be subject to the same tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide ceilings whether they are intended for domestic consumption or export is downright perverse."
"It is certainly a noble intention to want to take responsibility for the health of smokers in non-EU countries."
"But if this sense of mission leads to the tobacco industry relocating its manufacturing plants to the countries for which its cigarettes are intended, all we shall have achieved will be the loss of European jobs."
"In my little country alone, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, such a measure would result in the relocation of 12% of our cigarette-production capacity."
"That surely cannot be allowed to happen."
"For the fight against lung cancer, I am in favour of a targeted information campaign with adequate budgetary funding; it would be directed primarily at young people, making them aware of the danger that smoking poses to their health."
"But I am opposed to all the excessively radical measures contained in the joint text and cannot therefore endorse the report in its present form."
". (DE) Mr President, I am firmly convinced of the importance of provisions designed to eliminate the use of misleading descriptors in the labelling of tobacco products."
"It must be clear to consumers that they are intentionally exposing themselves to a health risk."
"Palliative descriptors such as 'low-tar' or 'light' merely salve people' s consciences and obscure the fact that these products are not the least bit healthier than any others."
"Sadly, however, the Union' s policy is ambivalent."
"On the one hand, it takes a resolute stand for the protection of public health by means of measures such as the present directive, while on the other hand it spends a billion euros on subsidising tobacco-growing in the Community."
"The Union must set itself the aim of pursuing a rational policy."
"However, it is surely well-nigh impossible to explain away this particular contradiction to the European public."
"I fully support the compromise agreement on a draft directive on the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco products."
"This tough new anti-smoking legislation covers all tobacco products and lays down maximum levels of tar, carbon monoxide and nicotine."
"I strongly back these new laws which will transform the way cigarettes are sold across Europe and alter the public perception of smoking."
"I wholeheartedly welcome the use of picture warnings on packets, graphically illustrating the harmful effects of long-term smoking on health, as they do in Canada."
"A picture is worth a thousand words."
"If shock tactics like that help get the message across and save lives, then I'm all in favour."
"Overall, this ground-breaking legislation will raise public awareness about the health risks from smoking and finally shatter the myth that one type of cigarette is less damaging to health than another."
"The tobacco giants hired some of the best lobbyists money could buy to fight this legislation every step of the way, but the European Parliament was not for turning."
"After the industry managed to overturn Europe's ban on tobacco advertising on a legal technicality, we were more determined than ever to make sure that this latest legislation finally reached the statute book to spell out the dangers of smoking and save thousands of lives."
". (DE) For the following reasons I have voted against the outcome of the conciliation procedure on the tobacco directive:"
"According to the joint text, the export to non-EU countries of cigarettes with more than ten milligrams of condensate, more than one milligram of nicotine and more than 10 milligrams of carbon monoxide is to be prohibited."
"The result would be a massive fall in exports of cigarettes from the EU and hence the loss of tens of thousands of jobs in the EU."
"Such a ban will serve no purpose at all, because the cigarettes will then be produced outside the EU."
"But jobs in our countries will be lost."
"The EU has no authority to impose such a ban."
"This is not about transactions in the single internal market."
"The anti-tobacco zealots should not act as if the export of tobacco products were something akin to handing out potassium cyanide."
"The EU is acting inconsistently here, given that it subsidises both the growing and the export of tobacco to the tune of one billion euros."
"By imposing an export ban, the EU is setting itself up as a global health freak."
"This is an arrogant and disparaging way to treat the customs and practices of other countries."
"The right approach would be to forge ahead with the work that has been started within the World Health Organization on uniform standards for tobacco products."
"Unilateral action by the EU will prove fruitless."
"Paulsen report (A5-0136/2001)"
"Mr President, when I was trying to decide how to vote on this recommendation on animal nutrition, I could not fail to seek enlightenment from two of the animals I have at home: my two cats."
"You know that I have two pet cats at home - called Lulù and Frifri - whom I feed regularly."
"I did not know how to talk to them and whether they would reply, but I have to say that chance came to my aid."
"In fact, in order to give them a nicer meal, I had bought tins of a different type of cat food to that which I usually buy, and put them down for the cats to eat."
"Well, Mr President, I swear to you that - even though they were hungry - neither of Mr Fatuzzo's pussy cats ate any of the meat from the two tins: neither Lulù nor Frifri."
"This was their way of telling me: 'You see, what we eat is important!"
"It is right for inspections to be carried out on feedingstuffs and so you must vote for the motion' ."
"And that is what I have done."
"Evans report (A5-0115/2001)"
"Mr President, I dropped off to sleep for a moment during the vote just now, and I dreamt of Mr Fatuzzo the scientist."
"That is right: instead of launching himself into politics in support of pensioners, Mr Fatuzzo had become a nuclear scientist, for, you know, I used to love maths and physics."
"So I asked him: 'Have you enjoyed your life as a scientist?'"
"'Ah,' he said, 'I came to the United States of America: they pay me a lot of money, I have invented lots of things and I have received the Nobel Prize' ."
"'I truly envy you, Mr Fatuzzo the Nobel Prize-winner,' I replied."
"'I, on the other hand, am a simple Member of the European Parliament."
"But tell me, how did you become a Nobel Prize-winner?'"
"He replied: 'By not staying in Italy, where I was unable to study the way I wanted to, but by going to the United States."
"If I had been able to move around within Europe, I would have stayed in Europe rather than emigrating to the United States."
"Therefore, you must vote for the mobility of researchers in Europe!'"
"The text that we have discussed and voted upon calls on the Member States to foster the mobility of people undertaking a course of study, a period of training, voluntary work or work as a teacher or trainer in another Member State, whether under a Community programme or not."
"The European Parliament naturally welcomed this type of proposal."
"Parliament believed, however, that some amendments were necessary in order to improve the quality of the text, and, above all, to extend the scope of the proposal to include researchers, something I consider to be extremely important."
"Some amendments along these lines were tabled and adopted at first reading."
"Unfortunately, however, the European Commission rejected those relating to researchers for legal reasons."
"As rapporteur for the Sixth Research and Development Framework Programme, I can naturally only deplore this move."
"I hope that the conference on the mobility of researchers and scientists, which is due to be held under the Belgian Presidency, will enable us to make progress in this area."
"The creation of a European area of research involves collaboration by researchers and scientists from all corners of the globe so that advances can be made in research, which is in the interests of all citizens."
"That is why it is crucial to combat the various obstacles to their mobility."
"Since this can only be done within the framework of this proposal, another solution will have to be found."
"I am committed to working towards this."
"Furthermore, like the rapporteur, I would like to pay tribute to the hard work of the French Presidency on reaching the most ambitious common position possible which could command general assent."
"The amendments that have been adopted, therefore, cover some essential aspects of mobility and seek to improve or eliminate administrative, financial or social difficulties."
"With regard to the practical measures that Member States will be taking, linguistic and cultural initiatives are proposed, for example, in order to prepare those who will be travelling abroad for their new lifestyle, improved access to information on mobility and practical difficulties that may be encountered and financial aid in the form of grants, benefits or loans."
"Nationals of candidate countries and third countries, who are legally resident in the EU, will also be able to benefit from the provisions of the recommendation."
"I am pleased that the report has stressed that all types of qualifications gained in other Member States need to be recognised."
"All too often, Member States have a negative attitude to this and create unacceptable problems in an area in which individuals should enjoy free movement, thus preventing people who travel from making the most of their experience."
"Mr Evans also drew attention to the fact that, since Parliament' s first reading, the Council agreed an Action Plan on Mobility - a 'toolbox' of 40 measures, which complements the recommendation."
"Some amendments were then tabled at second reading to take account of this development."
"I sincerely hope that these measures will soon become reality."
"Madam President, I strongly support this excellent report by my Labour colleague, Robert Evans."
"It offers yet further proof of Labour's commitment to create a Europe for our citizens."
"The aim of the programme is to allow people to take advantage of moving across Europe by extending mobility within the EU for students, young volunteers and teachers."
"This offers educational opportunities and encourages people to take on active role in society across Europe."
"It is a crucial development following last year's Action Plan of concrete measures identifying obstacles to mobility."
"It is also an important measure for the efficient functioning of the European single market."
"The Labour Government is determined to make the single market work for British people, not just for business."
"By introducing greater steps towards student and volunteer mobility, people will feel more confident to work and travel not just across Britain but also right across Europe."
"Such a scheme can inspire civic values, is highly educational and an excellent advertisement for the European Union among its most important citizens, the young."
"This is vital when we remember that, in Britain at least, turnout among young people at the last European elections was among the lowest in the EU."
"Practical experience of Europe, not media prattle on Europe, is a far more reliable and inspiring source of knowledge on Europe for young people."
"Florenz report (A5-0146/2001)"
"Mr President, this report rightly seeks to limit the use of hazardous substances, including lead, in electrical and electronic equipment."
"However, I would like to inform Mr Florenz that, where lead is concerned - as the Italian proverb says - it is better to have leaden feet, that is to go slowly."
"I am saying this because, apart from anything else, many politicians and ministers in Europe have their pockets full of lead: so much so that they are unable to stand up from their chairs!"
"Well then, metaphors aside, I feel we should not be in a hurry to eliminate all the harmful substances from electrical and electronic equipment either if there are no less harmful alternatives with which to replace them."
"I therefore support this report, with the proviso, however, that the ban on these substances is introduced gradually."
"Florenz report (A5-0148/2001)"
"Mr President, by imposing recycling standards on waste electrical and electronic equipment, the European Parliament is boosting efforts to make this industry more ecologically sound."
"It is essentially the environment that has won through in the battle between the supporters of an innovative industry in electrical and electronic goods and the conventional manufacturers who slammed on the brakes so they could delay the date on which they would be responsible for recycling waste."
"Although we can congratulate the rapporteur on having chosen to deal with these products, we regret that the Commission has not taken the opportunity to deal with electrical and electronic waste and chemical substances associated with it. With regard to this second report, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance deeply regrets that, out of 70 substances, only two are to be banned, when breast milk is sometimes contaminated with chemical substances from these products, such as brominated products, to levels which exceed WHO standards."
"Despite this harsh comment, the primary innovation of this report is that it places individual responsibility on the manufacturers, as they will become financially responsible for their products, both products that are already on the market and future products."
"The environmental considerations contained in the report are gaining ground, and there is growing political awareness of the danger of increasing amounts of industrial waste, particularly electrical and electronic waste."
"Ultimately, now that this has to happen, everyone will benefit at the end of the day: manufacturers, consumers and the environment."
"The report by Mr Florenz on waste electrical and electronic equipment has therefore benefited from some substantial environmental gestures, which confirm that industry in Europe must work with the aim of creating an environmentally-minded culture, for citizens and for politicians."
"Mr President, the night of the announcement of the results of the Italian elections, I could not keep awake between one announcement and the next and so I went to sleep several times."
"After my dream about Mr Maaten, which I related to you just now, having just read the Florenz report - in preparation for the debate - I dropped off again and saw Mr Florenz himself, bustling about in person on a platform, disposing of some of the electrical and electronic waste referred to in his document."
"He was exhausted and covered in sweat."
"'I have been sorting waste for reuse for three days and three nights now,' he said in my dream."
"'Don't worry,' I said to him, 'I will vote for your report because I am convinced that it is right to reuse electrical and electronic waste."
"But now you must come with me to the Pensioners' Party, where we can dance and travel and where there are lots of widows with whom we can have a much more enjoyable time than you are having here!'"
". (FR) In Strasbourg, the European Parliament debated the report tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on waste electrical and electronic equipment."
"The proposed directive specifies that the responsibility for electrical and electronic waste, which is approximately 16 kg per capita in each of the 15 EU Member States, an amount which, according to forecasts, is set to double over the next 12 years, lies either with the manufacturer or the original importer."
"Luxembourg, due to the specific nature of its position, has hardly any producers in the true sense but, in the main, has importers."
"Product distribution is often organised in such a way that a general importer is responsible for the area of Belgium and Luxembourg."
"This importer is usually based in Belgium and not in Luxembourg."
"If Belgium has to place responsibility upon a single general importer, Luxembourg will have to place responsibility upon the countless businesses which receive product deliveries from this general importer."
"Furthermore, parallel imports of products outside these established distribution channels are reaching a much higher level in Luxembourg than in other countries."
"It follows that, in Luxembourg, commercial enterprises upon whom responsibility is placed are generally small businesses and are, in any case, smaller than their equivalents in other countries."
"This characteristic, specific to Luxembourg, means that particular attention must be paid to simplifying the administration involved in managing recycling and recovery funding systems that are to be implemented."
"In some areas, it is preferable, therefore, that the directive should give enough freedom to Member States for them to be able to implement appropriate solutions."
"Companies, especially in built-up areas, do not usually have the facilities to store vast amounts of waste."
"The requirement for businesses to collect waste must, therefore, not be mandatory - it should remain voluntary."
"If companies cannot collect waste, other systems, such as recycling sites, for example, must be made available to consumers."
"The cost of collecting waste, if it were mandatory, would be too high for many businesses."
"The directive also deals with the financing of electrical and electronic products which will already be on the market before the directive comes into force, the manufacturers of some of which no longer exist."
"Some appliances, such as refrigerators or televisions for example, have an average life cycle of 20 years."
"The directive must give Member States a choice of the means to implement in order to finance recycling of these appliances."
"It will, therefore, be possible to agree with the Member State some incentives for consumers, such as free collection of waste that is currently stored on their premises."
"These incentives have been provided in countries which already have free collection systems."
"(Speech cut short pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"We Moderates consider this directive to be urgently needed for protecting the environment."
"Moreover, the directive' s basic principles of producer responsibility for future products and of opportunities for consumers to choose environmentally sound products are important."
"The wording of Article 7 is somewhat unclear."
"We have interpreted it as follows: the financing referred to in Paragraph 2 applies to scrapping in quite general terms."
"It gives the Member States the opportunity, over a ten-year period, to opt for collective financing, for example taxes, as an alternative."
"This also needs to cover what is referred to as historical waste."
"After this period of time, derogations will only be possible if they have been approved by the Commission."
"With the above interpretation, we voted in favour of the report."
"I support these measures which introduce tough new recycling rules allowing consumers and retailers to take back waste electric and electronic goods free of charge and encouraging manufacturers to take responsibility."
"The aim of these rules is to encourage consumers getting rid of old, worn out electrical and electronic goods to return these items through new local public collection points or retailer take-back schemes, rather than to throw away their old hairdryers, fridges and TVs."
"We live in a throw away society, with worn out computers, kettles, fridges and freezers flooding into the waste stream at an unprecedented pace."
"Consumers across Europe must play their part in stemming the tide of waste from electronic goods."
"All this means is a small change in people's daily habits."
"Taking old radios and hoovers back for recycling will be like going to the bottle bank or collecting old newspapers, rather than dumping them in the bin."
"For manufacturers, it means financing recycling schemes with public collection points, retailer take-back schemes and treatment, recovery and disposal systems."
"Responsibility does not begin and end with the production of electronic goods, but electronics manufacturers should undertake responsibility for the after-life of their products."
"Such a scheme is an important step towards greening up the European Union."
"Yet again, this is proof of Europe's commitment towards creating a healthier, safer environment for our citizens."
"Breyer report (A5-0135/2001)"
"Superior stabat lupus longeque inferior agnus."
"I am sure you are familiar with this Latin fable, Mr President: 'A Wolf was drinking at a spring on a hillside."
"On looking up he saw a Lamb just beginning to drink lower down ...'"
"Why have I quoted this Latin fable?"
"Because I consider it quite right that we should not throw hazardous substances into rivers."
"In the same way that the water flowed downstream from the wolf to the lamb, the European rivers flow from faraway places into the Mediterranean Sea and into our other seas. Therefore, It is right, as this report requests, to involve the candidate countries so that they do not pollute upstream the springs and the rivers crossing Europe."
"Alavanos report (A5-0299/2000)"
"Mr President, this report is deals with promoting innovation with new technologies."
"As I have already said before on several occasions, I am highly in favour of computers and the Internet and all those newfangled gadgets that young people like so much."
"I regret having had to spend many Easter and Christmas breaks retyping all the electronic files which I had accidentally deleted by pressing the wrong key."
"This has made me a little hostile towards new technologies."
"However, my daughter, Elisabetta, has convinced me that they are very useful, for she has employed them in her political life as well."
"I therefore support this report, although I do hope that children will be brought up to be good, responsible people and not just good users of computers."
". (FR) If this report contained nothing other than statements of good intentions, asserting the need for new technologies to be widely used, particularly in the education system, we could have voted in favour, although good intentions still do not guarantee a policy."
"However, the intention behind these statements ""to provide companies with the financial and technical help required"" came through in several paragraphs."
"Since we do not wish to support grants to private businesses, even those that are not made openly, we abstained from voting on this report."
"New technology in European education should not create a fresh divide between the national languages and a privileged language of communication."
"Europe boasts a collection of relatively small and predominantly monolingual regions."
"This is not America, where migrants who all live in one and the same community yet speak different languages by origin, need to adopt the official language in order to be able to communicate with one other."
"In Europe, language differences within one region often reflect differences between rich and poor, powerful and powerless, winners and losers."
"For centuries, large multicultural states have attempted to impose a different language on their inhabitants."
"That was the language of the country' s capital, which was also used outside the capital by businesspeople, officials and the military."
"Whilst the privileged adopted the language protected by the government, workers and farmers continued to speak their own national languages."
"That is mainly how linguistic conflict started and large states disintegrated."
"Even today, it is still a requirement for education and government to be in the citizen' s own language in all the regions where the language border does not coincide with the country' s border, or with the internal borders of autonomous regions."
"If we do not want a young generation to be divided artificially between the privileged and the underprivileged, we need to defend the equality of languages."
"Perry report (A5-0302/2000)"
"Mr President, the conclusions of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on page 21 of Mr Perry's report, which also deals with the White Paper on the use of electronic equipment, tell us that it ""... would be ... appreciated if employers showed greater willingness to take on older employees"" who, throughout their lives, have acquired the new skills that the modern world offers us every day."
"Clearly, I support this conclusion."
"I fervently hope that this report will mean that elderly people who have studied and improved their skills will be able to find employment more easily."
"Mauro report (A5-0152/2001)"
"Mr President, as you know, Mr Mauro is Italian like me, and, like me, he also belongs to the European People's Party."
"I was therefore very willing to go and listen to one of his meetings on this report."
"At one point, he said: 'Can you see this glass here in front of me?'"
"'Yes,' we all thought, 'we can see it.'"
"'This glass,' continued Mr Mauro, 'is used for drinking water."
"However, I could smash it over Mr Fatuzzo's head and that would be an improper use.'"
"This is exactly what he said - my head is still sore from the memory - and he explained why."
"Because new techniques, computers and the Internet, can be used improperly, just as - and here he illustrated the point - the glass could be used improperly. Truly, however, I would beg him not to break a computer over my head because that would be the end of my explanations of vote."
"Education falls within the competence of the Member States and we reject any attempt to change this established fact."
"To call this division of responsibilities into question is to support the increasing array of liberal-market choices appearing in education issues."
"The reports therefore clearly take this approach, with, in particular, the shift from 'contents' towards 'skills' ."
"In other words, qualifications gained as part of a degree are being overshadowed in favour of 'flexible' skill sets, for which companies alone are responsible."
"This approach backs up the logic of liberal counter-reforms that are taking hold in many countries."
"In the same way, from this viewpoint, 'life-long learning' goes hand in hand with drastic cutbacks in initial training and playing down the role of public training institutions - in favour of 'virtual' , distance learning that is increasingly market-oriented."
"On the other hand, information and ICT technologies must support the right to common, public education for all, which is of a high level and good quality."
"Financial investment in this area will not achieve this if all the funds ploughed into education for the last 15 years are also drastically reduced."
"We cannot, therefore, vote in favour of these reports."
"The issue of new technologies and their application in education naturally generates considerable interest and is extremely important."
"As we all know, however, just giving every school a computer is not going to solve the problem."
"It is essential not just to enable schools to use appropriate technological infrastructures, both in terms of programmes and equipment, but the utmost attention must also be paid to teacher training. We must also create conditions that enable each and every student to have access to these technologies and to know how to use them."
"It is nevertheless important to emphasise that this Commission communication is very loosely defined and, in practice, is dependent on other, existing programmes, which have their own objectives. This initiative, therefore, does little more than propose to monitor the progress made in each Member State, rather than envisaging actions that could actually change the present situation and influence the future direction of widespread Internet use."
"For a country such as Portugal, unless there is a substantial reduction in the cost of access to the new technologies, and unless the standard of living of the most deprived families improves considerably, it will be hard to ensure that a high percentage of children and young people have equal opportunity of access to the new technologies."
"von Wogau report (A5-0165/2001)"
"The debate that has just been held on the broad economic guidelines for 2001 was dominated by great uncertainty, which is, after all, not surprising since the aim of the exercise was virtually unattainable."
"The aim was to define common economic guidelines at European level, whereas every country has different requirements."
"This uncertainty was further increased on 10 May 2001, when the European Central Bank lowered the key interest rate by a quarter of a point."
"Even though Christian Noyer, the Vice-President of the ECB, told Parliament' s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on 2 May that he was optimistic about price stability in the euro zone, even though Wim Duisenberg, the President of the ECB, has just presented a report saying he too was confident about the prospects for growth, even though all these factors combined lulled us into thinking that interest rates were stable, by lowering interest rates, the ECB has just contradicted to some extent the explanations given the day before."
"The main effects of this move would have been a drop in the euro' s value - a further drop - and a strong hike in the stock markets, without any major advantages for growth."
"The ECB lives in a permanently paradoxical situation, from which it is not about to escape."
"It is impossible to adopt a single measure that would suit the situation of all the Member States."
"For example, Mr Blokland has just explained to us that the latest drop in interest rates was greeted with some confusion in the Netherlands, where inflation is now at its lowest level in 20 years, and where everyone expected rates would, in actual fact, have to be increased."
"The same holds true for other countries in the euro zone."
"In these circumstances, any step taken by the ECB highlights the differences, which are immediately translated by the international operators as obstacles to the viability of a common monetary policy, without taking all the other variables into account."
"Thanks to the euro, we feel as if we are constantly on the verge of losing public confidence."
"Mr President, point 8 of the conclusions of Mr von Wogau's report calls upon the European States to adapt their pension systems to Europe's economy."
"On this point, which is the centre of my political life, I would like to stress the fact that we need to find a balance between State budgetary restrictions and giving all citizens a dignified life, not just pensioners and the elderly but young people as well."
"I oppose all the measures which give a minimal monthly cheque to the elderly - although this is a good thing which is right - because we should also be giving such a cheque to young people who do not have the means to support themselves and live, and we should be giving one to those who have paid contributions too."
"In short, there needs to be a proper balance between money and the social life to which we all have the right."
". (FR) We voted against the report on the broad economic policy guidelines of the Member States and the Community in 2001, since these guidelines are entirely geared to the interests and wishes of major employers and are not in the interests of workers."
"Even with the amendments, such as those which express environmental concerns or the amendment which proposes introducing a Tobin-style tax on the movement of capital, the text still glorifies the pro-employer, anti-worker policies conducted in the Member States and is approving of the way that the economy is currently run."
"We abstained on the last amendment so that our votes will not be confused with those from the most staunch supporters of the capitalist system, who have voted against the report because they do not even accept capital being taxed by the tiny amount represented by the Tobin tax."
"To claim, however, that movement of speculative capital will be controlled by this tax or that it will reduce the volatility of the financial markets is all just a smokescreen."
"The huge number of redundancies in some of the largest companies in the European Union proves that it is not just speculative use by large investors that harms the working classes and society - it is capital full stop as well as the economic system, which is driven by profit and the capitalist thirst for making money."
"What the workers need are measures to protect them from employers' greed, not symbolic gestures, which actually justify the capitalist management of the economy."
"We will be voting against this new liberal theme tune."
"The 'structural reform' of the labour market that it advocates translates as increased insecurity in employment contracts."
"This is basically the policy conducted throughout Europe and, far from wanting to ""continue and speed this up"" , we want instead to put an end to it."
"We would not be against creating an ""appropriate environment to foster investment"" as long as this did not involve making even more profit, when it is private consumption by employees that enables investment to be sustained."
"As for retirement, we are still on the front line, battling against these alleged 'reforms' , which, in actual fact, signify a move towards private insurance schemes."
"We are also totally opposed to the liberalisation of the electricity and gas sectors and are, in fact, in favour of establishing a major European public service."
"We are also voting against this report because it has been written in hypocritical, anti-democratic waffle and its dominant theme is that of an 'economy of ignorance' ."
"Given the situation of the British railways and the electricity industry in California, how can we possibly forget that privatisation is not synonymous with efficiency?"
"Not even the prospect of a slowdown in the European and world economies, which has been confirmed by the spring macroeconomic forecast, is making the Commission change its recommendations for the broad economic guidelines for 2001."
"The remedy that it is proposing has remained unchanged over the years: a reduction in public spending, wage moderation and an acceleration of the structural reform process laid down in the Lisbon Strategy, specifically in terms of liberalising the labour market and making it more flexible."
"The Commission is not interested in anything apart from price stability and fulfilling the criteria of the Stability Pact."
"Even for Portugal, whose prospects indicate greater difficulties in reaching the European growth level and higher unemployment, especially amongst women and young people, a country in which workers are being punished by higher inflation and the concomitant loss of buying power, despite still having the lowest wages in the European Union, the remedy is the same: wage moderation, making it easier for employers to make redundancies, and working towards the objectives of the Stability Pact, with a greater reduction in public spending in the 2002 budget."
"The von Wogau report endorses the approach outlined by the Commission and highlights the unique proposal to call the ""European internal market"" the ""euro zone"" instead."
"The rapporteur endorses the blind quest for price stability at the expense of economic growth."
"He disregards the importance of public investment and calls for the ""the potential for (public) spending cuts"" to be ""fully exploited"" ."
"He regrets the fact that the Stockholm summit did not make progress on liberalising the gas and electricity sectors and ""stresses that liberalisation in the outstanding sectors is essential"" ."
"He ""stresses the need to continue reform of labour markets"" and expresses the need to reform pensions and health systems. Issues of employment are completely ignored."
"We therefore had no choice but to vote against this report."
". (DE) The present report on the Commission' s recommendation for the broad guidelines of the economic policies of the Member States and the Community in 2001 states that the supreme goal of European economic policy is to make the European Union into the most competitive and dynamic economic area in the world by 2010."
"That is an unobjectionable aim in principle, but it is surely no mere oversight that makes the author omit the rest of this sentence as formulated at the Lisbon summit, for it went on to speak of an economic area with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion."
"That is the very heart of the matter."
"A cyclical economic slowdown is rightly identified in the report, but once again the neoliberal solutions are trotted out: supply-side economic policies, liberalisation, reduction of government debt and wage restraint on the part of employees in pay negotiations."
"Although some important points that were not contained in the report on the European economic situation by the same author have now been incorporated, such as the need for harmonisation in certain areas of tax law, special emphasis on the importance of strengthening SMEs and consideration of environmental factors, some vital elements are still missing."
"Unless domestic demand is strengthened, in other words unless people' s purchasing power is increased, a sustained upturn will be impossible to achieve."
"That is why foremost priority must be attached to the creation of new jobs."
"We urgently need to redistribute work by devising every possible means of shortening employees' working hours, to ensure that everyone who earns an income from employment is integrated on an equitable basis into national insurance and pension schemes, to show greater commitment to education and training and to alter the course of public investment policy."
"As long as these imperatives are not incorporated into the strategy for the development of European economic policy, we cannot give it our approval."
"The European Parliament report adopts the Commission' s proposals on the application of the Stability Pact, with economic policy guidelines for an even stricter anti-employment package."
"It describes continuing wage restraint and greater flexibility on the labour markets as positive factors while, at the same time, recommending stricter measures for workers due to the slowdown and lack of vigour in the European economy and the downward revision in the rate of growth in the ÅU from the original estimate of 3% to an average of 2.7% in 2001."
"The Commission considers that the process of promoting more flexible forms of work should be encouraged and that efforts should continue to relax the existing restrictive legal framework on the protection of work even more, i.e. in order to allow more 'economic' uncontrolled mass redundancies."
"Large companies have already applied this measure and made huge redundancies on the pretext of the slowdown in the rate of growth of the economy and have restructured production and staff, with the result that over 250 000 redundancies have been announced in recent weeks."
"With acute signs of a recession in the United States, the wave of redundancies will increase as companies endeavour to maintain high profit margins by cutting staff."
"This is the policy of the EU, which has given the go-ahead for mass redundancies in order to protect the plutocracy's profits."
"Which is why any reference by the EU to its supposed interest in the workers and in combating unemployment is mere Pharisaism and hypocrisy"
"The report also recommends accelerating the radical shake-up of the existing insurance and pension system and reviewing this during 2001 so as to deal with the ""problems arising from the ageing population"" ."
"It also proposes speeding up the rate of privatisation, specifically quoting the liberalisation of the telecommunications sector as a good example, which should be pursued in the energy, post, airport, railway and sea transport sectors, as agreed."
"Clearly, even more difficult and bleak times are ahead for the workers."
"Social insurance will be linked to wages, output and the purchasing power of salaries."
"Part-time work is becoming the norm and, combined with partial retirement and the high cost of private social care and the commercialisation of the pension, health and welfare systems, is pushing the whole of the working class into unemployment, poverty, insecurity and social exclusion."
"The measures designed for the workers are tantamount to a guaranteed level of poverty."
"Prosperity is, of course, reserved for big business, which these measures strengthen still further."
"The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece are voting against this report, which promises even greater poverty for the workers and even more mega-profits for big business and which seeks to reverse everything the workers have achieved."
"The workers, who are speaking out and demonstrating against these barbaric, inhumane policies in huge mass rallies and strikes in the various countries of Europe, including Greece, will try to ward off the impending storm and we shall be by their side in the fight."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.39 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Consumption of alcohol by children and adolescents"
"The next item is the report (A5-0150/2001) by Mrs Stihler, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a Council recommendation on drinking of alcohol by children and adolescents [COM(2000) 736 - C5-0020/2001 - 2001/0801(CNS)]."
"Mr President, this report concerns the proposal for a Council recommendation on drinking of alcohol by children and adolescents."
"Parliament has been asked to give its opinion on this issue."
"Our report will not become a binding piece of European legislation but will literally act as a recommendation to Member States."
"I should like at this stage to thank the Swedish presidency for its interest in this issue and for organising the successful Stockholm Conference."
"The format of allowing young people to make their views known on an equal footing with health ministers made the dialogue all the more interesting."
"We know the growing evidence shows that children and adolescents are starting drinking at a younger age and drinking at worrying levels at a younger age."
"The problem is growing not only in the northern states but also in the southern states."
"France and Spain report growing problems of adolescent drunkenness, associated with fights, violence, truancy, theft and illegal drugs."
"Recent surveys show that the UK, Denmark, Finland, France and Sweden report the highest proportions of boys and girls who have been drunk at or younger than 13."
"Scotland, which I represent in this Parliament, has the highest rate of binge drinking amongst 15-year-olds."
"The gender gap is also closing, with more girls reporting having been drunk at 15 in Denmark, Finland, England, Scotland and Wales."
"Yet the simple fact is that children and adolescents are just more vulnerable to the effects of alcohol than adults."
"The rise of drinking to excess by children and adolescents has serious implications for future health."
"Drinking behaviour, which occurs during youth, can lead to similar patterns in adulthood."
"Certainly many colleagues here will know the consequences of drinking to excess."
"But in terms of misuse of alcohol by adolescents, the link between binge drinking, unplanned pregnancy, sexually-transmitted diseases, crime and road-traffic accidents cannot be denied."
"You need only go to your local police station or hospital to see the evidence."
"What are the solutions?"
"Information, education and health promotion are critical in the fight against under-age binge drinking, as are health promotion policies targeted at children, parents, teachers and carers, better labelling on alcohol products, integration of adolescent policies."
"In preparing this report I contacted over a hundred schools and fifty youth organisations in Scotland."
"Townhill primary school in Dunfermline, where I live, summed up the need for more education when it found that most children in the class were not aware of the health and social problems associated with alcohol misuse."
"This leads me on to my second point, an important one."
"More research is needed into the nature, scale and causes of this growing trend in binge drinking by children and adolescents."
"We need to improve data collection and share information."
"Kinghorn primary school in Fife thought that the research issue was important and that an e-mail network of pupils allowing them to discuss and explore the issues was critical."
"Thirdly, the issue of selling to under-age people is also an important one."
"In many countries there are existing laws which should prevent this from happening."
"However, as we all know, this still goes on."
"The rise of bootlegged alcohol in many Member States is also a factor."
"Proper implementation of existing laws in Member States could go some way to prevent the selling to children and adolescents."
"On codes of conduct: much of the alcohol industry has signed up to voluntary codes of conduct and has self-regulation."
"Much of the industry has tried to take a responsible view to this issue."
"However, there is a real concern among parents, teachers and young people themselves that not enough is being done on advertising."
"When you see pictures of babies in beer-logo babygrows, no wonder people have cause for concern."
"Powrie primary school in Dundee asked that alcohol should be made 'uncool' ;"
"TV ads should show vomiting and hang-overs."
"Many members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection supported the move for more binding regulation, and the debate continues."
"In conclusion, the need for joint action on education and research is critical in the fight against binge drinking by children and adolescents."
"At St Elizabeth primary school in Hamilton they noted that there is more to life than the aspiration to get as drunk as possible in as little time as possible, with as big an audience as possible."
"Finally, in the words of the World Health Organisation's European Charter on Alcohol: ""All children and adolescents have the right to grow up in an environment protected from the negative consequences of alcohol consumption and to the extent possible from the promotion of alcoholic beverage""."
"I hope my colleagues will support this report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the relationship between adolescents and alcohol is not a new problem."
"Alcohol is part and parcel of adult social life."
"It is therefore logical that adolescents will come into contact with alcohol as they approach adulthood."
"Children and adolescents are normally unaware of the dangers of excessive alcohol consumption; born of curiosity to try new things, it can quickly become a habit."
"The average age at which children and adolescents try their first alcoholic drink has not fallen."
"Young people continue to have their first contact with alcohol in their early teens, as in the past."
"The age at which regular alcohol consumption begins, however, is falling steadily."
"Alcohol consumption by children and adolescents is an extremely emotive subject, since it concerns the rising generations of European citizens."
"The animated discussions in our committee left me in no doubt of the importance of this subject to every one of us."
"At this point I should like to thank all my fellow members for their contributions."
"We overwhelmingly took the view that responsibility in this area could not be assigned to parents alone; it was essential to create basic conditions in which adolescents could learn everything they needed to know in order to deal with exposure to alcohol."
"I should therefore like to re-emphasise that my opinion relates specifically to children and adolescents and their dealings with alcohol and not to the health implications of alcohol abuse in general."
"In February of this year, as the rapporteur said, a conference was held on the subject of young people and alcohol."
"One of the points that were made in the declaration adopted at that conference is crucially important, in my view, and I have taken it into account in my opinion. It is the fact that care must be taken to ensure greater involvement of young people in these programmes and measures."
"It is particularly important that support and assistance be given to schemes devised by young people for young people."
"Since children and adolescents are affected by the problem, they must be involved in the effort to resolve it."
"This is the only way to ensure that young people actually commit themselves to the cause."
"Prohibitions and regulations alone will not help young people to become responsible adults - quite the reverse."
"We can only achieve that if we let them learn to assume responsibility themselves."
"(PPE-DE). (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by thanking the Commission for having addressed this increasingly acute problem of alcohol abuse among children and adolescents."
"May I also say that the Commission has produced a good basis for a recommendation to the Council."
"The unimpaired development and health of our children and teenagers is a matter of concern to all of us."
"Mrs Stihler and Mrs Zissener have both indicated the nature of the problem in Europe."
"For adults in Europe, the consumption of alcohol is often, though by no means universally, an integral part of social life."
"Young people, however, are shaped by the drinking habits of adult society, which they copy."
"Alcohol consumption is therefore widely regarded as part of growing up."
"The drinking habits of young people largely reflect the attitudes and habits of the adult society in which they live."
"Role models are therefore of the essence."
"It is imperative that young people see alcohol being treated properly and wisely by their families and by society as a whole."
"Any inclination to abuse alcohol must be nipped in the bud."
"Targeted education campaigns must be used to combat alcohol abuse."
"The consequences of alcohol abuse affect us all."
"They affect families and societies."
"Road deaths caused by drunk drivers, loss of jobs and ultimately family break-ups are but a few examples of the ravages of alcohol abuse."
"At the national level there are already many sound laws for the protection of children and adolescents, such as the laws prohibiting the sale of alcohol to minors."
"Strenuous efforts must be made to ensure that these existing national laws are more effectively enforced."
"Warnings printed on labels, extending to comparisons such as 'one glass of brandy equals three glasses of beer' , if I understood Mrs Stihler' s amendment correctly, would serve little purpose, in my opinion."
"Such comparisons create confusion and might even give the impression that particular alcoholic drinks could safely be consumed in larger quantities."
"Such comparisons cannot give any indication of the actual effects of a beverage on individual people or of an individual' s consumption capacity."
"On the contrary, they might induce people to misjudge their own tolerance levels."
"Such warnings would not constitute consumer education; they would be more likely to confuse or even mislead consumers."
"Producers and purveyors of alcoholic beverages are heavily involved in the sponsorship of sports clubs and cultural organisations and of the events in which they participate."
"A ban on the sponsorship of youth events would ultimately deprive clubs of vital income."
"Why should a brewery which sponsors an adult sports event for a club or association not be allowed to make its marquee available for a youth event too?"
"Whether a ban on sponsorship would actually have an educational impact is a moot question."
"The most likely effect is that the clubs and associations could no longer afford to stage youth events, which means that young people would be the losers at the end of the day."
"Alcohol, tobacco and drugs are three distinct problems and need to be treated differently."
"I hope we are addressing each of these problems, and indeed I am sure that we do address them on an everyday basis."
"I therefore ask the House to refrain from any attempt to lump these three very important issues together in this report."
"Mr President, unfortunately, we all know that drunken driving is the primary cause of death among young people between the ages of 15 and 25, not forgetting that this figure does not include the number of people disabled as the result of road traffic accidents caused by drunken driving."
"The consumption of alcohol, especially at a young age, is becoming an increasing cause of concern to the public and experts alike."
"The problem appears to be more acute in northern Europe, where it is linked to an increase in the number of suicides."
"Another worrying dimension is that younger and younger children, irrespective of sex or social class, are drinking more and more regularly."
"It would be helpful, I think, given that numerous, somewhat cloudy terms are being used, such as use, dependence, abuse, excessive use, if we were to use the term applied by the World Health Organisation, which talks of 'harmful use' and which refers to the amount, frequency, conditions, form and consequences of alcohol use by young people."
"The Council recommendation should be more specific; what we want is uniform European legislation on this matter."
"What we need, first and foremost, is preventive intervention designed to limit use and I think that any reference to measures which restrict demand is important and that our policy should revolve around it."
"Access by young people to places in which alcoholic beverages are easily obtainable must be specially regulated, together with any other measures to control supply."
"The fact is that we need to be proactive and ensure that young people are correctly informed about the side effects of a drinking habit, as they are for other psychotropic substances, both legal and illegal."
"Special reference also needs to be made to the role of advertising."
"It is unacceptable that alcoholic beverage companies should direct advertising campaigns at young people, a group of consumers which is highly susceptible to the messages it receives."
"What we need to do, within the framework of the European Union, is to organise proper information campaigns and special training seminars for people who come into contact with young consumers."
"Having extended its remit to other psychotropic substances, the European Drugs Monitoring Centre could play a decisive role both in this sense and in collating reliable and comparable epidemiological data."
"To finish, I should like to express my hope that the European Commission has understood how serious this issue is and will introduce clear and specific regulations which deal effectively with such a serious issue, which concerns the health and security of our youngsters."
"Mr President, I have to say, the liberal group did wrestle with this topic to some degree, and has problems with the Commission proposal."
"The question is, how motherly should the European Union be in the quest to protect itself from its subjects?"
"Indeed, we can see major differences compared to the control of tobacco."
"Tobacco is always harmful, whereas alcohol is not, most of the time."
"The addictive aspects are completely different."
"Tobacco is immediately addictive, alcohol is not."
"Also, the seriousness of the tobacco issue is of a completely different order from that of alcohol."
"Alcohol does create problems, and sometimes they can be harrowing."
"Just think of the road victims caused by alcohol abuse, which Mrs Malliori mentioned a moment ago, or the role of alcohol in domestic violence."
"However, the issues are first and foremost of a criminal nature and, as such, they belong with the national, not the European, legislator."
"This is also preferable for reasons of content."
"The cultural differences in this area are enormous, and a legislator who is closer to the citizen can therefore act more effectively, and, in the final analysis, effectiveness is what it is all about."
"In addition, in the proposals, the differences between justified alcohol consumption and alcohol abuse have been watered down, if you will excuse the pun."
"In that respect, we believe that the present proposals are to some extent missing the mark."
"We also vehemently object to the patronising overtones of many of the amendments, in particular."
"We identified much more with the rapporteur' s original report, on which we should like to congratulate her."
"To the Member States, I would like to say the following: be as strict as you like in terms of controlling alcohol abuse, and especially alcohol abuse among young people, but do not hide behind the European Union and behind what you are about to arrange amongst yourselves behind closed doors in the Health Council."
"We do recognise the fact that the issue of alcohol has a European, cross-border dimension, although it is not evident from these proposals."
"These predominantly focus on the ingredients of alcohol products."
"We believe that European legislation in the field of labelling should at least be considered or examined."
"This could then include the possibility of using warning labels, as is done in the United States, for example, at least as long as it can be proven that these warning labels serve a purpose."
"It could also incorporate the issue of advertising."
"Secondly, the proposals deal with taxes, excise, tariffs and such like. The differences in this field within the Union are enormous."
"We wonder about the internal market implications this has, as well as the health implications. That is why my group has tabled an amendment on both scores."
"Mr President, all the statistics show that the number of children and adolescents drinking has reached alarming levels over the past decade."
"So I congratulate the Commission on this welcome initiative and the rapporteur, Mrs Stihler, for strengthening and improving the Commission's recommendation."
"Children and young people are drinking alcohol more frequently and starting not only to drink but to get drunk at an ever younger age."
"In Wales, my own constituency, half of all fifteen-year-olds drink beer every week."
"While I would usually be the first to welcome equality between the sexes, in this case we can only regret that over the past decade the number of girls drinking excessively has almost equalled that of boys in nearly every Member State."
"Young people, as was said earlier, must be able to make their own informed decisions about alcohol."
"The report refers to the importance of involving young people themselves in the campaign to prevent alcohol abuse, so that the right, positive images and the right messages are used, which will reach young people and which will have an influence on them."
"We must stop the deliberate targeting of alcohol products at young people."
"We must have effective labelling and advertising of the dangers of alcohol, but also readily available information for young people, parents and all those involved in youth work to promote healthy living."
"In this way we may be able to stem the increasing prevalence of alcohol, which can be so destructive in the lives of young people."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a great deal of attention has been paid in recent years to the problem of addiction with regard to drug use."
"Paradoxically, with regard to abusive consumption of alcohol and alcohol dependency, little or nothing has been done."
"It is also a paradox that the real situation is very far removed from what is normally thought to be the case."
"Alcohol dependency is a much more widespread and deep-rooted problem in social and public health terms, with statistics in many countries showing that around 10% of the population could be classed as suffering from alcoholism."
"This is one of the unspoken tragedies of our times - society appears to be repeating the denial that is one of the defining features of alcoholism and other forms of drug addiction and, as is well known, is one of the major obstacles to recovery for those affected."
"The report and this recommendation counter the indifferent approach we have seen in the past and therefore deserve our congratulations and our support."
"They rightly focus on children and adolescents in particular."
"On the one hand, it is a known fact that alcohol consumption amongst the young has increased markedly and today we are even seeing cases of juvenile alcoholism, which was practically unknown or extremely rare a few decades ago."
"On the other hand, health education and information programmes targeting young people will, in the long term, also have a positive impact on the overall prevention of alcoholism."
"Many older alcoholism sufferers today are from generations that were unaware, that thought that there was no problem because things had always been that way."
"What we need to do now is to provide information, especially for young people."
"We must inform, warn, monitor, anticipate and prevent a human and social disaster."
"As a matter of fact, we are today facing new challenges, with a situation in which the market is swamped with products that purport to be harmless, such as alcoholic cool drinks or synthetic drinks that are specifically targeted at the youngest drinkers, which could represent the start of their alcohol abuse and, consequently, the door to the abyss, the danger of which we must expose."
"We sincerely hope that this recommendation will succeed and that it will be stringently monitored in all Member States."
"Mr President, as we know, the report that is before us today has been adopted unanimously in the competent committee, which surely illustrates that there is broad consensus on this subject matter across all the ideological divides."
"If you were to ask me to express a point of criticism, this would not be about the gist of this report, but I should only like to mention that, when I read this document, it appears at times that it is labouring quite a few obvious points in a fairly patronising manner, in other words, a number of opinions are being trotted out on which everyone is in fact agreed."
"One can also question whether it is, in fact, necessary to tackle an issue at European level once again, of which all Member States are very much aware and on which they are all taking measures."
"However, allow me to express my surprise at the fact that, among the keen advocates of this report, especially in the parliamentary committee, I also discovered the names of MEPs from, for example, several Belgian parties in office who, in their own countries, support an actual policy to legalise soft drugs and implement such a policy by adopting an extremely flexible policy of tolerance, on the one hand, and by launching various specific propaganda campaigns promoting the use of soft drugs, on the other. This even includes the Ministers of parties in office who, via the mass media, openly admit to using soft drugs and who even light up joints while on television."
"In all honesty, I am extremely annoyed at this form of hypocrisy, where alcohol is rightly kept in check but where the use of marijuana and other dangerous drugs by a certain type of progressive intelligentsia is advertised as being politically correct."
"I simply wanted to get this off my chest, Mr President."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, having been elected by a wine-producing region, I will gladly support the text presented for the vote."
"It is true, we must combat the menace of alcoholism in young people, and this text successfully highlights the role that families, teachers, producers and retailers must play in this area."
"This document will certainly been seen as a call for sensible behaviour in Member States and I appreciate the fact that it is not restrictive but makes every effort to make those involved shoulder more responsibility."
"Nonetheless, I would like to stress that wine consumed in moderation at meal times has always been an integral part of our culture, our way of life and our conviviality."
"Drinking wine, and drinking sensibly, is something that we learn in the family context as we grow up."
"This natural product, which is as varied and diverse as the land on which the vines grow, has a beneficial effect on the health and happiness of the peoples of the Mediterranean, as stressed in the amendment that we have tabled."
"Mr President, I happened to be Minister of Health when advice came through that the new guidance should be that some alcohol was better than none, but some was also better than too much, and in a sense that is what we need to do through this report: to help young people understand that there is a balance to be struck between the pleasure and the benefit of drinking alcohol sensibly and the dangers of alcohol abuse."
"One of the things that had to be learnt was that the units per day that you drink cannot be concentrated in binge drinking at the weekend because the level of alcohol in next day's bloodstream is then catastrophically high."
"Young people need to understand the danger of abuse, they need also to understand the effect of drinking on their study, on their ability to concentrate, on work, especially if they are working with machinery, on leisure and on sport, and we have inserted a warning about the risk of dying if you swim after drinking too much."
"Most serious of all is the role of alcohol abuse in triggering or exacerbating mental illness, and especially for young men as the precursor to suicide attempts."
"This is a useful report."
"It needs further study in some places, not least on the unit labelling, because in Britain the unit is eight grams of alcohol, in Spain and Denmark it is ten, in France it is twelve and in Portugal it is fourteen."
"We also need to look carefully at the sports grounds restrictions that are suggested, because there is a huge difference between a ninety-minute football match - give or take the half-time break - and many clubs of course ban alcohol in their grounds, and the all-day cricket match with the lunch and tea intervals."
"We have to be careful not to ban the hospitality boxes because of loss of revenue to sport and boardroom drinking because of loss of sanity to sports directors."
"But broadly I welcome this as a step for the Commission to consider."
"Mr President, the abuse of alcohol by children and young people is a serious problem, and it is a growing problem, but for me it is not an EU problem."
"Mr Prodi said last year, here in this Chamber, that, out of consideration for the EU' s legitimacy in the eyes of the people, Parliament and the EU should not become involved in all manner of ridiculous matters."
"The abuse of alcohol by children and young people is no laughing matter - on the contrary - but the problem falls within the province of families, the local community and the Member States."
"We are talking about the principle of subsidiarity."
"There are sensible things in what is being proposed."
"We are discussing the provision of information to young people and the risks of alcohol, but the proposal also contains so much that is over-protective and so many admonishments, and these are aspects I cannot support."
"The EU must not dictate the frameworks for the cultural differences in the Member States."
"In fact, the EU must ensure that the differences are respected and, therefore, the advertising of beer on English television must be permitted, even if this might be unacceptable on Spanish television."
"We must respect diversity and strengthen the principle of subsidiarity, partly out of consideration for the legitimacy of the EU."
"Mr President, earlier we voted in favour of the report by Mr Maaten on tobacco products, which contains some excellent measures."
"Now, we have exactly the same problem with alcohol; in other words, we are faced with approximately the same number of deaths, not only caused in road accidents, which is what we seem to focus on, but from cirrhosis of the liver, stomach cancer, throat cancer as well, and this is without including the various social problems."
"As in the case of tobacco products, we know that smoking a cigarette is no more dangerous than drinking a glass of wine."
"However, as in the case of tobacco products, we also know that drinking alcohol and adopting the habit of drinking begins at a young age, particularly because of the example shown by adults and the positive image it is given in advertisements."
"We should, in fact, adopt the same type of measures for alcohol as for tobacco products, and from this point of view, although the Commission report is good, it does not go nearly as far, perhaps because the alcohol lobbies are still more powerful than those for tobacco products, or perhaps because of our culture and customs."
"We should, in fact, bring in labelling for all alcoholic drinks to cover 30% of the product' s surface, indicating that alcohol kills, that alcohol is dangerous for health."
"We should ban advertising of alcohol, however implicit."
"We should ban sponsorship of all activities, particularly sporting activities, by manufacturers of alcoholic drinks."
"I shall not give a lecture but the truth of the matter is, as in the case of tobacco products, we will not make progress through clamping down on consumers - only through prevention."
"That is why we must immediately take action against everything that may incite young people to drink alcohol."
"Mr President, I think it encouraging that there is now a considerable consensus on the problem of alcohol abuse by young people and I certainly think that the views expressed here this afternoon should strengthen Commissioner Byrne's hand in dealing with the problem."
"It is regrettable that in our understandable concern to tackle drugs and drug-trafficking we have by and large ignored what is for many people, young and old, a serious form of addiction with immense consequences for society and in particular individuals and their families."
"The cost to the state in terms of health costs, loss of work days and production is in my view greater than the revenue generated from the sale of alcohol."
"The survey referred to by the rapporteur in this report is startling, and it certainly gives me no pleasure to see Ireland at the top of that list."
"Surveys in Ireland reveal a similar and worrying trend with implications for the welfare of a generation of young people with enormous potential and opportunities."
"While each individual must at the end of the day take responsibility for his or her attitude to alcohol, there is in my view a need for much stronger action on the part of Member State governments and on the part of the Commission and this Parliament as well."
"The targeting of young people by some manufacturers of so-called designer drinks is a case in point."
"A stop must be put to such activity and this Parliament, with the Council, should initiate strong action to deal with the matter."
"Mr President, like everyone here, I am concerned by alcohol abuse in young people and by the shift in culture, which dictates that young people, in some countries particularly, believe they have to get blind drunk at the weekend so as to be cool."
"I acknowledge, therefore, that the Commission' s initiative has a valid basis."
"Unfortunately, our competent committees, which have collectively drawn up around 50 amendments, have again sinned in their overzealous approach."
"If their ideas are adopted, instead of combating unsavoury alcoholism, they will have succeeded in harming, amongst others, a whole industry, in other words, the wine-producing industry."
"We should make a distinction between the moderate, responsible drinking of alcoholic beverages - of wine in particular, which is part of our culture - and alcohol and drug abuse."
"We cannot combat alcoholism by restricting supply."
"For instance, would you like the production of wine, beer and spirits to be banned, and to what extent?"
"The majority of our countries have a ban on the sale of alcohol to minors and this legislation should be strictly enforced."
"Why, though, would we want to ban the sale of alcoholic beverages at competitions and other events?"
"The Evin law in France, which is also inconsistent with the single market, bans all advertising of alcoholic beverages at sporting events, but does not ban their sale."
"We have also already held epic debates on the labelling of alcoholic beverages."
"We have not, until now, succeeded in reaching agreement on a directive."
"A recommendation on alcohol consumption in young people is certainly not the way to obstruct us, proposing to place warnings about the dangers to health on each wine bottle, for example, despite the fact that experience has shown such warnings to be totally ineffective in the United States."
"There is, moreover, a law on labelling wines, which actually makes it illegal to make the public aware of the benefits of drinking wine in moderation, whereas it has been scientifically proven that drinking a few glasses of wine a day is an excellent way to prevent cancer, vascular diseases and Alzheimer' s disease in particular."
"I shall be voting against the amendments that propose measures which are totally unrelated to combating alcoholism in young people and which show utter disregard for the principle of subsidiarity."
"Throughout the EU we have a problem with young people drinking too much."
"We are not talking about adult drinking here, let us stress that."
"Some of my colleagues have raised the issue of subsidiarity."
"We are not dealing with a regulation or a directive here."
"We are simply talking about a recommendation."
"To try to deal with young people binge drinking and drinking to excess."
"It is a way for other countries to learn from each other."
"It is important, for instance, that school nurses and doctors are trained to spot the problems of excessive drinking by young people."
"We must realise that peer pressure is a problem, lack of self-esteem, parents drinking: those are all problems we should take into account."
"I personally would like to see alcohol advertising banned at young people's sporting events, not at adult events but at young people's sporting events, and I believe very strongly that we should support this recommendation."
"The WHO is supporting measures in this field, the NSPCC is and I certainly hope my colleagues will vote for it."
"Mr President, I also wish to join my colleagues in thanking the committee and the rapporteur in particular for their tremendous work on this report."
"It is important that when we speak about young people we should recognise that we may not be the best people to understand what they want."
"A lot of us are past the first flush of youth and, therefore, we may not be as clued up on today's youth culture as some of us might like to believe."
"Perhaps one of the key points or recommendations that should be in this report is that young people should be asked what they want, what pressures they suffer from and what drives them to binge drinking and abuse of alcohol."
"Maybe we would discover that some of the issues which we think of as problems are not problems at all, and that a lot of the difficulties are due firstly to the example they are given by their parents and the older generation; secondly, the acceptability of young people drinking and, thirdly, the way social events revolve around alcohol."
"We also have to ensure that we do not mix the message with regard to what is moderate and what is immoderate drinking."
"In particular, we should ensure that information campaigns are reactive and proactive towards young people."
"The number of health problems, both psychological and physical, affecting young people because of alcohol abuse is enormous, as is the number of unwanted pregnancies, under-age pregnancies, violent assaults and suicides."
"The coroner in County Mayo on the western coast of Ireland said that sixty per cent of suicides or attempted suicides in that area were directly related to alcohol."
"Therefore we should have a clear enforcement of the law, an identity card system at national level to ensure that young people do not have access to alcohol and strict enforcement and penalties for people who supply young people with drink."
"Mr President, combating alcohol-related harm is a public health priority in many Member States and also at EU level."
"This is clearly reflected in the draft of the future Public Health Action Programme where inappropriate use of alcohol is mentioned as one of the key health determinants to be tackled."
"Over the last couple of years, there has been growing evidence that alcohol consumption by young people and the corresponding health and social problems have increased alarmingly."
"This is why the Commission took the initiative to address the problems caused by the drinking of alcohol by young people in the form of a Council recommendation which is a valid instrument foreseen under the public health article of the Treaty, namely Article 152."
"The broad discussions which we held during the last three years with the Member States, experts and stakeholders clearly show that the drinking behaviour of young people is increasingly similar throughout the European Union and that Community action is therefore justified and appropriate."
"I have been very pleased to learn that in the Council working group and in COREPER the Member States have welcomed this initiative very positively."
"I therefore believe that this is an issue for the European Union at European level, and not just an issue at Member State level."
"I fully agree with those who say that this issue is different from tobacco."
"It must be distinguished from tobacco and indeed also drugs. It has been mentioned in the contributions this afternoon that we dealt with this yesterday in the directive that we discussed, and that is dealt with on an EU-wide basis."
"But there are many issues relating to alcohol consumption that must be addressed on an EU-wide basis also. For instance, advertising comes to mind."
"The codes of conduct that are contained in the television without frontiers legislation: are they being fully and properly complied with?"
"These codes of conduct operate on an EU-wide basis. The advertising operates on an EU-wide basis, and as has already been stated by one of the honourable Members, this is a recommendation."
"It is not a directive or a regulation. I am equally pleased that the discussion in the European Parliament confirms our concerns and the way to tackle them."
"I welcome Parliament's intention to support the Commission's approach and to strengthen the proposal through the large number of very constructive amendments."
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Stihler, and the Committee on the Environment for their constructive work."
"On this basis the Commission can accept Amendment Nos 1, 8, 10, 11, 18, 27, 30, 31 and 34."
"There are also a number of amendments which contain very valid ideas which can only be accepted by the Commission in a redrafted form to make them fit into the proposal structure and to keep the text consistent."
"I am speaking about Amendment Nos 7, 13, 15, 17, 21, 22, 24, 33, 35, 38, 39, 40, 42, 49, 50, 51 and 52."
"A range of Parliament's amendments suggest to enlarge the scope of the recommendation by proposing broader aspects of alcohol policy or concrete regulatory steps."
"I think that we should stick to the proposed approach which is, at this stage, to intensify health promotion and education efforts and to bring the producers and retailers to act responsibly."
"During the implementation of the recommendation and in the framework of the future debates on a strategic approach of the Community to reduce alcohol-related harm there will be room to discuss all aspects which could be relevant for an effective alcohol policy."
"The following amendments can therefore not be accepted for the purpose of the recommendation, but the Commission will take account of their contents in the future strategy approach: these are Amendment Nos 5, 6, 14, 26, 29, 41, 44, 45, 47, 48, 53, 54, 55 and 56."
"In relation to Amendment No 53 I would draw the House's attention to Directive 79/112 on the labelling of foodstuffs which is a piece of legislation that is within my competence and of course will be kept under review and looked at in the context of the remarks that have been made by colleagues and of the other advice that I get in relation to the labelling of alcohol."
"Some of the amendments cannot be accepted because they propose to change a quotation from a legal text and I refer to Amendment Nos 2, 3 and 4."
"Others are unnecessary because the proposed subject is already covered in the proposal and I refer here to numbers 19, 25, 32 and 46."
"The subject matters of Amendment Nos 20 and 37 refer to issues which are too specific to be taken explicitly on board, although in principle they fall under the thematic approach of the proposal."
"Concerning Amendment No 23, the whole recommendation is about alcohol consumption by young people."
"The Commission believes it to be very important to mention drink-driving specifically."
"For this reason the amendment is not acceptable."
"Amendment No 36 cannot be accepted because of definition problems for the purpose of this recommendation."
"The age ban has not been defined by using the term under-age, and different legislation applies in different Member States."
"Amendment No 28 conflicts with the medical advice the Commission has received."
"Amendment No 43 would remove an important aspect of future codes of conduct and therefore cannot be accepted either."
"Some amendments can be partially accepted by the Commission."
"In Amendment No 9 the first two sentences cannot be accepted because assessment will have to cover all aspects and not just a shortlist of measures."
"It makes sense however to accept the reference to the regional and local level."
"The changes proposed in Amendment No 12 highlighting only some alcohol policy aspects and not others would be misleading and cannot therefore be accepted, except a reference to self-esteem by young people which the Commission can of course accept."
"In Amendment No 16 the Commission cannot accept mention of only certain specific aspects for evaluation as this would be counter-productive."
"However, references to good practices and to the role of the medical practitioners are acceptable."
"I look forward to seeing the recommendation being implemented because there is no doubt that this will be an excellent basis for working jointly towards a common aim, to better protect our young people, especially children and adolescents."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"General product safety"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0133/2001) by Mrs González Álvarez, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on general product safety [14614/1/2000 - C5-0045/2001 - 2000/0073(COD)]."
"Mr President, we are debating the revision of Directive 92/59/EEC on general product safety and there is a priority which the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament share, which is to improve consumer health and safety."
"This has always been a desire, but in the current circumstances it has become a firmer commitment."
"The proposal is intended to guarantee the safety of marketed products and promote compliance with the obligations of producers and distributors."
"Producers must only market safe products, must provide consumers with reliable information, prevent risks and, where necessary, finally withdraw dangerous products already on the market."
"Nor must distributors supply any product which they know to be unsafe, and they must cooperate with the markets' monitoring network, which also involves the authorities charged with monitoring product safety."
"This revision has followed a method which we believe to be adequate, including the consultation which took place before making the proposal with non-governmental organisations and social agents, companies and so on."
"More than fifteen of these organisations were consulted before making the proposal and the intention was to correct the gaps and insufficiencies in the implementation of the directive over previous years."
"Some of these suggestions are included above all in the first Council proposal presented by the Commission."
"We agreed with the majority of the proposal made to us."
"However, we presented thirty amendments, which we believed improved the proposal."
"At first reading, twenty-one of them were adopted, totally or partially."
"They better defined the concepts of 'safe product' and 'recuperation' , pointed to the need for periodic reports to the European Parliament on the success or failure of the implementation of the directive, as well as labelling in the language of the country where the products were marketed, and proposed, amongst other things, that the candidate countries be included in the RAPEX system."
"Nevertheless, certain issues continued to concern the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, the alternative rapporteurs and the Commission itself."
"And in this second reading we are presenting just eleven amendments which were discussed in the Environment Committee and approved at the last sitting by a significant majority, and which at the various informal meetings - there were many and I must thank the Commission and the Council for their interest in this report - we tried to reduce."
"I believe we can easily reach an agreement on five of these amendments."
"They are amendments which refer to the possibility of an external certification of safe products, to the possibility of harmonising the monitoring programmes of the different Member States, to the inclusion of the precautionary principle in such an important issue and to the establishment and promotion of a network of competent authorities in relation to product safety."
"There are more difficulties with other amendments, such as those which refer to the exporting of unsafe products to the Third World and to the safety of services."
"We believe it is very important that there should be specific legislation."
"At the moment - I do not know if this is the case in the rest of Europe, but in my country it is - services such as tourism, courses in academies or telecommunications are the subjects of much debate, because in many of them there is flagrant abuse going on."
"We therefore wish to ensure that there is legislation on this issue soon, as well as legislation relating to the nature of committees."
"Mr President, I believe that it will not be difficult to reach an agreement on the eleven amendments approved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"And I will stress one which I believe should be a distinguishing mark for Europe."
"I am talking about our attitude to the ethics of exporting products, which Europeans consider to be unsafe, to other countries."
"This seems to us to be an essential amendment because, if they are unsafe for Europeans, they are unsafe for the whole world, even if other countries have more flexible regulations."
"We therefore believe that by supporting the proposal of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, we are also supporting principles which are of paramount importance to the European Union."
"Mr President, the directive that is now before us, concerning general product safety, offers the consumer excellent protection against unsafe products."
"Moreover, it is particularly suited to achieving the internal market, free movement and the harmonisation which is required for this in an effective manner."
"I greatly appreciate the fact that the Council has adopted a large number of the amendments accepted by Parliament at first reading."
"The directive in its current version provides for greater transparency, more active monitoring of the markets, a better definition of producer and consumer responsibilities - for that was still a stumbling block at first reading - stricter criteria for product safety and stricter criteria for testing these products."
"It allows for better and more effective intervention when products need to be withdrawn from the market."
"New, too, is rapid exchange, which I very much welcome in Europe."
"I would now like to turn my attention to a specific problem."
"It was raised in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and concerns the export ban, enshrined in Article 13."
"This entails an automatic export ban on products from the Community once the Commission has been requested to examine the safety of these."
"We do not support this."
"Indeed, the proposal that a request for a safety check alone should lead to an absolute and automatic ban is hardly justifiable."
"Needless to say, the European Union is in favour of a high level of protection and very strict safety requirements, but a distinction must be drawn between a safe and a hazardous product."
"My colleague, Mrs Marialiese Flemming, whom I represent here, has tabled an amendment in this connection, and she suggests only allowing the automatic export ban to apply if the product for which a ban is being issued here should also be banned on account of safety."
"This point is of crucial importance to the PPE-DE group, and I hope that our fellow MEPs will support us by adopting the amendment tabled by Mrs Flemming on our behalf."
"Mr President, I will begin by congratulating the rapporteur."
"As the shadow rapporteur for my group, I have seen her diligence throughout these proceedings and we all wish to honour her work."
"This is quite a new state of the parliamentary proceedings, and we need to pick our words carefully as we look forward to a potential conciliation."
"At second reading we are deliberately putting forward only a few amendments which centre on some very important principles, and on most of those we will reach a further agreement."
"As Mrs González Álvarez has said, the committee passed, by a substantial majority, all of the amendments, and we propose to vote for them today."
"We need - we think we shall get - a clear assurance that we shall move ahead from these proposals to the safety of services and the liability of service providers and there should not be any division of principle on that."
"We need to make it crystal clear that we shall also be able to take out of the market, not just for us, but world-wide, those products which present a serious risk, not just for domestic consumption, but also in the global market, because such products can easily be recycled, as Mrs González Álvarez says in her new Amendment No 13."
"We are asserting that principle today in the signing off of the Maaten report on tobacco, and it is precisely the same principle that we invoke here."
"Of course, there will have to be some compromises and discussions, but we need to look very carefully at what the word ""exemption"" means, if it is going to be asserted as a limitation on the path to withdrawal."
"There is a will to agree and a will to compromise, but we need to do it on the basis that the precautionary principle is always held in mind in our discussions and that this is consistent with other things which this Commissioner and this Commission have done in terms of the banning of dangerous products elsewhere."
"Finally, I would like to say that whilst I am certain that we can harmonise the guidelines on safety which will be used throughout the enlarged EU and we can agree on external certification, we need to be careful of other phrases which I hear bandied about as possible compromises."
"One is ""where appropriate""."
"Where is not appropriate, where we are applying the precautionary principle?"
"It has to be there throughout, not necessarily as the leitmotif, but certainly as something that we bear in mind in framing the legislation."
"So I cannot, I fear, go along with Mrs Flemming's amendment, and I, like most of the committee, wish to press these amendments."
"Mr President, this Parliament and Council directive on general product safety is important to the safety of the consumer."
"The aim is that this directive should also incorporate products which still do not come within the province of sectoral legislation and products whose safety aspects are not dealt with very well by sectoral legislation."
"That is important for the internal market, and it is also important for consumers to be able to rely on products within the European market displaying a high safety content."
"Needless to say, these consumers must then proceed to use these products in a responsible manner."
"This directive thus creates more clarity by explaining definitions and, at the same time, simplifying procedures so that Member States can obtain information more quickly."
"People still die of the effects of unsafe products."
"Moreover, I am of the opinion that it is irresponsible for safe product standards to be observed on behalf of EU citizens, but for citizens outside the EU to have to content themselves with less safe products."
"If we take these products off the shelves here, we should no longer export them."
"In fact, that is, of course, an issue that goes beyond this report, and I think we have not heard the last of it."
"This report can count on our unqualified support."
"Mr President, I wish to express my support and the support of my group for the rapporteur and the amendments retabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"The Council's common position improved the methods of traceability for consumer products, cooperation between authorities, producers and distributors in taking action to withdraw and recall dangerous products, and the opening up of the rapid alert system to the applicant countries."
"I am very pleased that it has now been made clear that charity shops, car-boot sales and flea-market stalls will not be harmed by this directive as, by their very nature, they cannot provide information on product risk and product origin for second-hand goods."
"I support the Environment Committee's retabled amendments, in particular the specific reference to the precautionary principle, to market monitoring and the European product safety network."
"I strongly oppose exempting provisionally banned products from the export ban."
"This would be double standards and would go against the very aim of the directive."
"If there is concern about the safety of a product, then how can we justify exporting it to third countries?"
"As the rapporteur said earlier: safety should be assured for all consumers, not just those in the European Union."
"I agree with the need for a fair balance between ensuring that products put on the market are safe and that the measures proposed can be practically implemented - this directive can achieve that."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the directive on general product safety is so important to us because it relates to a key area, namely those products that are not covered by the CE mark."
"But this brings me straight to one of the weak points of this proposal for a directive on general product safety, namely the fact that it will no longer be apparent to the consumer whether a product is really safe."
"This makes our Amendment No 3 especially important, because it provides quite simply for external certification by authorised testing agencies."
"There is an urgent need for the Commission to consider the introduction of verification marks - marks which certify to the consumer that a product is safe and, in some cases, that the product is of above-average quality."
"A product is then deemed to be safe when its safety has been verified by an accredited test centre."
"This is of particular importance to small and medium-sized businesses."
"If we think about the precautionary principle and prevention, it becomes clear that incentives must be created to encourage companies to have their products tested."
"I believe that testing by a third party, an impartial agency, would be an important means of easing the pressure on market-monitoring programmes."
"And this easing of pressure, along with the predictability deriving from testing and certification, would enable consumers to establish very clearly and easily where reliably safe products can be bought."
"On the export ban, let me say that there are naturally many countries whose standards differ greatly from those in Europe."
"I believe we should not be so haughty as to regard other countries' standards as inferior and to assume that ours are the only good and valid standards."
"Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs González Álvarez, and Mr Whitehead and Mr Lange for their very comprehensive contribution to the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on general product safety."
"There is a formal revision provision in the original directive."
"The revision coincided with a reinforced commitment by the Commission to safeguard the health and safety of consumers."
"The revised directive will progressively lead to a substantial improvement in the possibilities for dealing with safety problems of non-food products."
"The Council common position takes account of the fundamental points of the amended proposal adopted by the Commission in the light of the first reading opinion."
"21 out of 30 amendments from the first reading have been incorporated in part or in substance in the common position."
"Many of the proposed amendments of the González Álvarez recommendation are an improvement to the text and can therefore be accepted by the Commission."
"Allow me to address the amendments with which the Commission cannot agree."
"First Amendments Nos 2 and 9 reinstate the text of the Commission's original proposal for a ban on exports of dangerous products withdrawn from the EU market following an emergency decision."
"Amendment No 13 justifies this with the risk of reimportation to the Community market of such products which have been exported."
"The compromise in the common position would make it possible for the Commission to provide for exemptions from an outright ban on the export of such products."
"This was accepted by the Commission, because it was considered by many Member States as a safeguard necessary for them to accept the very principle of a ban; moreover the compromise leaves it up to the Commission to decide whether waiving the ban is justified."
"The risk of reimportation of exported goods can be kept under control with the normal mechanism of customs and market surveillance."
"Overall, I consider that the impact of this exemption would be very limited, would be under very tight control and supervision by the Commission itself and obviously would only operate in circumstances where it was justified, clearly rationalised and clearly acceptable and not just to me, but to the entire Commission."
"Secondly, Amendment No 3 introduces a requirement in an article that external certification should be regarded as a proof of conformity with the directive."
"The Commission can only accept a reference in a recital that such certification can facilitate proving such compliance."
"Thirdly, Amendment No 11 invites the Commission to submit proposals related to the safety of services before a specified date."
"The Commission is in fact already analysing and considering this issue as it has announced in a statement."
"Recital 1 would include a reference to these initiatives, as suggested by Amendment No 1."
"Finally, Amendment No 12 seeks to limit the export ban so that it shall not be applied when a product has temporarily been banned from the Community market for the period needed for further safety investigations."
"It cannot be justified to permit exports of products banned from the Community market on the basis of a potential serious risk."
"In my view, this action must protect consumers outside the European Union in the same way as it protects consumers within the European Union; and it occurs to me that if an emergency measure is being taken in this way, it is highly probable that it is an emergency measure because of the nature of the danger involved and very often the most serious emergencies result from the fact that the danger is the greatest."
"If that is the case and if my assessment is correct, it means there is a greater need for this emergency proposal to apply not only to consumers within the European Union, but also to consumers outside the European Union."
"Moreover, it is clear from this legislation that the evaluation as to whether it should apply in this way or not, will be undertaken by the appropriate committee which will be charged with this kind of work, experienced in doing this kind of work, which does not act precipitously or in a manner that would not fully protect the interests of consumers."
"The committee will only operate where there is a clear and serious danger to consumers."
"Having explained why the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 2, 3, 9, 11, 12, 13, I can inform you that the Commission can, in principle or in reworded versions, accept Amendments Nos 1, 4 to 8 and 10, as these amendments constitute an improvement and clarification of the proposal."
"To conclude, I wish to thank Mrs González Álvarez again for the excellent report which can be broadly supported by the Commission and on those amendments with which the Commission cannot agree, I am convinced that a satisfactory conclusion can be found as identified and stated by Mr Whitehead."
"I hope that this will be achieved as quickly as possible in the next stage of the regulatory process."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"COM in beef and veal market"
"The next item is the report (A5-0142/2001) by Robert William Sturdy, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) Nº 1254/1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal (COM(2001) 87 - C5-0082/2001 - 2001/0042(CNS))."
"Mr President, it is a pleasure to see the Commissioner here."
"I may well disagree with his proposals but I wish to begin by saying that we believe that Commissioner Fischler is an excellent Agriculture Commissioner, although he might have got this report slightly wrong."
"That is no criticism of Mr Fischler himself."
"It is well known that we need to address the serious problem facing the beef industry, and that is certainly what brought about the Commission's proposal."
"I say to the Commissioner that there is a Byzantine proverb: for those who have food, there are many problems; for those who have not, there is only one problem, and it is, of course, a great problem when there is too much beef in the marketplace."
"This is exactly what the Commissioner is trying to address."
"However, in my opinion as rapporteur, he has missed the mark."
"It is easy for me to stand here and criticise, but what I tried to do in my report was to be constructive and move the situation forward - I realise that the Commissioner does not agree with some of the measures."
"I hope that when the Commissioner addresses us he will perhaps answer one question: Will the 15 Council members agree with the Commission's proposals?"
"I think they might not."
"I should like to know whether the view of the Commission is that they will agree with the Commission's proposals or not."
"First, the one thing that was voted out in the Committee on Agriculture that I believe was a mistake was the 90-head limit."
"One of the major problems that we have - and the Commissioner is quite right that we have a problem with overproduction and we have pushed forward the proposals to allow the intervention limits to be raised - is that by changing the 90-head limit there is a real risk that we cut off some of those producers in their prime."
"I say to those Members who do not understand agriculture that to raise a beef animal from conception to the actual marketplace takes somewhere in the region of three years."
"It is a very long process."
"You cannot switch off something like that overnight and just say: well, hang on a minute, these cattle cannot be supported because suddenly we have changed our minds."
"If the Commissioner cannot at least change that 90-head limit - and we hope that one of the amendments may help us; we are looking at that at the moment - then at least he should look at helping those farmers who are affected by the 90-head limit so that they can adjust, because agriculture is a long-term process, not a short-term process."
"We have seen the effects of BSE."
"This is again why I am concerned a little about the report."
"As the Commissioner knows, BSE has been a major problem in the United Kingdom."
"It has been the archetype of the BSE crisis."
"We got through it and with careful construction we brought our market back."
"It was rather unfortunate that foot-and-mouth disease played a part in destroying the very work that had been done to get the marketplace back, bearing in mind that foot and mouth has nothing to do with food, in as much as it is of no danger to the public."
"I ask the Commissioner not to make knee-jerk reactions, because I believe this is a knee-jerk reaction."
"At the moment I cannot accept the new amendments tabled."
"I have a great concern that we are trying to move away from the real issues here."
"As I said, it is easy to stand here and criticise and I hope the Commissioner takes on board the amendments."
"The question we ask is whether or not the proposals satisfy the requirements: I believe a few of the Commission's proposals do but the majority fall short."
"I leave the Commissioner with one last thought: if he finds it impossible to accept Parliament's proposals, then he may wish to see the report referred back to the Committee on Agriculture."
"Then we could rediscuss it, because we have put forward some good proposals and if it is a wish of this august House that it be referred back, then so be it."
". (FR) Mr President, the financial implications of the emergency plan proposed by the Commission to deal with the upheavals in the beef market as a result of the BSE crisis, have now been referred to the Committee on Budgets."
"This plan was published on 13 February and was, therefore, unable to take into account the crisis caused by the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, two areas infected with which were discovered in the United Kingdom in February."
"In these circumstances, I believe it should be stressed to the House that the current number of cases already represents a potential cost of over EUR 170 million, and that, on 8 May, the Commission quite rightly proposed establishing a reserve of EUR 1 billion."
"The first is a direct cost to the Community budget, which still has not been defined but which is regularly increased. The second is a negative impact on beef and veal consumption and exports and lastly, the third is an impact on animal destruction programmes and, as a result, on slaughter costs."
"In addition to the Commission' s proposals, we must therefore be well aware that we are up against a major problem."
"All the financial forecasts of beef consumption and exports are approximate, since they do not take into account the consequences of the recent outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease."
"It is my view, therefore, that beef and veal consumption in 2001 will, unfortunately, fall by more than the 10.8%, forecast by the Commission."
"It is also unlikely that exports in 2001 will reach 60% of the GATT limit."
"The financial requirements could well, therefore, be higher than the Commission' s forecasts."
"We all understand that, in normal circumstances, financial inaccuracies would have been enough to justify a refusal but, given the urgent nature of the situation, the Committee on Budgets decided to support the Commission' s proposal and it hoped that Parliament would approve the amendments, as the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have been able to, thanks to the excellent work by Robert Sturdy, while requesting a prior consultation of the budgetary authority should the costs incurred need to be revised."
"Mr President, Commissioner, limiting the number of bulls for which premiums are payable to ninety per farm, one of the points in the Commission' s seven-point plan, is unlikely to prove effective in matching beef production to demand in the European Union."
"It is universally accepted that, in view of the fall in beef consumption, cattle farming cannot be sustained at the accustomed level."
"But let me say, Commissioner, that the burden of this reduction must not be distributed unfairly to the detriment of particular regions."
"If we want to speak about a new regime of premium entitlements, we cannot base such a regime on an absolute ceiling, as the Commission proposes, but on a solution that is reasonable for all farms, a point that Mr Sturdy has already made."
"Such a solution can only be based on the amount of available grassland or, perhaps better still, on the input of working hours, in other words on the number of farmhands employed in accordance with the laws and regulations - and let me stress that last proviso."
"Incidentally, if you remember, we have held this discussion already. We held it when we were discussing the organisation of the market in beef and veal in the context of the debate on Agenda 2000."
"But when you write, Commissioner Fischler, in your reply to a letter from the Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development that there is only one derogation from the 90-head rule in the new Länder of the Federal Republic of Germany and that the reduction there ought now to result in structural change, you are missing the point that the number of persons employed in agriculture in those regions has fallen in the last ten years from 800 000 to 150 000."
"May I say to the Commission that this is quite enough structural change!"
"Or, if I may resort to sarcasm, do you perhaps want to solve the beef problem at the expense of these new Länder in eastern Germany, thereby ensuring that the farms there will be forced to shut down?"
"Why, in fact, can we not contemplate a tighter squeeze on premium payments on the basis of stocking density per hectare of forage area?"
"You have provided for a reduction from 2 to 1.8 livestock units."
"But I should like to see a different system, one which would render the 90-head premium limit superfluous."
"Just imagine it were left to the farmer' s discretion to decide how drastically he cut down the number of his cattle below the density threshold at which premiums became payable."
"For this, however, the farmer would have to receive an additional compensatory payment corresponding to the extent of the voluntary reduction."
"This could be called beef set-aside, by analogy with fruit and vegetable production, because we spend considerable amounts on set-aside premiums for non-production in those domains too."
"If this system were to result in a lower level of beef production, it would be right and proper for us to reward those farmers who trim the size of their herds in such a natural way instead of producing surpluses which cannot be marketed and may even have to be destroyed."
"Perhaps, Commissioner, you could take to this idea."
"Your conversion need not be immediate!"
"Mr President, as has already been said, the reform presented to us by the Commission on 13 February 2001, as a package of seven measures to deal with the problems created in the beef market by the BSE crisis, clearly deserves critical consideration by our Group."
"Firstly because, while the Community cattle sector is hoping for measures to solve the crisis it is facing, only two of the measures in this package appear to be appropriate for resolving one particular crisis, that is, the Commission' s budgetary crisis in relation to solving it."
"Only the removal of the ceiling on public intervention of 350 000 tonnes for meat, with a view to preventing the implementation of the so-called safety network intervention system, seems to be a genuine crisis measure, as well as the measure - already approved by the management committee for meat on 16 March - of introducing a new intervention method for the sale and storage of animals of more than 30 months."
"Please allow me to say also, Commissioner, that this measure does little to improve consumer confidence and to resolve the market problems, since we are storing meat which will later have to enter the market, thereby creating significant imbalances within that market."
"The other five measures are really directed at the sector, but they are not urgent and they can enter into force and have their effects in the short and medium term."
"These measures should really have been proposed with the calmness required for a reform in a sector suffering such a deep crisis."
"However, I must be absolutely critical in relation to two of them."
"One is the removal of the national limit on premiums for male cattle by means of individual laws;"
"I believe that this measure is wrong and would lead us to a market of quotas, which would be closed and narrow, and would do absolutely nothing for the transparency and simplification of the CAP nor a future reform of this sector."
"The other is the restriction of production, as intended, by means of the reduction in the premium for suckler cows."
"Commissioner, this proposal, which lays down that, in order to receive the premium for suckler cows, between 20 and 40% of the animals for which the premium is requested must be heifers, is intended to reduce the quantity of meat available on the market; but what it removes is quality meat which originates from herds of suckler cows bred within extensive systems."
"This measure therefore has the completely wrong objective and is clearly contrary to the often-repeated objective of Community agricultural policy promoting extensive agriculture."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner, but first and foremost I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Sturdy, for an outstanding report, many parts of which I can support."
"It is, of course, necessary to intervene in some respects in order to remedy the problems that do after all exist in the beef sector, but I would like to emphasise that consumers' lack of confidence has nothing to do with whether meat is produced on an intensive or extensive basis."
"I would like to stress that a reintroduction of the 90-head limit will have very serious consequences for some countries in particular."
"It will result in more bureaucracy and it will not provide any relief whatsoever in connection with the consumption of beef, which is after all what we need just now."
"With regard to the buy-up scheme, I would like to say that it is not an aim in itself to buy up animals in order either to put them into cold storage or subsequently destroy them."
"Consequently, we have proposed that we donate the healthy tested beef to areas that need crisis help."
"We can do this very easily for the costs associated with the intervention buy-up."
"I would, then, like to draw the Chamber' s attention to the fact that the proposal to tighten up the stocking density requirement, namely by reducing the number of livestock units per hectare from 2 to 1.8, will not have the desired effect either."
"Nonetheless, we agree that the intervention ceiling should be abolished for the years 2001 and 2002."
"However, with these few but - I hope, Commissioner - clear comments, we would like to support your proposal but, at the same time, also draw attention to the fact that we should not, through the new decisions we make, contribute to maintaining the distortion of competition that currently exists between some of the Member States."
"Mr President, Commissioner, several points in the Commission' s crisis plan for the beef market have already been dealt with, of course."
"The slaughter programme has gone through the administrative process, and we dealt with clover ley here in a debate on matters of topical and urgent importance."
"So let us now concentrate on the things that remain to be discussed."
"I essentially wish to confine my remarks to the 90-head limit."
"It should be made clear that this ceiling already applies in Europe but is not compulsory."
"That was the big mistake in Berlin."
"It would have been better to have adopted the proposal we made in Parliament at that time to the effect that there should be an additional mechanism in the degressive premium model to make allowance for the cost of labour."
"This idea has now been taken up again, as the speakers from the other groups have made clear."
"I hope the Commission will adopt this proposal, so that we can give farms with higher livestock populations the opportunity at least to adjust this 90-head limit."
"As a result, larger farms with species-related husbandry methods involving additional labour inputs would have a means of obtaining reimbursement of their costs."
"I believe we would then have made this limit less rigid as well as having introduced an enlightened social factor."
"I hope that the House agrees and that it will vote accordingly tomorrow."
"Mr President, Agenda 2000 sets out the key indicators for the domains of agricultural, structural and finance policy in the EU for the period from 2000 to 2006."
"Its aim was to sever the link between aid and production levels in the relevant product markets while keeping the loss of income and jobs within reasonable bounds, an aim which was formulated at a time when the restructuring process seemed destined to run fairly smoothly."
"After the outbreaks of BSE and foot-and-mouth disease, the beef and veal markets collapsed with no sign of an early return to stability."
"Farmers are counting on the additional special funds being provided now rather than disappearing in an interminable bureaucratic labyrinth."
"The promises made in the initial weeks of the crisis regarding the special purchase scheme must first be honoured."
"Incorporating this scheme into long-term plans to alter the organisation of the market in beef and veal will exacerbate the financial situation of beef producers."
"The present draft amendment to the Regulation on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal essentially fulfils the Commission' s aim of reducing the oversupply of these products."
"Some of the proposals, however, have nothing at all to do with the consequences of BSE and foot-and-mouth disease."
"The quality of products is not automatically better if a farm is bigger or is managed in a particular way."
"Present market trends are unlikely to act as an incentive to invest in beef production."
"The fixing of any form of ceiling for the payment of support is therefore an unwarranted additional financial burden on those who have already made investments."
"Farmers depend on this income, and the 90-head limit will certainly be resisted."
"Mr President, we have, on several occasions, stated that the best way of improving the situation of the zootechnical sector in Europe is to restore consumer confidence in the operators of the sector."
"In order to achieve this goal, I feel that, first and foremost, it is vital for the institutions to ensure that the information they issue is correct and that appropriate terms are used to inform the public about BSE."
"Talking about contamination, mad cow disease or infected meat does nothing to encourage the consumer to buy beef or veal."
"BSE was not caused by a virus or a bacterium, and so we must prevent the use of inappropriate terminology generating phobias or psychosis among consumers."
"What I am saying is part of the debate seeking to ensure that consumers are provided with correct, comprehensive information without creating futile panic."
"Ensuring that information issued is correct is the most effective way of encouraging consumers to start buying beef and veal again, and this is much more important than any economic support the European Union may provide or any subsidising of farmers."
"Mr President, Commissioner, European cattle farmers are being dealt heavy blows."
"The huge drop in the consumption of beef and veal as a result of the BSE crisis has put the price of meat under heavy pressure, and consumption and exports have fallen even further in the wake of the foot and mouth crisis."
"It is evident that the sector needs help."
"However, the contingency plan suggested by the Commission appears to be a plan which will only restrict the production of beef and veal in the long term."
"Commissioner, changing a common organisation of the market to have a long-term effect is something which we would term a reform, rather than a contingency plan."
"Fortunately, the rapporteur, Mr Sturdy has included a number of amendments in his report which could serve as a contingency plan, namely by encouraging cattle breeders to have bulls slaughtered while they are still calves."
"The measure to restrict animal premiums per cattle farm to a maximum of 90 animals, provided that the number of livestock units is reduced from 2 to 1.8 per hectare, will cut down production in due course."
"The fact is, however, that, in this way, cattle farmers are not only affected by the existing crisis, they are also being hit financially by the Commission."
"I therefore also support the amendments which propose increasing the premium for animals in proportion to the reduction in the number of livestock units, so that the financial incentive to produce more is actually being taken away from farmers."
"Abolishing the intervention ceiling, a purchase scheme to which the Member States contribute, will enable the Commission to exercise the highest possible level of influence on the market price."
"It keeps the costly safety net principle, which is funded 100% from the EU budget, at bay for the time being."
"Unlike Mr Sturdy, I am in favour of storing, rather than destroying, the meat purchased."
"I would remind this Parliament of the foot and mouth resolution which it adopted in April and which urged that healthy animals should not be destroyed."
"Agriculture is all about what we received from God in Creation."
"It transcends economic interests and is all about ethics and responsible stewardship."
"The current proposal from the European Commission is intended to compensate beef and veal producers for the huge instability that the market has suffered in recent months as a result of the successive crises to have hit the sector."
"I understand the reasons behind this proposal and especially its timing, but I think it is quite inadequate, for the following reasons: first of all, I find it unacceptable that the special premium for male cattle should be reduced, if only temporarily."
"Secondly, it is hard to understand the creation of the special system of intervention buying for meat from animals over thirty months old either from the point of view of consumer confidence or that of cost, given that, even in a few months, it will still be impossible to dispose of meat that is stockpiled now."
"It would be more sensible to buy these animals in order to destroy the meat."
"Thirdly, encouraging extensive production makes sense but this must be accompanied with a special premium entitlement for small farms, which will not benefit from these incentives because they cover too small an area."
"We are insisting once again on applying the 'one size fits all' approach, as if all farms had the same capacity to adapt and to survive."
"Finally, authorising organic farmers to use set-aside land for fodder - the subject of Mrs Auroi' s report - can only be seen as symbolic at a time when producers are facing increased feed costs for their livestock."
"Why are we not allowing farmers to use set-aside land for protein crops?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I too would like to praise the work that our fellow Member, Mr Sturdy, has carried out on the issue of amending the COM in beef and veal, following the BSE crisis."
"We are faced with several problems: we need to address the imbalance in the beef and veal market, support farmers' income and restore consumer confidence."
"With regard to addressing the imbalance between supply and demand, first of all, I would like to point out that no one here and that includes the Commission, the rapporteur and the Committee on Agriculture is suggesting that we leave it simply to the effects of the free market."
"I would like to think that the need to regulate supply, as we have to do today, will also be uppermost in our minds when we tackle the new, further-reaching reform of the common agricultural policy."
"To return to the issue that we are dealing with today and in view of the reduced level that production must fall to, I would like to stress how crucial it is that we find a balance in the division of efforts required, on the one hand, by suckler herds and milk herds, and by industrial rearing methods and farms using grazing."
"It would be ironic, just when the need to produce quality beef and veal by encouraging the use of grass is acknowledged, if it is the traditional suckler herds that are the cause of the main expenses of this COM' s new adjustments."
"I therefore ask that the 90 head limit be reinstated in order to qualify for the special premium, which supports the Commission' s point of view."
"I am not neglecting the fact that the Member States who have waived this limit as part of Agenda 2000 could come up against some problems."
"Since Amendment No 12 of Article 1 introduces the possibility of taking into account wage costs, however, I believe that this measure is fair."
"In the same way, I believe that the farmers who are already being penalised by the fall in market prices must not be punished further by a reduction in government support for cutting their numbers of cows per hectare."
"I would also like to draw the Commission and the Council' s attention to this issue so that the level of premiums per hectare of forage area remains unchanged."
"As for the other points, naturally, I would also like to voice my support for not applying the ceiling for buying into public intervention of 350 000 tonnes of beef and veal per year in 2001 and 2002 as well as my support for the steps advocated by the rapporteur to promote beef and veal products."
"Mr President, the seven-point plan was proposed, as we are all aware, in response to serious concerns about falling consumer confidence in beef and the resulting pressure on the intervention ceiling."
"We understand that these concerns have abated somewhat in recent weeks and that consumption forecasts have now improved significantly."
"If the Commission still believes that emergency measures should be introduced to inhibit over-supply in the beef and veal sector then these changes should not jeopardise the long-term future of the quality, grass-fed beef sector."
"For this reason we would oppose any alteration to the existing rules for suckler cow premia and beef special premia."
"Attention should instead - in our view - be focused on the removal of surplus calves from the system."
"Whilst respecting the aims of Agenda 2000 we would therefore seek renewed justification from the Commission of the need for such radical proposals and would call for the re-evaluation of these measures."
"Mr President, the draft Council regulation and the parliamentary report are confined to the purely administrative aspects of the problem of BSE and make no provision for any substantial procedure for identifying and combating the causes."
"No mention is made of the role of the multinationals which, in order to maximise their profits, ignore the consequences of their unacceptable feeding methods and are only interested in containing the inevitable shock waves and crisis on the beef and veal market."
"At the same time, by proposing measures to generalise and reduce the rates of growth in livestock farming, the European Union is treating all Member States the same and this is intolerable."
"In other words, it treats production in developed livestock farming countries and in countries such as Greece, which is less self-sufficient and where production systems are less likely to have fostered the emergence of this disease, in the same way."
"If the European Union really wanted to deal with the problem, it would treat production in countries such as Greece differently by cancelling all quotas for the expenditure incurred and covering it by reducing support for livestock production in the countries which are responsible for these health problems."
"The ban on the use of meal and bonemeal should be finalised and measures taken to change the system of prices and subsidies so as to encourage the production of fodder crops to replace meat and bonemeal."
"Mr President, I congratulate Mr Sturdy on his work."
"The reform of Europe's beef regime is necessary for market balance and the restoration of consumer confidence."
"It must, however, be done in a manner which safeguards the interests of family farming as distinct from intensive production."
"Reasonable margins for farmers must be central to any restructuring proposals."
"Without farmers we will not have a beef sector."
"Already, many farmers are leaving the sector."
"It is right to plan the future of Europe's beef sector based on extensification and traceability."
"As regards trade liberalisation, I wonder what steps will be taken to protect European producers from the unfair competition from third country imports where the same rules do not apply."
"I have serious reservations about the individualisation of the male beef premia."
"It is complicated and administratively difficult."
"Likewise on supply control, it is wrong to target the suckler herd which is the foundation of quality beef production."
"The proposal to set up a national purchase scheme should, in my view, be re-examined."
"In the present climate the storage of beef for later sale will hot help to reduce volume, and do little for consumer confidence."
"Finally, it would be wrong to draw panic conclusions - as Mr Sturdy already said - on the long-term sustainability of Europe's beef sector during this very depressed period resulting from the BSE and foot-and-mouth crises."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we have discussed the subject of beef and veal and the crisis in the sector a great many times in recent months."
"It is important that our institutions concentrate on developing a European production model, a model that must, of course, suit many different national situations which, in some parts of Europe, have different production characteristics."
"I would now like to comment very briefly on the Sturdy report itself."
"Firstly, we consider it essential to limit the effect that would arise if the Member States were given the possibility of amending or derogating from the ceiling of 90 head per holding."
"This production increase is, in actual fact, insignificant, while the derogation is essential in certain production contexts and does not in itself contribute to production intensification."
"Similarly, the plan to introduce individual rights into the system of special premiums does not appear to take account of the usual production customs of large parts of the Community, which are characterised by the presence of specialised holdings which do not manage the entire breeding cycle but only the last stages."
"Secondly, in the light, apart from anything else, of the definitive ban on animal meals and of the requirement to use vegetable proteins alone, there will have to be a heated debate on the Blair House Agreement and it will have to be revised on the basis of the requirements of European production."
"Finally, we consider extremely important the support and enhancement and promotion actions implemented across the sectors."
"It is just as important that we attempt to do this on a Community basis, above all, rather than on a national basis as before, because it is only in Europe that we can provide a response to the demands and requirements of the consumer."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as we have already said, the backdrop to Mr Sturdy' s report is the dramatic context, both for farmers and consumers, we should remember, of the BSE crisis and the resources put in place to eradicate it."
"Commissioner, one of the seven measures that you proposed several months ago is today being proposed for implementation."
"This is, in addition to using set-aside land to grow protein plants, a step in the right direction, even if, in the opinion of the Group of the Greens, it is still not enough."
"Mr Sturdy has tried to push the Commission position on farmers further, by dealing with other aspects of beef production."
"On the other hand, he has not considered a serious problem of fraud in the BSE crisis."
"Now, Commissioner, I suppose that you too have seen the latest report by AFSSA (the French Agency for Food Safety), which has been well-documented and is damning on this issue."
"It shows that the cases of animals suffering from BSE, described as naïve and, more often, extremely dumb, are caused by the fraudulent use of bone meal from carcasses in animal foods."
"We therefore need urgent measures to step up checks and sanctions."
"The health of consumers depends on this, as does consumer confidence."
"The second point that I would like to draw your attention to is that the measures proposed by the Commission are moving towards extensification whilst relieving a saturated market, but there is a risk that the special premium for cutting headage of male cattle per hectare will have no effect unless a ceiling is imposed on surface areas, since the advocates of high productivity may attempt to claw back this premium, which is not intended for them, by increasing surface areas, which are, in any case, already high in their case."
"We should therefore do our best to encourage small holdings, which are endangered and threatened by the latest food crises, and this is what I hope you will soon be doing."
"NGL). (EL) Mr President, I have a question to put to Commissioner Fischler."
"When Commissioner Fischler passes, as all of us must, to the other side - although not for a long time I trust - and he meets St. Francis of Assisi who asks him: 'Commissioner, why so much slaughter for nothing?"
"Why so many animals stored without ever getting to market?' what will he reply?"
"What I mean is that we have arrived at a certain point."
"We are in a period of crisis."
"Of course, compensation has to be paid, including to the holdings responsible for the crisis, if they are not to go under completely."
"But, at the same time, we need to break away from the outmoded concept of industrialised, intensive livestock farming."
"In this sense, I think that, while dealing with the crisis, the Commission' s measures should look to find an alternative model."
"And a distinction should be made between the countries which are responsible for the crisis, which invented BSE, and the countries which protected and still protect the European Union, between importing countries and countries which saturate the market with exports and ruin the budget and between small and large companies, so that we can move towards a model of small, ecological livestock holdings."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that the subjects of BSE and foot-and-mouth disease have disappeared somewhat from the headlines, and with good reason. Thank goodness for that!"
"In my view, their absence from the front pages will do more than anything else to restore consumer confidence."
"Commissioner Fischler, I should like to appeal to you to accept the amendments in the Sturdy report, because referring the report back to committee after the vote would only cause delays, as far as I can see."
"I could not explain such delays to the farmers, consumers and voters back home."
"What are we actually asking for?"
"The first thing is that the goalposts should not be shifted in the middle of the game."
"The rules were laid down in Berlin."
"We are calling for the reintroduction of a limit of 90 head of cattle."
"I believe this is something upon which all of us, from our widely diverse regions, really must continue to insist at the present juncture."
"As for the plan to reduce the stocking density to 1.8 livestock units per hectare from 1 January 2002, I must tell you in all honesty that I am also at a loss to explain this to the farmers in my region."
"Another lesson we must learn relates to the repeated references to alternative production methods."
"I believe that organic farms are a good thing, but they are no panacea, because we are already seeing that there is too little purchasing power and too few markets for their produce."
"It is my opinion that the amendments could be accepted as they stand - time forbids me to repeat the wording of each one - from my point of view and perhaps from your perspective too."
"And last but not least, our guiding principle throughout this sector should be the need to produce safe food. Safety cannot be regulated with premiums."
"Safe products are the key to the restoration of a stable beef and veal market."
"I would like to congratulate Robert Sturdy on bringing forward a common-sense report here."
"I would also call upon the Commission to accept the recommendations."
"Otherwise the report should be referred back to committee, because the key to European beef production is quality, and that is what we can sell to the consumer."
"I think we have to take out the poor-quality calves that are born so that in the long run we can produce quality beef."
"An attack on suckler cows and their numbers is exactly the wrong way to go, because this is very much quality, grass-fed beef, in which the consumer has great confidence."
"We need to take a much more positive approach to selling beef again."
"I think the UK has shown that."
"We have now returned to consumption above that of the 1996 level, therefore we need to move forward."
"The 90-head limit is wrong and to bring in individual claims will be a bureaucratic nightmare."
"We really have to move forward."
"Destruction is also the key."
"If you are going to have a buy-up scheme for the over thirty-month cattle, then for goodness sake destroy them, do not bring them back onto the market at a future date, because this will be lower-quality beef, and if you are not very careful, this will actually destroy the future recovery of the market."
"Mr Busk made a good point."
"If these cattle over thirty months old are tested and found not to have BSE, why cannot they be provided as aid in the future."
"Why do we have then to destroy them?"
"What we cannot do is to put them onto the European market."
"So I think the long-term solution is to take on board Robert Sturdy's report."
"Let us go out and sell good-quality European beef to the consumer."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have focused particular attention on a point that has come in for a degree of criticism from some other MEPs, namely the introduction of the 90-head rule."
"I regard the introduction of this rule as an entirely desirable step, for two reasons: firstly, because it releases funds which we could use to assist smaller farms and family holdings wherever possible and, secondly, because it accords with a certain principle of equality."
"In our economic legislation we have support systems for enterprises with up to 50 employees, for enterprises with up to 250 employees and for those enterprises with a payroll in excess of 250 employees."
"In the farming world, I do not see the logic behind the special treatment of large agricultural holdings."
"It seems to me that our policies will not bear fruit in the future unless we make a point of supporting the small and family-run farms, the protection of the landscape and environmentally beneficial soil cultivation, especially in ecologically sensitive areas, instead of pouring a considerable percentage of our financial resources into large farming businesses."
"In my view, there is no justification for us in the long term to go on having the lion' s share of our aid resources creamed off by farms with thousands of animals, nor will the people of Europe accept such a situation."
"I therefore hope that the Commission' s proposal will be adopted."
"I know that my opinion differs from those of my group and of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, but I nevertheless hope that we can keep the 90-head rule as proposed by the Commission."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Ladies and gentlemen, before moving on to the Commission communication, and before welcoming Mr Prodi, I have some distressing information to share with you."
"Gorka Landaburu, a very well-known Basque journalist, was very seriously injured this morning in a horrific parcel bomb attack."
"His life is not in any danger, but I would like to send, on behalf of all of us, our wishes for a speedy recovery."
"I would simply like to say that, on the day after elections were held in the Basque country, in which the great majority of Basque people renounced violence, this latest attack on the freedom of expression has achieved nothing, other than to disgust us and arouse our deep concern."
"Sustainable development strategy"
"The next item is the Commission communication on the sustainable development strategy."
"I shall now give the floor to Mr Prodi."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, ""sustainable development is any development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs"" ."
"This concept, formulated by the Brundtland Commission in 1987, laid the foundations for the Rio declarations."
"The European Union committed itself to translating this concept into concrete strategies in time for the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development."
"We are, therefore, coming to the end of a long story and I am pleased to inform you that, today, the Commission has voted on - or rather, has adopted - its proposal for a European Union strategy for sustainable development as part of our preparations for this World summit."
"Sustainable development is indeed a fundamental goal of the EU and has been one of the main aims of European integration since its incorporation into the new Article 2 of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"It is, therefore, very appropriate that sustainable development should have been given such a prominent place."
"It used to be seen as a luxury, but it is now increasingly recognised that there are a number of major trends giving cause for concern that we need to address now - before it is too late."
"Some of these trends, like global warming of the atmosphere or the loss of biodiversity, concern vital aspects of the earth's ecological functioning on which the fate of humanity depends."
"However, the subject of sustainable development should not be seen as all doom and gloom."
"The real challenge of a sustainable development policy is, in fact, to ensure that economic growth, social cohesion and environmental protection can go hand in hand."
"In this regard, further technological progress and the use of cost-effective, economically acceptable instruments will be critical."
"If we structure our policies intelligently and announce our long-term targets in good time, our economies will not find it too hard to pursue the path of sustainable development."
"The strategy paper the Commission has adopted today seeks to lay the foundations for the European Union strategy, which should - and must - be adopted by the forthcoming European Council on 15/16 June in Gothenburg."
"The paper is our response to the invitation issued in Helsinki in December 1999 to ""prepare a proposal for a long-term strategy dovetailing policies for economically, socially and ecologically sustainable development"" ."
"As well as featuring on the agenda of the Gothenburg Summit, I expect this subject to be one of the points discussed with President Bush at the bilateral meeting prior to Gothenburg."
"What is the strategy we are proposing and which we have adopted today?"
"First and foremost, this strategy is the first step in a two-stage approach."
"Firstly, we are committed to assuming all our responsibilities at international level and thus displaying total solidarity in this field."
"We intend to ensure that all our policies help to promote global sustainable development."
"Once we have put our own affairs in order, we shall insist that other developed countries accept their responsibilities as well."
"We also wish to place sustainable development on the agenda of all the international institutions."
"Secondly, promoting sustainable development means linking and integrating the economic, social and environmental objectives of our societies."
"Unless we make our policies more coherent, progress towards sustainable development will be very limited."
"For the strategy to succeed, we need to move beyond the abstract discussion of concepts and definitions of sustainability: we have to translate the Brundtland concept into action."
"To overcome sectoral resistance and set goals that meet long-term requirements, we need incisive policies and ambitious decisions. And, of course, to achieve this, we need the individual and collective commitment of the citizens."
"Governments can set the reference frameworks but, ultimately, sustainable development can only come about if people and businesses make the right consumption and investment decisions."
"The Commission is taking up this challenge by proposing horizontal measures to improve the overall effectiveness of our policies."
"These measures are designed to ensure, in particular, four things."
"Firstly, that when policy is drafted in any particular field, its likely implications, good or bad, for any other policy areas are identified."
"Secondly, that all policies have sustainable development as their central concern."
"In particular, tangible sustainable development criteria must become guiding principles in future reviews of common policies such as the common agricultural, fisheries and transport policies and also in other sectors."
"Thirdly, that subsidies which encourage wasteful use of natural resources are removed."
"This is an area in which we will have to take courageous decisions."
"Fourthly, sustainable development depends on the daily investment, consumption and mobility decisions of millions of businesses and consumers."
"Widespread willingness to explain and active support for sustainable development is therefore essential."
"Thus, we want to encourage businesses to take an active approach in this field, inviting, for example, all publicly quoted companies with at least 500 staff to include in their annual reports an assessment of performance against economic, environmental and social yardsticks."
"The third feature focuses clearly on the risks we will have to face in our endeavours to promote sustainable development."
"In addition to the more horizontal measures, we are proposing a number of clear objectives and measures at European Union level to tackle what we consider to be the risks of affirming the principle of sustainable development."
"You may remember that, in March, we identified some alarming trends of irreversible deterioration in six areas: climate change, poverty and social exclusion, the ageing population, traffic, the diminishing of natural resources and loss of biodiversity and, lastly, threats to public health."
"These trends affect us all, and in order to halt them we have to take specific, incisive action, and we have to do so now since, in many cases, we have now reached the limit."
"The recent European Councils at Lisbon, Nice and Stockholm have already decided upon ambitious, objective measures for combating poverty and social exclusion and for dealing with the social implications of an ageing society, so we are not proposing any new initiatives in these two areas."
"However, I want to stress that they - the social sectors - are an integral part of the European Union's strategy for sustainable development, on an equal footing with the environment and public health."
"In the other four areas, however, we are proposing new and, I would add, ambitious objectives."
"Not surprisingly, the most ambitious proposals are also the most controversial."
"To combat climate change, for example, we are proposing, in addition to our Kyoto commitments, further reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 1% of their 1990 levels every year until 2020."
"We are proposing more ambitious environmental targets for energy taxation, and phasing out all subsidies for fossil fuel production and consumption by 2010."
"These are all proposals which will require quite a high level of political and economic change."
"Obviously, steps will have to be taken to develop alternative sources of employment for redundant miners or the fields affected, and we will also need to think about the specific situation of coal in some candidate countries, within the framework of the accession negotiations."
"Lastly, the measures we are proposing include the goal that, by 2010, alternative fuels, including biofuels, should account for at least 7% of all the fuel consumed by cars and trucks."
"To address threats to public health, we propose to ensure that, by 2020, chemicals are produced and used only in ways that do not pose significant threats to human health and the environment, and to redirect support from the common agricultural policy to ensuring healthy products and promoting quality rather than quantity."
"This will mean, for example - it seems to be a popular idea - phasing out subsidies to tobacco producers."
"Here, as well, we will need to develop alternative sources of income and activity for, apart from anything else, in some cases, these productions are in extremely poor areas."
"This is, therefore, a policy which will require a great deal of coordination."
"Our proposals to improve the transport system include disassociating transport growth from growth in Gross Domestic Product and ensuring that the share of road transport in 2010 is no greater than in 1998, the most recent year for which data are available."
"This is a goal that may seem minor but which will require considerable change and investment."
"These are a few examples of our proposals for Gothenburg. They do not illustrate all the decisions taken but they are sufficient to show clearly that translating these measures into real legislation will require strong political leadership."
"Fourth and finally, the credibility of any strategy depends on effective monitoring of its implementation and on review mechanisms."
"The Stockholm European Council decided that all aspects of sustainable development should be reviewed at the annual Spring Council."
"Therefore, measuring our progress each spring will mean adding a number of indicators to those already agreed upon in Lisbon."
"These indicators will develop naturally from the long-term objectives and targets the Commission is proposing in its strategy paper for Gothenburg."
"For the strategy to succeed, the Commission believes that the working methods of all the European Union institutions also need to be changed, starting with ourselves."
"At all stages of the Community legislative process, there is, in fact, an unfortunate tendency to develop and discuss policy proposals without paying sufficient attention to the connections between different policy areas."
"The way the Commission and, I believe, the Council and Parliament are currently organised reinforces this narrow, sectoral approach."
"We must therefore consider what steps should be taken to remove the sectoral barriers that prevent us from developing policies with sustainable development as their core concern across the board."
"The Commission, for its part, will establish a sustainable development 'Round Table' of independent advisors who will report directly to the President of the Commission."
"Their work will be taken into account when we prepare the overview report in December every year."
"They will also make recommendations on how to make the main body of Community policies more coherent."
"We feel - although this is just a proposal - that it might be useful for Parliament and the Council to establish similar bodies, which would help us to sustain ongoing, constructive dialogue."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that if the practical proposals outlined today can be successfully translated into legislation, this will give the European Union a good chance of becoming, in the long term, a more just society, which has much more respect for man and the environment."
"If we are to deliver a better quality of life for ourselves and our children, we need to make sustainable development something which all Europeans see as relevant and exciting, not just the experts."
"Sacrifices may be needed initially but major benefits will be reaped in the long term."
"What we cannot do is sit back and let present trends continue."
"We do not expect to change the world at Gothenburg, but what we must do is send out a signal that attitudes and behaviour need to be changed."
"Europe must set the standard in this area, and we are making every endeavour to ensure that this new undertaking gets off to a good start."
"Madam President, I am absolutely delighted that Mr Prodi and the Commission are giving priority to sustainable development."
"Nevertheless, I would like to say that, in this regard, there is an issue which is never discussed and which I believe is a part of European tradition, an issue which we should take into account: man."
"We are always talking about the biodiversity of nature, but we do not take account of the fact that, within our programmes in general, there is a lack of projects and working programmes concerning man' s environment: both the natural environment and, above all, the urban environment, where man actually lives."
"Sustainability must take account of the fact that, in today' s world, we cannot draw a distinction between the artificial setting and the natural setting."
"The city is an artificial setting which is just as important as a natural setting. We must bear in mind that we cannot allow our heritage to be destroyed, our cities to be destroyed, the environment to be destroyed, without calculating the consequences for man."
"The city is the setting for the greatest injustices, it is the setting which we must take care of in order to prevent marginalisation."
"Therefore, if we do not introduce the urban environment and the historic environment, which have made up our European identity, we will lose a great part of our personality."
"Salvador de Madariaga said that man is the only tree which picks up its roots and walks."
"Well, I believe this is an important issue which we must take into account; that there is a rootlessness in our society; that we must take account of the settings in which man lives, because that is where the greatest environmental problems take place, as well as the greatest cultural problems."
"Therefore, let us look after that environment and bear in mind that, although the biodiversity of ways of life and settings is important, I believe that the European Union is currently moving away to a large extent from sustainability, in the sense that only gigantic projects are given massive funding, as in the case of the URBAN project."
"One of the principles of sustainability is to deal with issues at the smallest level."
"That, ladies and gentlemen, is what I ask in order to achieve sustainability."
"Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines, although I cannot say that I agree with all you have said, the point you are making is clearly extremely valid."
"I do not, of course, agree that the European institutions are not starting to respond."
"We have made substantial changes precisely to our strategy in promoting regional development, which will reduce the economic disparities between the different regions and sustain a balance between rural and urban communities, and, in this regard, we have observed the recommendations made in the proposal for European spatial development."
"Certainly, the basic situation is as you have described it, but, in my view, what we are doing is an improvement, although probably not to the extent that is necessary."
"In any case, the Gothenburg Summit should give us fresh impetus to stride out along the path you have indicated."
"Mr President, Mr Prodi, you spoke a moment ago about sustainable development which is to take place worldwide."
"You specified a number of initiatives which apply to Europe."
"That is fine."
"There is also a debate surrounding the question of whether European businesses should perhaps not only report on the social and environmental standards which they apply within Europe, but also on the social and environmental standards which they apply when they invest abroad."
"What if they invest in Asia, Africa or Latin America?"
"Might it not be a good idea to enter into a dialogue with large businesses on the question of whether they should maintain European environmental standards, even if they invest in Taiwan, Namibia or Brazil?"
"A large company such as Volkswagen is already developing that strategy."
"In that way, Europe could do something for the environment outside Europe, and that is a practical initiative."
"We might need to make this strategy compulsory after a number of years, but we need to enter into a dialogue with large-scale industry in the first instance."
"I agree with what you say, Mr de Roo, but we must be realistic and implement what you are calling for in Europe first of all, assiduously and incisively."
"Only then can we make this demand in cases where investments are made outside Europe."
"You are absolutely right: if there is one immediate effect of globalisation, it is the need for the same rules governing these issues throughout the world."
"However, in my opinion, for the time being, our task is to be assiduous in ensuring that these matters are respected in the European Union, at least."
"In any case, we still have a long way to go before we reach that point."
"Madam President, I have listened with interest to what Mr Prodi said."
"He has some very good ideas."
"A lot can be achieved but clearly it has to be done step by step."
"And the rather eclectic list of issues he has listed - the outcome of which is not yet clear - are going in one direction."
"However, one thing that does not require any new legislation, as he has proposed, and which will take us on some important first steps towards sustainability is clearly and simply the implementation and enforcement of existing environmental legislation within the Union."
"If this is done within the next five years, we will not need any new studies or legislation and it will be a shining example to the candidate countries of what they must do to become members of the Union."
"Will the Commissioner tell me what he is going to do about that?"
"What you have just said reiterates my answer to the last question: we must implement the legislation in Europe first and then outside as well."
"However, you have asked me a different question, referring to the candidate countries too."
"I can assure you that the environmental chapter is one of the four most problematic chapters."
"When I am asked which chapters of enlargement are the most complex, I reply: agriculture, the environment, the Structural Funds and labour mobility issues."
"These are thus areas which require us to discuss the most intricate matters on a case by case basis."
"As regards environmental issues, we have even gone so far as deciding to make exceptions for certain EBRD measures and certain aid measures intended to relieve tragic situations outside the Union as well as within, authorising EIB investments in Saint Petersburg and Kaliningrad, precisely in an attempt to make environmental issues a top priority."
"I have to say that, in many cases, we will be forced to introduce, not necessarily moratoria, but transitional periods on these issues, considering the complexity of the investments and that the appalling underdevelopment of these countries will make it impossible to balance the situation very quickly."
"Madam President, you referred to Saint Petersburg and the June Summit, but you in fact have another Summit this week - with Russia."
"How are you going to address the issue of sustainable development in the discussions at the Summit with Mr Putin?"
"Are you going to touch upon the issue of energy conservation?"
"Are you going to broach the sensitive subject of new energy extraction in Arctic areas?"
"Will you be going on to produce a report on the way in which Russia has complied with its earlier commitments from the previous Summit between the EU and Russia in which one of the promises made was to protect the environment in the Bay of Finland when constructing the harbour in Primorsk?"
"Will you be demanding that Russia ratify the Esbo Convention on environmental impact assessment in a transboundary context?"
"I am just mentioning some of the areas you touched upon at the most recent Summit."
"The situation in the Bay of Finland is very sensitive because a port is in the process of being constructed in Primorsk."
"I am indeed leaving for Moscow, where the Summit is due to start tomorrow evening."
"One of the fundamental points concerns, in particular - I have to admit, thanks to the responsible, constructive insistence by Finland and the Nordic countries - precisely the environmental problems of the Gulf of Finland."
"It is in this context that the EIB was authorised - as I said earlier - to give loans, but solely and exclusively for environmental matters."
"An exception has therefore been made precisely because we consider the situation to be extreme."
"Tomorrow, we will also tackle the wider issue of energy, in view of the energy leaks, spillover, wastage and similar factors in our energy cooperation policy, in the context of which we have, in recent months, already held a large number of technical meetings which have brought great progress."
"Lastly - and this is the chapter which concerns me most - there is the whole of the great nuclear waste issue, which we discussed at the last meeting."
"I am talking about underwater waste but also waste from industrial plant and power stations."
"We are working very actively on this, but the economic scale of the issue is enormous and the cost can certainly not be borne by the European Union alone."
"I hope that it will be possible to build a common relationship in order to deal with an issue that is assuming truly huge dimensions in economic terms but which, at the same time, demands incisive action."
"Madam President, I would firstly like to thank you for your commitment and for your immediate reaction to the latest terrorist attack in our country, because it is terrible that, once again, an attack has been made on probably one of the most respected people in the Basque Country."
"Secondly, Mr Prodi, yesterday we were voting in committee until twelve at night on the Sixth environmental action programme, which constitutes the European Union' s strategy on the environment for the next ten years."
"This is something which concerns me as a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Petitions."
"The serious problem we are facing is not a lack of environmental legislation: the legislation on the environment is extraordinary."
"The problem is that it must be complied with, and I know that the European Commission has initiated legal proceedings against a number of countries."
"The process, however, is very long."
"The question is obvious: what clear and concrete measures can be taken to oblige Member States to comply with Community Law, and how can the legal processes be speeded up so that this very Community Law is complied with?"
"In many cases, this would require us to act outside our competence."
"In the majority of the cases which you have cited, Mrs González Álvarez, our only weapon is perseverance in trying to persuade the public, but it is the Member States that are responsible for implementation."
"In some cases, we have succeeded, where possible, in making certain specific action on our part conditional upon compliance with environmental legislation, but, as you understand, this can only be considered to be a special exception, in the same way as bringing an action before the Court of Justice - something which has been done in many different areas - can only be considered to be a special exception."
"But here we are looking at the roots of the problem: the practical aspects are the responsibility of the national governments."
"Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, it would interest me to know, whether you would deem it useful to comb systematically through all the items in the EU budget in order to establish which of them are conducive to sustainable development?"
"Could we use a best-practice method to identify the budget lines with which we actually do anything substantive to promote sustainable development?"
"Perhaps we could also carry out a benchmarking exercise so that the development of the individual budget lines could be observed."
"Do you believe that the best-practice method could optimise our performance?"
"That is what we are attempting to do in all areas."
"Today, for example, this subject kept coming up during the Commission's debate: consider, Mr Rübig, our debate on tobacco subsidies."
"Clearly, looking at the matter from the point of view of growers' incomes, since tobacco is often grown in the poorest areas, particularly the regions bordering on Greece, we had to link this type of subsidy precisely to sustainability, which conflicts, of course, with other principles and areas of concern such as health."
"However, we concerned ourselves with providing an income support policy for those who currently earn their living from this product."
"There you are: this is a typical example of the need to ensure that agricultural policy is always considered in terms of its sustainability in other fields, in this case the field of health."
"I hope that this principle will always be applied."
"Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, this is a day for which I have waited a long time as rapporteur for Parliament' s report on sustainable development."
"I am pleasantly surprised that the President of the Commission mentions both political leadership - which I consider to be one of the most important aspects - and the local level."
"If we have both levels, we have gained a lot."
"The global level was also mentioned, and I think it good that we should clearly single out that too."
"I should nonetheless like to have more practical details."
"What does that mean for the European Union' s activities when it comes to the ways in which we trade, create investments etc?"
"Finally, is this to be regarded as an overarching instrument of control for all the European Union' s activities, or how are we to view a sustainable development strategy?"
". (IT) If I understand your question correctly, Mrs Hulthén, you are asking two questions."
"On the one hand, we have said that we must adopt a raft of horizontal measures within the European Union to make sustainability a kind of common benchmark against which we must measure all of our decisions, whether in the field of agriculture, industry or transport."
"This is a complex issue because it means going back, apart from anything else, on many decisions we have already taken where sustainability was not taken into account."
"On the other hand, however, you are also asking me how these rules relate to globalisation, to the non-European countries."
"Well then, here we must reiterate our commitment to acting in all international situations and forums but, in many cases, the only thing we can do is lead by example, since we have no weight with which to impose our decisions."
"The case of the Kyoto Protocol is extremely significant."
"We cannot force other countries to take the same line as us, but, with the strength that we do now have when we act in unity, our example will ultimately carry great weight in decisions taken outside the European Union as well."
"Madam President, Mr President, as far as sustainability and your ambitious goals are concerned, we really are in something of a vicious circle."
"The forces of the market with their spontaneity and the effects of deregulation very much stand in the way of your highly ambitious goals."
"I have two questions."
"First: what do you think you can really do under these circumstances?"
"One of your predecessors, President Delors, elaborated whole programmes on the issue of shifting modes of transport from road to rail."
"If you look at the situation today, however, you will see that very little has changed."
"Quite the contrary, in fact, the situation has worsened."
"We talk about alternative energy sources and yet solar energy and wind energy are hardly being promoted."
"The big energy companies do not want to let such things onto the grid too."
"Second: what form should a debate with citizens take?"
"What do we want to talk about?"
"About facts and figures, or also about how citizens can be involved more democratically and more actively in shaping policy?"
"What information do they want to give us, the Members of this Parliament?"
"(IT) To answer your question, just a short while ago, I said that we have to set ourselves a goal of energy taxation which regulates energy consumption itself, not just by ensuring that the share of rail transport does not fall below its 1998 level and thus succeeding, by means of practical decisions, in achieving those goals which you, Mr Modrow, say we have failed to achieve, but also by setting ourselves the goal of alternative fuels, including biofuels, accounting for at least 7% of total fuel consumption by 2010."
"This 7% may well seem rather a low figure to you, but, from our perspective, it is quite high."
"The two goals we have set ourselves can clearly be achieved, with a certain amount of sacrifice, by fiscal and other means, and they can be achieved without harm to the economy."
"With regard to labour mobility, we need much more effective awareness-raising."
"In order to obtain more tangible results from companies, we propose to introduce a kind of sustainability performance assessment report for all publicly quoted companies with over 500 staff, in order, gradually, to increase public awareness."
"There is no question about the fact that the two go hand in hand."
"I can assure you that, a few years ago, it would have been impossible for us to sustain the line we took at Kyoto - united, all the countries standing together, resolutely - if public opinion had not, I am glad to say, changed."
"We can therefore say that these are two things which must be seen as closely related."
"If public awareness is not raised, then, in political terms, we will certainly not succeed in bringing about the changes we propose."
"Madam President, I would thank the President of the Commission for a welcome, long-term proposal in a political landscape which is all too often very short-sighted."
"I must nonetheless regret the fact that the proposal comes only a few weeks before the Gothenburg Summit, which is why a real dialogue with all the parties possessing an interest in this issue is now impossible."
"My first question is about the way in which Mr Prodi plans to ensure that, following the Gothenburg Summit, the process is followed up and continued in such a way that it is the subject of the broadest possible dialogue with different stakeholders."
"Mr Prodi very valuably indicated to the world around that this must be seen in a global context."
"My second question is therefore about how this affects the strategy in the short term."
"The EU' s activities in a long list of areas - trade policy, fisheries policy, energy policy etc - naturally have consequences for the situations in other countries."
"The fact is that it is not appropriate to put one' s own house in order and then take care of the rest."
"Instead, an integrated approach is required."
"What is that process to look like?"
"With regard to control - as I said at the end of the speech - we propose that the report we present every Spring to Parliament should include an assessment of the sustainability element of the decisions taken."
"This is crucial, or we will end up with conflicting decisions."
"I also proposed to introduce what I called a Round Table for the Commission: a sort of monitoring body of experts, who will constantly advise us on achieving these goals."
"As far as globalisation is concerned, I refer you to my answer to the previous question."
"The only channel open to us is to make our voice heard in the appropriate international forums. We cannot do more than this."
"However, I would stress that the European Union does have a great responsibility in this matter for it is currently the world' s leading economic player in terms of the physical scale of its production capacity."
"Therefore, we cannot deny that, although, I regret to say, we do not have formal authority, there is no doubt that we have a great responsibility and great influence over the countries and structures outside the European Union."
"Mr President, I was one of the first who asked to submit a question to Mr Prodi."
"Your colleague in the brown jacket nodded to say 'alright' , but I was not called to submit my question."
"I fail to understand this sort of discrimination."
"More than 10 of my fellow Members have spoken, while I have been ignored."
"What does this mean?"
"Are there two sorts of Members in Parliament?"
"Furthermore, I think that the way in which Members who ask to speak are noted is unacceptable."
"It should be done electronically, so that those who ask to speak can be sure they will be noted in the right order."
"Question Time (Commission)"
"Mr Marinos, you know the nature of the debate which has just ended. There is an element of discretion, but there is also the intention to create a balance between the different groups and nationalities."
"I have not taken part in it and I am sure there has been no discrimination and that next time you will have the chance to ask your questions."
"That is the only response I can give you."
"The next item is Question Time (B5-0169/2001). We will examine Questions to the Commission."
"First Part"
"As they deal with the same subject, Questions Nos 45, 94 and 95 will be taken together."
"Question No 45 by (H-0432/01):"
"Subject: Trafficking in children in Africa European public opinion has been shaken by the recent news concerning a vessel flying a Nigerian flag carrying 250 child slaves off the coast of Africa and the shocking findings revealed in this connection by UNICEF concerning the alarming increase in the trade in children from Africa and the arduous work performed by children."
"What action does the Commission intend to take in view of these phenomena which bring shame on our civilisation?"
"How does it assess the impact of its policy so far to protect the rights of children in today's world?"
"Does it intend to ask for more ample and substantive information on the living conditions of children from the African countries with which it cooperates and to which it grants development and humanitarian aid?"
"What measures does it intend to take in order to protect the rights of children in these countries effectively?"
"Question No 94 by (H-0393/01):"
"Subject: Child slavery and child labour In the light of the recent exposure of child slavery in West Africa, particularly within the cocoa industry, can the Commission ensure that it is doing all it can to end this cruelty?"
"How far have the plans developed to introduce voluntary labelling for products not produced by child labour?"
"And what further steps will the Commission take if these voluntary agreements are not enough in the fight to end child labour?"
"Question No 95 by (H-0424/01):"
"Subject: Slave-trade in children in cocoa plantations and the chocolate industry UNICEF's latest report on the situation of children throughout the world contains appalling information about the trade in and exploitation of children between five and fourteen years of age."
"It estimates that some 250 million children are sold and exploited throughout the world."
"I should like to draw attention to one particular aspect which concerns European industry: leaving aside prostitution networks, the overwhelming majority of children sold into slavery in Africa end up in cocoa plantations which produce the raw material for the European and international chocolate industry."
"What does the Commission intend to do within the framework of the relevant international agreements and trade with the poor countries of the Third World to put an end to the unacceptable phenomenon of the exploitation of children and the slave trade in minors, a phenomenon which was officially abolished in 1880 but which continues to exist in the third millennium with the connivance of the developed Western countries?"
"The European Commission of course strongly supports pressure from the international community to eradicate child trafficking and child forced labour, in particular in those countries of western and central Africa where, regrettably, these practices are well-established in tradition and even tolerated by the national authorities."
"The European Union has repeatedly condemned such policies and ensures that promoting children's rights is a priority in our relations with the countries concerned."
"The Cotonou Agreement reaffirms the parties' commitment to internationally-recognised core labour standards as defined by the International Labour Organisation, including child labour."
"As far as trade agreements are concerned, the European Union seeks to raise support among trading partners for respective core labour standards, including child labour."
"The Commission considers that additional tariff preferences under the scheme of generalised preferences should be considered for countries which effectively apply those standards."
"The Commission also finances actions which directly address the issue."
"Over EUR 1.2 million was allocated to promote children's rights and to protect them from violence and exploitation in Gabon, Benin, Togo and Nigeria."
"The Commission is also financing a project in Benin that aims to strengthen a brigade for the protection of minors to foster more effective implementation of legislation and to raise public awareness on this issue."
"Many other activities are undertaken by the relevant international organisations, in particular UNICEF and the International Labour Organisation."
"A recent positive signal is the likely ratification of the ILO Convention on the prohibition of child trafficking."
"Several west African countries, including Cote d'Ivoire, should have ratified it by the end of the month."
"The Commission strongly supports these initiatives."
"Thank you for your reply, Commissioner."
"We know that the European Commission operates action programmes with ideas and funding to protect the rights of children in third world countries."
"I should like to ask you, firstly, how does the European Commission assess this policy?"
"Have you made any fundamental assessments?"
"Do you intend to conduct more in-depth controls, rather than the superficial controls which appear to have been the case in the past?"
"Secondly, will you join with the European Parliament, which has called repeatedly for a political commitment, to be funded from the European Union budget, on an in-depth policy to protect the rights of children in both the European Union and the rest of the world?"
"Will the European Union be tabling its own independent proposal in the run up to the summit on children' s rights to be held in September?"
"The cross-party group in Parliament is preparing an event on 29 May with this objective in mind and it would be a good opportunity to formulate a binding proposal on the protection of children."
"Obviously, we will want to take account of the honourable Member's views and the views of Parliament in preparing for the conference, which the honourable Member quite rightly points to as an important event in mobilising, not just the international conscience, but international actions in order to deal with abuses which we all condemn."
"As for an oversight of practice in individual countries, we do, of course, have the possibility of applying the essential elements clauses in our agreements under the Cotonou Agreement in order to try to keep a check on what is happening."
"It is important to recognise the multiplicity of reasons for the problem and to recognise the complexity of some of the solutions which are required, which in my judgement go right to the heart of what we often talk about in relation to poverty alleviation as the central part of our development assistance programmes."
"I draw attention, for example, to the UNICEF strategy based on the Convention on Rights of the Child, which in my judgement goes to the centre of this debate."
"UNICEF strategy focuses on four main areas."
"First of all, raising awareness about the problem, which we are trying to do."
"Secondly, providing economic support to families at risk and appropriate social welfare."
"Again, that is part of our global strategy for poverty alleviation."
"Next, improving access to and quality of education and finally putting the case for children's rights and training law enforcement officials and judicial authorities."
"UNICEF offers an extremely convincing analysis and a convincing way forward and I hope along with the contributions made by Members of this Parliament, it will provide us with an intellectual framework for our preparations for the conference later this year."
"I have a similar question."
"I think the answer was given adequately."
"Mr President, my point was to highlight the problem in relation to the European chocolate industry."
"The Commissioner spoke in his reply of the help being given to the countries of Africa."
"However, I read in Le Monde that representatives of the chocolate industry met on 2 May to discuss the question of forced child labour because they are worried about this problem."
"I think that we should look at the question of ethics and the operating standards of the industry, which is located on European territory and manufactures products based on this unacceptable form of work."
"Did you follow the debate organised by the International Cocoa Council, the European Cocoa Council, the British trades union in the chocolate industry and the Belgian organisation Caobisco, Commissioner?"
"What are your views on this?"
"What specific measures need to be taken?"
"Yes, I did see the article to which the honourable Member refers."
"It has to be said that if you look at the problem globally there are other industries as well as cocoa and chocolate which one should take account of."
"I am sure the honourable Member would agree that it would not be sensible for us to try to boycott some products."
"To boycott particular commodities or products would simply increase problems in some developing countries, which depend very largely on the export of primary products, and would damage a lot of people who are already appallingly impoverished."
"But what I do very much welcome are private and voluntary labelling initiatives, which can help to create premium market access opportunities for developing country producers on a basis of respect for the EC's international obligations and are aimed at the specific promotion of core labour standards."
"Labelling schemes which are objective, which are transparent and which are non-discriminatory can promote exactly the sort of higher labour standards that the honourable Member supports and that I support as well."
"Those sort of labelling schemes, augmented by technical assistance from the European Union, are an extremely effective way of dealing with the issue of labour standards, not just in relation to the commodities which we are discussing today, but in relation to other commodities as well."
"As usual, we have no objections to Commissioner Patten' s answer."
"We would emphasise that boycotts are not the right way to proceed - especially since we know that, in actual practice, most cases in which children are exploited for slave labour take place in private homes and on smallholdings."
"I am also grateful for the support he is giving to UNICEF' s work."
"Dark clouds are nonetheless visible on UNICEF' s horizon because of the decision not to elect the United States to the Commission for Human Rights."
"Is the Commissioner able to reveal anything about the possibility of supporting UNICEF' s work in these areas?"
"We also know that the issue of sanctions against certain other countries in this region, for example against Liberia, is highly topical."
"Can the Commissioner assure us that this will not mean reduced support for UNICEF and for work aimed at children?"
"We must have intelligent sanctions."
"We must support education, in particular, together with the rights-based approach you talked about."
"UNICEF is an extremely important global organisation, which I have had the pleasure of working with in the past."
"It is, of course, only one of the organisations in the field."
"The work which UNICEF has done with the ILO to promote a common platform of action on this subject is extremely important."
"However, if the honourable Member is making the point that in order to deal with these global problems we need a greater commitment to multilateralism and to multinational institutions; if she is saying that there should be one message from this Parliament to the US Administration and to other administrations around the world, then she will have me leading the standing ovation for her remarks, because she is entirely right."
"What are we trying to do?"
"We are trying to deal with poverty, insufficient education and training, insufficient institutional capacity to apply national laws even where they exist."
"We are talking about cooperation in dealing with transnational crime, because this is an appalling criminal activity, pushing young boys into employment and young girls into prostitution."
"To deal with all those problems, we need effective multilateral institutions, and I hope that the European Union will continue to be at the forefront of those internationally who are supporting multilateral solutions to these problems."
"Question No 46 by (H-0360/01):"
"Subject: Association Agreement with Algeria and the situation of women Does the Commission intend to champion an improvement in the situation of women in connection with the negotiations for an Association Agreement between the EU and Algeria?"
"Is there any provision for education and training for girls and young women in rural areas?"
"What improvements in the situation of women within families are planned?"
"Second Part"
"Questions to Commissioner Solbes"
"The Association Agreement currently under negotiation with Algeria sets out among the priorities in the social and cultural field the promotion of the role of women in economic and social development and the improvement of women's access to education and training."
"Gender questions also figure within cross-cutting priorities in the MEDA national indicative programme for Algeria."
"The potential impact on the situation of women is examined before a decision is taken on the financing of each programme."
"Women are among the primary target groups of the assistance project for the development of NGOs."
"They had received about EUR 5 million under MEDA by the end of 1999."
"An important Social Fund programme is in the final stages of preparation."
"It will finance activities for poor women in rural areas through training and micro-credit schemes."
"For 2001 we are preparing an education and health infrastructure rehabilitation project and a vocational training reform programme."
"These projects will have a direct and positive effect on the living conditions and on the employment situation of women."
"The programme European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights has funded several seminars and projects concerning human and economic rights of women in Algeria since 1996."
"In the year 2000 for example a EUR 1.4 million regional programme was launched in the three Maghreb countries."
"It aims to promote activities to enhance the participation of women in political and economic life."
"Mr Commissioner, your reply is insufficient and very short."
"Please be more specific and more precise and tell me what you feel about the killing of Algerian Berbers resulting from the police charge at the end of April in Algeria."
"What effect will this killing of Algerian Berbers have on relations between the European Union and Algeria, on relations between the Commission and Algeria?"
"The honourable Member accuses me of being too brief."
"I try not to go on too long in response to questions, so that people have greater opportunity to ask more questions, but obviously I can read out page after page of well-meaning and well-intentioned prose, if she would prefer."
"Of course, we condemn any violence, and there have been all too many acts of violence in Algeria, and we also argue strongly for the promotion of women's rights and of individuals' rights in general in Algeria."
"We have followed developments in this sensitive field with considerable attention."
"I note that President Bouteflika has himself recently criticised the existing Algerian family law, for example."
"The European Union within certain limits can certainly aim to act as a catalyst for change through the financing of projects and positive actions as well as through its regular political dialogue with the authorities."
"The conclusion of an association agreement will make this process easier through the institutionalisation of our bilateral political dialogue."
"Perhaps I can repeat one other thing."
"We have just had the annual discussions in the Human Rights commission in Geneva."
"It is a matter of some regret that we found ourselves so often on the opposite side of the argument to Algeria in our espousal of the universal validity of human rights."
"I hope the association agreement and the dialogue which that will promote will mean that we will have fewer of those disagreements in the future, because we support the development of people's human rights and the protection of their civil liberties everywhere in the world."
"Thank you very much, Mr Patten."
"Since the author is not present, Question No 47 lapses."
"Question No 48 by (H-0322/01):"
"Subject: Combating poverty in Greece According to the Commission's Communication (COM(2000) 0594 final), there is a wide gulf between the rich and the poor in Greece, and Greece is also the EU country with the second highest 'persistence of poverty' rate, a fact borne out by the recent Commission report on social cohesion."
"In section 2.2 on poverty the Commission points out that in Portugal and Greece 21-22% of the population have incomes below the poverty threshold, while in Greece 10% of the population suffer from persistent poverty."
"Can the Commission say whether the Greek government has notified it - and, if so, when - of specific programmes and action plans to combat the phenomenon of poverty, given that the take-up rate for the previous Greek operational programme in this field was extremely low?"
"Given that Greece also has a very high level of unemployment, almost non-existent provision for training and the lowest education spending in the EU, factors which are directly linked to poverty, does the Commission consider that it is possible meaningfully to address the basic causes of poverty merely by giving social assistance to the poor?"
"The Commission communication on the structural indicators which present the most recent data on social exclusion and poverty, stresses that in 1995 in Greece, the indicators relating to the level of poverty, including social transfers, the level of persistent poverty and the relationship between population incomes, which involves the highest 20% of earners and the lowest 20%, were higher than the Community average."
"This clearly highlights one very evident fact, that the Greek situation is worse than that of the rest of the countries of the European Union."
"Nevertheless, we should highlight one very important fact, and that is that we are only referring to the data for 1995."
"When we have data on other characteristics and other time periods, we may see a different situation."
"To try to relate the problems of employment and poverty to one single factor is perhaps a mistake."
"In our opinion, in tackling the problem of poverty, various dimensions should be considered: the general economy, the structural reforms necessary to improve the level of growth and the standard of living, and also the correct use of structural funds and the implementation of specific policies to improve employment."
"In this respect, employment strategies may help in combating poverty."
"So can social assistance policies or specific actions aimed at the problem of poverty, such as those stressed at the European Council in Nice."
"In this context, the Greek government has committed itself to presenting its national action plan against poverty and social exclusion before 1 July 2001, and that plan will be in force for a period of two years."
"The plan should include information on the concrete policy measures for combating poverty, including those announced recently by the Greek government."
"We should also remember that, with regard to the use of structural funds and in particular in relation to the European Social Fund, there are also certain specific measures for combating poverty and social exclusion, and in this respect some of the operative programmes for Greece and also some of the regional programmes include measures on employment, education, health and welfare."
"All of this should have a positive effect and change this situation which has been referred to and which of course is the situation as demonstrated by the indicators for 1995."
"Thank you for your reply, Commissioner."
"I more or less agree with what you said, except for your comment that if the rate of growth increases, poverty can be reduced."
"In Greece, as in other countries, I think, we have seen that it is precisely when there is growth that the gap between the incomes of 20% of the population and the other 80% widens and that is where the problem lies."
"It is perhaps a good thing that you, rather than the Commissioner for social affairs replied, because this is indeed a question of growth."
"I think that this is where the Commission needs a more joined-up position."
"Of course, as the Greek government has not sent you its plan, we cannot comment on it."
"But I would remind you, Commissioner, that its previous plan to combat poverty had a very low take-up rate and very little impact."
"I therefore hope that we shall discuss this again on the basis of the plan because you too have an important role to play."
"I imagine that, over and above what you said, the question of taxation and the question of social security also play a very important part in reducing the gap between poverty and wealth, to put it one way."
"And what worries me - although perhaps I misunderstood - is that the Commission' s view is not very clear cut."
"I believe that there is little difference between my initial position and your comments."
"I have pointed out that economic growth helps to improve the context and you draw the conclusion that it does not necessarily reduce the differences."
"Your comment is correct and I do not believe that this argument will take us very far."
"It is true that in Greece the differences between the richest 20% and the poorest 20% of the population are very high in relation to the average."
"What is the Commission' s position?"
"I believe that the Commission has been very clear."
"Firstly, I believe that growth is important."
"Within growth, it is essential to increase employment."
"In order to increase employment, it is not enough to implement measures of a structural nature, such as reducing tax and social costs."
"We also believe that adapting the labour markets in order to create more employment is essential in the fight against poverty, but we believe that this does not include the specific actions for fighting poverty referred to at the Nice Council and which you clearly know well."
"The necessary actions relate to a series of areas which are well defined."
"I believe that this is the position of both the European Union and the Commission."
"Question No 49 by (H-0361/01):"
"Subject: ECOFIN's warning to Ireland Earlier this year, the ECOFIN Council criticised Ireland' s state budget and asserted that the country' s economic policy was causing excessively high inflation."
"How does the Commission intend to pursue this matter?"
"Is the Commission considering any further measures in relation to Ireland on account of its failure to obey ECOFIN' s warning?"
"Mr President, in my first speech I shall be very brief."
"What the recommendation says in its second paragraph, and I will try to explain it, is that the Commission is invited to report, during 2001, on the economic and budgetary development of Ireland and that the Council will monitor these developments and, in particular, assess whether they are consistent with the broad guidelines of economic policy."
"We are in May and for the moment we have a series of economic and budgetary information, but nevertheless I would not yet dare to draw any overly definitive conclusions."
"The Commission expects to have greater knowledge of this data, not more precise knowledge, but rather better knowledge from the point of view of compliance with the recommendations, in order subsequently to present the Council with its assessment."
"We do not believe that the best method is to work with data which relate exclusively to the first few months of budgetary implementation, which are influenced by the previous budget."
"I would thank the Commissioner for his answer."
"I think that overheating in the Irish economy demonstrates the problems of having one currency and one economic policy in countries with very different economic conditions."
"I now have a follow-up question for the Commissioner."
"Do you think it would be to the advantage of the Irish economy to have higher interest rates and a stronger, more highly valued currency?"
"Do you think that would be an advantage to the Irish economy in the current situation?"
"I shall first give an indirect reply to your first question by saying that that the exchange rates applied to the Union as an average clearly do not correspond to the specific countries which make up the Union."
"And if we apply the traditional monetary theory, it is clear that those countries with a higher level of inflation, with greater growth, require more restrictive monetary policies in order to prevent processes of overheating."
"The conclusion can clearly be deduced from the comments I have just made."
"The problem of the exchange rate has given rise to much discussion and debate, given that the exchange rate cannot be modified, being irrevocable, and given that the problem in Ireland would be resolved by a modification of the exchange rate."
"Higher inflation and, to a certain extent, a re-evaluation of the exchange rate, will not go any way towards resolving its problems. Nor will these approaches help us achieve greater equilibrium in terms of the current account balance."
"This debate is clearly related to the fundamental debate on whether budgetary policy should be expansive or non-expansive, but there is no doubt that, if the argument used by some economic theorists is true, it is also the case that an expansive budgetary policy would force this adjustment by means of a real re-evaluation of the exchange rate to be even more dramatic than it would be in other circumstances."
"Having said this, I will just add that, according to our information, growth is now clearly going to be lower."
"Inflation is still high, although it is lower than last November, and the budgetary measures of most interest to us in terms of assessing what is happening in Ireland in the future are, without doubt, going to be the saving plan laid down by the Irish Government, the impact of foot-and-mouth disease in Ireland, which is very significant, and, of course, increases in incomes and expenditure, which so far do not correspond with the budget."
"However, as I said before, to draw conclusions in April on the figures for the end of the year seems to me to be far too risky."
"Commissioner, it would appear that the general elections in Italy held last Sunday will result in a victory for the central right party, Forza Italia, and that Silvio Berlusconi will become the next prime minister of Italy."
"In his electoral campaign, Berlusconi promised his supporters massive tax reductions and, what is more, investment in public building projects."
"What is your opinion of these electoral promises?"
"Do you think it is possible that the Commission would consider issuing this sort of warning with regard to Italy too, if that country takes an interest in or engages in an expansive economic policy in a situation in which the euro zone really does have inflation pressures, or do these intended warnings only concern the small Member States in the euro zone, such as Ireland?"
"As President for the sitting, I declare that the question is not relevant, since it is not a supplementary question."
"It has a different scope."
"There will no doubt be other occasions to ask this question and receive a reply."
"Mrs McKenna has the floor for a supplementary question."
"Is the Commission concerned that its pressure on Ireland and Ireland's Finance Minister may influence the forthcoming referendum on the Nice Treaty?"
"I feel that the Commission should be pulling back just in case there might be bad publicity."
"What is the point of the citizens of Ireland electing a government if its Finance Minister is not allowed to make his own choice?"
"What is the point in us having a government?"
"How far will the EU go in putting pressure on Ireland in relation to public spending, because services in Ireland are in an appalling situation?"
"If we follow EU lines, it will make things even worse."
"We also have to look at EU economic policy and its impact on Ireland in relation to interest rates, over which we no longer have any control."
"It is undemocratic to try to decide the economic policy for an individual Member State considering that it is the citizens in that Member State who elect the government to do that."
"You ask whether the Commission is concerned at the Court of Justice making a certain judgement in one direction or another as a result of non-compliance with Community legislation."
"I believe that amongst all of us we have established some ground rules."
"I believe that the fundamental rule is that we must comply with what is agreed."
"The Commission has the not always pleasant task of pointing out cases of non-compliance with what is agreed."
"In this specific case, the Commission has highlighted that fact, which has also been supported unanimously by the ECOFIN Council."
"I therefore believe that interference of this type does take place, but we cannot become hostages in this type of situation."
"Secondly, does the Commission intend to take the Irish hostage in relation to their decisions?"
"No, the ground rules are very clearly defined in the Treaty."
"There are general guidelines which have to be respected and those general guidelines include a series of elements of coherence in relation to the general policy."
"Ireland, like other countries, is part of the Monetary Union and the development of interest rates and exchange rates is a problem of interest to all the Member States."
"We must all therefore behave coherently in terms of the national economic policy we adopt in accordance with the Treaty, but it must also coordinated in accordance with the Treaty."
"Ireland' s relative weight has been debated in this House on previous occasions."
"I stressed at the time that, from the Commission' s point of view, the rights and duties of all the Member States are the same and, therefore, the economic concept - the economically significant concept - of the different weight of one or other Member State does not have so much importance from a legal or regulatory point or view."
"Having said this, the Irish government has full room for manoeuvre with regard to making the increases it considers necessary in terms of public investment and improving its services."
"The problem is that this must respect the broad guidelines of economic policy and the Stability Pact."
"It is clearly up to the Irish government to define its spending priorities."
"I shall be very brief."
"My question is about whether the Irish case would have been more serious if it had concerned a country within EMU and within the common currency, but with greater economic clout."
"Do you think that the case of Ireland is less serious because it is a country of less economic importance?"
"There is no doubt, from an economic point of view, as I have just said, that your statement is correct."
"But, from a legal point of view, from the point of view of our legal commitments, the situation is the same for all countries, large or small."
"The Treaty does not allow for different treatment for countries in one situation or another."
"What decision should we adopt if one small country behaves as a complete 'free-rider' , gaining advantages from the Union, but none of the disadvantages?"
"What would happen if, instead of one country, there were two, three or four small countries?"
"What size does a country need to be in order to be significant?"
"It seems to me that this argument, although attractive from an economic point of view, is unfortunately not acceptable from a political and legal point of view."
"Question No 50 by (H-0385/01):"
"Subject: Coordination of EU's views in the IMF and World Bank Informal discussions with Europeans working at the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have revealed that there is no coordination of EU action within those bodies."
"Has the Commission taken steps to remedy this shortcoming, which means that the EU's influence is not used to the full?"
"Questions to Commissioner Fischler"
"The Commission has made several attempts to improve the coordination of the European Union and the Monetary Union in order to resolve the problem of the external representation of the International Monetary Fund."
"An agreement was reached in Vienna at the end of 1998, on the basis for a Commission proposal which, however, the Member States did not take up."
"The Commission' s proposal was that, in accordance with Article 111(4) of the EC Treaty, the decision would be taken that the Community would in principle be represented by the Presidency of the euro zone, the European Commission and the European Central Bank."
"However, the Member States reached an agreement of a different nature, reducing the validity of this proposal, particularly with regard to the role of the Commission, which was reduced to a kind of support for the Presidency of the euro zone."
"But these already limited proposals are not being applied in practice."
"In practice, what has so far been achieved is something of an improvement in the coordination of economic policies and, through the Economic and Financial Committee, an exchange of points of view in relation to the positions adopted in the International Monetary Fund."
"This coordination is taking place both in Brussels and in Washington and I believe that it has brought some progress in the process of coordination."
"Now, if you ask me if the Commission is satisfied with this process, I must reply that we are not and nor are we satisfied with the degree of coordination achieved, although we are aware of two limitations: firstly, the International Monetary Fund is made up of States."
"The Union is not a member of the Fund as such - a factor which causes us some interesting difficulties."
"Secondly, the Fund itself is currently subject to a review of its statutes, a factor which must also be taken into account in order to make progress on the process of external representation."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for that honest answer."
"I believe it will enable us to continue this work together."
"I think it was obvious that small countries, which normally defend the Commission, did not defend the Commission' s position at the meetings in Vienna."
"I also think it is obvious that, in future discussions, we must take this into account when we look at the need to develop the discussion on European governance."
"I hope that, in those contexts in which we are to review the EU' s global role, the Commissioner will address the fact that this issue could be emphasised."
"I also hope that the Commission may, in any event, have informal contacts with those who represent the Member States in, for example, the management of the IMF."
"I believe they would view it as extremely valuable to be able to meet and go together through the IMF' s agenda in order to see the need for coordination if our interests are to be safeguarded in that organisation."
"I think the World Bank has other systems, but it is precisely the management of the IMF that ought to be able to meet and coordinate their efforts."
"It is true that these channels exist and at the moment we have at least three useful instruments."
"At the meetings of the Economic and Financial Committee, where the positions to be adopted are debated, the real rules which we take into account for the positions of the different constituencies in Washington - and let us not forget that we are made up of countries which are not members of the Union - the Commission is obviously present."
"A representative of the Commission is also present in Washington at the meetings of the Executive Directors of the regions of the European Union or of the constituencies which affect the European Union within the Fund."
"Secondly, the Commissioner, each time he attends meetings of the International Monetary Fund, which is usually every six months, has bilateral contacts with the Executive Director of the Fund, with whom, furthermore, we enjoy an extremely high degree of cooperation, not only for the euro zone but also for the various regions of the European Union."
"In the euro zone, we have currently accepted the application of the analysis laid down in Article 4 of the Fund, which is produced each year with the International Monetary Fund."
"For the area outside the euro zone, we have great cooperation with the Fund, not only in the candidate countries, but also in all of those countries where we are implementing systems of macroeconomic aid, since we always do this in cooperation with the Fund."
"Lastly, it is true that the President of the eurogroup represents the euro zone in the Monetary and Financial Committee of the Fund, in the former interim committee."
"The speeches of the President of the eurogroup are agreed speeches, which include elements of common agreement between all the countries of the euro zone and we would like this to be the seed for something which may have more content and precision in the future."
"We believe that this is a positive step on the road to progress."
"Question No 51 by (H-0326/01):"
"Subject: Trawling for hake The rules on trawling for hake in the Bay of Biscay allow a minimum mesh size of 70 mm."
"Given the state of the stock and with a view to improving the pattern of production, it is proposed that the mesh size be increased to 100 mm."
"This would cut the amount of fish landed by the fleet by 50% for the same level of effort, and would increase the vessels' operating costs owing to the greater effort needed for the same level of catches and the cost of new nets."
"Has the Commission quantified the hypothetical gains in production in the long term?"
"Has it taken account of the phenomenon of post-escape mortality which is common for other species of gadidae and also affects hake?"
"Has it taken into account that increasing mesh size entails a greater degree of effort to land the same level of catches, giving rise to a parallel increase in post-escape mortality and in the operating costs of the fleet?"
"Has it considered the likely cost of the new nets and what measures might be put in place to aid the fleet's transition to new mesh sizes?"
"Would it not be more appropriate to start by guaranteeing strict compliance with the current rules before making any changes to the rules on technical measures?"
"Commission. (DE) Mr President, at the end of May the Commission will be imposing the emergency measure referred to by Mr Ortuondo Larrea in his oral question."
"There are a number of academic reports, especially those by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea from last November, that were confirmed at the beginning of this year by the Commission's Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries."
"All of these reports indicate that stocks of hake in the Bay of Biscay and southwest of the Irish coast are on the brink of collapse."
"The main problem for the stocks here is the large number of juvenile fish caught."
"The number of mature fish is declining constantly and it is to be feared that they are no longer producing sufficient young for stocks to be able to recover."
"One possible way of reducing catches of juveniles is to use nets with a larger mesh size."
"Using nets with 70 mm mesh, hake of around 25 cm and upwards in length are caught. 100 mm mesh nets, on the other hand, catch hake measuring 40 cm or more."
"The planned regulation does not demand that all hake must be caught using nets with a mesh size of 100 mm or more."
"We have deliberately made exceptional provisions in clearly designated areas for vessels of less than 12 metres in length fishing on a day-trip basis and for vessels that catch crayfish."
"This exception applies to around 1500, or in other words a total of two-thirds of all vessels for which hake is the primary catch or a by-catch."
"I am aware that increasing the size of the mesh entails short-term losses as regards catch weight."
"However, unless such a measure is introduced stocks will not be able to recover to an extent that permits sustained fishing."
"Scientific research has proved moreover that by increasing mesh size to 100 mm, while maintaining current fishing effort, yields will increase in the long term by at least 70%."
"Of course fishermen will need a certain amount of time to re-equip their vessels with the new nets, and we will give them until August 1 of this year to do this."
"Those fishermen who want to continue operating with a mesh size of less than 100 mm - and this is also possible - then any by-catch of hake may not exceed 20% of the total catch."
"This is intended to create an incentive to fish with larger-mesh, more selective nets."
"Now let me answer your question regarding whether it is possible to obtain aid for purchasing new nets."
"Later in the year we want to present a long-term recovery plan to the European Parliament and the Council."
"As soon as this proposal has been approved by the Council, the Member States will be able to grant retrospective compensation to their fishing vessel owners in accordance with the provisions of Article 16(2) of the structural regulation."
"Such a possibility is unfortunately not provided in the framework of the emergency regulation."
"I too view this as a major flaw and have ordered steps to be taken so that the structural regulation can be adjusted in this regard as rapidly as possible."
"And now, let us turn to the argument that hake is very sensitive and that some of the juvenile fish escaping from the nets ultimately die anyway."
"I will be quite frank with you here."
"Our experience has shown that over a longer period a larger mesh size means more adult fish."
"This is what it is primarily at issue here, namely to enable stocks to recover for reproduction."
"And this, ultimately, will be the best proof that this measure is a sensible one."
"Commissioner, I thank you for responding so fully in relation to this problem of hake fishing, but if I have not misunderstood you, you have said that consideration is being given to an exception for vessels of less than 12 metres, amongst which are vessels catching lobster and langoustine."
"Now, the information I receive from fishermen confirms that these vessels, although small, fish with very long nets, and that, furthermore, catches of langoustine also include a great number of young hake, because the areas of distribution of langoustine and of young hake, which are the fishing areas in question, overlap very considerably."
"I would like to ask you whether, when considering these issues, you have examined the serious affects of langoustine fishing on young hake."
"Mr Ortuondo, perhaps there has been some problem with the translation here."
"Let me make it quite clear: what I said was first of all that there is to be an exception for vessels of less than 12 m in length - and not those longer than 12 m - with regard to the 100 millimetre nets."
"There is an additional condition that these should be small vessels fishing on a day-trip basis."
"Second, an exception is to be made for vessels that fish for crayfish."
"As to your question concerning the very long nets, I would like to say that in my opinion it is not these smaller vessels that use very long nets."
"I believe that we can live with this compromise - and I must concede that it is a compromise - that we have entered into."
"It is our opinion that absolute priority must be given on the one hand to ensuring that hake stocks recover."
"However, we cannot turn a blind eye to all the social implications that this certainly very stringent measure that we are proposing entails."
"We feel that we can respond to this best by making an exception especially for owners of very small vessels, as they depend directly on this economic activity and have no other alternative."
"We cannot, however, go further than this as otherwise the measure would end up in practice being ineffective."
"Question No 52 by (H-0331/01):"
"Subject: Reform of the management structure of the Directorate-General for Fisheries Why has the Commission changed the structure of the Directorate-General for Fisheries, downgrading policy on international agreements with third countries in the south and favouring the positions of northern European countries as regards European waters as if the countries concerned owned those waters, in opposition to the positions and interests of southern Member States, which appear to be regarded as intruders both in Community waters and in the EU's international policy on fisheries?"
"Mr Nogueira Román, first of all I would like to make it clear with regard to the wording of your query that your allegation that we pay little attention to the southern Members of the Community is quite simply wrong. I therefore reject it, as I do your insinuation that the Commission regards the southern Member States as intruders - to use your term."
"The Commission does not allow itself to be led by motives of that sort where it is a question of ensuring optimal management of the Directorate-General for Fisheries, but concerns itself rather with optimising its work."
"It is not a question of south or north here, but of bringing together under one department those bilateral agreements that are based on a financial payment in return for access to fishing grounds."
"In this way we will be able to ensure that these are managed in a uniform and coherent manner."
"In doing so we are complying with the conclusions of the Council in 1997, with the position of the Court of Auditors, which was set out in a Special Report, and with the aims of the Green Paper on the future of the Common Fisheries Policy."
"As for agreements with third countries, where it is principally a question of exchange of fishing rights, it makes sense to locate these in the department that also deals with TACs and quotas, because the fishing rights in these agreements are already a part of the TACs and quotas."
"The case of Norway in particular makes the advantages of this new structure clear as we engage in negotiations on long-term technical measures for the recovery of cod stocks in the North Sea."
"You see, there is no unequal treatment here on the part of the Commission, but rather it is a question of finding the most appropriate solution."
"Commissioner Fischler, according to my information, Denmark holds 44% of fishing quotas for Community waters, the United Kingdom 16% and Spain only 6%."
"This is exactly the opposite of the situation with catching capacities, in which the Spanish proportion, centred mainly on Galicia, rises to 35%."
"These figures prove the profound discrimination and national self-interest that underpin the principle of relative stability, which you do not wish to question."
"This same discrimination is now being applied to the structure of the Directorate-General for Fisheries, in a way that favours Denmark and the United Kingdom."
"Do you not think, Commissioner, that it is time we applied the European Union' s intrinsic principles of equality to the fisheries sector, for which you are responsible?"
"Do you not think that the States of southern Europe, such as Spain, should be allowed to take their rightful place in the Union' s fisheries sector?"
"Mr President, I must say that to lower the structure of the Directorate-General for Fisheries to this level and to assert that we are biased in favour of Denmark and other northern states is first of all completely unjustified and, second, Mr Nogueira Román, it is an insinuation that I simply cannot accept."
"If you went to the trouble of informing yourself, you would see very clearly that since I have been responsible for Fisheries the number of Spanish staff in particular at the Directorate-General for Fisheries has increased out of all proportion."
"Compared to the share of the population that Spain represents in the Community, Spain is over-represented in the Fisheries Directorate-General."
"So, if you would like to see your criteria applied in the Fisheries Directorate-General, then we would have to reduce the number of Spanish staff."
"I hope that you would not want that!"
"Commissioner, I rise to speak because we are talking about international agreements with third countries from the south and I have received news of Basque and Galician shipowners who are also fishing alongside Andalusians, or who did so within the framework of the previous fishing agreement with Morocco."
"I have been told that talks were held with the Commission with a view to studying measures to restructure the Spanish fishing fleet in Moroccan waters."
"Could you tell us whether these verbal agreements are going to prosper, be accepted by the Council and be implemented by the Commission?"
"Mr President, I would like to point out that this very same question was raised today as number 57 in the oral questions. It relates to the restructuring measures on Morocco and this in fact has nothing to do with the internal organisation of the Directorate-General for Fisheries."
"You are absolutely right, Commissioner, but please understand that the Members are taking the opportunity to ask their questions."
"You are absolutely right though."
"Question No 53 by (H-0336/01):"
"Subject: Fires and reafforestation in Greece Greece is a country severely and continually affected by major fires which devastate its forests."
"Reafforestation is limited and the fires therefore result in permanent alteration of the natural environment, desertification and the loss of vital 'green lungs', mainly around Greek towns and cities."
"Land-grabbing after forest fires is endemic in Greece, facilitated by the lack of a Land Registry, a project which is financed by the European Union but which the Greek Government has not even completed by as much as 25% despite receiving Community funding for years."
"What is the rate of reafforestation in Greece and the other Member States of the Union?"
"Which Member States have the highest number of fires and largest areas of forest destroyed by fire?"
"What is the Commission's view of the rate at which forest destroyed by fire in Greece is restored?"
"Questions to Commissioner Diamantopoulou"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is well aware of the great damage caused by the forest fires that occur every year in the forests of the European Union, and particularly in Greece."
"In connection with this I would like to inform the honourable Member that in the next few weeks, within the framework of Regulation No 2158/92, the Commission will be approving a programme of protection against forest fires in Greece with funding to the tune of EUR 1.7 million earmarked for the year 2001."
"To turn to your other questions, first: the average area reafforested annually in Greece in the period 1994 to 1999 totals 2 750 hectares."
"This is equivalent to 15% of the area of forest destroyed by fire in this Member State."
"The information available to the Commission only permits comparison with Portugal, where forest areas were restored at a rate of approximately 5 000 hectares per year in the same period; this equates to 14% of the area destroyed by forest fires."
"Secondly, the area of forest destroyed each year by fire in the various Member States totals 73 500 hectares in Spain, approximately 50 000 hectares in Italy, 36 500 hectares in Portugal and 19 000 hectares in Greece."
"Thirdly, it is very difficult for the Commission to assess efforts in Greece to restore areas of woodland destroyed by fire as of course there are numerous factors at play here."
"Reafforestation of the affected areas is - as you know - an integral part of national forestry policy and the success of restoration efforts depends especially on a number of key factors, namely the annual capability of Greece to undertake reafforestation, the chance of natural forest rejuvenation in the areas affected by fire damage and, lastly, the afforestation of new areas, for example areas used for agriculture."
"In certain cases this can create a substitute for the forest areas destroyed by fire."
"In the end, of course, success depends especially on the quality of forest fire prevention measures and on how well fire-fighting systems perform."
"These can help to reduce the extent of destruction caused by forest fires in years to come."
"I shall try to make do with your reply for the time being, Commissioner, until I can come back with the new data which, I think, are vital if we are to have a more detailed, full and constructive discussion."
"Questions Nos 54 to 58 will be replied to in writing."
"Question No 59 by (H-0349/01):"
"Subject: Religious discrimination Can the Commission confirm that Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty outlaws discrimination on the grounds of religion?"
"Article 13 of the Treaty clearly states that discrimination must be combated and provides a basis for policies to combat discrimination."
"However, Article 13 cannot be used as a basis for obtaining direct results or creating individual rights."
"The facility to take recourse to the Court and full application of the policy against discrimination depend on application at national level of Directive 2000/78, i.e. the directive against discrimination adopted by the Council."
"This directive introduced a general framework for any indirect discrimination, including on the grounds of religion or belief."
"Én particular, Article 4(2) deals specifically with churches and other public or private organisations based on religion or belief."
"This provision allows religious employers to substantiate difference of treatment on the grounds of religion or belief but always looks at any such ban within the context of the type of work and general circumstances."
"These exceptions generally refer to employees whose work is such that it affects the ethics or ethos of the organisation in question."
"Under no circumstances, however, can they constitute the rule."
"I am glad that the Commissioner has confirmed the principle of non-discrimination on the grounds of religion."
"I am concerned over the practice in some Member States."
"As she may be aware, in the United Kingdom there is a clergyman - the Reverend Raymond Owen - who has been refused permission to go to an industrial tribunal to resolve outstanding issues relating to his dismissal by the church authorities."
"This would not have been the case in various other Member States, or had he been a religious minister from a non-Christian organisation."
"This case seems to exemplify the discrimination that exists against Christian ministers of religion in certain Member States of the Union when they are in dispute with their ecclesiastical authorities."
"United Kingdom law fails to incorporate properly the Council Directive of 14 October 1991 - most notably Article 8 which notes that Member States are allowed to exclude certain limited cases of employment."
"However, the UK Employment Rights Act of 1996, in part 13, chapter 1, specifies particular types of employment that are excluded from the Act but makes no reference to the clergy, therefore implying that the clergy is covered by legislation, which is not in fact the case."
"I hope the Commissioner will agree to look in detail at this case and receive the Reverend Owen and representatives from his trade union so we can make a formal complaint."
"I would be delighted to meet the organisations in question and discuss the matter, but I must point out that the Member States have to transpose the directive into national law by December 2003 and the specific case you referred to dates back to the 1990s and is not covered retroactively by the directive."
"Nonetheless, I would be happy to look into the matter and to investigate the reverend' s case."
"Question No 60 by (H-0350/01):"
"Subject: Social security funds in Greece The viability of social security funds has been a subject of consideration by the European Union's institutions recently."
"Similar deliberations are also taking place in the Member States."
"In Greece, a significant discrepancy has been revealed between the data provided for analysis of the viability of the Greek social security funds and the reality of the situation as the funds have not brought their records up to date and are, therefore, unable to determine the exact number of people insured."
"What is the Commission's view of this situation?"
"Do the data which the Commission receives from Greece for processing undergo statistical correction?"
"Why was the computerisation of the Greek social security funds not completed under the Kleisthenis programme as part of the 2nd Community Support Framework?"
"What provisions have been made under the 3rd Community Support Framework in this respect?"
"I assume that the question raised by Mr Alavanos, especially as regards statistics, refers to the actuarial study commissioned by the Greek government and not to statistics provided for the purposes of the institutional bodies of the European Commission."
"According to the Commission' s information, the purpose of this study was to broaden the fiscal prospects of the insurance funds and, eventually, to identify the changes needed in order to safeguard their fiscal viability."
"There were huge problems in carrying out the study due to the large number of funds in Greece, and there were problems due to the auxiliary insurance funds and, more importantly, as the result of shortcomings in the computer system."
"Naturally, the Member States are responsible for drafting this study."
"The Commission is not, therefore, in a position to check if the data used by this firm is correct or to check the methodology used in order to conduct the study."
"As for the second question regarding statistics on social security funds, Greece has been obliged to provide the Commission with these data since 1994, within the framework of the procedures relating to the European Union."
"There are difficulties with the flow of data on the part of the Greek authorities when it comes to collating and updating detailed data."
"Progress has been made in this sector since 1996, now that primary expenditure in the wider public sector has been legalised and rationalised and is better controlled, but I have to say that there are problems with the information received by the European Union, due mainly to the lack of detailed information, particularly from certain funds."
"Your third question concerns the modernisation of the public administration, especially the insurance funds, under the Kleisthenis programme."
"There was a commitment under the Kleisthenis programme to computerise the ÉÊÁ, which is the main social security fund, and to computerise the policy for a standard social security number for all persons insured in Greece."
"Under the second Community Support Framework and the Kleisthenis programme, certain projects in these two sectors should have been completed by now."
"IKA has started restructuring and modernising but there have been delays due mainly to legal differences regarding the results of the invitation to tender, unfortunately for the most important action plan, i.e. the integrated computer system."
"This programme was due to be completed in 2001 but has been extended to 2002."
"I have to say that the modernisation of both the IKA and some of the other funds will need to be completed by reorganising them under the third Community Support Framework and information society programme."
"I should like to thank the Commissioner for her extensive and fairly detailed reply."
"If possible, could she perhaps be more specific on the forecasts and the specific funds incorporated into the third Community Support Framework?"
"It is clear both from the Commissioner' s reply and from our knowledge of the facts of the matter that there is a great deal of ambiguity surrounding the number and status of pensioners in Greece and that is no basis for national or Community policy on matters such as insurance, pensions etc."
"What I can be specific about, based on the commitments of the Community Support Framework, is that the reorganisation and modernisation, i.e. the computerisation of the ÉÊÁ, must be funded and completed under the information society programme."
"I cannot make any comment on commitments relating to the European Operational Programme for the other individual funds."
"Question No 61 by (H-0363/01):"
"Subject: Forthcoming Commission Green Paper on corporate social responsibility Does the Commission still support the view expressed by Anna Diamantopoulou in her address to the EU Committee of the American Chamber of Commerce on 30 October 2000 that 'when voluntary action fails, the pressure for regulation grows' and that 'there are certain abuses of basic rights which simply cannot wait for voluntary action to address them?'"
"How will this view be upheld in the Green Paper on corporate social responsibility currently being prepared by DG Employment?"
"What sort of monitoring system does the Commission envisage in order to allow for both voluntary action and legislative regulation?"
"The Commission is preparing a communication on corporate social responsibility, basically a Green Paper, and discussions will start in June."
"However, let me say quite clearly that the principle on which the Green Paper is based is that any action relating to corporate social responsibility, any corporate social action, has nothing to do with compliance with current legislation, which is taken for granted."
"When we talk of corporate social responsibility and of new action, we are talking about greater investment in human resources, in the environment, in the social environment and in the immediate vicinity by which, of course, we mean over and above their obligations under the law."
"I should like to make it clear that, as far as the legislation is concerned, it sets out the minimum standards with which companies must comply."
"As far as the logic of corporate social responsibility is concerned, it refers to higher standards which form the basis on which corporate operations are developed."
"I wish I was as confident as the Commissioner that compliance with present legislation by companies is something we take for granted."
"Sadly in recent years we have all too often seen some companies - not the majority - responsible for abuses in third countries, including the problem of child labour on which she was so eloquent when we spoke together at the EU Committee of the US Chamber of Commerce, to which I refer in the question."
"I am asking her for an assurance that Parliament's call for a legal base for monitoring European companies' actions in third countries will be included as one of the options in the Green Paper."
"I share her view that voluntary action is important."
"However, I put to her that she has to include the option of regulation."
"When we look at the actions against bribery and sex tourism, and when we look at the recent very interesting draft report of the International Council on Human Rights on the legal accountability of businesses, we see that world institutions are considering legal actions and legal responsibilities."
"I want an assurance that this will be discussed and therefore form the basis for consultations through her Green Paper."
"I should like to highlight two basic aspects of the Green Paper."
"One relates to European policy and the other relates to the international dimension of the problem of corporate responsibility."
"At European level, failure to comply with the law is a matter for the Member States and we have the facility, both through the European Parliament and through the Commission, to impose sanctions on Member States who fail to ensure that the law is applied."
"As regards the international dimension and the issues such as child labour to which you referred, proposals have been tabled either on a Community label or on corporate codes of conduct, which we want to link with an independent assessment of how these companies operate at global level."
"One of the questions which will be raised in the public debate triggered by the Green Paper in June will be how we can mobilise international monitors, independent international bodies, in conjunction with government organisations and with what specifications, so that we have an objective assessment at international level to which to refer."
"Only then will there be any real point to the Community label, codes of conduct and lists of companies with a positive impact at global level."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to ask you whether the Green Paper also takes account of the fact that eighteen million businesses in the European Union have fewer than 250 employees."
"This accounts for two-thirds of all employees and affects more than 60 million workers."
"Most of these enterprises are family businesses."
"Many businesses also have a life cycle."
"We are always talking about start-ups, but we should also think of those companies that close for reasons of age or various other reasons."
"In my opinion, attention should be paid to ensuring that livelihoods are not put at risk, because this would, of course, be an enormous strain on the workers in these businesses, but also for the entrepreneurs who want to cease trading."
"How will the Green Paper deal with these issues?"
"Naturally, best practices for action by companies in the Community relate mainly to large companies."
"The existing corporate social responsibility network is also made up of large companies."
"However, you will see that one chapter in the Green Paper deals with collaboration between large and small companies and best practices, of which we already have examples in several countries in Europe, where large companies form networks with small and medium-sized enterprises to support them, train their employees and keep them abreast of new practices."
"I think, and here I agree with you, that the Green Paper and the new role played by companies may offer a great deal of support, especially for small companies."
"Question No 62 by (H-0365/01):"
"Subject: Equal treatment on pay I gather that the Commission is launching a campaign next year on the principle of equal treatment in respect of pay, which I welcome as it is the Commission' s task to monitor the implementation of the equal pay directive."
"In spite of the fact that the Directive has been in force since 1975, its results have been conspicuous by their absence."
"Pay differentials are still at their 1980 levels - in the EU, men working full time earns on average 27% more than women working full time."
"In some countries the difference is as much as 30%."
"It is important to clarify the background to the Member States' difficulties in combatting pay discrimination and the extent to which a review of the Directive is necessary."
"Is the Commission prepared to look into how the Directive and the case law of the Court of Justice have been applied in the Member States, and whether it is necessary to update the Directive?"
"As Mrs Theorin says in her question, the issue of unequal pay between men and women in the European Union is still a major problem, despite long-standing national and Community legislation and case law."
"It is one of the first principles contained in the Treaty of Rome, it was one of the first laws passed in 1975 and we reiterated and strengthened it in the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"And yet, the situation is the same as it was at the beginning of the 1980s."
"What the Commission has done so far, over and above legislation, the application of which is causing serious problems, with governments failing to set up mechanisms to ensure that existing legislation is applied correctly; so over and above the fundamental question of application, the Commission has drafted proposals and, in the guidelines for 2001, this issue is examined very seriously, it is one of the guidelines and we shall have a fuller picture when we assess national action plans not only of the situation in the Member States but also of the action and initiatives taken to deal with this issue."
"May I remind you that, at the Stockholm Council this year, the Commission undertook to develop indicators so as to ensure that there would be no difference between men and women due to unequal treatment."
"Similarly, the fifth programme for women contains action which calls for proposals, initiatives, innovative ideas and transnational collaboration in order to bring about a better understanding of this phenomenon, together with proposals addressed to governments and companies, so that we can achieve faster, more substantial results than we did during the previous decade."
"On the basis of the results and initiatives which I have mentioned, the Commission, with Parliament's help of course, will assess whether the directive on equal pay for men and women needs to be updated again."
"The crucial factor for change is for the wage gap to be made apparent, not only at national level but also at every place of work and within every branch of industry, that is to say at that level at which the wage negotiations take place."
"It is at that level that the analyses of women' s and men' s wages are required as a basis for doing something about wage discrimination."
"In Sweden and Finland, we already have legislation requiring all employers to prepare annual equality plans, including plans for securing equal pay for work of equal value."
"Yesterday evening, the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities voted through a proposal to implement this throughout the European Union."
"I would ask the Commissioner whether she is prepared to give her support to this proposal."
"The policy applied in Sweden on the question of equal pay is, I think, both pioneering and effective, because it is the only country which has managed to minimise the wage differential."
"I think that it is an ideal model and I totally agree that it would be an excellent idea if it were implemented by the other Member States, which is why I think that, initially, it could be used as a best practice between governments, to be adopted initially on a voluntary basis as a pilot project."
"This European dimension of the Swedish model could then be used as the basis for binding resolutions."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Diamantopoulou, for your cooperation with Parliament this afternoon."
"Since the time allotted to Questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 93 and 96 to 112 will be replied to in writing."
"That concludes Questions to the Commission."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.30 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)"
"EEC-Denmark/Greenland Fisheries Agreement"
"The next item is the report (A5-0129/2001) by Mrs Langenhagen, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the Fourth Protocol laying down the conditions relating to fishing provided for in the Agreement on fisheries between the European Economic Community, on the one hand, and the Government of Denmark and the local Government of Greenland, on the other (COM(2000) 865 - C5-0028/2001 - 2000/0348(CNS))."
"The Commissioner is not present, but I am assured that he is on his way."
"In the interest of time we should start this debate."
"Mr President, at the moment Mr Fischler is in the Committee on Fisheries, which was scheduled to finish working at 9 p.m."
"However, it was very important that he spoke to us there about the planned reform."
"In this respect I appreciate why he is not yet here at the moment, and in any case he knows us all quite well already."
"This is indeed a tricky business: Greenland lies only a few kilometres off the coast of Canada, while it is more than four hours' flight from Copenhagen but is nevertheless a part of Denmark."
"Denmark, meanwhile, is a Member of the European Union, while Greenland withdrew from the EU more than 15 years ago following a referendum."
"Have no fear, I do not intend to give an impassioned speech in favour of Greenland returning to the EU, although I am sure that would be an interesting debate."
"I simply want to clarify how difficult the situation before us actually is."
"Since Greenland withdrew from the EU in 1985 it has had Fisheries Agreements with the Community."
"These were necessary in order to regulate fishing in Greenlandic waters and set catch quotas for European fishing boats."
"The Third Protocol to the Fisheries Agreement expired on 31 December 2000 and was replaced by a new one that came into force on 1 January 2001."
"Yes, a Fourth Protocol has now been in operation since January 2001."
"If one looks at today's date then one can see that we in Parliament are trailing behind by some months."
"However - and this should be emphasised again in the context of the present debate - the reason for this delay does not lie with Parliament!"
"The signing of the Protocol went ahead in September 2000."
"However, the Commission did not submit the Protocol for Parliament' s approval until the end of December 2000, in other words shortly before it was officially due to come into force."
"If we want to take our role seriously, and be taken seriously, as the body responsible for budgetary matters, then this way of handling procedures on the part of the Commission is unacceptable."
"In the interests of ensuring good relations between the Commission and the EP there is an agreement to allow Parliament a period of six months between submission and entering into force to afford it time to make comments."
"And Greenland too, incidentally, which had to wait for four months in vain for payments, was not best pleased - to put it mildly - with the behaviour of the Commission."
"The advance payment that the Commission then initiated off its own bat in mid-April did little to change that."
"In the case of future Agreements the Commission should pay more attention to the deadlines and arrangements in order to avoid irritations of this sort, which give rise to ill feeling between institutions and damage the international standing of the EU."
"Why do we need a Protocol of this sort at all, when after all it costs the EU EUR 42.8 million per year?"
"On the one hand, of course, it directly benefits EU fishermen who lay their nets in Greenland's waters."
"These fishing possibilities are irreplaceable."
"On the other hand, the Agreement with Greenland is of tremendous importance as regards the Fisheries Agreements with other nations such as Norway or Iceland, as it is through the exchange of fishing quotas that the Agreements with Norway or Iceland are possible in the first place."
"In the Fourth Protocol the fishing quotas have at last been reduced to a realistic level."
"Conservation of stocks and sustainable management were the deciding factors in setting the quotas."
"And this is a good thing, as we do not want to fish to the point where there is nothing left to catch. We want to leave our children and grandchildren the chance of making a living from fishing."
"One question, if not the most important question, in the case of Greenland will be: will cod recover?"
"Despite some signals to this effect, there are still no positive, conclusive findings from fishermen or the scientific community."
"This is of course bound up with the problem of what we so appositely call 'paper fish' ."
"What use is it to our fishermen, after all, if on paper they are allowed to catch so many tonnes of fish but the fish is simply not there?"
"We need more realism here."
"This includes the possibility of fishing other species, as is expressly provided under the new Protocol, and also annual review and confirmation of quotas and support for joint venture projects, which has so far been lacking."
"We need a realistic fisheries policy with Greenland."
"I therefore advocate undertaking a cost-benefit analysis before the renewal of the Protocol and a review at mid-term with the active involvement of Parliament."
"In doing this, one issue will be how to separate financial compensation for purely fishing possibilities from the total contribution, which also covers development projects."
"As you see, there is still a great deal to be done."
"I hope that the proposals for amendments we have put before you will pass through Parliament successfully."
"If relative stability is to be brought about, however, I would ask you to reject this motion."
"We are, however, in the process of elaborating a compromise to show how unanimous we are in our efforts with regard to the subject of fisheries."
"I welcome the Commissioner."
"We understand the difficulties that you have had this evening but we felt it appropriate - and the rapporteur agreed - that we should proceed, as we know you understand the situation."
"Mr President, I am not going to talk at length on the great number of irregularities in this Protocol."
"We simply have to look at the text and compare it with the Council' s mandate to see how arbitrary the Commission has been."
"Furthermore, if we compare the Protocol with any other agreement with the South, it is frightening to think how sure some high-level officials in the Directorate-General for Fisheries must be of their position of impunity."
"That is the heart of the matter."
"Not the fact that there are EUR 300 million to solve the crisis facing the fleets affected by the failure with Morocco and that there is more than double to pay for fishing opportunities in Greenland which are not even worth what has been spent on their negotiation, not to mention the cost in terms of the loss of prestige and credibility of the Commission."
"Nor is the most important element the fact that, unlike the agreements with the South, there was no clause allowing new Member States access, nor the fact that only shipowners within the agreements with the South have to contribute to the funding of the external fisheries policy, nor the fact that it is impossible to control the spending of this considerable amount of tax-payers' money."
"The important thing, Commissioner, is that this Protocol demonstrates in a few pages the extent to which the CFP can be arbitrary and unfair."
"Furthermore, the Director-General for Fisheries' attempts at an explanation before our committee could be called laughable if the gravity of the situation did not make them insulting."
"He thinks it is completely normal to have double standards in terms of the benefits of agreements for the North or for the South."
"And he added unashamedly that Council ended by approving this Protocol."
"Of course we are also going to approve it, because we are very aware of the difficulties of ending up without a fisheries agreement."
"Neither do we have great hopes for an improvement in the mid-term review, since the Protocol makes it clear that, if one party does not wish to deal with an issue, that issue will be left out of the review."
"If this is not the case, if we have interpreted it wrongly, we would ask you, Commissioner, to make a gesture to calm the worst fears of the fishing industry and to put an end to the feeling that our CFP always benefits some people at the expense of others."
"It only remains for me to thank Mrs Langenhagen for her work in the Committee on Fisheries."
"Mr President, I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Langenhagen, on the quality of her work and on the speed and care with which she has produced her report, thereby responding to the urgency which the Commission and the Council had demanded of us."
"However, I would like to say that this debate concerns a fishing agreement which is atypical for many reasons."
"Firstly, because it is the only Community fishing agreement which is not international, since the Community negotiates it and signs it with a Member State, as well as with the local authorities of Greenland."
"This international agreement is in no way 'international' and it is barely a 'fishing' agreement, since it does not distinguish - despite the claims of Parliament and the Council - between the specific amount intended for development cooperation and the amount corresponding to fishing possibilities."
"This is fundamentally a development cooperation agreement dressed up as a fishing agreement."
"EUR 14 million is intended for development cooperation but it is also the case that the very limited use of the fishing opportunities means that most of the remaining 28 million also goes into the coffers of Greenland' s treasury, with no compensation for the Community' s fishing sector."
"Another idiosyncrasy of this agreement is that it is the only one in which shipowners do not have to pay a single tariff for carrying out their activities."
"It is regrettable that there has been hardly any development of the possibility of creating mixed companies and that exploratory campaigns have not been developed at all."
"Commissioner, the sector affected casts doubt upon the figures supplied the Commission on the true use of fishing possibilities."
"According to some reports, only 12% of the fishing possibilities were utilised within the last agreement, and the agreement negotiated by the Commission, which it is proposing to this House today, prevents these possibilities, paid for the Community tax-payers, being used by other Community fleets with an interest in fishing in these waters."
"The whole thing is a wasteful mess."
"Iberian fleets - Spanish and Portuguese - which before joining the Community fished in these waters, are still being excluded, 15 years later, from the scope of this agreement, owing to an abusive interpretation of the principle of relative stability."
"Given the high financial figures involved, second only to Mauritania, the Community must make a real assessment and not a fictitious one."
"Furthermore, Parliament should have been consulted during the negotiation."
"The Socialist Group will vote in favour of the amendments of the Committee on Fisheries and also the amendment tabled by Mrs Figueiredo."
"Mr President, to start with, I would like to thank Mrs Langenhagen who, with this report, has once again produced a good and thorough piece of work."
"The Greenland Agreement is important for the Union, especially because it gives the Community the opportunity to enter into other very important fisheries agreements, for example with Norway and Iceland."
"There are four countries that benefit from the Greenland Agreement, but there are even more Member States that benefit from the agreements with Norway and Iceland."
"In short, the third country agreements that the Union has with countries in the north, west and south bring many advantages."
"With reference to respect for the principle of relative stability, we are therefore opposed to Mrs Figueiredo' s Amendment No 9."
"In this area, I would also support the ideas discussed by Mrs Langenhagen during her submission."
"I am pleased that the fishing possibilities, to which access is being purchased, are more realistic than in the previous agreement."
"I share Mrs Langenhagen' s desire to apply the principle of 'money for fish' , i.e. separation of the financial consideration for the fishing possibilities, on the one hand, and the resources for development needs, on the other."
"I would like to call upon the Commission to seek a solution model which Greenland' s local Government can accept and which distinguishes between the value of fishing rights and more development-oriented financing, which is actually taken into account in the budget items, as is reflected in their headings."
"On behalf of the Liberal Group, I have put forward an amendment to the effect that those fishermen who benefit from the agreement must also be involved in financing the agreement."
"This is a proposal that we always make because we feel that the users must contribute to the financing to a greater extent."
"We believe that this principle should apply to all the EU' s fisheries agreements."
"Mr President, for the Greens this agreement is rather different to others."
"As we have said here many times, our position is not against fisheries agreements in principle but more against the way in which they are negotiated and the terms arrived at."
"All too often there is very poor - if any - scientific understanding of the status of the stocks."
"There is also poor control and enforcement of EU fishing activities."
"Negotiations do not take place in a regional context."
"That is why we have generally voted against them."
"The Greenland agreement is different."
"It falls in the geographical zone of three international fisheries organisations: the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, the North West Atlantic Fisheries Organisation, and the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission."
"These are among the most scientific regional bodies that exist."
"There is therefore scientific information on the status of the stocks being fished and we note with approval that the overall quantities to be fished have been reduced dramatically and are more in line with responsible fishing opportunities."
"Both NAFO and NEAFC also have among the best and most comprehensive programmes for control and surveillance."
"For that reason, this time we will support the agreement."
"We will also support the amendment by the Liberals on the Commission recovering the costs of the agreement from the ship-owners who benefit from it."
"This is an extremely important principle, which should be followed."
"The old Fisheries Protocol between the European Union and Greenland mainly benefited Germany, which received around 80% of the quota despite the fact that it used, on average, around 12%."
"The new protocol guarantees fewer fishing possibilities, arguing that this is a more accurate picture of the real catch."
"Nevertheless, we still need to resolve the fundamental issue of guaranteeing fishing possibilities for fleets from other Member States, which are able to make use of the predicted catch possibilities. Until such fishing possibilities are guaranteed, we cannot achieve greater balance in the cost of the protocol, which would be of economic and social benefit to these countries."
"We would also be disregarding the conclusions of the Council of Fisheries Ministers of October 1997, on the fisheries agreements and the underutilisation of quotas."
"Hence our proposal for an amendment, which seeks to ensure that all Member States can make use of the fishing possibilities that are available. The current situation is especially unfair to fleets such as Portugal' s, which has fished in those waters since the 1930s, although Portugal did not sign up to the protocol when it joined the European Union in 1986."
"The existence of a small quota for Portugal could reduce its fishing deficit by 12 000 tonnes, which would help to keep afloat the rest of its deep-sea fleet. I should point out that of the 52 factory ships that existed in 1990, only 14 are still operational."
"Mr President, the fisheries agreement with Greenland remains controversial, and this is because the fishing possibilities granted to the European Union are not fully used and the other Member States are not allowed to use them."
"In this way, the European Union is paying a very high price."
"We must remember that this is the most expensive agreement, together with the Mauritania agreement, since the Moroccan agreement disappeared, simply as a result of what is known as 'paper fishing' ."
"The fact that Member States other than the ones that traditionally benefit cannot use the fishing possibilities makes this agreement controversial."
"If we add the fact that, in the agreements with the South, shipowners have to contribute increasing amounts of tariffs for the funding of these agreements, while in Greenland they are exempt from these payments, we have another good reason to describe this as a discriminatory agreement."
"As chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, I would like to point out that the partial payment brought forward by the European Commission, before Parliament has expressed its view, has been strongly criticised in our committee because, while legally possible, it is nonetheless politically unacceptable."
"I hope that the mid-term review of this agreement - and of the common fisheries policy itself - will consider and overcome these difficulties, which have nothing to do - I stress - with Greenland, which is offering us its waters."
"The agreement must serve to genuinely promote fishing cooperation, opening up new avenues to new Member States in order to jointly develop the fishing potential of Greenland to our mutual benefit, that is to say, the benefit of those States and of the European Union, of those who are fishing now and of those other Member States who are not doing so."
"At this difficult time for the agreements with the South, after the failure of the negotiations with Morocco, I would like to take this opportunity, Commissioner, once again to remind you, for the second time in this debate, of the political priority and urgency of European solidarity, which should take the form of a generous, practical economic plan for the people affected by this agreement, as was approved at the Nice Summit."
"Commissioner, this is now the second major fisheries agreement between the European Union and a third party."
"The first issue that must be raised about this agreement, which is of such huge scope, is that there appears to be an unacceptable degree of confusion between what is a fisheries agreement and what is development aid for a region which, although part of a Member State of the European Union, has decided not to be a part of the Union."
"We have nothing against such development aid and in fact I feel it may be totally justified, but I fail to understand why this development agreement should be disguised as a fisheries agreement."
"This is a fisheries agreement which reflects and lays claim to the principle of relative stability based on historical catches, but one in which the historical facts are ignored!"
"Portugal will soon be celebrating 500 years of fishing in Newfoundland."
"Fishing in Greenland is actually a little more recent, and does not date back 500 years."
"It would, therefore, be difficult to say that any fishing tradition is older than that of Portugal in the seas of Greenland."
"To say that Portugal has no place in this fisheries agreement is something that we could never accept and which is completely out of touch with the reality of the situation. We can therefore not accept this interpretation of the principle of relative stability."
"Ladies and gentlemen, those of us who believe in the European Union and in the existence of a common European maritime and terrestrial territory can neither accept nor approve the type of discrimination and favouritism that appear in this Fisheries agreement with Greenland."
"We cannot understand why the fleets of Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Denmark should be given favourable treatment, particularly since they cannot even reach the level of catches allowed under the previous protocol and since they have not taken advantage of the opportunity to create joint, mutually beneficial companies."
"We cannot accept the discrimination against the fleets of other Member States such as the Spanish and Portuguese fleets - and within the Spanish fleet, the Galician fleet - that want to fish in Greenland' s waters and which are in a position to make business agreements with local agents, as allowed under the agreement."
"What we want, and it should not be necessary to have to say this once again, is sustainable development and the preservation of fish stocks."
"Lastly, we also want the European Union to maintain a real presence in Community waters as it does in the markets."
"Commissioner, as the rapporteur emphasises, our experience of the previous fisheries agreement with Greenland was extremely disappointing, with much lower percentages of catches than the quotas that were initially established."
"Despite that fact that it did not fish, the European Union nevertheless made payments, on time, of an average of EUR 38 million per year during the period covered by the previous agreement."
"The most shocking aspect of this third agreement is that fishing possibilities for the period in question are being reduced, whereas the European Union' s financial compensation, which stands at around EUR 43 million per year, is being increased."
"In other words, we are paying more for fishing considerably less."
"What has brought about this decision by the European Union to sign a fisheries agreement despite the negative experience of the previous agreement?"
"Our rapporteur highlights two main reasons: the first is the importance of this agreement for the conclusion of other agreements in the region, specifically with Norway and Iceland, and the second reason is that it is crucial for the fleets of countries that fish there."
"For these reasons and despite all the inconsistencies, the rapporteur proposes that we adopt the report."
"I understand these reasons and shall, therefore, not oppose the rapporteur' s proposal, although I have adopted various amendments tabled by other Members of the House."
"We must nevertheless bear in mind that, according to the two main arguments invoked by the rapporteur to persuade us to support this agreement, this one was to be followed by other fisheries agreements, which did not happen, as we know, with the agreement with Morocco. The agreement with Morocco was not signed despite the fact that this was essential to the fleets of two Member States that fished there and the fact that it was a fundamental sign that we needed to give in order to conclude other fisheries agreements in the region, with Mauritania and with other countries to the south of Mauritania, for example."
"There can be no doubt that this is an incomprehensible two-tier policy with two sets of standards, and I hope that the relevant Member State governments - Portugal and Spain - take due account of what has happened and what is happening with this agreement with Greenland, in order to make a similar procedure hold sway in the Council."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Langenhagen for her work on this."
"Indeed she went beyond the call of duty and applied herself very sincerely to consideration of the Greenland problems and the European problems."
"Having said that, this agreement should be based on economic criteria."
"We should evaluate what we are buying, consider the cost of catching it and consider whether the game is worth the candle."
"We should not get involved in the business of giving aid and buying fish at the same time."
"It is not the business of our Commissioner for Fisheries to deal with aid to Greenland."
"In the first place, Greenland was once a Member of this Union. It chose to leave."
"We do not owe it any economic aid."
"If it is poor and hungry, let our people in the Commission who consider such problems deal with that."
"We are dealing with fish."
"This should be a commercial activity."
"We should buy the fish and ensure we are getting good value."
"We have to consider also that we are dealing with countries that are normally weaker than we are."
"We must ensure that we do not exploit those countries and do not allow our fleets to damage or exploit their fishing stocks."
"I do not accept that we should charge the ships that specifically go there."
"When we buy these fish they belong to the European Union and should be shared out amongst the fishermen on the same basis as all the other fish that the Union controls, in order to create a balance."
"It does not necessarily not make sense for Portuguese fishermen not to go to Greenland."
"In relation to historic rights, 500 years ago Basque fishermen went to Newfoundland."
"Fishermen from Bristol went there as well and also fished around Iceland."
"Today they would not do that because the navies of these countries will not allow them to do so."
"Historic rights are not necessarily right."
"Generally speaking, we should apply common sense to today's problems."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to thank you warmly, Mrs Langenhagen, for your excellent report on the conclusion of the Fourth Protocol to the Fisheries Agreement between the Community and Greenland."
"I am also pleased that you, as rapporteur, recommend approval of the proposal."
"Among other things, the Fourth Protocol, which was initialled on 13 September 2000 in Copenhagen, creates a basis for re-assessing the relationship between the Community and Greenland."
"The most important measure for this re-assessment is described in Article 14 of the Protocol."
"An interdepartmental working group of the Commission will review measures that are intended to bring more transparency and accountability into relations with Greenland."
"This review will take place by 30 June 2003 at the latest."
"The objective of this mid-term review is to create a new framework for future cooperation between the Community and Greenland."
"Parliament will of course be involved in drafting such an agreement in accordance with the provisions in force."
"What are the most important aspects of the Fourth Protocol?"
"First of all let us consider catch quotas."
"These have been reduced by comparison to the Third Protocol in order to set catch possibilities that are also actually available."
"This applies especially to cod, which has been reduced from 31 000 tonnes to 2 000 tonnes; redfish has been reduced from 52 000 to 31 000 tonnes and roundnose grenadier has been reduced from 8 000 to 3 350 tonnes. A new article has been included with the aim of intensifying cooperation within the framework of regional fisheries organisations, especially with regard to implementation of monitoring and control regulations and in the field of research."
"Financial compensation has been set at EUR 42.8 million, taking into account the desire of both parties for close and stable relations and with due consideration for the development requirements of Greenland and for inflation."
"I would like to emphasise that the Commission supports the rationale behind most of the proposed amendments, and will cooperate constructively with Parliament on these issues."
"For formal reasons the Commission must nevertheless distance itself from the amendments in their present form."
"Concerning Amendments Nos 1 and 2, the Commission supports Parliament' s wish to be informed appropriately, in advance, about budgetary issues or other issues connected with the implementation of the Protocol."
"However, the Commission already makes relevant data available in accordance with the Interinstitutional Agreement."
"For this reason the Commission considers the proposal to be unnecessary."
"As regards Amendment No 3, the opinion of the Commission here too is that the amendment is largely covered by Interinstitutional Agreements, especially the Framework Agreement of 5 July 2000."
"The cost-benefit analysis referred to is part of the information provided to Parliament prior to the renewal of a Protocol."
"The Commission does not feel that annual cost-benefit analysis would be very useful."
"The Commission therefore cannot accept this proposal either."
"The Commission rejects Amendment No 4 on principle because it contradicts current practice with regard to Protocols to Fisheries Agreements and affects the Commission's powers of negotiation."
"As the Protocol is an annex to the framework agreement, no new mandate is required to renew it."
"It goes without saying, of course, that the Commission, as chief negotiator, has responsibility for ensuring that the guidelines laid down by the Council for the negotiations are adhered to."
"In the case of the Fourth Protocol with Greenland the Commission proposed guidelines for the negotiations - which were approved by the Council - because it wanted to introduce several far-reaching changes compared to the previous Protocol, especially the provision relating to a mid-term review."
"As far as the latter is concerned, too, the Commission will make an effort to inform Parliament, and especially the Committee on Fisheries, in the appropriate manner."
"Amendments Nos 5, 6 and 7 are not acceptable because they interfere with the authority of the Commission."
"The Commission agrees with the content of Amendment No 8, although it would forestall the mid-term review, and that does not seem sensible."
"The Commission cannot agree with Amendments Nos 9 and 10 because they do not correspond to some of the principles of the Common Fisheries Policy."
"Amendment No 9 fails to take into account the principle of relative stability, which assures certain Member States that they will have certain catch quotas in Greenlandic waters too."
"I would like to add here that the Commission constantly encourages Member States to utilise their fishing rights to the greatest extent possible and also always makes a point of reminding Member States of the possibilities of quota exchange."
"Amendment No 10 would result in 100% of the costs of the agreement being taken on by the fishermen, and this has never before been the case with any previous agreement."
"Such a proposal also raises considerable legal and practical problems and I think that it is unacceptable for this reason."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Extension of duty-free access to least-developed country products"
"The next item is the report (A5-0128/2001) by Mr Miranda, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the proposal for a Council Regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2820/98 applying a multiannual scheme of generalised tariff preferences for the period 1 July 1999 to 31 December 2001 so as to extend duty-free access without any quantitative restrictions to products originating in the least-developed countries (COM(2000) 561 - C5-0136/2001 - 2000/0239(COS))."
"Commissioner, I wish to begin by expressing my satisfaction at the inclusion of this report in today' s sitting, at the very time that in the buildings of the European Parliament in Brussels, the Third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries is taking place."
"This is a good opportunity to discuss this measure, which is designed specifically for these countries, but also to reflect, once again, on the problems affecting them and how these can be overcome, even though we have already considered and adopted a general proposal on this issue."
"Nevertheless, I must say straightaway that I profoundly deplore the Council' s decision not to involve the European Parliament in defining and considering this measure. I also deplore the fact that no representative of the Council is here with us today."
"I think that this is unacceptable behaviour and we hope that it does not set a precedent."
"Incidentally, since this is a measure designed to cover 49 countries, the vast majority of which are ACP countries, it would be desirable, when defining the measure, to sound out the views of these partners of ours. We should do this even if, or perhaps because the countries for which these measures are mainly intended, measures to exempt them from paying customs duties on products from the least-developed countries, are basically those who are not members of the ACP group."
"With regard to the measure itself and in general terms, we feel it is a positive step, although its scope is limited."
"I say limited because, as we all know, exports from these countries represent no more than 0.4% of world trade and 1% of the European Union' s imports. It is also limited because more than 99% of Community trade with these countries already benefits from complete exemption from customs duties."
"The measure is a positive step, which we would like to be seen as merely the first step in a deeper and more global approach, which we think is crucial, feasible and designed to respond to the countless problems facing the poorest countries in the world. I am not talking only in terms of trade."
"As a matter of fact, I think that it would be a huge mistake to be so presumptuous as to think that these countries' problems will all be resolved through measures that are primarily geared towards what is known, sometimes rather simplistically, as ""integration into the process of globalisation"" ."
"We must take account of the fact that, rather than solving these countries' problems, this process of liberalisation has ultimately become a genuine problem for them, given that their economies are so weak and that the gap separating them from the industrialised countries is so wide."
"At the same time, we must not forget that just as important, if not more important than access to the market for these countries is their ability to feed communities that often have no access to the most basic means of subsistence, and this should make our main concern their self-sufficiency, food security and also the survival of their family-based farming structure."
"Furthermore, still in the field of trade, there are various other aspects we must consider in addition to facilitating the export of the products laid down in this measure."
"I am talking about the prices of products normally exported by these countries, which are being gradually but constantly knocked down. This also applies to the non-diversification of production and, consequently, to the concentration of exports around a limited range of products, moreover not specialised products, not to mention, for example, the sensitive issue of rules of origin."
"Basically, although we should give the final version of the agreement as adopted by the Council the broad approval it deserves, for the reasons I have mentioned, it still raises some particular concerns."
"The first of these specifically concerns the transitional periods that have at last been adopted for sugar, rice and bananas, although we are fully aware of the problems that the issue raises and I do not, therefore, think that this matter should be a source of further controversy."
"Secondly, I feel that we need to ensure that there is proper supervision of the agreement' s implementation in order to guarantee that the LDCs and their communities really are its final and definitive beneficiaries. We must also ensure that the agreement is not implemented in a way that puts the ACP countries at a disadvantage."
"In my opinion, an appropriate and broad allocation of quotas for the types of exports covered could improve the effectiveness and discipline of the agreement' s implementation."
"I shall finish by saying that, in any event, it appears essential to monitor the real impact of implementing this agreement."
", draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Lamy, thank you, Mr Miranda, for your excellent report."
"I too am pleased, despite the criticism I have concerning this initiative of the Commission."
"I feel that granting the least developed countries greater access to our markets is a first step in the right direction."
"Of course we in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development would also have liked to be involved in the decision-making process from the outset, instead of having to decide on an objective that ultimately has already been decided."
"We hope that such matters will be settled differently in future."
"In principle, the Committee on Agriculture too welcomes this initiative, although of course it has formulated a whole range of reservations."
"There is perhaps a legitimate fear that, via triangular operations, more goods - such as sugar for example - could enter the European Union than these countries produce."
"This can be prevented, however, by giving individual countries a quota for the amount of sugar they can supply."
"This would be easy to keep track of, and also feasible using present-day methods."
"A fear repeatedly expressed was that goods would now enter the country that do not comply with our health and hygiene regulations."
"To this I can only say that we already have very clear European Union regulations regarding what food products may be imported into the EU at all."
"In my opinion - and this brings me to a more personal part - accepting this report was the right thing to do - for the Committee on Agriculture too."
"But in many respects the attitude adopted by the Committee on Agriculture is too protectionist for my liking."
"One need only look at what a tiny share of European Union trade these countries account for."
"These countries are dependent on a few products that they can export."
"It is right for the report to talk about 'everything but arms' ."
"That is precisely what we supply to these countries and what we are least likely to import from these countries, as they do not produce arms of the quality we require."
"I also believe that we have no need to fear being flooded with goods."
"I would have wished the Council to adopt the Commission's proposal to stick with the original three-year transitional period."
"I also feel it is important, however, that we support these countries in producing for their regional markets."
"In this regard I think it is slightly cynical of the Committee on Agriculture to include the motion that we have to keep an eye on these developing countries to ensure that they are not turning excessively to producing crops for export."
"Up until now virtually no one has really bothered about this."
"In the Committee on Agriculture I also saw motions to delete altogether the sentence stating that we welcome this initiative."
"I think this is regrettable, especially when one considers that the European Union represents a community based on solidarity that operates with large transfers of funds."
"Why then should we not give the poorest people in this world a certain transfer too?"
"As I said before, I would have liked the Committee on Agriculture to take a much less protectionist stance."
"But there I shall leave it for the moment."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I too should like to highlight the appropriate timing of this debate in the context of the Third United Nations Conference on Least Developed Countries, which is now being held in Brussels."
"And precisely for that reason I believe it is worth putting the debate in context by reminding ourselves that the world of the 49 least developed countries at which the measure we are concerned with is aimed is a world where life expectancy barely exceeds 50 years, where 10% of infants die before their first birthday, where 50% of children under five suffer from malnutrition, and where the average per capita GDP is little more than EUR 282 per year."
"These are figures that still shock us even though are they well known."
"They shock us, first of all, because these figures are not just abstract statistics but speak for those who cannot speak for themselves, and because we know that every figure reflects real conditions which affect people who are also real."
"People who have the same rights and the same dignity as we have, who see poverty and underdevelopment looming over them for the simple reason that they were born where they were born."
"Secondly, these figures shock us because, despite the aid and development policies that the European Union and the Member States carry out to fight poverty and underdevelopment throughout the world, not only are the figures not coming down but the abyss separating the rich countries from the poor countries is growing ever deeper."
"Now, changing the reality reflected by these figures means we must not just sit back in resignation but must enter the field of action and practical measures."
"Thus on behalf of my Group I should like to congratulate you, Commissioner, on the 'Everything but arms' initiative."
"This initiative is a good step in the right direction, although to optimise the results that may come of it additional measures should be taken in additional fields."
"That is precisely why I regret the fact that the Council, under pressure from certain Member States which I prefer not to name, has introduced longer transitional periods, as has already been reported, which may lessen and in any case delay the impact of this initiative on these countries' economies."
"I also regret the points in the draft resolution of the report we are discussing which were highlighted by the representative of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr Kreissl-Dörfler, which show a desire either to protect the interests of the Member States or to safeguard the advantages of the ACP countries."
"Both these interests and these advantages may be legitimate."
"But in no case, in the Christian Democrat view, should they prevail over the duty of the European Union to foster lasting economic and social development in developing countries, particularly the least developed countries, as the Treaty stipulates."
"Mr President, we think Commissioner Lamy' s 'Everything but arms' initiative, which should allow the least developed countries to place their products on European Union markets with no quantitative or tariff restrictions, is a positive measure."
"In this overall evaluation we agree both with Joaquim Miranda and his report, which was approved by our Committee on Development and Cooperation, and with the concerns and criticisms that the rapporteur expresses with regard to the proposed amendments to the Regulation that we are discussing here."
"We also feel it is unnecessary, mean and even pathetic that for products like sugar, rice and bananas the proposed opening-up will not be fully effective until 2009."
"The reasons that have led to this cautious measure do not seem justified to us."
"Other machinery could have been set up to protect Community production of these foodstuffs without diminishing the value of the initiative we are debating through this move."
"We believe that the proposal made by Mr Miranda that this whole question should be discussed with our partners, the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, within the context of the Cotonou Agreement, is also pertinent."
"This 'Everything but arms' programme is essentially a political gesture, the essential value of which lies in the European Union' s show of solidarity towards those who are most in need within the developing world."
"As a gesture, it is of interest and important, but there is no reason to exaggerate its consequences - which some have defined as a threat to certain sectors in the European Union - or to exaggerate its positive effects, which are certainly very limited, on the economies of the actual countries affected."
"Even though this is all it may be, what should be stressed is that it is a little step in the right direction."
"Perhaps the most debatable point is the discrimination it makes among developing countries between least developed and slightly more developed ones; this is an arbitrary division and therefore one that introduces injustice, something that in the medium term we should overcome."
"Lastly, I shall mention a detail that we believe is indispensable and which is already hinted at in the regulation to which this initiative refers. It is the need to establish strict controls to prevent fraud, whereby the produce of other countries, even highly-developed ones, might reach Europe via countries that are beneficiaries of these measures in order to benefit from the new conditions established here."
"This really could become dangerous, and it would also be cheating the generous intentions behind the measure, which if defrauded would turn against the interests of those whom we are trying to help today."
"Mr President, the Commission put forward a good proposal - at least from a strategic point of view - and, at any event, it is a step in the right direction."
"However, having been through the Council' s mangle, it undeniably looks less impressive."
"Industry has lobbied well, in the sense that it has succeeded in convincing certain Member States that the EU system will collapse if developing countries are given the opportunity to export just a little bit more sugar and rice than they do at present."
"I will not even go into the subject of bananas."
"Despite the fact that the EU countries like to use fine words about being advocates of the free market, protectors of the developing countries and a region with responsibility in the world and with high social ideals, etc. etc., it is apparent that these kinds of words can generally only be used on special occasions."
"There is occasionally something of a gap between words and action and, if there is one thing that the developing countries need, then it is action."
"As other speakers have mentioned, there is a kind of tragi-comic situation in the fact that the opportunities of the least developed and poorest nations are being discussed in Brussels right now whilst we are simultaneously having the same debate."
"It is to be feared that, in both places, the discussion will end once again with a lot of words and, in reality, very little action."
"But OK, it is a small step in the right direction, and so we can only wish the Commission luck with the new proposal and the new communication on sustainability which also, after all, mentions agriculture. We must therefore hope that the Commission has the necessary strength to settle matters with the agricultural organisations in the various countries."
"In any event, it is absolutely necessary for us to get to grips with the problems associated with the poorest countries, the number of which has, after all, grown from 25 to 49 over the past 30 years, with only one country disappearing from the list."
"The developing countries need free trade, debt rescheduling and aid, both technical and economic, and all three are needed urgently."
"Mr President, while some of the motivations behind this initiative are obviously very good, the Greens/EFA Group has a number of questions about the initiative, both on the details and the general thrust."
"On the detail, as has been said, about 99% of LDC exports already enter EU markets duty free."
"The problem is not so much about access as about supply-side constraints, about issues concerning infrastructure, education and training."
"Agriculture is the key area where LDCs do not currently have access, yet it is precisely the area in which we see delays in relation to sugar, rice and bananas."
"Others have raised legitimate concerns about food security in poorer countries."
"Rather than using their land for ever-increasing exports of agricultural commodities to the north, there are important questions to be asked about feeding their own populations."
"I want to raise the question of the general principle behind this initiative."
"When I was at the ACP meeting in Gabon earlier this year, Commissioner Nielson praised the initiative by saying that it was a great sign of progress that poor countries are now being thrust into competition with each other."
"To me that is not a sign of progress, but a sign of madness."
"If the poorer countries compete with each other on small numbers of commodities that can only bring down international prices, with the winners being those in the north, not those in the south."
"Markets in the north are not, sadly, infinite."
"We are already seeing how the EBA risks undermining the Cotonou Agreement and how the preferential access that has already been guaranteed to ACP countries is now coming under threat."
"In some senses the EU is being accused of taking from the poor to help the poorest."
"Finally, I am concerned that open markets and global integration are becoming a substitute for development policies."
"We need to think more imaginatively about supporting poorer countries in their own regional development strategies."
"Commissioner, you described the 'Everything but Arms' initiative as a world first."
"If this initiative begins to have a real effect in the near future, bringing about a qualitative and effective improvement in the quality of the living conditions of the people concerned, then, yes, it will be a world first."
"Even so, if I may, I would firstly like to ask about the timing of this initiative, which is scheduled a few months prior to the re-launch of the WTO negotiations."
"It would be regrettable if this proposal were used primarily to attempt to bring round all the developing countries to the European position at the WTO."
"I would, however, like to look at the content of this initiative."
"Europe imports six times the amount of agricultural products from LDCs than the United States, yet this only represents 1% of all the European Union' s exports."
"This shows the magnitude of the effort that rich countries must make in order to attempt to restore some balance within the world trade system, which more than works in their favour."
"Several aspects of this initiative give me cause for concern, however."
"First of all, the lack of consultation with either Parliament or the ACP countries, which are stressing, as they did at the Joint Assembly, that the preferential system for sugar, for example, as well as all the Community protocols, could be compromised."
"Also, the need to reclassify impact studies in order to improve understanding and take into account the legitimate concerns expressed with regard to the potential negative effects."
"Then, products destined for industrialised countries should benefit from access to minimum guaranteed prices and should be protected from fluctuations in exchange rates, whereas the economies of the LDCs are all too often dependent on the international environment and on the exports of one or two basic products."
"Lastly, diversifying production must be actively encouraged, all the more so because, as confirmed by experts at the United Nations, production capabilities were weakened in the last decade and some industries died out due to competition from imports."
"The French High Council for International Cooperation stresses, for example, that the right of the LDCs to protect and to support their fragile industry, particularly in terms of their food safety, must be recognised."
"Now, in order to guarantee this sovereignty of food, to make considerable progress in meeting the people' s most pressing needs and to have access to technology, the LDCs are in dangerous and vital need of substantial external funding, and for this to be provided in a spirit of cooperation which will help develop their production capacity."
"If we can give them help by opening up our markets to their products, the liberalisation of trade cannot be seen as a development policy."
"How, indeed, can essential needs be met when the growing burden of debt continues to condemn every attempt made by these countries to invest in a future?"
"In 1970, this debt was equal to 10% of the developing countries' GNP, and now it represents more than 40% of their GNP, whereas the total amount of public money given is less than that paid in interest on the debt."
"France had, in fact, made a commitment at the second Conference on LDCs to give 0.20% of its GNP, but in 1999, only 0.08% was actually given."
"I cannot stress enough the gravity of the situation behind these figures half of the population lives on less than EUR 2 per day, one in three does not have access to electricity, one child in three suffers from malnutrition."
"The time has come, therefore, to listen..."
"(President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, in the Commission report on the Union' s development policy, which was published last year, it was noted that the EU' s trade policy has more impact on the development of countries than the total sum of the entire aid policy."
"The Commission' s 'Everything but Arms' initiative is therefore commendable."
"However, for the least developed countries, market access is not sufficient."
"They lack the infrastructure to capitalise on market access."
"Furthermore, the transitional periods for rice, sugar and bananas are long, and after these, a safeguard measure can be used at will."
"Additionally, the EU' s product requirements are high."
"In order to turn the initiative into a real success, it is important to help the least developed countries gain market access."
"Technical assistance is required if the requirements which European consumers prescribe in terms of their food are to be met."
"Only then can food safety be taken as a guiding principle."
"Otherwise, the European market will retain its protectionist character."
"I emphatically support the rapporteur' s call for a study of the actual implications of the initiative."
"In the past, the indigenous people of the least developed countries rarely benefited from the opening up of markets."
"The evaluation of the Lomé agreements in the 90s made that abundantly clear."
"Unfortunately, the Miranda report contains a few contradictions."
"The text of our resolution has the feel of a compromise."
"The European farmers, the ACP group, the consumers, they all seem to be gaining from it."
"Although I understand the positions of all parties in and outside the European Union, I still believe that we need to make a choice."
"Either we choose to improve the situation of 600 million people in the least developed countries, or we do not."
"Finally, Mr President, I would urge the Commission also to involve the US and Japan in the 'Everything but Arms' initiative at the LDC Conference, which is currently being held in Brussels."
"Mr President, as the Socialist shadow rapporteur on 'Everything but Arms' I welcome this agreement as a significant step in advancing fairer trade access to bring development to the world's poorest countries."
"Commissioner Lamy has been accused of many things in bringing this forward: of a cynical attempt to buy votes in the WTO; of seducing developing countries into untrammelled free trade; of seeking to divide the solidarity of the ACP countries; of robbing the poor to pay the poorest."
"Each of these criticisms has some validity and we need to keep them at the front of our concerns as we take this issue forward."
"But Mr Lamy should be congratulated, after years of inaction, for helping us take a huge step towards bringing down agricultural protectionism which - according to the United Nations - robs developing countries of some USD 100 billion a year, more than twice the amount of international aid flows."
"In his reply, let me ask the Commissioner to address some important questions."
"When Ingo Feustal of DG Trade told our Committee on Development and Cooperation on 6 March that Cotonou consultation procedures had been followed and joint impact assessments would be produced, the Commissioner should honestly accept tonight that Declaration XXIII of the Cotonou Agreement, requiring a joint-ministerial trade committee recommendation, was not observed and that no such assessments have yet been produced."
"Mr Lamy should commit the EU to providing the aid required by the LDCs to exploit the new opportunities and by other ACP countries to achieve transition."
"He should recognise that the EU is currently badly failing to fulfil its promise to the rum-producing countries."
"Mr Lamy should guarantee that administrative arrangements will prevent hygiene rules being used as a disguised form of protectionism and, at the same time, apply rules of origin which prevent fraud but enable LDCs to add value to their raw materials."
"Finally, Mr Lamy and I both come from sugar-producing regions."
"Like him I strongly resisted those who sought to scare our farmers and industry with wholly misleading claims about the consequences of the proposal."
"We all know they are dwarfed in reality by the impact of the sugar protocol within the common agricultural policy."
"Mr President, now that the Berlin Wall has gone, the walls around Europe must also be razed to the ground."
"The overprotection of our markets is at the expense of the poor, and particularly the poorest, countries."
"That is why my group too applauds the 'Everything but Arms' initiative."
"However, free market access will not automatically lead to a higher level of exports from the least developed countries."
"For that to happen, supply, above all, will need to become better, more diverse and more competitive."
"Also, exports should not be at the expense of the local market."
"The current initiative will not be able to substantially improve the economic situation in the least developed countries."
"Indeed, what does free access mean without the means or the expertise to raise industry to Western standards?"
"What does this fine initiative mean if it does not apply to sugar, bananas and rice for the time being?"
"Precisely those products which many countries can offer competitively."
"Europe must help the least developed countries to cope with globalisation."
"For that reason, all walls will need to be taken down."
"So, the European Union is opening its borders to all products from the least developed countries, except arms, as if Mali or Bangladesh exported arms to Europe anyway."
"Everything but arms - but bananas, sugar and rice too, or, in other words, sensitive sectors for European countries but staple sectors for the LDCs."
"Furthermore, 40 of the 48 LDCs were already reaping the benefits of these preferences in the framework of the Lomé trade system."
"Therefore, their situation will not change in the slightest because of this measure."
"On the other hand, however, it is the non-LDCs that will feel the change, with the end of non-reciprocal trade preferences under the Cotonou Agreement and the creation of free trade areas by 2008."
"This measure will actually stimulate competition between the LDCs and non-LDCs, even within the same ACP group, which has not even been consulted."
"We are still taking the approach that only liberalisation and competition can lead to development."
"In return, as has already been mentioned, Mr Lamy is obviously expecting support from the LDCs at the negotiations in Qatar and, more broadly speaking, expecting them to join the WTO."
"On the face of it, these proposals appear to be favourable, but they risk confining the LDCs to the role of exporters of raw materials, at the expense even of the food requirements of their own populations."
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Miranda, for the valuable support he has given to what was the Commission' s and is now the European Union' s initiative."
"Opening up our markets to the poorest countries, and this time, fully opening up our markets, has, overall, been well received, although it is undeniable and to be expected that this proposal should have given rise to some concern and some criticism, both in this House and in the Council."
"I shall therefore try to give very brief answers on the various issues that have been raised, starting with the impact of this proposal, which, we are occasionally told, would pave the way for a massive influx of agricultural products from the LDCs onto the EU' s market; your report itself puts into perspective the concessions made in terms of volume."
"It is true as you have said that these countries account for only 0.4% of total world trade and 1% of EU imports."
"These figures are unlikely to increase in a sudden and spectacular manner, especially when the export capabilities of these countries are taken into account."
"We are, however, committed to increasing these capabilities, particularly by imposing health standards, as Mr Kreissl-Dörfler mentioned, but also and more generally by improving infrastructures."
"We, and by 'we' I mean the Commission, Poul Nielson and myself, do not, therefore, see this as a substitute for aid, and here I am replying directly to the point made by Mrs Lucas."
"With regard to the deadlines, it is true that the Commission has re-examined its original proposal in light of the discussions held on the impact of this proposal."
"It is correct to say that we changed the schedule to bring about a gradual opening of the market, but over time to open it completely, for bananas, sugar and rice."
"It was on this basis that the Council gave its final opinion."
"Some regret these concessions."
"I myself would probably have preferred not to give concessions, but our common law is that of qualified majority and we had to achieve a qualified majority."
"As for respecting the Cotonou Agreements, I would like to reiterate that the ACP ministers welcomed this proposal last December, and that they stressed the need to respect this agreement, which is what we have done."
"The Commission consulted Mrs Boudjenah and Mr Rod as well as the ACP countries on its proposal, and is currently in consultation with the ACP countries on the provisions needed to maintain the competitiveness of these countries, in accordance with Declaration XXIII, which Mr Howitt quite rightly quoted."
"With regard to the desire expressed by some of you to make more progress, the report clearly demonstrates that universal agreement has not been reached on either the timetable or the resources."
"We are taking a step in the right direction and we are endeavouring to make our actions match our words."
"Let us begin by implementing this proposal and let us encourage other trading partners, as Mr Belder proposed, to move in this direction as well."
"The Commission shares the rapporteur' s point of view on consultation with Parliament."
"This was a decision that would have been submitted to the codecision procedure if the Commission and Parliament proposals at the Intergovernmental Conference on reform of Article 133 had been accepted by the Member States."
"We know now that this did not happen and that we are, therefore, bound by the rules of the Treaty, which, on the issue of Parliament' s involvement, unfortunately remains unchanged."
"We have, therefore, worked and, in accordance with the commitments I undertook when I entered office, I personally have worked directly with the various competent parliamentary committees, with the Committee on Development and Cooperation in January, with the Committee on Agriculture at the end of January and with the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy in February, and I fully intend to continue doing so, unfortunately with the inadequate Treaty texts, which involves working on all the important paragraphs of our trade policy with the House."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this report represents a valuable contribution to our efforts to avoid the LDCs becoming marginalised in a trading system that is becoming increasingly global."
"The discussion that we are holding today is, nonetheless, welcome, as Mrs Ferrer said, given the UN Conference currently taking place in Brussels."
"I believe that this report confirms the breadth of consensus between our two institutions on our main goals for managing the multilateral trade regime."
"As Mr Martínez Martínez said, this is a small step rather than a great leap forwards, but it is undeniably a politically important step, no more, no less."
"It is now up to us to work resolutely towards putting this into practice."
"Thank you for your attention."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Maritime safety"
"The next item is the joint debate on two recommendations for second reading:"
"(A5-0140/2001) by Mr Watts, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council Directive amending Council Directive 95/21/EC concerning the enforcement, in respect of shipping using Community ports and sailing in the waters under the jurisdiction of the Member States, of international standards for ship safety, pollution prevention and shipboard living and working conditions (port State control) (5179/1/2001 - C5-0074/2001 - 2000/0065(COD));"
"(A5-0144/2001) by Mr Ortuondo Larrea, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 94/57/EC on common rules and standards for ship inspection and survey organisations and for the relevant activities of maritime administrations (5178/1/2001 - C5-0075/2001 - 2000/0066(COD))."
"Mr President, I begin by paying tribute to the Council and the Commission for the efforts they have both made to reach an agreement on a text which I believe will significantly improve maritime safety."
"But the question that has yet to be satisfactorily answered is why did the Erika have to break up for the glaring deficiencies in maritime safety to become apparent?"
"Indeed we only need to look at statistics produced by the Paris MOU organisation to see the appalling state of too many of the world's ships."
"These statistics were available long before the Erika and continue to show that standards are actually deteriorating."
"As rapporteur, I maintain my position that the Erika package will help to improve maritime safety but I am afraid will not prevent another Erika."
"I do not make that point lightly."
"It will only, as an amendment to an existing directive, be effective if the Member States concerned are willing to implement it effectively."
"If you look at the existing controls, several Member States simply fail to fulfil their legal responsibilities."
"I am very pleased that the Commissioner has taken swift and decisive action to try to ensure that this is no longer the case."
"I welcome the joint determination on the part of the institutions to toughen these measures."
"In particular, I recommend that we support the proposals to focus our checks on the black-listed flag states and introduce a 'three strikes and you're out' rule whereby a ship detained for the third time within a specific period will be banned from Europe's ports."
"I regret the lack of progress on the issue of the voyage data recorder, the 'black box' ."
"We believe, as a Parliament - and we have said this many times in the past - that this is essential for both environmental and safety reasons."
"We are pleased that the Commission favours, in principle, a 'black box' being fitted to all ships."
"We are pleased that the Council has made a political commitment to this effect."
"But what we need is not a political commitment but a legally binding commitment to ensure that these are introduced to old ships and new within five years."
"The case for fitting VDRs has been made very often."
"Indeed the IMO itself has agreed in principle that they should be fitted."
"Vessels fitted with voyage data recorders have a better safety awareness and a better safety record."
"In other words, it is not just useful after the event but contributes - in my view - to a change of the safety culture for every ship to be fitted with a 'black box' voyage data recorder."
"According to the UK Marine Accident Investigation Branch, the reluctance to accept the value of data recorders and take positive measures to fit them in merchant vessels is ""a contributory factor to the poor safety record of some ships sailing today""."
"A ship fitted with a 'black box' is a safer ship."
"I know that the Commissioner and the Commission have worked hard to try to seek a compromise in this very difficult and complex area."
"I would welcome tonight a report back on progress with regard to reaching a satisfactory compromise on the particular issue of the 'black box' ."
"The public simply will not understand why, after so many tragic events at sea - the Herald of Free Enterprise, the Scandinavian Star, the Estonia, the Erika and many others - we cannot just get on and fit 'black box' voyage data recorders."
"Finally, I thank my Parliamentary colleagues for the assistance they have given me over the past few months in preparing this report."
"I say that to colleagues from all political parties, from all Member States."
"I also look to them for continued support through the codecision process."
"This, I believe, will be the first time in the field of maritime safety that we as an institution will be using the new powers granted to us by the Amsterdam Treaty."
"Let us use them so that we can look in the eye the families that have lost loved ones at sea and say to them that we will not compromise on safety."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it is now a year and a half since the tragic accident of the Erika, which caused a real environmental disaster on the French coast near the Straits of Dover."
"During this time the European Parliament has been working on a proposal made to us by the Commission, called the Erika I package, containing two or three important reports."
"One of them has been approved; the second, by Mr Watts, has been commented on by him; and the third deals with classification societies, the organisations that specialise in carrying out vessel safety inspections. These are of particular importance to us because, if we do not manage to properly ensure that ships sailing under the flags of European Union Member States - or better still all ships - do so in suitably safe conditions, we are going to have to put up with a lot more accidents like that of the Erika."
"Sadly, as I said at the beginning, it is a year and a half since that accident in December 1999 and we are still here debating the Commission proposal at its second reading."
"I think we will have to go on debating it in Parliament."
"I do not believe that we in the European institutions are responding adequately to citizens' demands."
"I believe they want faster, more effective responses in areas that do not just affect people but, as in this case, also affect the environment, animals and plants."
"On 30 November 2000, the European Parliament approved eighteen amendments to the Commission proposal at first reading, and in its amended proposal of 12 December 2000 the Commission only partially accepted Parliament' s amendments."
"On the basis of the political agreement reached in December 2000, the Council approved its common position on 28 February 2001, in which it accepted fourteen of the amendments proposed by Parliament."
"When the matter was considered anew in the Parliamentary Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, certain questions were again raised. I shall mention in particular, in increasing order of importance, first that recognised organisations should not be authorised or engaged if they or their staff have certain links with ship owners or operators."
"The Committee has also accepted that it should be general practice for recognised organisations to consult with each other periodically to maintain their quality standards and also that these classification societies should agree to provide the Commission with periodical reports and be willing to cooperate with Port State control administrations."
"There was an amendment, which I myself withdrew at the Commission and Council' s demand, concerning the cases where a classification society did not have its headquarters or main office in the European Community."
"I believe this matter is also important, because we are going to monitor classification societies that are based in our countries but not those possibly recognised ones that have their headquarters outside our countries."
"But the most important thing - and this is where the greatest disagreement lies - is the financial liability of classification societies when they are negligent in some way in their vessel inspection duties."
"In view of the Commission' s proposal that there should be a ceiling to this financial liability of classification societies, the European Parliament has attempted to find a compromise with the Council' s position by providing an option, so that instead of a fixed limit there can be a range within which each Member State can choose its own most fitting or most appropriate ceiling."
"The Council, however, rejects this position and does not want to talk about ceilings."
"I think we need to go into this further in order to reach an agreement as quickly as possible."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank both rapporteurs."
"After months of work, Mr Watts and Mr Larrea have succeeded in reaching consensus on both reports in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism."
"We had a united stance at the first reading and we will be united again for the second reading tomorrow."
"For this reason, I do not want to say very much at all about the information they have presented on this matter, but will move straight on to procedure."
"I regret, however, that the Council again rejected our offer to carry out an informal conciliation procedure so that the Erika I package could be concluded with regard to these two directives in the next few days."
"Our offer was to seek a compromise prior to the official second reading in Parliament and then jointly conclude the dossier in the next few days with the confirmation of the Council."
"I think it is a pity that this cannot be achieved."
"There are two remarks I would like to make here: first I would like to mention that I had to negotiate hard with Mr Gayssot, the French Transport Minister, like my colleagues on the railway package, but at least he was available and we were able to speak."
"The Swedish Presidency was not there at all."
"As the European Parliament, we should pass a resolution that unofficial three-way discussions should only be agreed to if the minister participates."
"After all, we do not send our conseillers to an informal conciliation procedure; we try to bring our own personal weight to bear."
"The second practical point concerns what the Council offered us twice as a compromise, which in fact was an insult to our intelligence, since it was not a compromise at all."
"I only hope that the Council, and the Swedish Presidency, may yet think better of it."
"We are prepared to continue negotiating until the end of June, after this resolution and after the Council has passed a resolution on this matter, in order to reach an outcome quickly in a Conciliation Procedure."
"I have an important request to make of you, Madam Vice-President: we as the European Parliament represent the concerns of the Commission in this matter, as the Commission too wants to introduce a voyage data recorder."
"However, as Parliament we are very much afraid, no, we are sure, that the Council is always putting the brakes on us and delaying this matter so that we cannot move on to Erika II."
"If the Commission is in favour of voyage data recorders, it should support us in the Watts report."
"The same goes for the Ortuondo Larrea report."
"We are on the side of the Commission, which has proposed maximum limits."
"When we suggest as a compromise setting minimum and maximum amounts for the financial liability of classification societies, then this is a fair compromise."
"Mr President, I hope that the Commission not only has its eye on the Council, but that it will honour its promise, bearing in mind that the Commission and Parliament are natural allies."
"Mr President, in German there is a saying that goes 'before the court and on the high sea one is in God's hands' ."
"Before the court this is certainly likely to be the case, but on the high sea we can give God a helping hand, and I believe that the Commission did this when it originally put forward the Erika I package. We should perhaps recollect here that this package also included the port state control administrations, the classification societies, and proposals with regard to double-hulled vessels."
"I too would like to thank Mr Ortuondo and Mr Watts very warmly for their work."
"Mr Ortuondo pointed out earlier that one and a half years have now passed and I believe that at some point the people too will say: how long does it actually take you in Europe to pass regulations when a disaster like the Erika takes place?"
"It would be good if the Council would make a bit of an effort, as our colleague Mr Jarzembowski said earlier."
"The Commission and Parliament are ready."
"All we need for proper regulation is the Council."
"I think it is obvious that - as Mr Watts said - the only issue left to discuss is that of the voyage data recorder."
"We must be able to find a solution here."
"I have no wish to conceal the fact that I personally am not one hundred percent convinced as regards the issue of ceilings for the liability of classification societies."
"However, I think that if we as a Parliament want to stay together, then we must be united in a conciliation procedure too."
"Sometimes, therefore, one must be able to set aside one's own reservations."
"But an abstention from voting is also a possible way of demonstrating unity in Parliament."
"Commissioner, I have a small request: could you perhaps, independently of the two dossiers, give an appraisal of what was decided by the IMO at the end of April on the issue of double-hulled vessels, and tell us what the opinion of the Commission is on it?"
"That would be good, because then we would have the whole package."
"We clearly ought to enter into the conciliation procedure with the Council."
"But maybe then it would not take so long."
"Because - and Mr Jarzembowski is quite right - it is high time that we concluded this and time that we were able to tell the public that we have taken political action."
"The public expects this, and so it must be done."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteurs for producing these successful reports and for their excellent work."
"The reports focus attention on the essential factors in increasing maritime safety."
"There is still, however, much to be done to improve maritime safety."
"Besides imposing stricter rules, we have to ensure that the solutions implemented are realistic and, furthermore, viable."
"The Council has incorporated in its general position a large number of the amendments adopted at Parliament' s first reading."
"Regarding classification societies, the problem is amending the article that deals with liability in such a way that maximum as well as minimum limits are defined in it."
"Many Member States do not, however, intend to accept that a maximum limit should be set."
"With regard to the directive on Port State control, the problem is the black boxes, which we must hurry to fit in vessels."
"There must be a black box on all ships, but financial reality makes it necessary to seek solutions wherein present cargo vessels could be equipped with technically simplified black boxes."
"In my opinion, the approval and scrutiny of classification societies must be tightened up."
"Expanded inspections must be made of high-risk vessels in particular."
"The criteria for allowing high-risk, blacklisted vessels access to a port must be made more stringent."
"Our group thinks it important that a solution be found for the problems, that both proposals be adopted speedily, and that we make progress in matters of safety."
"I still nevertheless wish to draw attention to the fact that decisions made solely within the Union to increase maritime safety are not enough. For example, questions of liability must be dealt with on a global basis."
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank the rapporteurs warmly for the huge amount of work they have done."
"Secondly, I should like to echo what Mr Jarzembowski said."
"I believe that there is a great deal of truth in it."
"It is all about the procedure at the moment."
"I am increasingly being driven to distraction with regard to the way in which we are time and time again pushed into codecisions."
"I would want things to move faster, and that should be possible."
"In fact, everyone - whether it be the IMO or the Commission - is convinced that such a voyage data recorder, for example, is useful."
"Ultimately, we have very difficult procedures behind us, involving Mr Gayssot, inter alia."
"In my opinion, we should be able to achieve results faster one way or another, not just now, but also in future."
"That is one thing."
"Secondly, I believe we are right in retrieving the VDR by means of an amendment and, thirdly, it is even more important specifically to consider the evaluation of port State control, for that is what matters."
"That also includes the quality of that Port State control; not just the technical side of things, but also the human factor, such as the way in which the crew is set up."
"I have a good mind, pending the second Erika package, to ask again for extra consideration to be given particularly to the crew, the number of crew, the nature of the crew, etc. I believe we simply need to draft another proposal in this connection, for we are not adequately covering that area, and the public will be at a loss to understand why that is."
"Mr President, there was a time when European businesses ruled the seven seas in terms of transport."
"To do this, they used their own ships which were registered in the country in which the owner was based, and mainly employed crew from their own countries."
"The substances they transported were less harmful than now, and they were little affected by extremely cheap competitors, particularly from the Third World."
"Furthermore, they could not afford any major scandals affecting public opinion in their own countries."
"It is precisely in those circumstances that working conditions and safety in shipping were far from ideal."
"But State governments and trade unions were better equipped than they are at present to monitor the course of events."
"If businesses wish to withdraw from State intervention, this can best be done in shipping activities partly carried out outside of the territorial waters of States."
"In those areas, attempts are made to use unsound ships and underpaid crew."
"These ships are registered in a country other than that of the owners, and that is preferably a country were taxes are low and the level of inspection negligible."
"Crews are recruited where unemployment is high and wages are low."
"Many ships are obsolete and neglected, and the chances of waste and cargo ending up in the sea are significant."
"Safety for the crew is generally minimal, and the environmental risks high."
"I am, in fact, of the opinion that ships should not be inspected by private classification societies, but rather by the government, in sound coordination with trade union and environmental movements."
"Until that is the case, it remains crucial to ensure that classification societies are not dependent on those they are meant to monitor, for, without such a guarantee, any form of control would be an empty exercise."
"I am keen to support proposals which rule out classification societies if they have ties with the ship' s owner and which demand better periodical inspection of these societies."
"That is a step forward, as is banning single-hulled tankers and refusing access to ships from states sailing under a so-called 'flag of convenience' ."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we welcome the Council's decision to include in the common position the essential points of the amendments adopted by this House."
"We of the UEN Group consider particularly important the fact that the Council, like the European Parliament, has endorsed the principle that the system for inspecting certain potentially dangerous ships, an extended inspection to take place annually, should be mandatory rather than discretionary."
"Who knows how many environmental disasters we could have averted for our marine life, our coasts, our fishing fleets and our tourist operators?"
"Who knows how many oil tanker wrecks, how many deaths, how much serious pollution we would have avoided in our continent if proper inspections had been carried out?"
"Let it be quite clear that these inspections should not just assess the technical aspects of vessels but also respect for social standards on crew living and working conditions and crew training as well."
"I would point out that 70-75% of accidents are caused by the human factor."
"I would like to end by saying we welcome the fact that the Council has recognised the importance of installing voyage data recorders, better known as black boxes, on board vessels."
"In our view, this should not just be an essential condition for entry into European Union ports but also an effective way of applying one of the underlying principles of Community environmental policy: 'Polluter pays' ."
"Mr President, the most important and fundamental comment that I must make in this debate, as MEP for the Atlantic regions, is that, 18 months after the Erika disaster, the many people affected by this terrible oil slick are caught up in a very slow, complex and extremely unfair compensation process."
"Out of 1 200 applications for compensation, only 200 have been paid under the IOPCF Convention."
"The sums which are being claimed, and which are justified, are systematically reduced on an arbitrary basis."
"The procedures take so long that many coastal businesses are at risk of bankruptcy, particularly shellfish and fish farmers, and the fishing and tourist industries."
"The IOPCF Convention functions as a mechanism to limit the responsibility of the oil companies, which are thus exonerated of a considerable proportion of cover for the damage that they themselves have caused."
"It is now more obvious why the United States steered clear of this mechanism; as the settlement by Exxon of the total damages caused in the Exxon Valdez disaster, in other words, FRF 50 billion, would never have been paid had it become involved."
"The total damages caused in the sinking of the Erika, are admittedly more modest and are currently estimated to be FRF 5 billion, but a maximum compensation of FRF 1.2 billion can be paid under the IOPCF Convention and not a penny more, because compensation paid under the Convention relates to sums held by the Fund, and not to the losses sustained by the victims."
"The State and local authorities are therefore forced to make up the shortfall, which means that the taxpayer has to bear the costs of a proportion of the responsibility that falls to the polluter."
"We absolutely must correct this extremely serious discrepancy."
"We have made a good start with the first Erika package, which is being considered tonight at second reading and we, in my group, approve of the improvements proposed by the rapporteurs, for giving responsibility to ship classification societies."
"However, when this House considers the second Erika package, we must ensure that a genuine system of responsibilities is established that is clear, fair and which also acts as a deterrent to the two main players, the shipowners and charterers."
"Mr President, we are reminded daily of the need to achieve results speedily in the area of maritime safety."
"Only this week there was another accident involving a cement freighter in the so-called Kadetrenden channel in the Baltic Sea between Denmark and Germany."
"The delicate-sounding names of the ships, like Erika or Ievoli Sun, should not blind us to the fact that in European waters there are all too many unseaworthy rust-buckets plying about."
"As someone who lives on the German coast all I can say is: enough is enough!"
"The present proposal, which is now before us for its second reading, is a part of the so-called ERIKA-1-package named after the first, very competent proposals of the Commission in response to the accident involving the tanker Erika off the coast of Brittany."
"When we concluded the first reading, we were full of optimism, inspired by the Commission' s new-found élan, and we believed that our amendments would be - must be - approved by the Council too, because speedy implementation was supposed to follow."
"But then things do not usually happen quite as one expects them to."
"Today, unfortunately, we are not much further on. And yet the recommendations of Parliament were entirely reasonable and this was reflected in the common position."
"Unfortunately, it was not then possible to reach a positive outcome early in the context of the three-way discussion."
"I say early, I mean of course in logical sequence!"
"I very much regret this because avoiding a conciliation procedure would have speeded up the entry into force of the regulations."
"Can anyone possibly understand the Council' s blockade any more?"
"There is no doubt that we need a practicable and fair solution to the issue of the liability of classification societies, and one that is also appropriate in terms of competition."
"We need to have ceilings for financial liability and the amounts need to be insurable."
"I therefore welcome the proposals relating to this."
"We must not forget that the issue of liability is not a question of one-sided apportioning of blame."
"All players involved must bear their recoverable share of the responsibility."
"This, of course, is expressed in the form of a greater duty of care - from the shipbuilder to the ship-owner - than has hitherto been the case, and also in concrete sums of money."
"I say we ought at long last to take a step forwards in the interests of safety."
"I call upon the Council to support the Commission and us and make its own contribution actively and visibly in the interests of safety."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I support what the rapporteur said about the importance of losing no time in getting this package approved."
"At the same time, my thoughts turn to how important the forthcoming Erika 2 package will also be in warding off the single biggest environmental threat to the Bay of Finland, namely the construction in Primorsk."
"We are on the way to landing ourselves in an extremely difficult situation in which what are perhaps the worst tankers in Europe are to be used to transport large quantities of oil in the sensitive Baltic."
"In connection with the discussion of this package, I would appeal to you, Commissioner, quickly to take such measures as will ensure that we obtain the 'black box' Mr Watts is talking about, as well as a reporting system for the Bay of Finland."
"Ice classification must also be taken into account in this context."
"At the same time, we must note that, even though it is the accidents that attract attention, deliberate emissions are unfortunately the source of the greatest pollution."
"There is much to suggest that prosecutors in the European Union must begin to cooperate better within the framework of Eurojust and, in that way, dare to address this phenomenon."
"Unfortunately, we are sent many reports, but the prosecutors rarely set to work."
"Mr President, the loss of the oil tanker, Erika, triggered a long list of activities on the part of the Commission."
"That is good."
"However, it would have been better to act before an accident than after one."
"There are two interesting factors in this context."
"The first is that the Erika was registered in Malta."
"Malta-registered vessels have been involved in quite a few losses. In the current membership negotiations, there are therefore reasons for imposing far-reaching requirements when it comes to maritime safety and the environment."
"The second factor is that the Erika had been approved by an Italian classification society."
"There has been a lack of supervision of classification societies."
"This is shown, in particular, by the fact that the same classification society also approved the Ievoli Sun, which sank less than a year after the Erika."
"Tougher demands upon classification societies are therefore one of the most important components of the proposal we are to adopt a position on."
"Such a system would have placed a number of question marks over this particular classification company and certainly over a number of others, too."
"Other efforts are required, too."
"It is important that the rules governing double hulls should be as stringent here as in the United States."
"However, rules alone are not enough."
"The Ievoli Sun was only eleven years old and fitted with a double hull."
"However, the vessel was poorly maintained, had a poorly trained crew and had been detained in a Dutch port three times before the accident occurred."
"It is therefore of the greatest importance also to tighten up on Port State Control and clearly to increase the minimum standard for both vessels and classification societies."
"The proposal tabled by the Commission is crucial and an important step in the right direction."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, it must be recognised that the sinking of the Erika caused a wave of indignation at the time in European public opinion against the shortcomings of existing measures and the inability to prevent a catastrophe of this magnitude."
"This accident revealed the limitations of a political approach that tried to deal with maritime safety exclusively within the framework of international organisations like the IMO."
"Therefore the Commission and especially the Commissioner Mrs De Palacio must be congratulated on the excellent work they have done over this period."
"In one year they have tabled six proposals aiming at improving maritime safety, showing the great importance attached to this subject. I should also like to congratulate the rapporteurs, Mr Ortuondo and Mr Watts, for the excellent work they have done."
"In any case, one year on, although it seems we could be quite satisfied with the way we have responded to the expectations of our citizens, I think we should already have given these measures final approval."
"In view of the urgency with which both this Parliament and the Council have dealt with this package of measures, one might think we have been able to react quickly."
"In reality, however, the debate on this subject has lasted quite a long time, and if we go to conciliation we shall still have to wait several months before we see these measures finally adopted, which will affect the credibility of the institutions we represent."
"And even though one year may seem a relatively short time by Community standards, we must agree with the Commission that perhaps we are jeopardising the effectiveness of the Erika package by discussing matters of secondary importance."
"The very extensive international safety regulations that today govern maritime transport have brought about a drastic reduction in accidents and pollution, and the measures we are debating today show the commitment of our institutions to enhancing vessel safety and the protection of the marine environment."
"Finally, I should like to keep up this sense of urgency in our work without resting on our laurels."
"I trust in this Parliament' s determination to move the Erika II package forward with the three new measures that complement those we are debating today, and I agree that the Council too must hurry up and support Parliament."
"Mr President, quite frankly, it is difficult at this point to add anything new; apart from anything else because the situation is rather odd."
"As other Members have said, we fully support the Commission's proposals. Let us all pull together, so to speak, so that we can present a united front to the party we really have to convince, which is against this proposal as it stands."
"It is an extremely reasonable proposal, which is not intended to distort the initial position."
"Ultimately, we are calling solely for this instrument which is so very important - as the rapporteur, Mr Watts, made clear - more in terms of the culture of safety than in terms of efficiency: this black box can genuinely change behaviour, it can force people to realise that the issue of safety exists and that they must be properly equipped."
"The aim is therefore to introduce, as far as is possible, a new culture of safety, and to define a different two-pronged structure for financial compensation."
"Moreover, I feel that Parliament's proposal gives much more consideration to the principle of subsidiarity, which gives each Member State different options to choose from."
"Therefore, basically, there is no great dispute."
"What is truly incomprehensible is how the Council can fail to realise the importance and political consequence of a taking a timely decision on this matter."
"It has already been said that we cannot allow issues which are, when all is said and done, so minor, further to delay an initiative which would carry great political weight, not just because it would put an end to and remedy a situation which has caused great alarm but, in particular, because it would show that, for once, we are being more far-sighted."
"We would not want, one day, even before we succeed in launching this measure, the accidents of lots of little Erikas which, I am sorry to say, continue to take place in our waters, to cause another major disaster."
"We do not want this to happen and we call upon the Council to act wisely."
"Mr President, sea transport and its importance have been discussed on numerous occasions in this Chamber."
"Because it is more environmentally friendly, we have also talked about the need for or the suitability of modal transfer onto short sea shipping, which could be an element in the Community strategy to comply with the Kyoto commitments; about the fact that recent studies show that sea transport is responsible for only 12% of all discharges into the sea, or that it is the most energetically efficient mode of transport, and that compared with overland transport structures, which are highly saturated in developed countries, especially in Europe, the sea is an open, free infrastructure that is still far from saturated."
"The media occasionally report on the tragedies that occur, sometimes with the loss of human lives."
"Fortunately, because of both the extensive international safety regulations and the more rational attitude and greater awareness that today govern sea transport, accidents and pollution have been considerably reduced."
"I believe that the measures under consideration today reveal the commitment of our institutions to take on and to enhance vessel safety and the protection of the marine environment, and for that we must congratulate the Commission and the Vice-President, who have tabled six legislative proposals in less than a year."
"They have reacted well."
"As a member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I want to talk about vessels not just as places of work but also as places where the living conditions of professional seamen are developed, and therefore I think that, in addition to the efforts to improve safety for the lives and wellbeing of seamen, an effort also needs to be made to improve the living and working conditions for these workers while they are aboard ship."
"Mr President, first of all I want to thank the rapporteurs for the excellent work they have done all this time on these two very important proposals."
"I should like to remind you that the Erika package, as has been said, was presented just after a truly regrettable disaster, which caused environmental problems for four hundred kilometres of European coastline; we acted swiftly and appropriately in the proposals, but in the informal trialogue we have regrettably been unable to reach an agreement between the three institutions."
"What the Commission regrets most of all is that we have been so close to reaching one: only a tiny bit more was needed."
"In the end it was non-essential aspects that separated us, but I fear that these aspects will make us go to conciliation and we will take another three or four months to achieve an agreement on the proposals."
"All this when we can all - Parliament, Commission and Council - be very proud because thanks to our firmness, particularly in Parliament and the Commission, thanks to our work by common accord we have succeeded in getting the International Maritime Organisation to adopt our demands in practically every detail on the use of double hulls as a better or equivalent system to ensure greater oil tanker safety, laying down maximum time periods in which single-hull tankers can be retained and allowed to berth in our ports."
"We have to face the facts, but of course the Commission will carry on working so that in conciliation we can reach this agreement between the three institutions as soon as possible."
"Basically between Parliament and the Council, although we shall perform our mediation duties, which is our job."
"Points concerning crews have been brought up during the debate."
"I agree with you - several of you have mentioned it - that the crew problem is crucial."
"We have presented a communication on seamen, on crews, on their preparation and training."
"We understand that positive proposals must also be submitted, and we are examining how to extend the benefits of proposals such as the one currently in force in Great Britain, the tonnage tax, how to encourage other Member States of the Union to adopt these kinds of measures, because of course disasters often occur simply through human error."
"It is true that others are due to substandard vessels, as has been mentioned here, but all too often it is a matter of human error, lack of preparation, sometimes even details like the fact of speaking different languages and not understanding each other, and things of that kind."
"That is why this point has to be emphasised here, because there are safety aspects connected with it."
"Let us move on to the proposals."
"With regard to Amendment No 1 to the Port State control Directive, I must say - as I have reiterated on other occasions - that the Commission fully agrees with what the rapporteur, Mr Watts, says on the need to gradually incorporate in fleets the mandatory installation of black boxes in those fleets sailing to European Union ports."
"But we insist that this is not the place: we are raising it in the Erika II package;"
"Parliament is discussing it, and in my understanding it is not in this Directive that we should be raising it."
"We also believe that the proposal to automatically ban a vessel for not having a black box is not practical."
"Clearly a vessel cannot be banned from sailing without an initial inspection, and as a matter of principle a ban cannot be used as the solution to just any problem concerning safety on board vessels."
"In the port state control system, a suitable response to that omission is inspection and subsequent detention of the vessel."
"The proposed amendment, moreover, includes vessels over three hundred tonnes gross, which far exceeds both the international system and the Commission' s proposal, which only covers those over three thousand tonnes gross."
"In addition, it is highly likely that at an international level vessels will be fitted with a simplified voyage data recorder, which will be much cheaper to install and will nonetheless provide the essential data, which are also so important for facilitating inspections by port authorities."
"The Commission also feels that the proposed amendment should not be included in Article 7, since it refers to penalties for prolonged lack of compliance by vessels that do not meet minimum standards or that fly flags of convenience, and here we are talking about penalties against a vessel for a specific omission."
"Most of all, however, our view is that these issues refer more to the future amendment that would have to be introduced in the other proposal that forms part of the Erika II package."
"I agree, then, Mr Watts - I have told you so several times - with the need: you are quite right to include black boxes."
"The problem is where."
"The voyage data recorder would also have to be considered."
"We have to analyse the possibility of combining them or just think about one system or the other depending on the type of vessel and the type of cargo it transports."
"As for Amendment No 2 concerning the review clause, the Commission can accept it, but the review process should take into account a period of three years from the date of implementation of the Directive and not from the entry into force of the Directive, since it is necessary to assess the implementation of the Directive after a significant period of time."
"With this partial modification we have no problem in accepting it."
"In relation to the second item in the package, the Directive on classification societies, I should like to point out that I fully agree with the rapporteur, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, and all the other Members of Parliament who think that it is all too easy for the Member States to simply place the whole burden of liability on the classification societies and thus exclude their own liability as regards genuine control by the port authorities."
"In relation to the subject of liability, which is the most controversial amendment, I should like to point out that unlimited liability is already a principle in the case of major offences."
"I regret that in the end, because of the problem of minor offences, we have not been able to reach an agreement on this initiative."
"Compared with the major improvements in maritime safety that are achieved here in the general text, the truth is that in the end we have got tangled up - I repeat, I feel quite sad at this - in an aspect that is of minor importance in comparison with the whole."
"In the end, however, focusing on the proposed amendments to the Directive on classification societies, the Commission can accept Nos 2, 5, 6 and part of 7 - provided that the reference to its duplicating IMO Resolution 847/20 is suppressed."
"We cannot, however, accept Amendment No 1."
"In this respect we agree with Parliament that there should be no family or business links between the shipowner and the classification society, and this is already included in the text."
"The problem is that the proposal you make goes one step further and therefore implementation becomes practically impossible."
"I hope you can reconsider this amendment, because I really think it would be better for everyone."
"Amendments Nos 3 and 4 deal with the critical subject of liability."
"Parliament wishes to set maximum levels of liability, and I agree that the principle of liability should be kept."
"In fact the Commission sought the upper level for harmonisation in the proposal for a ceiling."
"I must remind you, however, that on all the other subjects we have reached an agreement."
"Having said that, we must try to move the proposal forward as soon as possible."
"We will have to seek agreements if we cannot get to a second reading."
"The Commission will always be there to propose formulas and help mediate, but in any case I must again reiterate the excellent job done by the two rapporteurs, both Mr Watts and Mr Ortuondo, and this House as a whole, because I believe it has been extremely useful not only for the Commission' s positions but also in general for improving the quality of the proposals."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Uniform driver attestation"
"The next item is the report (A5-0151/2001) by Mr van Dam, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 881/92 on access to the market in the carriage of goods by road within the Community to and from the territory of a Member State or passing across the territory of one or more Member States as regards a uniform driver attestation (COM(2000) 751 - C5-0638/2000 - 2000/0297(COD))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the problem of cheap labour from elsewhere versus more costly labour carried out by EU subjects has, in connection with the pending enlargement, been in the news rather a lot in the last few weeks, and with good reason."
"Labour costs of non-EU-subjects are significantly lower than those of EU workers."
"According to some members of the Council, this could lead to inevitable tension within the labour market."
"That concern is not totally unfounded."
"At least, if we consider the transport sector."
"In that sector, certain international carriers make use of drivers from third countries for cross-border transport within Europe."
"These drivers mainly hail from Eastern Europe and beyond and put much less heavy pressure on the labour costs of a company than do their European colleagues."
"There are a number of reasons why non-EU drivers can be active within the Community transport market."
"First of all, there are international agreements, such as the CEMT, as well as bilateral agreements which grant Eastern European businesses access to the Community market."
"Thanks to these agreements, businesses from outside the EU are allowed to carry out international transport within the European Union, in a restricted manner or not, as the case may be."
"Secondly, non-EU drivers can drive Community vehicles, provided that they have the necessary licences."
"This last aspect, in particular, is the subject of debate in this report."
"In practice, it appears complex to verify across the EU whether the documents which a non-EU driver produces at an inspection point are the correct ones, in other words, whether this person has been employed legally and whether all social conditions have been fulfilled in the process."
"This difficulty has led to all kinds of practices in which non-EU drivers work for Community businesses illegally and under social conditions which are considerably worse than those enjoyed by their EU colleagues."
"This results in distortion of competition between EU businesses and, understandably, protests among EU drivers."
"That is why the Commission has proposed introducing a uniform driver attestation for all drivers who drive lorries from Community businesses."
"This attestation - equivalent to the Community licence for international transport within the EU - is then proof that, for the relevant driver, legislation and social conditions which apply to the business in the country where it is established, have been met."
"The attestation does not detail the content of those conditions, but merely their application in terms of working conditions."
"According to the Commission proposal, this attestation should be introduced for all drivers who work for Community businesses."
"This means that certain routine actions, specifically the use of more than one driver from different Member States for a lorry during one journey, would be rendered more difficult."
"In addition, the wholesale introduction of this attestation into the EU will entail a considerable administrative burden, because an extensive number of attestations are to be issued in a very short space of time."
"Bearing in mind that the key goal of this measure is to thwart the use of so-called 'illegal' non-EU drivers for lorries of EU businesses, the scope of this proposal appears to be somewhat on the generous side."
"That is why most members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism are of the opinion that the scheme should in the first instance be restricted to drivers from third countries."
"In that way, the root of the problem is addressed, and the administrative burden, which could delay the implementation of the proposal, is reduced."
"In addition, according to that same majority of the Transport Committee, this scheme should - without evaluation - apply to all drivers who drive lorries of EU businesses, two years after the introduction of the attestation for third-country drivers."
"A major argument in favour of this decision is the assumed irregularity in their working conditions, too."
"If the attestation were also to apply to EU drivers, this would create an entirely transparent situation in which national proof of employment could be replaced by the attestation."
"It would then be important to resist the increasing pressure on the content of working conditions and not to allow competitive pressure in the sector eventually to end up as a burden upon drivers."
"Mr President, if we accept this proposal, that does not mean that all problems involving non-EU drivers will be a thing of the past."
"The existing CEMT and bilateral agreements offer - also for EU businesses - ample scope for using drivers from third countries on international transport within the EU."
"That is why I would like to end my speech by calling on the Member States to keep sight of this proposal' s cardinal concept in the negotiations surrounding this licensing scheme."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would first of all like to thank the rapporteur for his report, but also the Commission for the proposal, which it presented at relatively short notice."
"We should not forget that three-quarters of all freight transport in Europe continues to take place by road and working conditions remain a major problem, because they not only have direct economic effects, they also have an impact in terms of security policy."
"The market is distorted by so-called social dumping."
"In an environment where competition is unregulated - such as we unfortunately have on our roads - only large transportation companies still have a chance of survival in the medium term."
"In any case it is becoming more and more difficult for small transportation companies as the competitive struggle is tough and sometimes it is at the cost of safety, and at the cost of driving and rest times, but also at the cost of proper employment relationships."
"It is this that we have dealt with and resolved partially in this proposal."
"The introduction of driver attestation is an initial response, and although it goes some way to solving the problem, it is still only a partial solution."
"Let us not forget that many hauliers from adjacent third countries exploit the situation and certain authorisations - be it CEMT licences or bilateral authorisations - to operate with poor social conditions and low wages."
"We are therefore called upon to go further than this report and deal with this issue if we are serious about transport, working conditions and especially if we are serious about road traffic safety."
"The rapporteur has suggested limiting the scope of this regulation to drivers from third countries."
"The opinion of the Commission - and I think this is very good - was that this should be extended to all drivers."
"Perhaps the amendments before us are a healthy compromise, because we can include third countries in a first phase and extend it to all drivers in a second phase, as we consider this to be a general and useful measure for all drivers."
"This also makes it possible to divide the administrative burden between two levels."
"As someone who lives in a border municipality, I know personally that there is quite a lot of checking to be done in this sphere at the internal European level too."
"And soon, when we have the new tachograph and the card, we can also introduce an integrated system of control that could take into account both social and safety aspects."
"We therefore propose that we should work in these two phases and hope that the countries will recognise, as with all regulations, that any regulation is only efficient if the control mechanisms too are efficient."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr van Dam."
"I think he has submitted a very good report."
"Looking again at the explanatory statement, one realises that it contains a whole lot of arguments and material about what is happening on Europe's roads."
"What is happening on Europe's roads can either be described as criminal or disgraceful, or both at the same time, and it is often simply unacceptable."
"The fact that we are not solving all the problems with this dossier has been described in detail by Mr van Dam in his report."
"However, I think that we are really getting to grips with at least one important matter, that of clamping down on social dumping by a few black sheep in the haulage sector."
"One must always stress that the great majority, as I believe, do things by the book."
"Here we are talking about a very few people, but their behaviour has devastating consequences."
"Driving and rest periods are one thing, and these must be adhered to, there is no question about that; the social conditions of the drivers are the other aspect of this."
"All drivers have a right to be employed in accordance with the conditions that usually apply in the Member States."
"The attempt to use two drivers from central or eastern Europe to comply with the driving and rest periods, while at the same time gaining competitive advantages by means of wage dumping, must be stopped, because if two drivers together earn less than a driver who is employed on the usual terms, then that is simply out of order."
"It is a disgrace and must be denounced as such."
"It is good, therefore, that we are starting with third countries first, as we have suggested."
"We should not wait too long to extend this to the Union, and to the Member States, so that this regulation applies to everyone."
"I hope that it will not take as long as the ERIKA package, but that we can arrive at a regulation speedily."
"Eastward expansion is imminent and we need to have decent social conditions, but also fair conditions for competition, on our roads and in the haulage industry."
"Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, thank you so much for all your efforts."
"I can remember that these related to my first parliamentary questions, for I was rather unfamiliar with the mechanism for matters of this kind."
"During the Christmas recess last year, I was reading something about the illegal deployment of Eastern European drivers, social dumping as it is referred to, and such like."
"Probably like many others, I then thought that something should simply be done about this."
"I am grateful for the fact that this issue was addressed reasonably promptly."
"It is not just the trade union associations, but it was also the employers who sounded the alarm."
"It was a joint effort."
"I would like to make it clear at this stage that we are keen supporters of the free movement of labour."
"Needless to say, there is an entire debate, specifically in Germany and Austria, with regard to border traffic, and there are all kinds of problems, but if work is done in the European Union - enlarged or not, as the case may be - it should be carried out under the working conditions and working hour regulations which apply here."
"It is as simple as that."
"That means that some countries should also consider whether, slowly but surely, they should start introducing minimum wages and minimum standards, for otherwise these areas would be difficult to verify."
"I regret the fact that we are not focusing our attention initially on third countries."
"The underlying reasoning for this is explained later on."
"I would mainly underline the importance of evaluation, for it is not just this construction, but also the move to Luxembourg, along with a whole series of other measures, which have led to this."
"We should make sure that we are not always lagging behind."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to thank the rapporteur for the work he has done."
"In my opinion this is one of the occasions when the institutions fortunately show their support for a new measure intended to do away with practices that might endanger the working conditions of professional drivers and safety on our roads."
"Parliament, the Commission and the Council all affirm the real need for issuing a uniform document, the driver attestation, which will help the competent authorities in the Member States to ascertain whether a driver is regularly engaged in the haulier' s State of establishment."
"Such a measure may help, of course, to ensure respect for working conditions in the EU and hence guarantee the level of road safety demanded by European citizens, and not just guarantee road safety but also put an end to unfair competition and therefore ensure that the internal market really operates properly."
"The basic difference in position among our three institutions lies in the scope of this new measure."
"The Commission proposed that all drivers performing international transport operations, regardless of their nationality, should be required to obtain the attestation, so as to preserve equality of treatment for all drivers and specifically to avoid social dumping."
"For its part the Council is concerned about the administrative burden that issuing this document would place on the authorities in the Member States and prefers to apply the Regulation first to third country nationals and leave a broadening of the scope of the Regulation for future consideration."
"I think this House has made a very constructive suggestion in this respect, and I should like to thank the rapporteur Mr van Dam and the rest of the Committee for this."
"Thanks to this proposal, I believe we can perhaps meet the need for quick results as regards third-country drivers and at the same time attend to the difficulties that the Member States of the Union have, and the Member States can thus commit themselves straight away to taking on the considerable additional administrative burden that applying the Regulation to European Union drivers as well would mean."
"The Commission believes that rapid progress in this matter would substantially increase the value of the measure itself."
"The Commission has therefore already communicated its agreement in principle with the Council' s point of view, even though it departs somewhat from the Commission' s initial proposal."
"In fact Parliament' s position in favour of applying the Regulation to drivers from European Union Member States as well after a transitional period is interesting."
"Above all I am convinced that it is important for the Council and Parliament to adopt this much-needed legislation as soon as possible."
"Thus - I must make this quite clear - I think Parliament' s idea of introducing a transitional stage may provide the basis for an agreement in the Council, and so I should like to accept its basic thrust in order to reach a solution; I can therefore accept Amendment No 6, which I believe may help combine the two problems."
"With regard to the other suggestions made by Parliament, I want to declare my complete agreement with Parliament' s valuable proposal, formulated in its Amendment No 7, concerning the inclusion of certain additional driver details on the attestation, since in my opinion this will make the attestation itself clearer and more precise and will prevent or at least reduce the possibility of abuse."
"I cannot, however, accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3 and 4 since they have no effect on the achievement of the objective of this Regulation."
"Neither can I accept Amendment No 5, because I feel it could lead to confusion instead of improving the text of the Regulation."
"I should like to thank you all for your productive cooperation in this matter."
"I hope you can accept the position I am now proposing, by which I accept Amendment Nos 6 and 7, and that on this basis we can at the forthcoming Council of Transport Ministers achieve a common position at first reading, if Parliament really does accept the Commission' s position."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.25 p.m.)"
"Madam President, you will be aware that the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development is currently meeting in our Brussels building."
"You may not be aware that there are two representatives of the Burmese military junta taking part in that conference."
"As you know, the European Union has a common position, supported by this House, not to grant visas to members of the Burmese military junta."
"Yet here they are in our own building."
"I understand that the Council has waived the ban for this conference, as it felt that this was necessary in view of its obligations to the United Nations."
"If so, may I call on you, Madam President, to ask the Council or Mr Solana to issue a statement making it absolutely clear that this was an exception and that the visa ban and the common position are still in place."
"Thank you, Mr Corbett. I will indeed discuss this matter with Mr Solana."
"I also assume, of course, that Mrs Lindh has listened to you very carefully and that she has taken note of what you said."
"I do not know whether she wishes to reply."
"Not at this moment, it would seem."
"But we heard what you said Mr Corbett, and I, for my part, will take the appropriate steps."
"Madam President, on a point of order."
"I wish to draw attention to some other rather unwelcome visitors on our premises."
"Yesterday there was a disgraceful Communist demonstration in the courtyard of the Tower."
"This is very intimidatory, as far as Members are concerned; it is an intrusion on our parliamentary premises."
"Could you look into the circumstances of this: where are the limits of this Parliament and what rights do we have to exclude such people from our premises?"
"I will give the floor to Mrs Banotti at once because I think she wishes to reply to your question, for which I thank her."
"Madam President, you will be aware that I raised the issue at the Bureau last week about a grossly intimidatory and intrusive demonstration in front of the Parliament in Brussels, so I was equally surprised yesterday to see exactly the same thing happening again."
"Apparently, the courtyard of the Parliament is a public space. It is under the control of the gendarmerie here in Strasbourg and apparently there has been some breakdown in communications."
"They had not informed Parliament that this demonstration was going to take place yesterday."
"I agree with Mr Van Orden."
"Everybody is entitled to their democratic point of view, but certainly it was intimidatory to both Members and guests, hundreds of whom were trying to get into to Parliament at the same time."
"So I very much hope that the administration in Strasbourg will ensure that we do not have to go through that again."
"I make no comment on the issue that was being raised, but this is the second time that access to Parliament has been impeded by the same demonstrators."
"Madam President, on Monday evening, after your statement about the Berlusconi business in Spain, I asked whether you could possibly let us have all the documents you had received from the Spanish political and judicial authorities."
"You replied that yes, of course, you would see to it immediately."
"It is now Wednesday morning and I have still not received these documents."
"That is quite unacceptable, Mr Caudron."
"I shall check what has happened at once."
"I asked the departments concerned twice and they assured me that these documents had been transmitted to all the Members of this Parliament."
"Believe me, I will look into this matter."
"Madam President, I had the same observation as Mr Corbett."
"We also received notification that a high-ranking Burmese delegation is in Brussels."
"It is the official policy of the European Union not to admit any government representatives from Burma because of the shameful regime in that country."
"No less a person than Aung San Suu Kyi, who received the Sakharov Prize here, is still in detention."
"I consider it an absolute disgrace that these people are able to come here and speak in our very own parliament."
"I should like to join wholeheartedly with Mr Corbett in asking for immediate action to be taken."
"Madam President, some more points on the Berlusconi affair."
"First a positive point. I must tell you, and Mr Caudron, that the documentation you promised us was definitely sent by the secretarial services."
"We received it yesterday - admittedly after 9 p.m. by e-mail in all languages. This leads me to believe that a number of honourable Members have not yet checked their e-mail today."
"But now a second matter, Madam President."
"I have in front of me a telegram you sent to Mr Berlusconi, leader of Forza Italia."
"You congratulate Mr Berlusconi, admittedly on a personal basis. But I must say that I am amazed at the very warm way in which you express the wish that he will give Italy a new impetus with his election manifesto."
"I must remind you, Madam President, and stress that Mr Berlusconi's election victory does not place him above suspicion in regard to the allegations of corruption and abuse of power."
"I should like to state clearly here that the origin of his fortune is surrounded by a lack of clarity."
"Moreover, his monopolistic hold on the media constitutes a danger for Italian democracy, Madam President."
"As you know, Berlusconi controls a large part of the Italian press."
"I find this unacceptable."
"In fact, I would hope that the Commission will quickly institute an investigation into this violation of European competition law."
"Madam President, I had hoped that despite the warm words you have sent to Mr Berlusconi, you would lead the way in this campaign to make it clear that what is currently happening in Italy is really not really kosher."
"Mr Staes, thank you for informing me that you received the documents last night."
"I can only ask Mr Caudron to check his mail."
"As for the telegram I sent Mr Berlusconi, I am sure you took note of the fact that I had made it quite clear that I was congratulating him on a personal basis."
"Obviously I was not speaking on behalf of the European Parliament in this congratulatory telegram, but simply expressing myself on a personal basis."
"Madam President, there is a limit to the patience even of calm, restrained people like myself."
"We have witnessed a number of personal attacks on the leader of a political grouping, attacks based on information given in newspaper articles, none of which has been proved to be true."
"We are an institution: well then, an institution demands that respect be shown for all its members, and I would argue that this has not been the case over the last two months."
"The Italian people have made a clear, indisputable choice: we are in the presence of a Head of State."
"Therefore, the Members are all free to have their own - quite legitimate - views, but in meetings of our institution would they kindly keep them to themselves!"
"Madam President, a few hours ago, a Basque journalist, Mr Landaburu, was the victim of an attack. Mr Landaburu is well known for his professional work, his commitment to democracy and his opposition to Francoism."
"Nonetheless, this is a disturbing incident, coming as it does just a few days after elections in the Basque country. Without going into the results, the 80% turnout alone is worth mentioning."
"Parliament is debating a resolution on freedom of expression this very week. My group will table an amendment on the harassment to which the free and independent media are subjected in the Basque Country."
"Madam President, I hope you will agree to send a message of solidarity to Mr Landaburu on Parliament' s behalf."
"Mr Galeote Quecedo, certainly I raised the matter of this new attack, here in the Chamber at 5 p.m. yesterday, deploring it in much the same terms as you did."
"Naturally I immediately offered this journalist all our sympathy, on behalf of the European Parliament."
"Madam President, on Monday I had the pleasure of reporting the release to the House of Mr Tsiakourmas, who was kidnapped by Turkish-Cypriot kidnappers and released following a resolution by Parliament calling for his release."
"I said that I hoped that this might be the beginning of a change in Turkey's behaviour, with the representatives of the Turkish-Cypriot community abandoning violence and provocation so that we can move towards reconciliation."
"Unfortunately, events have quickly proven me wrong because another kidnapping has taken place - it appears that a kidnapping is always needed so that when one person is released there is another to take his place. This time it was a 75-year-old man, who was cycling along the green line and who was taken for being drunk in charge of a bicycle."
"It is the first time I have heard that drink driving is not just a crime but the sort of a crime which can only be punished by violating borders."
"I ask you and I ask my fellow members to take note of this incident and to repeat the position expressed by Parliament to the Turkish authorities last time, because if this carries on, there will be no progress or peaceful settlement."
"Welcome"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have the honour and the pleasure of welcoming to the public gallery a delegation from the Knesset, headed by its Chairperson, Mrs Dayan."
"May I say that it is always with great pleasure that the European Parliament receives delegations from the Knesset, given our close and long-standing relations."
"Since the joint visit in September 2000 by the Speaker of your Assembly, Mr Avraham Burg, and Mr Abu Ala, President of the Palestinian Legislative Council, a visit which had raised so many hopes, we all know that the outlook has, alas, darkened tragically."
"The European Parliament is following the situation very carefully, as the debate we are about to hold will show."
"Let me welcome you very warmly and simply express the keen hope that your visit will contribute to a resumption of the dialogue."
"Situation in the Middle East"
"The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the situation in the Middle East."
"I give the floor to Mrs Lindh, President-in-Office of the Council."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in the Middle East is deteriorating."
"Distrust between the parties is growing."
"Violence is claiming more victims every day."
"A normal life has not been possible for the Palestinians for a long time and conditions are getting worse all the time."
"The EU distances itself from the increasing amount of violence in Gaza and on the West Bank: Israeli encroachment and tank fire in Palestinian-controlled areas, firing on various roads, the killing of certain selected people."
"Innocent civilians have lost their lives, including many children."
"The economic situation is also difficult."
"The Palestinian Authority is in deep financial crisis since the Israeli transfer payments were halted and normal economic activities ceased in the area."
"In practice, the Authority is living on financial grants from Arab donors and the EU."
"Israel is also suffering from the economic downturn as a result of the crisis, although to a lesser extent than Palestinian society."
"The daily lives of Israelis are becoming more and more difficult."
"Violence in the form of mortar fire, car bombs and suicide bombings is increasingly affecting Israel."
"Israeli civilians and children are being killed."
"Prime Minister Ariel Sharon was elected on the promise of increasing security."
"Instead confrontation has been exacerbated, military interventions have increased and a readiness has been demonstrated both to enter Palestinian-controlled areas and to attack Syrian targets in Lebanon."
"Quite simply, the security situation has got worse."
"There is no long-term military solution."
"The conflict will neither be won or lost."
"The only solution to the conflict lies in negotiation."
"Therefore the peace process must continue."
"The Presidency and the EU are in close contact with the parties and we are encouraging them to continue the peace negotiations on the basis of the result of previous negotiations, seeking to reach a permanent status agreement on the basis of international law, including UN Resolutions 242 and 338."
"A crucial difficulty is the basic lack of trust between the parties."
"Both parties harbour the misconception that it is the other side which is solely responsible for the violence and the halting of the peace process."
"No one dares to show an example of reconciliation or flexibility as it is feared that this will be seen as weakness."
"A diplomatic initiative is required to break the deadlock."
"The European Council in Stockholm commissioned High Representative Javier Solana together with the Commission to also report to the Gothenburg Summit in June on how the EU can promote the peace effort."
"Javier Solana reported the progress of this work at the Gymnich meeting in Nyköping on 5 May."
"The EU welcomes and supports the Mitchell Commission' s report and proposals, as it does the Egyptian-Jordanian peace initiative, which is based on agreements in which Israel took part."
"Both proposals encourage the parties to immediately enter into cease-fire agreements, to confirm their willingness to respect agreements entered into and seek to reopen negotiations."
"Measures to build trust are required if negotiations are to succeed."
"One of the most critical issues for the peace process is the Israeli settlement policy."
"Both the Egyptian-Jordanian initiative and the Mitchell Report demand a freeze on all settlements."
"The Mitchell Report also suggests that the Israelis should consider withdrawing from controversial and vulnerable settlements."
"The EU considers that these requirements are justified."
"We consider that the settlement policy is in breach of international law and constitutes a serious obstacle to peace."
"The EU has encouraged Israel to start to withdraw from its settlements."
"We also support the Mitchell Report' s proposal that Israel should cease using live ammunition against demonstrators."
"Measures to build trust also include Israel repaying the taxes due to the Palestinian Authority."
"A negotiated solution, or a step on the way towards one, must include the goal of establishing a democratic, sustainable and peaceful Palestinian state."
"The EU has defined its positions on the issue in the Berlin Declaration of March 1999 and in the New York Declaration of 12 September 2000."
"It will remain the task of the EU in cooperation with other interested countries and players to help the Palestinians in developing such a democratic and peaceful Palestinian state."
"Lasting peace in the region is impossible without peace agreements also between Israel and Syria and between Israel and Lebanon."
"Considerable progress has been achieved in negotiations between Israel and Syria."
"These now have to be concluded and a solution found based on the principles of international law as stated earlier."
"Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon in May last year was an important precondition for a future peace agreement."
"Until such a peace agreement is concluded, it is important for all parties to avoid incidents and other action which may lead to continued violence."
"The EU will actively contribute to the continued peace process in cooperation with other states affected and through High Representative Javier Solana, special envoy Miguel Moratinos and the Commission."
"The Middle East is the original home of human civilisation."
"It is an area of rare cultural riches and religious importance which is now increasingly associated with the long conflict into which the region is sinking deeper and deeper."
"One condition for positive development in the region is the cessation of the current conflict."
"The Swedish Presidency wishes to do all it can to contribute to this together with other EU partners to the best of our ability."
"Madam President, I obviously very much regret that the situation in the Middle East which has been well described by the Minister has not improved since my last intervention in the House on this subject."
"The violence continues, killings on both sides, including of children, also continue unabated, property is being destroyed, particularly arable land and shelters in refugee camps, and settlements in West Bank and Gaza are still expanding."
"The European Union is regularly urged to play a stronger part in the Middle East."
"The core principles of our position are that peace must be built on international law, on the relevant UN Resolutions including UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and on the formula 'Land for Peace'."
"We, that is all the European Union institutions, should clearly restate these principles in all our contacts with the parties to this bitter dispute."
"The European Union continues to support any efforts to find a peaceful solution to the conflict."
"We support, as the Minister said, the Egyptian-Jordanian initiative as well as the recommendations of the commendable Mitchell Commission of Inquiry, including the settlement freeze and the swift and decisive cessation of violence and terrorism."
"There has been too much bloodshed and fighting."
"Violence must stop."
"On the Israeli side there is no justification for the disproportionate use of force against civilians and the destruction of property."
"On the Palestinian side, the Palestinian Authority must do everything in its power to stop attacks on Israeli civilians."
"This includes preventing incitements for such attacks, and the Palestinian Authority must naturally control its security services effectively."
"We cannot condemn violence on one side but not the other."
"The Mitchell Commission seemed to me to point a sensible way, the only way, to ending the blame game, stopping the killing and the maiming and getting back to talking."
"Talks have to resume, and the parties must honour their international obligations."
"In the case of Israel, these obligations range from complying with international humanitarian law, that covers respect for human rights, as stated by the European Union at the Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva, and also settlements."
"It goes on to bilateral obligations regarding the Palestinian Authority, for example the transfer of tax revenues, and it also includes obligations under the EC-Israel Association Agreement."
"In the case of the Palestinian Authority, we need to see the implementation of long-overdue reforms both in financial and political terms including democratic transparency, fighting against corruption and strengthening the rule of law."
"I would like to refer to two concrete and practical points today about which I am regularly asked by Parliament: the effect of the economic blockade on the Palestinian Authority and the policy of settlements."
"There has been some improvement recently concerning the movement of goods and people within and out of Gaza."
"For example, a number of businessmen have received permits, but economic activities in the Palestinian territories remain severely restricted."
"The Palestinian Authority is still facing financial and institutional collapse."
"The international donor meeting in Stockholm on 11 April was a good step forward in bringing a solution to the Palestinian Authority's budgetary crisis."
"We particularly appreciate the commitments made by Arab countries."
"Following the Stockholm meeting, the Commission is discussing with the Palestinian Authority the basis for our future assistance."
"This includes measures intended to enhance financial management and complete the process of institutional reform."
"Some of these measures, in particular those referring to institutional reform, constitute a clear confirmation of commitments announced in the past by the Palestinian Authority."
"We have noted the steps taken by the Palestinian authority to adopt an austerity budget."
"The Palestinian Authority is also working on other welcome reforms related to financial management, such as the consolidation of revenues."
"The International Monetary Fund is monitoring this process, and our intention on the basis of this austerity budget is to make monthly payments of EUR 10 million during the next six months once we can get the agreement we all want, but I repeat what I said earlier and what the Minister said, what is important is to end the blockade and resume the payment of revenues."
"Let me turn now to Israel's settlement policy."
"The European Union's position on settlements is clear."
"All settlement activities in Gaza, the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and on the Golan Heights are illegal, under international law, and constitute a major obstacle to peace."
"This includes the natural growth of settlements, a violation of international law that cannot be allowed to continue unabated."
"I am often asked, particularly in view of the failure of our efforts to resolve the issue, what this means for the working of our Association Agreement with Israel and in particular for the question of rules of origin which is covered by the Agreement."
"It follows from what I have said that the West Bank, Gaza and the Golan Heights fall outside the territorial scope of the Agreement."
"This is not a new point I am making, it is not some political gesture."
"Let me make that point crystal clear."
"This point has already been made in the Commission's communication in 1998 on the same issue."
"The communication made it clear that preferential access to Community markets for exports originating in Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and in East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, and I quote, ""contravenes agreed rules of origin since these territories do not form part of the State of Israel under public international law""."
"Therefore the communication indicated that, and I quote again, ""preferential access to Community markets for exports originating in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as originating in Israel under the EC-Israel Interim Trade Agreement is a violation of the latter, given that it does not apply to these territories."""
"The European Union must uphold the rule of law."
"That was a point recently made very seriously in a similar case by the Court of First Instance which has stated that the existence of political tensions, and I quote, ""does not exonerate the Commission as guardian of the Treaty and of the agreements concluded under it from ensuring the correct implementation by a third country of the obligation it has contracted to fulfil under an agreement concluded with the Community""."
"The position is absolutely clear."
"If, I stress the word if, Israel wants to declare goods coming from the settlements as being of Israeli origin, EU customs authorities would not be able to share this interpretation."
"Customs is a Community competence and the implementation of this common policy is delegated to Member States, but the role of the Commission is to ensure coherence and to avoid divergent interpretations by different Member States."
"A number of Member States have queried Israeli origin certificates over recent months, and replies are now being received by Member States' customs authorities."
"Our responsibility in the Commission today is to avoid uncoordinated action."
"This is why I have suggested that customs authorities discuss the replies received urgently and any action they may be contemplating at the next meeting of the Customs Code Committee on 31 May."
"So what are the technical steps that will be taken now?"
"This issue will be signalled at the EU-Israel Association Committee on 21 May."
"The item is on the agenda agreed with Israel and, as I have just mentioned, there will be a full discussion by Member States' customs experts at the end of May on how to interpret Israeli replies and the common line on how to respond."
"In the light of the conclusions reached at this occasion, this would be discussed in the Customs Cooperation Committee between the European Union and Israel which would normally take place in July."
"I wish to stress that our decision will be entirely based on the law and its technical application case by case."
"We can do no more but we should do no less."
"As the Court judgment to which I referred argued, the Commission is the guardian of the Treaty and of the agreements concluded under it."
"We cannot, nor should we seek to, resile from the duty."
"I return to where I began: like others we wish to see an end to the violence."
"We want to see a return to negotiation and we stand ready to help with the delicate and demanding work of building an enduring peace."
"There is no other way."
"Thank you, Mr Patten."
"This is all the more distressing if we think back to the discussions we held a few short months ago. Then, as you have just reminded us, we were considering the content of various draft proposals which seemed to be bringing the prospect of permanent peace in the region closer."
"Nowadays the agenda seems to be set by the most extremist elements on both sides. A permanent vicious circle of violence has been created."
"I certainly do not wish to name names or apportion blame, but the fact is that rightly or wrongly, the feeling of insecurity in Israel is stronger than ever. At the same time the belief is gaining ground that the Palestinian National Authority does not wish to act in a serious and determined manner to bring an end to the conflict, or is simply not in a position to do so."
"In the meantime, the rapid deterioration in living conditions in the Palestinian Territories is a cause for great concern. It creates fertile ground for the growth of the most radical sectors."
"Faced with this turn of events, the Palestinian National Authority appears to be losing its grip on the situation. At the same time, the population' s support for the Intifada and indeed for terrorist action against Israel is growing."
"This should be categorically condemned and decisive action taken against it. President Arafat neglected to do so as recently as yesterday evening in his televised address."
"In general, the Arab countries are becoming ever more demoralised and positions are hardening."
"Consequently, appeals have been made from the area to the international community and in particular to the European Union, requesting greater involvement in the peace process. However, we need to establish whether the parties to the conflict are genuinely interested in returning to the negotiating table or whether anyone still believes in a military solution to the problem."
"We have been pleased to welcome a delegation from the Israeli Parliament to the House today. I should like to assure them that the institutions of the European Union are more committed than ever to offering even-handed support, if both parties wish it, in order to rebuild the necessary confidence to allow peace negotiations to resume."
"I am sure members of that delegation have felt this for themselves."
"Unquestionably, the European Union has already made a significant effort to offer economic support, in line with its global political vision for the region."
"Our political involvement is increasing as we hone the Union' s foreign policy instruments. However, we still have a long way to go."
"Nonetheless, neither the Community nor anyone else can replace the will of the parties concerned to negotiate."
"We firmly believe that if the aim is to achieve genuine security and well being in the area, peaceful and negotiated settlements must be reconsidered."
"Confrontation has to cease, and all parties must work together again, striving for peaceful coexistence and cooperation."
"It is my heartfelt desire that this should come about at the earliest opportunity."
"Madam President, with a death toll of nearly 500 since the resumption of hostilities in the occupied territories, the material situation of the Palestinian people is worse than it was before the Oslo Accords."
"Unemployment has reached 50%, the investments in peace are lost, the population is sealed off, i.e., living under surveillance in its towns and villages, and the hopes of an entire generation have vanished into thin air."
"In face of this disastrous situation, the European Union must raise its voice and call for respect for the law; in other words, we must focus on essentials again, and I thank Mr Patten for having done that so clearly."
"That means ending the illegal occupation, handing back the territories acquired by force, calling a halt to the settlement of the West Bank, Gaza, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights and respecting the Palestinian people's right to self-determination."
"If the escalation of violence is to stop, if the problem is to be resolved once and for all and the just and lasting settlement everybody is longing for is to be achieved, surely the first step must be to respect the United Nations resolutions?"
"That is precisely what the Pope said in his speech in Damas and I hope that this time the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats will not disavow it."
"(Applause)In any case, we welcome the fact that recital D and point 13 of the joint motion for a resolution recall that fundamental point."
"Israel, like any other country, has the right to live in peace within secure and recognised frontiers."
"But Israel, like any other country, must recognise its international frontiers."
"That, however, is not the case."
"During a recent interview, Mr Sharon spelled out his strategic thinking by stating that the war of independence was not over, and I quote ""so long as we are not in possession of the entire territory of Israel""."
"The entire territory of Israel?"
"What territory?"
"Faced with fait accompli after fait accompli, the international community stands by and does nothing."
"Last Saturday, Israeli shells once again fell on a Palestinian refugee camp."
"On Sunday, the army killed five Palestinian policemen whom it regarded as suspects."
"And so the list goes on."
"Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, it is now time to say, loudly and firmly, 'basta ya!' Enough is enough, Mr Sharon."
"(Applause from the left)"
"Madam President, we must not allow anyone criticising Israel to be immediately placed in the pro-Palestinian camp or vice versa."
"If Europe wants to make a credible contribution to this debate, we must not choose one side or the other, but always the side of peace, democracy and human rights."
"That means that whenever these values are in jeopardy we must raise our voice, irrespective of who is responsible at that moment."
"Europe is often vociferous about the possible influence that it might have in the Middle East."
"From our perspective these are empty words, if we look at the lack of new initiatives from Europe and particularly the lack of coherence between the Member States."
"That is why we call expressly on the Commission, the presidency and on Mr Solana, whose absence today I find a little odd, to do their utmost to bring the Union into line."
"With regard to the possible violation by Israel of the rules of origin in the Association Agreement, I should like to express my appreciation for the unambiguous words of Commissioner Patten, and ask him, and at the same time the Council, to give an immediate answer to four clear questions: for how many products have Member States asked for verification from the Israeli authorities, what answers have they received, what steps are they considering and within what timescale?"
"Let me make the position of my group on this matter quite clear."
"If it turns out to be true that there are doubts about the certificates issued by Israel and the Member States and the Commission do not act immediately and firmly, Europe will be complicit in the policy of settlement that we all abhor."
"In conclusion I am gratified that our text on the need throughout the whole region for education geared to tolerance and mutual respect, has found support in other groups."
"Madam President, the European approach to the problems of the Middle East should be, and fortunately often is, a balanced one based on the analytical conclusion that there is no one guilty party responsible for the present escalation."
"Having said that, it is crystal clear to my group that overwhelming responsibility for the present escalation lies with the Sharon government in Israel."
"Two examples: my group considers the heightened strategy of the execution of Palestinians by Israeli security services a disgrace, unworthy of a democratic state and moreover a strategy with no hope of success, since it will only increase the fury and frustration among the Palestinians."
"The rejection of the Mitchell Report is a lost opportunity for the Israeli government."
"Bringing an end to further expansion of the settlements, not even to the settlements themselves, should have been a first gesture towards the Palestinians as a sign that the Israelis also want a compromise, but sadly the Israeli government was unwilling to make that gesture."
"All this is a good reason for stepping up the pressure from the European Union on the Israeli government."
"Consequently I should like very specifically to ask the Commission and the Council, with all appreciation for the words spoken on the products from the settlements: what exactly is the Commission going to say to the Israeli delegation on 21 May about trade with Israel itself?"
"Will it be business as usual for products from Israel itself?"
"Not in the view of my group."
"The issue of products from the settlements must be addressed, but we also feel that normal trade should be scrutinised carefully and that the Commission should take initiatives in that direction on 21 May."
"Having said that, I do not wish to suggest that Palestinians are acting correctly."
"The Palestinians are waging a war that they cannot win."
"I also believe that the Commission must take responsibility and spell out to the Palestinian Authority that it - however difficult that may be - must try to prevent attacks on civilians and must opt for a different course, because the Palestinian Authority has its own responsibility."
"Madam President, I would like to thank Commissioner Patten and the President-in-Office of the Council, Mrs Lindh, for their speeches."
"Suffering and tragedy will continue to mark the days and nights in Palestine if Israel and the wider international community do not take action to restore international and human rights."
"Yesterday was another day of tragedy: more than 200 people, including a French journalist, were wounded at the check points, although the Palestinians had not opened fire; the evening claimed another victim, an Israeli settlement; over 500 Palestinians were killed, 23 000 wounded and hundreds maimed for life; bombings, the houses of the poor demolished by bombs, thousands of trees - the livelihood of the peasant farmers - uprooted, roads blocked, despairing men and women, prisoners in their own villages, going hungry and Palestinian leaders considered to be military targets executed."
"Pacifists from the Israeli movement, Peace Now, and I myself wept at the murder of Dr Tabet Tabet, an old friend; schools closed, land confiscated to make room for fresh settlements and further suffering: 80 Israelis, including children and adolescents, killed."
"We must stop the cycle of violence, for every death, whether Palestinian or Israeli, reduces our humanity."
"I understand the despair, the rage, the humiliation, the collective punishments, the retaliation, the need of the Palestinians forced to live under military occupation for 30 years for freedom;"
"I understand the historical fear of the Israeli people, the persecutions they have suffered, the unique experience of the Shoah, for which we Europeans are responsible;"
"I understand the fear that a bomb might explode under a bus or a shell hit a school, but these fears do not give anyone the right to occupy another people's territory or to violate international human rights."
"It is our responsibility not to allow any expression of anti-Semitism in Europe, guaranteeing to the Israelis that the safety of Israel is very important to us, just as the safety of the Palestinian people is very important to us."
"We have been saying for too long that we must stop the cycle of violence."
"What, then, is our policy?"
"To urge the Israeli government to resume talks without delay and to put an end to the closing-off of the territories and the bombings."
"International protection for the Palestinians must be guaranteed - this request has been made by over 400 Israeli citizens as well as by the Palestinians - but, above all, the expansion of settlements and roads must stop. The Mitchell Commission also says this."
"Yesterday, in an article in the newspaper, Ha'aretz, Daniel Bensimon condemned Mr Sharon's false motives in respect of the natural population expansion of the settlements."
"He cites sources of American intelligence which state that 20 000 houses have been emptied and that many settlers, even those who are most fanatical, are leaving."
"He writes that, if the government genuinely had the interests of the country at heart, it would put a freeze on new settlements."
"This would be a positive message to the Palestinians, the Arabs and the international community."
"Stopping the escalation of violence: the Palestinian Authority must make every endeavour to prevent extremism from prevailing."
"There are no military solutions."
"The European Union - as Parliament has stressed - must play a political role: international law must be applied in real life and not just proclaimed in declarations."
"In this sense, respect for the agreements signed by Israel must be ensured, including the agreement concluded with the European Union which lays down a ban on the exporting of goods produced in the settlements to Europe."
"Commissioner Patten has made this very clear, as has Mrs van der Laan."
"The resolution upon which Parliament is about to vote calls upon the Council and the Commission to consider whether collective punishments and the disproportionate use of force are not in conflict with the principles of the Association Agreement and to take the necessary action: our aim is not to punish, just to obtain respect for the rule of law."
"There is no time to lose in the struggle for peace: it is necessary for Palestinians and Israelis, for the region, but also for us."
"Madam President, I am deeply appalled by the latest, dangerous escalation of violence in the Middle East which must be ended."
"The question that really has to be answered is: who is going to broker an end to the violence in the Middle East?"
"I certainly welcome the active role the High Representative of the EU for the common foreign and security policy is playing in the Middle East."
"I believe that the European Union can play a constructive role firstly in ending the violence in the Middle East and then putting in place structures whereby peace talks can recommence between the various factions."
"I condemn without reservation violence from whatever quarter."
"It is not only a question of seeking to prevent violence by different factions in the Middle East, it is primarily a question of guaranteeing that conditions can be improved in the hope that the violence ends and that negotiations can be reopened."
"A peaceful solution in the Middle East can be achieved."
"It was only last summer that the Israeli government and the Palestinian people were negotiating on what were bottom-line issues."
"While I am disappointed that the peace talks in America last year did not culminate in a final peace settlement, they were not a complete failure either."
"Issues, including the status of Jerusalem, the borders of the Palestinian State, the fate of Jewish settlements and the right of return of Palestinian refugees, were all being discussed between the two sides last year."
"If violence can be ended in the Middle East and the conditions for the reopening of negotiations can be secured, we can once again come to a situation whereby bottom-line issues can be discussed."
"The European Union has affirmed on a number of occasions the need to ensure that the security of the Israeli and Palestinian people, both collectively and individually, is always protected."
"In the overall context, securing peace in the Middle East is going to take time."
"The first step in the current peace process was taken when Israel and Egypt concluded the peace treaty at Camp David in 1979."
"It took another twelve years before a comprehensive peace process got under way at the Madrid Conference in October 1999, which enshrined the principle of exchanging land for peace."
"The permanent status negotiations resumed in September 1999."
"I would appeal to the key parties involved to strive in good faith to end the violence in the Middle East and to put in place a negotiated settlement, based on the principles of existing agreements."
"Madam President, when I was in Washington on an EP mission last week, I was greatly shocked by the exceptionally cruel and vile murder of two Israeli schoolboys."
"How can this spiral of violence in the Middle East be averted?"
"What exact contribution can the Member States of the European Union make?"
"With the noble intention of addressing these questions the Netherlands Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr Van Aartsen, travelled to the region at the beginning of this month."
"The written account of his in-depth findings leads me to put a number of follow-up questions to the members of the Council and Commission present here."
"For example, during his meeting with the Israeli prime minister, Mr Sharon, the Dutch minister encountered clear criticism of the Middle East policy of the EU."
"Mr Sharon characterised it as 'unbalanced' ."
"This judgement, though, did not apply to the Netherlands, the premier added."
"I should like to hear the rebuttal by the Council and Commission of Mr Sharon' s statements on the matter, since they imply divergent approaches to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by Member States."
"In addition Mr Van Aartsen points to the dangerous radicalisation of the Palestinian camp."
"Do the Council and Commission share this analysis and what opportunities do they see for combating this tendency from the European side?"
"Thirdly, the Dutch minister argues for ""a more effective international effort to promote a healthy institutional and democratic development of the Palestinian administration"" ."
"For at this moment, says Mr Van Aartsen, the administrative weakness of the Palestinian Authority threatens to undermine its authority on two sides, with its own population and no less with the state of Israel."
"And in that case what political prospects will there be for peaceful relations between Israel and Palestine?"
"Are the Council and Commission, as donors of the Palestinian Authority, as aware of this lacuna and how do they propose to fill it in concrete terms?"
"At any rate they can count on the support of the Israeli vice-premier Nathan Sharansky."
"In last Monday' s Wall Street Journal he argues for a direct link between concessions to the Palestinians and making Palestinian society more open and transparent."
"Mr Sharansky hopes that such a society will give the Palestinians the rights they deserve, without threatening Israel."
"Surely that Jewish dream demands a European effort too?"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, just a few months ago, in this Chamber, in the presence of Israeli and Palestinian representatives, we discussed the possibility of Middle East peace process, at last, approaching its goal."
"However, the TV news bulletins showing the Middle East are still full of bloodshed and despair this morning."
"And yet the UN and Parliament resolutions have been reiterated for decades now to no avail, as have the calls for action from the whole world."
"In this morning's debate in this Chamber, we are repeating all the same things all over again."
"I no longer have faith in resolutions which are treated like waste paper, often lying in some dusty corner of the archives of the Parliamentary committees."
"Ladies and gentlemen, what we must do here is not dismiss the Palestinians, who are defending the right of a people to a homeland, as extremists."
"What we must actually do here is ask ourselves why, despite the resolutions, the autonomous activities of a community are still subject to Israeli approval, why a recently-built airport cannot operate, why the extermination of a community of 4 million people which, since the beginning of the Yom Kippur war, has been reduced by almost 10% by a subtle, insidious, treacherous, poisonous, cynical, cruel war which shows no mercy to women or children, is not considered to be genocide."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I wonder how a people which has known such pain can inflict it on others so relentlessly."
"I regret to say that it is since a certain right-wing party, the party of Mr Sharon, took control of Israel that, as a result of that appalling right-wing policy, the world has lost control of the overall situation."
"Let us therefore set about introducing an initiative which will go beyond the paper-pushing games that have been played by the world's parliaments for too long now and lead us to resolute, tangible, decisive action to save the innocent lives of women, children and the elderly with peace."
"It is no coincidence that Jesus Christ was born in Palestine."
"Madam President, unfortunately the names of European politicians have not been recorded in the annals of peace brokering in the Middle East over recent years."
