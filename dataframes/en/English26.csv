"On behalf of the Commission, I hope that the resolution you will be voting on tomorrow will provide clear and powerful support for these European Union objectives."
"With a vote in favour, you will be strengthening our negotiating hand and sending a political signal to our trading partners and to the general public, that the European Union will not simply be taking a 'business as usual' approach to these negotiations."
"To conclude, I should also like to take this opportunity to welcome, on behalf of the Commission, the Members of this Parliament who will be joining our delegation to Doha, and the positive and cooperative approach between us that I would say we developed in Seattle."
"This is, in any event, the result of the questionnaire that I sent to you at the time, to which most members of the delegation replied, and I count on your active support to promote what is, in my view, our common agenda."
"Mr President, Minister, Commissioner Lamy, it is my pleasure to be able to state on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats that the major Parliamentary Groups have found it very easy to reach agreement on the joint statement which we will decide on tomorrow following this discussion."
"This shows that on certain major questions a general view predominates over party lines."
"We have not seen much of Commissioner Pascal Lamy over the past few months, and for once I can say that we are glad about this."
"He had energetically and skilfully shuttled all over the world trying to create a basis for a new WTO negotiation round; on which a decision needs to be taken in Doha in mid-November."
"In the midst of all this, however, Commissioner Lamy has found time to do a good and adequate job of briefing the Parliamentary delegation that is leaving for Doha."
"We must thank him for this also; of course I was not to know that his message is so explosive that a fire drill would have to be arranged during it."
"My group fully supports the negotiation line that the Council had already decided for the Seattle conference."
"The new negotiation round to develop the liberalisation of world trade and rules of the game must treat matters on a broad basis so that we can strengthen sustainable economic growth; reinforce, develop and renew a trading system based on global rules; and ensure that its benefits are shared out equitably."
"We are also happy with the idea that the meeting will be held in Qatar."
"Now, if ever, it must be shown that we cannot be intimidated by terrorism; instead, we shall continue - on the 'business as usual' principle - with our policies of international cooperation for the sake of freer and fairer trade."
"This must also work towards a better environment, social development, the reduction of poverty, and human rights."
"There are some who would like to eliminate free trade, abolish the WTO and return to bilaterally regulated trade."
"This road, ladies and gentlemen, would be a road to protectionism, and then on to trade wars and also, subsequently, to possible armed conflicts."
"It would be a road which would make all enemies of freedom, democracy, the State under the rule of law, social development and human rights nod with satisfaction."
"I would like to thank all my colleagues who have worked so hard in order to bring about a Parliamentary meeting in connection with the Doha meeting."
"I would like to mention by name my colleagues Erika Mann and Konrad Schwaiger."
"We have heard today that there is still uncertainty about the mission from the United States Congress."
"We must indeed hope that at least as strong a delegation arrives from the United States Congress as from here; without them we will be a bit one-sided."
"I believe that during the next few years we can develop Parliamentary monitoring of world trade; this is important in order to open up to citizens the work of an organisation such as the WTO and, through this, to seeking approval of the activity falling within its sphere."
"Mr President, it appears that Doha has sounded the alarm bells here in this House."
"Over the past two years, the WTO has been under fire on many occasions, with good reason."
"Some of the critics claim that there is so much wrong with the WTO that we should not start a new trade round until the problems surrounding, for example, fair access to the world market for developing countries, the lack of democracy and decision-making within the WTO and the imbalance between trade and non-trade issues have been resolved."
"We, the Social-Democrats, however, have reached the opposite conclusion."
"These problems must be solved as an absolute priority, and it is precisely by starting a new trade round that this can be achieved most effectively."
"Only then will reform be truly possible."
"The PSE Group gives its unqualified support to a new trade round with a broad-based agenda aimed at economic and political reform."
"It is quite simple: we know that trade stimulates growth, attracts investment and creates employment, both within and outside Europe."
"The world economy is now poised between recession and recovery."
"The recession as a result of the terrorist attacks on 11 September gives the perpetrators ultimate triumph."
"Who stands to suffer most from these attacks?"
"The world' s poorest of the poor."
"The World Bank expects that the terrorist attacks will cut economic growth in the developing countries from 5 to 2.5%."
"The expected growth and effects are approximately another ten million people under the poverty line and an added 20 000 to 40 000 children under five who will die."
"That is a disaster."
"A new trade round is necessary in order to restore confidence in the world economy to some extent and to open the way to renewed sustainable growth."
"We also know, however, that trade on its own is not enough."
"Without an adequate regulating mechanism, we run too great a risk of the trade benefits being distributed very unevenly indeed and of the environment and social standards coming off worst."
"That is why in the negotiations with other groups on the resolution, we, as the PSE Group, insisted that the Fourth Ministerial Conference' s first priority should be to tackle worldwide poverty, reforms, democracy and the relationship between trade and non-trade issues."
"Why?"
"Think of the impact of the WTO rules on matters such as the environment, safe food, workers' rights or the freedom of governments to regulate public services without running the risk of being taken to court by profit-seeking multinationals."
"To the Social-Democrats, the fundamental objective of institutions such as the WTO is to bring worldwide processes such as globalisation under political control, enabling us to steer these processes in accordance with democratic, political choices."
"It is therefore our greatest challenge, together with many developing countries, together with many reform-minded and sound NGOs, in the face of opposition from the neo-Liberals, but also from a number of our fellow MEPs here in Parliament and that section of the anti-globalists who oppose a new round, to start this new round nevertheless."
"The Fourth Ministerial Conference is a key moment in the debate on globalisation, including the socio-economic security aspects of this debate."
"If the programme for the forthcoming three-yearly trade round compiled at the Ministerial Conference does not provide a solid basis for progress in the field of democracy, the fight against poverty, environmental protection, growth in developing countries and the protection of public services, then we, as Social-Democrats, fear the worst for the course of the current debate on globalisation, and eventually the very concept of globalisation itself."
"This is the message of the resolution which, we hope, will be adopted tomorrow."
"We support a new trade round."
"We are in favour of free trade which is fair and supports the citizens throughout the world."
"Finally, a word about the acid test in all of this."
"We hope that those cheap medicines which the President talked about in plain terms will also prove to be a true test, for without it we cannot imagine that this new round could be successful."
"We wish Mr Pascal Lamy every success, for he is doing fantastically well so far."
"He has a great relationship with our Parliament, for which we are very grateful to him."
"Mr President, firstly I should like to extend our congratulations to both the Council and the Commission for what seems to be a much improved preparation for this meeting, compared to the methodological confusion that seemed to reign prior to Seattle."
"We hope it will bear fruit in a couple of weeks' time."
"As a group we are also very keen that we should learn the lessons from Seattle and not use the launch of the round, or the text for the launch of the round, to somehow foreshadow or preclude the conclusion of the round."
"That is obviously a lesson well-learnt and we applaud the attempts to keep the document which will be discussed in Doha as crisp and brief as possible."
"I am not entirely sure whether the principles of brevity and crispness have been fully respected in our own resolution, but this is certainly something we hope you will follow in Doha."
"There are two issues of absolutely fundamental importance to us as a Liberal group."
"Firstly, trade and the environment: for us issues such as the interaction between trade and multilateral environmental agreements, eco-labelling, the incorporation of the precautionary principle are not add-ons or luxuries, they are absolutely fundamental to the future credibility of the WTO and, arguably, of globalisation as a political process itself."
"We feel strongly, therefore, that without those kinds of provisions in the next round of negotiations, it will simply become politically unsellable and unsustainable within Europe."
"Secondly on agriculture, our own views are that paragraphs 23 to 25, whilst just above adequate, are a little convoluted and mealy-mouthed on agriculture."
"We prefer the emphasis in paragraph 6 because it draws attention to the fundamental fact, highlighted recently by a study from the Centre for Economic Policy Research, that the greatest instrument to alleviate poverty is the further liberalisation of agriculture."
"That is a fundamental principle for us which we hope will be fully respected in the next round."
"Our group has not signed the compromise resolution with the larger groups for a number of reasons, but the most important one is this: We believe that fundamental reform of the World Trade Organisation's processes and rules must be a precondition for any new round of trade talks."
"Reform is not something that can be simply addressed as one issue among many in a new multilateral trade round where it risks being traded off against other interests and demands."
"In our view, the WTO faces such a crisis of legitimacy in public opinion that reform must come before any further negotiations, and that is the position we have put forward in our joint resolution with the GUE Group."
"Now that is not a tactic for putting off indefinitely the start of a new round."
"In our view, nothing has slowed down the WTO more than the debacle in Seattle which was caused in no small part by the chaotic and exclusive structures, rules and procedures of the WTO."
"So, for those who believe in multilateral trade rules, as we do, serious reform is not an option but a necessity."
"The lessons of the failed Seattle Ministerial were that the WTO must become a fully democratic and transparent organisation which genuinely supports sustainable development and which effectively responds to the needs of developing countries."
"They need to be far bigger players in the WTO."
"Their marginalisation needs to end and they need to be listened to."
"In recent weeks, many poorer countries have made it clear that for them addressing concerns about the implementation of Uruguay Round commitments should be a precondition for a new round."
"Just two days ago, a communication from the G77 reiterated that position."
"Our group agrees with developing countries when they oppose new issues on the agenda on the grounds that expanding that agenda would over stretch the capacity of many developing countries which are already struggling to participate effectively in the WTO process."
"It would distract attention from the unfinished development business and increase the risk that developing countries will end up accepting disadvantageous trade-offs."
"The possible opt-outs that are on offer are not a realistic or effective way of dealing with these concerns, since developing countries still do not have the capacity now to affect the negotiations of an agreement which they may be later under pressure to sign."
"Pressing ahead with a new trade round in the face of major opposition from the majority of developing countries is not helpful."
"Simply calling it a development round without genuinely addressing the demands of developing countries is a sleight of hand that fails to address their real concerns."
"Finally, our group agrees that strong international rules are needed to manage trade."
"We agree very much that internationalism is important, but the current international trade rules favour narrow business interests and not the poor and the environment."
"Changing those rules is the priority for Doha, not launching a new round."
"Mr President, after 11 September, we have every reason to redouble our commitment to multilateralism."
"Persisting with the Doha meeting and making it a success are, therefore, of considerable political importance."
"Of course, we cannot at this stage hope for the sea change that is required, but adapting, improving and consolidating the WTO system would at least be a good start."
"As supporters of the multilateral approach, we must fulfil this commitment."
"The criminals who destroyed the twin towers of the World Trade Center know the value of symbols."
"Making trade the focus of coexistence with other countries is a deeply reductive approach and directing world trade centrally is unacceptable."
"Multilateralism must be neither asymmetrical nor imperialist."
"Doha will not be Seattle, however."
"Civil movements have helped to make their leaders think, the southern countries are, with the welcome support of the Commission, playing an increasingly important role and the time when Carla Hills wanted to use a crowbar to open up other countries' markets to her own will will soon be a thing of the past."
"Doha is not a sign of a new wave of liberalisations, but nor is it an agenda for development."
"It will be something vague between the two."
"An agenda will be negotiated there whose objectives will remain general."
"There has been no prior negotiation of the outcome, fortunately, and we approve of the principle of the Union' s mandate: to set a broad agenda, but more than just balancing liberalisation by means of rules, there is no getting away from the fact that we must try to resolve the contradictions between society' s choices and trade rules."
"The social issue is symbolic."
"The main front on which we need to fight is finance, and a Union which allows tax havens to flourish within its borders must put its own house in order."
"Nobody can claim, though, that trade has nothing to do with fundamental rights."
"The WTO may not be the place to produce social conventions, but it certainly does have a responsibility to ensure coherence."
"The implementation of the Marrakech agreements and the incorporated agenda on agriculture and services will be at the centre of the forthcoming round."
"The legitimacy of the trade interests of the South must be recognised but the problem will lie in preventing negotiations boiling down to a process of tough haggling over their interests and our own."
"The concerns of northern societies as of those of the South must lead to a change in trade rules and to break their monopoly that favours one group."
"With this in mind, we must accept that we will have to open the door to the renegotiation of certain rules, in particular, those concerning intellectual property."
"Lastly, although the democratisation of the WTO will certainly not be on the agenda, it is nevertheless clear that this round will not succeed if it is nothing more than a diplomatic battle between countries, even if the European Union is happy to play the honest mediator."
"Civil society must be involved; we must consult our citizens and take account of their criticism and their demands."
"This is the only way to ensure that democracy will penetrate the WTO."
"Mr President, Commissioner, on the eve of this new meeting of the World Trade Organisation, which I prefer to call the Trading the World Organisation, you have used the correct term: legitimacy."
"The failure of Seattle, which I predicted, several weeks beforehand and in writing - forgive me if I gloat - was entirely due, in my opinion, to this twofold lack of legitimacy."
"Firstly, because the WTO itself has no legitimacy and, whatever people may think, is not up to the task that it has set itself."
"I am talking more precisely, however, about the absence of legitimacy of the European Union and I must say that this is not meant as personal criticism or criticism of the quality of the very idea of having a single negotiator, even if it does have a mandate, to replace all of our old nations, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Holland, Italy, which have, since the early middle ages, expanded on the mould of this international trade, which is now global."
"No one can picture you, whatever your qualities, which everyone recognises, promoting both the interests of all of these countries and maintaining the diplomatic channels that the history of our ancient nations could allow us to fulfil, either with Latin America for Spain, Africa for France, etc. There is, as always, a huge pretentiousness or even vanity, on the part of the European Union, in seeking to replace, in one fell swoop, a thousand years of history and in claiming to be able to fulfil this role."
"The second stumbling block, of course, is the hypocrisy of the World Trade Organisation, which is approaching these negotiations like a wolf approaches a lamb."
"Since the financial world effectively took control of the economy twenty years ago, international trade is now mainly an excuse to continually, ceaselessly and forever and beyond expand the sphere of financial speculation to the point that these negotiations are beginning to look like a big raffle held for the benefit of those organising the raffle."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, international trade is in crisis: according to the forecasts of the Istituto affari internationali, 2001 will see growth of 2% compared to the 13% in 2000."
"I feel it is right to raise the issues of WTO reforms, legitimacy and transparency of decisions so that we do not lose sight of the WTO' s primary, unique mission which is to extend international trade."
"This is why Doha must not fail: it must not fail because it has to ensure the sustained expansion of international trade over the next few years."
"The responsibility of the success or failure of Doha lies with Europe and the other more advanced countries."
"In general, I feel that we must take note of certain considerations and questions."
"Firstly, in my opinion, we must stop following the line of reciprocity at all costs."
"Removing the barriers to trade - even unilaterally - is not an act of surrender. It is a farsighted measure, particularly in economic terms."
"I commend Commissioner Lamy for taking this approach with the Everything but Arms initiative, although we will have to explain to the European citizens that, under that initiative, which was well-received and rightly so, banana duties will fall definitively in 2009, that is in 10 years time - a geologically important period in many respects - and we will also have to tell them why."
"A further problem we must avoid is overloading Doha with an oversized agenda. I would stress that Doha has a specific mission."
"We must not overload Doha and the WTO by attempting to use them to put right a number of issues which we feel need to be rectified in the world today."
"Certain positions expressed on the environment, health and employment standards do nothing to defend us against accusations that the advanced countries and Europe are actually using the extension of the agenda for protectionist ends."
"The developing countries are in a strong position and are not so very far from the truth when they say that all these so very politically correct issues actually serve to slow down the opening up of our markets to goods which have to come, first and foremost, from the least developed countries."
"With regard to agriculture, I feel that we must bring to an end this game of hide-and-seek, this game of role plays between Europe and the United States in which, while we are waiting for someone to make the first move and start to reduce agricultural protection, we are all maintaining duty levels and levels of agricultural subsidies which are incompatible with the liberalisation of trade in the agricultural sector, when, as has been pointed out, this is one of the sectors which could most be most beneficial to the developing countries."
"In Europe, we grant a subsidy of a dollar a day per bovine animal - and these animals are not high quality, they are our own mad cows - when there are one billion, three hundred thousand human beings who have to live on less than one dollar a day."
"There you have it: if we genuinely want the WTO and Doha to be successful, these are the issues we must address."
"Unilateral measures opening up international trade benefit, first and foremost, those who have the courage to implement them."
"Mr President, Commissioner Lamy deserves our gratitude for referring to the much-needed institutional reinforcement of the role of the European Parliament in European trade policy."
"I wish to ask you Madam President-in-Office of the Council, whether you can support this position when you are assembling your papers for the forthcoming Inter-Governmental Conference and, firstly, for the Convention for which we are all striving?"
"It is there that the breakthrough should at last occur, so that the European Parliament can draw even in institutional terms with the American Senate and House of Representatives."
"In the next few years, the WTO will, through the imminent accession of China and Taiwan - both of which have long been important trading partners of Europe - and the eventual accession of Russia, gain a global dimension, giving it an even greater worldwide representative role and presenting it with new challenges."
"To achieve this, it will have to adapt its structures and change the way it works."
"With Qatar, there is the additional factor that we must make a start and genuinely involve all the developing countries, not only the representatives of the least developed, in the negotiations."
"The technical aid which the EU and the other industrialised countries are called upon to provide is crucial for these countries' future real involvement in the decision-making process."
"The WTO must, however, also increase its efficiency despite these changes and become more transparent and more readily understood by the world's citizens."
"How will the WTO harmonise its new, strengthened universality with the need to become even more efficient and make markets more open?"
"Our resolution attempts to reconcile these two requirements, although surely incompletely as yet."
"We Europeans must contribute our environmental legislation, our regulations on food safety, our multifunctional agriculture and our social security legislation as expressions of a tangible European reality."
"Now, some weeks after 11 September, it is particularly important, partly as a response to terrorism, that we, the EU and, particularly, the European Parliament, continue without distraction on our way towards greater openness and democracy in the WTO and resolutely set about the necessary reforms."
"We need to promote fair and freer world trade rather than seal ourselves off by means of protectionism and fall back upon national markets."
"We must also strive to realise soon the central proposition of the European Parliament - the establishment of an effective parliamentary assembly for the WTO, to be the world's mouthpiece in trading matters."
"We therefore need representatives of the American Congress in Doha as well."
"We are relying on the parliaments of the industrialised states, of the emergent countries and of all the developing countries."
"May we ask, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, if you, at the end of your presidency of the Council, could give your support to this proposal, which we must implement as soon as possible?"
"We support Commissioner Lamy's efforts at using our cooperative structures to involve Africa in particular - Africa, that continent which is largely forgotten by world trade - more intensively in dialogue on the subject of a parliamentary assembly."
"Our seminar on 12 April was the first example of a successful conference on trade, democracy and development to involve our friends from Africa alongside the representatives of the industrialised countries in America, Europe and Asia."
"Technical support from the Commission and our parliamentary budget played an important part in this."
"Mr President, Commissioner Lamy, Minister Neyts-Uyttebroeck, ladies and gentlemen, the tragic events of 11 September have led to a re-emergence of two concepts which seemed to have been forgotten: multilateralism and solidarity."
"Firstly, political practice is developing in such a way that we can only confront global threats in a global fashion: all united."
"Furthermore, we also know that poverty and underdevelopment are significant causes of insecurity."
"A Japanese thinker, Daisako Ikeda, said that the new concept of security, which focuses on the security of States, must be defined differently, focusing on the well-being of peoples."
"Only by extending freedom, human rights and development can we recover our security."
"At the same time, these events have speeded up the decline in confidence in our security and the economy, areas which were already showing signs of weakness."
"It is therefore now important that we send clear signs of revitalisation and attention to the concerns of our citizens and, above all, to the concerns of the countries which need it most, that is, the developing countries."
"It must therefore be an absolute priority to launch this new round of multilateral negotiations in Qatar on the date set, not yet to negotiate, but at least to set the agenda in the direction we wish to take."
"We want to move towards a result which provides a balance between opening up trade and subjecting that trade to rules, internal democratic, and external democratic, rules, which respect fundamental social standards, the environment and the security of our consumers."
"We also want a balance between an increase in exchanges and special attention to the concerns of our citizens, as well as the concerns and needs of the developing countries, who must be allowed to share fully in the benefits of international trade."
"In summary, therefore, the mandate which the Council has given to the Commission, in our opinion, corresponds to these balances and deserves our full support."
"I would like to thank Commissioner Lamy for the sensitivity he has always shown towards the European Parliament and his constant cooperation."
"In return, Parliament and the parliamentary delegation which will accompany him to Qatar will offer him all their support."
"Mr President, in Doha the EU must show its hand."
"On which side does the EU really stand in the global North-South conflict?"
"Things are looking quite bad."
"In spite of the stream of protests from, for example, India and Malaysia, the least developed countries, the G77 group, China and a host of environmental and solidarity movements, the EU intends, together with the United States, to try to play its trump card by making the WTO' s free trade doctrine apply not only to traditional trade but to practically the whole of economic life."
"According to what Commissioner Lamy said in a statement earlier today, the EU' s main objective is to open the markets of the developing countries to EU companies."
"When it comes to TRIPS and GATS, too, it is obvious that the EU is on a collision course with the developing countries."
"In this global struggle, which is more crucial than the fight against terrorism, a number of 'progressive' people have believed that the EU could constitute a tool actually to combat neo-liberal globalisation."
"If the EU does not change its tactics, there is everything to indicate, however, that, when it comes to the crunch, the WTO meeting in Doha will be proof that all the fine declarations of solidarity are being abandoned."
"It is then that a 'policy of naked interest' appears, that is to say, a policy that places the EU alongside the United States and against the majority of the world' s poorer countries."
"Mr President, obviously the diverse manifestations of democratic resistance to the dangers of an uncontrolled expansion of the WTO's powers have given pause for thought."
"It seems, however, that well-intentioned appeals are not going to prevent it from going down this path."
"It is simply the case that trade in goods and money transactions are governed by the law of the market."
"The market is, by its very nature, immoral."
"Those who want to maintain their hold on the market have to make a profit or else they go under."
"The WTO has obviously set itself the goal of cutting the market off from the demands of society at large and even from parliaments."
"The opinions now on the table at least show an awareness of the problem."
"It is right to take small steps."
"However, far more ambitious steps must follow."
"We cannot wash the coat of the bear which the WTO has become without getting the animal itself wet."
"Our aim must be to work towards a new global economic order which distributes the wealth of this earth differently, justly and fairly, overcomes poverty, establishes and guarantees broad-based democratic cooperation giving parliaments a voice, and makes independent economic development possible for all countries."
"The European Parliament should do everything within its power to challenge the Council and the Commission to do this."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I would firstly like to thank you for the efforts you have made and the strategy you have employed in preparing for the Doha Summit, to promote fairer and more balanced sustainable development on a world scale, which contributes to respect for fundamental social rights and the protection of the environment, the benefits of which also reach the least-developed countries."
"Kofi Annan recently said that the Doha Summit must be the development summit."
"If this is to be the case, it is essential that the developing countries can be fully integrated into the structures of the WTO and they must be given easier access to world trade."
"That is why I want to insist on the importance of the technical measures for developing countries, because it is these measures which will allow these countries to take full advantage of the commercial opportunities offered by the liberalisation of the markets."
"Repealing or renegotiating the agreements already adopted is not the solution."
"On the contrary, in Doha the European Union must remind all the member countries of the WTO that it is necessary to respect the commitments made in the existing agreements, just as the European Union has respected its commitments."
"I am thinking specifically of the textile industry, which has strictly respected its commitment to open up its market, increasing quotas and progressively increasing the application of the GATT rules in the sector, which is something that not all countries have done, including the most developed countries."
"It is true that trade, even if it is multilateral, will not in itself resolve the inequalities of our planet, but it may reduce them by reconciling the interests and concerns of all the parties involved, especially those of the weakest."
"The European Union has proven experience in this task and we hope that after Doha, by following the line we have taken until now, Commissioner, we can finally succeed in it."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, like others, I wear a badge which symbolises trade with justice."
"Open trade - yes, but only with rules."
"Our national and European interests, yes of course, but also the interests of the developing world - your approach, Commissioner, and ours."
"I am going to concentrate on two frankly difficult areas - TRIPS and the environmental aspects of trade which you have already mentioned."
"Firstly, TRIPS: what we now have in the agreement is not clear enough or good enough."
"Intellectual property rights are important in world trade, but we thought that the 25.5 million HIV positive people in sub-Saharan Africa could have access to cheap drugs under TRIPS."
"Let us ensure that this is made more explicit after Doha."
"Ironically, the United States, the world's most fierce defender of intellectual property rights is now faced with the dilemma of needing huge supplies of antibiotics to combat anthrax."
"Attitudes may change with new circumstances - in any case, they have to."
"Secondly, environmental standards."
"The EU faces charges of protectionism."
"Commissioner, you know that this is not the case, that we are ready to help developing countries in any way necessary as we are helping applicant countries, that we have science on our side and that we will not abandon our hard-won progress - why should we?"
"Multilateral environment agreements cannot be discarded in the name of free trade and the precautionary principle must be explicitly included in WTO rules."
"This is a deal-breaker for us."
"We in the EU know more than any other part of the world how untrammelled free trade can be controlled through multilateral rule-making to the benefit of our citizens."
"Our achievements in the EU are relevant elsewhere, and we should defend them - your task Commissioner."
"I know you will be tough on our behalf."
"I hope you will be tough too on core labour standards."
"Seattle did not work - Doha can if it is fair and if there is a balance of trade and justice."
"Good luck Commissioner."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with your permission I will just say a few additional words, which perhaps have more to do with practicalities and less to do with the substance."
"Firstly, I should like to compliment Commissioner Lamy most particularly on the superb cooperation which we are enjoying and - I think that I speak for everyone - on the excellent manner in which he is representing the European Union in the run-up to this forthcoming trade round."
"His task will certainly be a difficult one."
"The right balance needs to be struck between, on the one hand, representing European interests and, on the other, ensuring that the other countries, our negotiating partners, and in particular the developing countries, are brought on board."
"Personally, I believe that this round will, more than any other, be able to send out a message to the world that it is possible to reconcile trade and politics."
"I trust, Commissioner Lamy, that you are in a position to achieve this, working together with your colleague Bob Zoelleck, but also with the many other negotiating partners that you have."
"It will not be an easy task."
"However, everything bodes well."
"I am grateful to you for consistently encouraging Parliament to play a more significant role in trade policy."
"Regrettably the Council has not taken the same step."
"Like you, I hope that we will be able to achieve more in this respect in the future."
"Incidentally, I should also like to thank all those colleagues in this House who have always supported this policy."
"I should, moreover, like to remind you, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, that you also have a task to carry out in Doha, namely organising the meeting with all of the trade ministers."
"We have a good tradition of arranging for the European Parliament's delegation to meet the ministers attending the trade round."
"I would earnestly request that you organise this meeting again this time and also ensure that we have a debate and that it is not just an occasion for a chat or seen as a bit of an afterthought, as the Council is wont to do, but that it really is an occasion for serious dialogue."
"In addition, I should also like to inform you very briefly - my colleague, Konrad Schwaiger, mentioned this - that the parliaments will also have a joint meeting in Doha."
"The invitation will be extended jointly by the President of this House and the President of the IPU."
"I hope that we will make progress there."
"Here, too, we need your support, Madam President-in-Office of the Council."
"We have always had this support from the Commission."
"Thank you once again for cooperating with us."
"Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, I should like to extend a warm thanks to all those who have taken the floor in this debate, for the good wishes they have conveyed to Commissioner Lamy and hopefully the Council presidency too, and I hope that we indeed manage to organise a balanced trade round with a broad-based agenda."
"My only comment in this respect is that I very much appreciate the fact that you have valued our respective efforts to improve the atmosphere prior to the start of such a round, and that you, as it were, assisted us in those efforts."
"This is a tremendous boost a fortnight prior to the start of this Fourth Ministerial Conference."
"If you allow me, Mr President, I should like to respond briefly to the specific questions that have been raised, notably those by Mr Schwaiger and Mrs Mann about the role of parliaments and Members of Parliament."
"Mr Schwaiger, I can only respond on behalf of my government with regard to our position concerning an amendment to Article 133 of the Treaty."
"I can only say to him that it was not the Belgian government that has precluded an amendment to the article."
"We will continue to strive towards a broadening of the Commission' s negotiation authority under that article, and towards greater parliamentary involvement."
"Secondly, I can say to Mr Schwaiger and Mrs Mann that I am delighted with the initiative for a parliamentary meeting in Doha; that appears to me to be extremely important."
"I will therefore be very happy to lend my support to this effort, and I hope that it will be possible to inject a little more stability into the meeting, because I believe it to be absolutely of fundamental importance for Members of Parliament - for in addition to MEPs, the meeting will, of course, also be attended by a number of national MPs - to learn to listen to each other."
"Maybe it will then be a little easier for us, members of the government, to convince our national parliaments of the accuracy of some of our claims when they hear those expressed by their colleagues from other countries, and particularly from developing countries."
"I welcome this development with open arms."
"It is significant in itself."
"It will also contribute towards more transparency in the activities of the World Trade Organisation."
"This does bring me to one minor remark made by Mrs Lucas who believes that the World Trade Organisation should be reformed first, before negotiations can commence."
"I should like to say to her that I cannot see how any changes could be made to the way the organisation works without a negotiation round."
"I should like to draw her attention to the fact that the very careful preparation of the Doha conference in itself bears witness to an entirely different approach from before."
"Finally, I should like to remind her that the World Trade Organisation is, in fact, a very young organisation which is very much open to improvement, and we will happily take part in this exercise."
"I gladly promise Mrs Mann, I will be organising a meeting with the Members of Parliament in Doha."
"Mrs Mann, you know very well that you and Mr Westendorp, as well as a few other MEPs, have had the opportunity to exchange ideas with us immediately prior to the start of the informal External Trade Council, so we will naturally carry on with this tradition."
"Mr President, I too wish to thank the speakers who have stated their support for the Commission' s position - including the President-in-Office of the Council - and also to thank those who have wished the negotiators good luck."
"Custom dictates that I should answer those who expressed more critical views and who, in tomorrow' s vote will not be adopting the position that the majority groups have stated they will."
"I shall do so briefly, replying first to Caroline Lucas - speaking on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance - the reasoning in whose speech I consider to contain a slight contradiction."
"On the one hand, Mrs Lucas, your group is in favour of tougher rules governing trade - specifically from the point of view of considering the environment - and yet, on the other, it is not in favour of negotiations taking place."
"You must have some solution for changing international rules that does not involve negotiating."
"Please tell me about it, because I have no such solution."
"To Mr Herzog, whose group I understand intends to adopt a similar position, I would like to say that I particularly liked your expression 'tough haggling' ."
"There will indeed be some of that."
"It is true that the WTO sometimes seems a little bit like a grocer' s shop but we must also remember that the more progress globalisation makes, the more trade develops and, occasionally, the more our values are at stake."
"In these cases, I think that toughness becomes a duty, whatever resentment this may engender."
"Mr Abitbol spoke on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group."
"You lament the fact, Mr Abitbol, that the Union has a single negotiator."
"I would remind you that this issue was decided for the future of the European Union 44 years ago."
"You choose to see in this the vanity of our founding fathers."
"Fifty years on, all I can see is their foresight."
"Lastly, Mr Abitbol, on the point you made, as on other critical points that were made, I would simply remind you that although the Commission negotiates on behalf of the Union, it does so under the control of those who gave it its mandate, which are the Council of Ministers and Parliament."
"Both will be attending the meeting: the Council, representing the States and Parliament' s delegation, with which you are familiar."
"In all honesty, I really cannot envisage a more effective method of ensuring that the negotiator' s political responsibility is maintained throughout."
"It is up to the Presidency-in-Office of the Council to oversee this process of giving account but, ultimately, I shall return with a position that I have negotiated and it will be up to the Council and Parliament to state their position with regard to the Treaties."
"This is how our democracy works."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"I have received six motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 10.00 a.m."
"International trade"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0331/2001) by Mr Désir, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on democracy and opening up international trade (2001/2093(INI))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the transition from the GATT era to that of the WTO changed the dimension as well as the nature of the multilateral trading system."
"With the advent of the WTO, trade rules were extended to a large number of new areas, including services, intellectual property, investment and rules on non-tariff barriers, that frequently affect non-trade issues."
"These rules have a binding force, which is backed by a dispute settlement system with the capacity to impose sanctions."
"Finally, enlargement, which begun under GATT, has resulted in an unprecedented diversity among its members with regard to international trade."
"The rules of the multilateral trading system now apply not only to the countries that account for most of world trade or only to the one-fifth of world production that is traded across borders."
"They also apply to goods and services that will never be traded internationally."
"All countries are concerned and their internal rules affected, whatever their share of international trade."
"In recent years, trade agreements have also had a growing impact on other international rules in areas such as the environment, health and social rights."
"Thus, WTO agreements or decisions have threatened the precautionary principle, environmental protection and access to medicines."
"The cause of this is partly the ambiguity of some agreements, such as the agreement on intellectual property, in the case of medicines, but with regard to public services, the scope of Article 1 of the General Agreement on Services is also to blame."
"To this, we can add another reason for the undermining of the multilateral trade system: the democratic legitimacy of the WTO, an intergovernmental organisation, in principle, relies firstly on the equal participation of all members, on the fact that they have an equal say in the organisation."
"Most of the developing countries, however, feel marginalised by its operation and cut off from the decision making process."
"At least 24 developing countries that are members of the WTO have no permanent representation in Geneva, and numerous others have only very small delegations that do not allow them to follow all of the proceedings that concern them."
"Many developing countries lack the necessary competences."
"In such situations, form and content are real issues for developing countries because the rules and agreements more often reflect the interests of the trading powers that have negotiated them between themselves, sometimes in 'green rooms' or in informal meetings, which are far too secretive - than the interests of all members, particularly of the poorest countries."
"Consequently, since the Uruguay Round, many developing countries have stated that they were not aware, when they signed, of all the legal, administrative and financial consequences of agreements such as the TRIPS agreement on intellectual property, which were drawn up without their involvement."
"Generally, where the developing countries are concerned, six years on from the creation of the WTO, the picture before us reveals a limited opening up of markets in the north, considerable difficulties in implementing agreements and persistent marginalisation from the workings of the WTO."
"This feeling is more acute still for the least developed countries (LDCs), which, twenty years ago, accounted for 0.6% of international trade. Today the figure stands at only 0.4%."
"The WTO, therefore, continues to be dominated by the large trading powers, and it is they that benefit overwhelmingly from its policies."
"And, two years after Seattle, the multilateral trade system is still undergoing a threefold crisis of democratic legitimacy, as a consequence of the uneven distribution of the benefits of world trade, of the marginalisation of many of its members, as a result of the impact of some WTO rules on other basic principles, even at international level, and lastly due to a lack of transparency and the limited involvement of parliaments and civil society in the work of the WTO."
"Although the WTO has started to acknowledge the need for reform, this recognition has yet to be translated into the necessary changes."
"As you know, Commissioner, our committee, therefore, adopted, by a large majority - 48 votes to 5, with 1 abstention - a report which is noteworthy above all for its set of practical proposals, grouped into four main chapters."
"First of all, the equal and effective participation of all members is a key factor in any new direction for the multilateral trading system."
"This will require an increase in the provision of technical assistance."
"The Commission has already undertaken a number of actions and we urge it to persevere in this direction."
"We propose going further, however. The Commission should propose the creation, for example, on the basis of a contribution proportional to each member' s share of international trade, of a fund or an increase in the WTO' s budget, which would enable all member countries to have a representation in Geneva."
"We propose supporting regional representations, which is already being done, specifically for the ACP countries, but we feel that we need to go further; we need to establish internal transparency; until all members have a representation, we must allow non-resident countries to have rapid access to records of meetings and draft agreements; we must establish clear rules on so-called 'informal' consultations to allow all countries that wish to take part to do so, by publishing agendas in advance and by ensuring that reports of prior decisions, which are sometimes prepared, are provided to the competent bodies in good time."
"We also propose that the dispute settlement system be reformed, because there are still inequalities linked to the market share of the various member countries, to ensure that the small countries, those that account for a small proportion of international trade, can, in certain circumstances, seek financial compensation."
"Secondly, there is the issue of opening the WTO up to society and external transparency."
"We feel that much remains to be done in this area before we reach the level of other organisations, within which observer status has been given to non-governmental organisations."
"We feel that the dispute settlement procedure itself could, given the judicial nature of the procedures, be held in public, as is the case in court proceedings."
"Thirdly, there is the issue of parliamentary control, which was mentioned in the previous debate, at both national and European level and also by means of a consultative parliamentary assembly within the WTO."
"Where the European Union is concerned, we propose that Article 133 of the EC Treaty be reformed, that the 133 committee be opened up to Parliament's representatives, and that the European Parliament' s assent be required for all trade agreements."
"Fourthly, there is the balance between international standards and establishing new relationships between the WTO and other international organisations."
"We propose that all other multilateral organisations, such as the International Labour Organisation, the World Health Organisation, etc., be given observer status within the WTO and that their opinion be systematically sought by the dispute settlement body when there is a risk of conflict between trade rules and other rules."
"In our view, the European Union should propose a de facto hierarchy of standards at international level, with which all countries must comply. In other words, it should recognise that business law or trade law cannot supplant the principles of environmental protection, public health and respect for the social rights of workers."
"It must fall to the ILO, and the ILO alone, to decide whether or not it is appropriate to adopt retaliatory measures and to impose trade sanctions on countries, and not the World Trade Organisation."
"I feel, however, that the WTO must give a commitment to respect any decisions that the ILO may take on such matters."
"To conclude briefly, Mr President, I would say that trade policy, which is one of the oldest of the EU' s policies and its oldest external common policy concerns, of course, economic interests, but it also says a great deal - or, in any event, the European Union says a great deal - by means of this trade policy, about its vision of the world and of north-south relations in particular. It also reveals a belief in a division between that which is the domain of the market and that which societies must do in the name of principles, such as, solidarity."
"This policy must reflect the Union's fundamental values and objectives."
"For this reason, the EU' s priorities must be the establishment of fair and equitable trade, a democratic multilateral system, and a reformed WTO."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, Commissioner Lamy, ladies and gentlemen, we need more and not, as has been called for several times, less, international cooperation."
"For small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular, we need the basic conditions to be legally certain and foreseeable."
"The aim has to be to use world trade to create more wealth for our people."
"In so doing, however, we must not overlook the fact that Europe has 18 million small enterprises, which, at the end of the day, employ two-thirds of the workforce."
"This means that salaries are mainly being paid by small and medium-sized companies."
"Sixty per cent of GDP and, important for us politicians, 80% of taxes come from small companies."
"That is why where the WTO is concerned, we should not only consider involving and integrating the ILO in this process and reflect on how we might better structure it, but should also and especially bring the social dialogue and the social partners to the fore."
"The Everything But Arms initiative should not contain the clause 'Everything But Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises' , but instead 'Everything For Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises' ."
"The economy is at the centre of this discussion, and this is something that we should not forget in the whole WTO debate."
"Very briefly on TRIPS: here we should consider, in particular, having compulsory licences and, above all, development aid; we should consider having calls for tender and also giving countries medicines of the necessary quality."
"As regards the dispute settlement mechanism, I should like to recall that many companies and individual firms are damaged by WTO rulings, for example because of carousel trade retaliation."
"Here I should like to ask: how do these companies obtain redress?"
"Finally, we need to introduce more transparency into these areas and ensure that decisions are made closer to the people."
"That is why I welcome the fact that President Neyts will support the European Parliament and parliaments throughout the world in their efforts to bring more transparency and also in the end, I hope, more wealth into this world."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to congratulate the rapporteur, Harlem Désir, on his very good, clear and extensive report."
"Commissioner, if the decision-making process in the WTO is not made more transparent and democratic then, in the long term, the people of the WTO Member States will not stand for it, because we cannot have nation states increasingly referring crucial issues to the competent supranational organisation, while parliaments and, therefore, also society at large remain prevented from exercising their democratic right to monitor and participate in its work."
"Events in the Dispute Settlement Body must also be seen in this light."
"The Dispute Settlement Body needs to be thoroughly overhauled."
"It needs to be transparent and changes also need to be made to its composition."
"In the same way, it is necessary for us, finally, to give the developing countries the tools which will actually allow them to participate in the negotiations on an equal footing and then to assess the decisions which need to be made as they see fit."
"There is, of course, a difference between a delegation arriving with 150 experts and a developing country having great difficulty sending its ambassador to the places concerned."
"I should like to point this out once more here."
"Otherwise, Harlem Désir has already said everything that needed to be said."
"Mr President, I would also like to join in the congratulations to Mr Désir, the rapporteur."
"This report strikes us as an excellent piece of forward-thinking, a blueprint for the WTO of tomorrow."
"It comprehensively rejects those who claim that the WTO is beyond redemption; that it cannot be reformed; that it is inherently biased against the poor or the dispossessed; and that it is just an agent for the rule of the jungle, rather than the rule of law."
"It also rejects the contrary view: the idea that free trade should prevail at all costs; that the WTO should be an agent for the dismantling of outstanding trade barriers, and should do so to the exclusion of all other political and public policy considerations."
"Instead, it represents almost a synthesis of those two views, because it shows how and when and why the WTO should, and must, be reformed."
"It shows how the WTO must become more transparent and legitimate."
"I should add that all the emphasis that we, as Europeans, place on the need for increased legitimacy and transparency in the WTO will come to nothing if we do not reform the way in which we conduct our own trade policy in the European Union."
"I was delighted to hear the presidency today say that it has supported in the past, and will support in the future, Parliament's demands for more transparent and legitimate trade policy-making in the European Council and the European Union."
"The report also - and this is perhaps its greatest contribution to the debate - shows the way in which the WTO has to be placed increasingly in a context of other public policy priorities and other multilateral organisations and agreements."
"It cannot rely on a role as primus inter pares on the international scene."
"Instead it should learn to interact with other priorities and other multilateral agreements."
"Our role is, therefore, to flank the WTO with other supporting agreements in other fields, notably the environmental field."
"Mr President, international trade is fundamental in our system and, in the opinion of those who advocate a different type of globalisation, including myself, international trade must be based on fair, equitable trading bringing development and wealth to the greatest number of people possible."
"Regrettably, the trade negotiations held under the auspices of GATT and the WTO did not serve to create fair international rules: quite the opposite, they left entire communities with no defence against the greed of multinationals."
"It therefore follows that these institutions are suffering an unprecedented crisis of legitimacy in respect of vast sections of communities, and are in vital need of thorough reform."
"The Désir report addresses clearly the limitations and dysfunctional areas of international trade, of unequal participation, and the lack of transparency and democracy and the ensuing consequences, and proposes reforms to remedy these shortcomings."
"We support the report and will vote for the motion, but we feel that this must only be the start of a process of change."
"The Commission and the Council must refuse to be influenced by pressure from the rest of the world."
"Mr President, justice must be done, but more importantly justice must be seen to be done: the WTO is a very powerful international organisation, dealing with rules and law, and it must be seen to act justly."
"Accountability and transparency are therefore exceptionally important."
"Global trade requires global rules and development requires understanding of some of the problems of the developing countries."
"If we are discussing transparency and accountability within the WTO process, transparency for its own sake and accountability for its own sake are just not enough."
"The fundamental purpose of both is to create integrity in the system so that those who have promised to do things, and here I mean the developed countries, are forced to do them because of international public opinion."
"There are many things that the developed countries promised in the Uruguay round which have not been delivered."
"Conversely, those in the developing world who now have systems of corruption and bad practice will also be brought to book through the process of accountability and transparency."
"In this regard, I would like to support Mr Désir in saying that he has produced an excellent report which I want to support."
"It is vital to understand the permanent position of the rule of law."
"Equality before the law and confidence in it is an absolute necessity for developing countries."
"Without it all the well-meaning words and the great aid-giving we indulge in will come to nothing."
"Justice must be done and must be seen to be done."
"Mr President, international trade is of central importance if conditions for growth and development are to be created throughout our world."
"The rules governing this trade determine whether growth and development are to benefit the whole of humanity or are to be confined to the industrialised world."
"Mr Désir' s report is an excellent instrument for bringing about something more akin to global justice in world trade."
"The developing countries must be put on the same footing as the industrialised countries when it comes to participating in the joint work of the WTO."
"For me, as a Social Democrat, global justice is an end in itself."
"The acts of terrorism in the United States also point to the need to limit the basis for hatred and fanaticism."
"Less injustice will increase the safety of us all."
"The voluntary organisations must be given scope to express their opinions when world trade is discussed."
"Democracy can be deepened through the setting up of a parliamentary assembly within the WTO."
"Social dumping must be prevented and employees' rights must be provided for."
"Fundamental human rights must be respected, the fight against environmental devastation intensified and child labour prohibited."
"We must stop dumping our food surplus in the developing countries and, instead, give farmers in those countries a chance to increase their production and their opportunities to provide for themselves."
"In that way, we can make our contribution to a more just and more secure world."
"Mr President, the new WTO round perfectly illustrates our criticism of the way in which this body is organised."
"This is supposedly a development round, but the European ministers for cooperation and development are not taking part in the forthcoming meeting."
"Furthermore, the Committee on Development and Cooperation has not been able to deliver an opinion on the Désir report."
"Fortunately, the report asks pertinent questions, and it has our support."
"This is supposed to be a development round, but the 49 LDCs are opposed to it and rightly so."
"Liberalisation, which is supposed to lead to development, growth and prosperity, has only made their situation worse."
"The WTO perpetuates the imbalance in world trade and the establishment of rules that are unfavourable to the developing countries."
"Furthermore, it has ended the preferential system instituted by the Lomé Convention."
"Similarly, the Cotonou Agreement urges the ACP countries to abide by the GATS or the agreement on Trips but the UNDP, itself, states that the liberalisation of services will only benefit multinational companies."
"The GATS is basically the IMA by the back door."
"It is a tool for dismantling democracy."
"Mr Lamy, if negotiations must take place, then they must focus on a root and branch reform of the WTO."
"It is the development of the least advanced countries that must benefit rather than the development of multinational companies' profits."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too wish to thank Harlem Désir for the quality of this report, which, of course, I fully support."
"The point that you made just now, Commissioner, on developments within the WTO to my mind shows all the more the need for such a report."
"I shall use two points to try to illustrate this."
"The Commission must keep a close eye on the issues of agriculture and intellectual property, so that the current shifts we are seeing within the WTO do not continue indefinitely."
"The dice have been and remain loaded against the weakest, either the poorest countries or the most endangered social categories in our own countries, because the WTO is a body that is neither transparent nor democratic."
"Let us take the example of the Marrakech Agreements on agriculture."
"They guarantee neither self-sufficiency with regard to food supply nor the right to protect biodiversity for the southern countries. They prevent the specific nature of small-scale farming in Europe from being taken into consideration, with all its quality, social and environmental aspects."
"There is a danger that, in the near future, they may ban small farmers from sowing the seeds that they have themselves produced."
"The Commission must exert pressure to change this, to have an in-depth review of the Trips agreement drawn up so that it is fully compatible with the Rio convention on biodiversity and the Cartagena protocol on biosecurity, as the African group within the WTO is calling for."
"This will enable us to preserve the biological heritage of the developing countries and the traditional skills in the south as well as the north."
"Furthermore, the patenting of living organisms must be prohibited, because these are the heritage of all humanity and cannot and must not be hijacked by private interests that want to turn life into a commodity."
"I hope, Commissioner, that you will convey this message."
"Mr President, Mr Désir' s own-initiative report makes a number of recommendations that are quite close to the spirit in which we are approaching the WTO ministerial conference in Doha."
"You would like to see the developing countries integrated into world trade, which is an objective that we share."
"You emphasise the importance of the WTO addressing the public' s concerns, over and above the traditional issues of access to the markets or of customs tariffs. We also share this objective and feel, as you do, that rapid economic change and the effects of globalisation must be managed."
"The fact is that progress has already been made on many of your suggestions, specifically with regard to follow-ups with technical assistance or councils for developing countries in WTO negotiations."
"The European Union, for example, is responsible for establishing the ACP countries' Centre in Geneva, which will enable these countries to better coordinate their position and consequently exert greater influence within the WTO."
"It is the European Union that insisted on streamlining meetings in Geneva and on making the participation of members who do not have a representation in the WTO easier."
"I am giving these two examples, to which one could add the efforts made to encourage the accession of a number of countries - and in Doha, an LDC, the island of Vanuatu, will sit side by side with China and Taiwan, for example - not to suggest that the situation is perfect or that nothing remains to be done, but in order to ensure that the debate on the proposals for reform is held on the basis of a full and up-to-date knowledge of the current situation."
"On this subject, I should like to make a small correction to a point of fact that appears in your explanatory statement, Mr Désir, concerning hormone-treated beef."
"Contrary to what you state, the European Union has not been condemned for banning hormones in cattle breeding."
"The WTO has explicitly recognised the right in this affair of each member to set its own level of protection."
"The Union was condemned because, at the time, it did not supply the necessary scientific evidence to justify such a ban."
"I have a few other different interpretations, or rather differences of opinion, concerning some of your comments or suggestions."
"You mention the crisis of democratic legitimacy, which other speakers have taken up."
"I disagree with the content of this criticism."
"Admittedly, the system could be improved: it must be made more open and the developing countries must be more fully integrated."
"The challenge of reconciling our 'civil society' agenda with our 'development' agenda is indeed formidable and your report, furthermore, attests to some of these difficulties, in that, for some subjects, you propose both external transparency and fundamental social standards."
"We know very well that, where these two matters are concerned, our sensitivity to the positions of the developing countries forces us to severely limit our ambitions: consequently, our own position is not entirely free from contradiction, as your report highlights."
"Nevertheless, calling the current situation a serious crisis of democratic legitimacy strikes me as somewhat excessive."
"As far as I am aware, the Marrakech Agreement was not only adopted by the Member State governments, but was also ratified both by the national parliaments and by your House."
"In other words, the Marrakech Agreement has been ratified by the European Parliament."
"With regard to your statement that decision making within the WTO is the sole preserve of the richer nations, I would say that, although this may once have been true, it is increasingly less the case in an organisation of more than 140 members and, in which, small discussion groups are inevitable in its day-to-day work."
"We are trying to ensure that these meetings include both rich and poor countries and that they guarantee a representative mix both in terms of geography and in terms of stages of development."
"It may be the case that these informal groups make it easier to reach consensus, but they never, as we all know, take decisions."
"Many preparatory meetings of this type have taken place over these last few weeks, for example, the ministerial mini-meeting in Mexico at the end of August, the Europe-Asia meeting in Hanoi in mid-September, the Europe-Africa meeting in Nairobi in mid-October and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting at the weekend."
"I would also add that, in terms of the method of preparation, the lesson of Seattle has been learned and that the participating delegations are larger and better informed about the issues you have raised."
"With regard to dispute settlement, an issue you have also addressed, I would make three comments."
"First of all, let us not forget that the main objective of the mechanism for settling disputes is the effective and disciplined implementation of commitments that have been freely negotiated and accepted."
"This is what a member of the WTO hopes to obtain when it resorts to the dispute settlement procedure."
"Like you, we are also opposed to immediate implementation and to trade sanctions."
"There must be more room for trade compensation."
"Personally speaking, I have greater reservations about your suggestion to replace sanctions with fines."
"My fear is that financial penalties would not resolve the imbalance between rich and poor countries, and might, to some extent, even allow the rich countries to buy off their breaches of obligations."
"With regard to the transparency of the panels, we are also in favour of opening up the hearings of the appeals body to the public."
"Let us remember, however, just between ourselves, that the developing countries have very firmly held positions on this point, which we do not share."
"Where the relationship with other rules of international law is concerned, we must ensure greater coherence and prevent conflict between trade and non-trade rules."
"This must apply to the very substance of the commitments in question."
"As to the issue of revising the agreement on intellectual property, which you consider to be necessary, I do not think that a thorough revision would be appropriate."
"If we take the examples of access to medicines or of the patenting of living organisms, the agreement provides sufficient latitude to establish an intellectual property system that responds to the concerns expressed by developing countries."
"It is the task of the members of the WTO to interpret and clarify this flexibility, and we feel that it is better to do so by means of discussion or negotiation than to leave this task to panels."
"This is the basis of our position in Geneva, which I mentioned in the previous debate."
"Mrs Auroi, the issue of compatibility between the agreement on intellectual property and the convention on biodiversity is one of the points that we wish to see clarified in these negotiations."
"With regard to the incentive measures to ensure compliance with basic standards in the field of employment law, we agree with your wish, Mr Désir, to highlight the importance of strengthening the ILO and this is why your suggestion to create a multilateral agreement within the WTO does not fill us with any great enthusiasm."
"As for the incentive measures to ensure compliance with basic social standards, I would say that we must not undermine the influence of the International Labour Organisation."
"This is not a weak institution that the WTO must provide with a dynamism that it would not otherwise have."
"We must instead work on improving the ILO' s profile."
"Lastly, with regard to creating a parliamentary forum within the WTO, a proposal that, as I stated in the previous debate, we have always supported, I shall conclude briefly by saying that we shall make use of the guidelines that Parliament has laid down for this set of work, to which we can now add your report, Mr Désir."
"I would say that, as this afternoon's debate has shown, the Commission' s political line, approved and implemented by the Council, is also coherent with the position of this House."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 10.00 a.m."
"Common foreign and security policy (CFSP)"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0332/2001) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the progress achieved in the implementation of the common foreign and security policy (C5-0194/2001 - 2001/2007(INI))."
"I would point out that, after the rapporteur, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, President-in-Office of the Council, and Commissioner Patten will speak, and they will then have to leave as a result of urgent air transport issues."
"This change to the agenda is due to the evacuation of Parliament, which is of course neither the responsibility of the President-in-Office of the Council nor of the Commissioner."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, in recent weeks we have frequently said it, and in the light of this annual report we should emphasise it once more: since 11 September we have not actually learnt anything new."
"It has become clear to us, however, and we have become more conscious of the fact that we need a new definition of security, that the old concepts of security policy actually no longer work and that, for this reason, a particular combination of external and internal security needs to be formed."
"It is no longer the case, you see, that a potential enemy can be unambiguously recognised behind a border; now the enemy also has the ability to be in our midst."
"Here, I believe, a coordinated approach needs to be agreed."
"Admittedly, we also know that this threat can no longer be fought by individual states because the challenge is international and runs across borders."
"That is why we also need to find cross-border solutions."
"Each individual European state only has a chance of guaranteeing the long-term peace and security of its own people if we pool our resources, in terms of military forces, in the field of prevention and in the field of civil crisis management, but also in terms of ensuring cooperation between our security bodies and intelligence services."
"For this reason, I believe, we have actually made considerable progress in the last two years in view of the decisions made since the Treaties of Amsterdam and Nice and, in particular, those made at Cologne and subsequent summits."
"On this basis, I think that we should press on with developing a European security and defence policy once the necessary conditions for doing so are in place."
"In our opinion, we have to recognise that it will be necessary to make certain structural changes to achieve this."
"This is because we believe that it will only work if, firstly, the Member States realise that only the joint institutions can act and that bilateral initiatives also weaken the individuals concerned, even if they think that it makes them appear particularly powerful in the media."
"The second point is that the structures in the different institutions will also have to dovetail to avoid there being any duplication of work."
"It does not, in my opinion, make any sense for there to be committees on civil crisis management in both the Commission and the Council, with the High Representative."
"That is why I wish, on behalf of the European Parliament, to repeat our position that in the long term the duties of the Commissioner for External Relations and those of the High Representative should be merged within the Commission."
"That should happen in order to ensure that there really is a uniform approach and so as to have uniform structures."
"This has nothing to do with the merits of those specifically involved at the moment; it is a question of structure."
"On this basis we must also, of course, make sure that this person has special relations with the Council so as to give their work the appropriate legitimacy at that level."
"I also think, however, that we can make it clear that added value really is being generated."
"I should like to give just a few examples here."
"I believe, for example, that the large anti-terrorism coalition would not have been formed in this way had it not been for the particular European influence exerted by the troika's travelling to the Middle East, which yielded significant results."
"I do not believe that the large anti-terrorism coalition will be able to exist in the long term if the European Union does not foster stability in the Mediterranean area through the Barcelona process."
"For this reason, I also believe that the European Union has the task of addressing the root causes which sow the emotional seeds of terrorism, whether it be in the Middle East, in the relations between Pakistan and India, or in other parts of the world where we should make a particular effort to make our contribution to securing peace."
"In this process we have to recognise that our relations with the United States take the form of a partnership and that, regardless of all our efforts to develop our own security and defence policy, NATO is still necessary because it alone is able to guarantee the collective security."
"If we wish to play a role in politics as a whole, however, we must also actively work to further develop our relations with Russia, build new bridges and provide those countries which at present cannot, should not or do not wish to be members of the European Union with a new framework and a new form of European economic area."
"Nevertheless, I should also like to say that all of this will only work if we are also prepared to make the money available in our national budgets to make it possible to really keep our pledge to provide 60 000 people for the Rapid Reaction Force."
"We will not be successful in terms of prevention and civil crisis management and we will not continue to play a key role in foreign policy, but will just be passive observers, including in our relations with Russia and the United States of America, if we do not plausibly demonstrate that we have our own military capability."
"It is often the case that prevention only works if it is possible to show the country in which you want to intervene to establish peace that you also have military options."
"It is often sufficient to possess a military capability - this is shown throughout history - to prevent military resources from even having to be deployed."
"That is why realising our vision of having a 60 000-strong Rapid Reaction Force, transport capabilities and our own satellite system by 2003 is decisive for the credibility of the future European foreign and security policy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Brok on his excellent rapport, in which he not only asks pertinent questions, but also, and from the outset, provides some valuable answers."
"Incidentally, the report is most timely, because, with regard to all issues concerning foreign policy as a whole, in other words, the Union' s policy towards the rest of the world, security policy in all its aspects and defence policy, the European Parliament is clearly in a state of change."
"I was present in this House for the discussion of the Treaty of Amsterdam, when we stated our disappointment at the little progress made on common security and defence policy."
"Looking at the point we have reached today, we see that we have come a long way and especially that we have progressed very quickly."
"The events of recent months and weeks have shown, whatever may have been said about them this morning, that the European Union is becoming, and is being perceived to be, an increasingly important player on the world stage."
"This gives us both greater visibility and, of course, imposes greater responsibilities on us."
"I am sure I am not the only person here to have been confronted over the last few weeks with the question: 'but where are the European Union' s troops?' asked by people who have completely forgotten that we are not involved and are far from being involved."
"This means quite simply that we are increasingly perceived to be a player on the global stage and that we must have all the institutional, financial and other means available if we are to successfully achieve all of these responsibilities."
"This result could clearly only have been achieved as a result of the energy and dynamism both of the High Representative for Security and Cooperation and of Commissioner Patten, who, in a spirit of perfect cooperation, both manage to represent us superbly on all world stages, in all crisis hot-spots on our own continent and in much more far-flung parts of the world."
"We, the Member States of the European Union, are also increasingly managing - and the Belgian presidency has played a part in this - to speak with one voice in international bodies and I am thinking in particular of the United Nations, which currently play an extremely important role."
"We therefore wish to see ourselves become a major political player on the international stage."
"This will enable us to better shoulder our responsibilities so that we can contribute to peace and stability across the world."
"This policy is progressing at the pace we had envisaged."
"I am sure you know that this is an open process, in which the Fifteen want to involve the candidate countries and the allied non-Member States of the European Union."
"Negotiations currently taking place with NATO are due to establish the methods of cooperation between ourselves and the Alliance, in order to ensure access to NATO' s resources and capacities and in order to avoid efforts being pointlessly duplicated."
"As you know, these negotiations are not straightforward and you also know why they are so complex."
"Ultimately, however, you also know - and I repeat what the presidency has already stated on previous occasions - that we have no intention of allowing this process of establishing the means to guarantee our being operational becoming hostage to events within NATO."
"We shall lead the way and we shall continue to work to achieve the objectives I have mentioned."
"I fully agree that conflict prevention and crisis management are amongst the foremost priorities of our action, and, as Mr Brok has said, these priorities must lead us to be committed at every stage."
"We shall maintain this commitment on a long-term basis in various crisis situations, whether it be in the Balkans, the Middle East or in Africa."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis which has its origins in the terrible attacks on 11 September in the United States has shown that the European Union is capable of reacting in a rapid and coherent manner."
"Our reaction bore witness to horizontal coordination and has, in fact, transcended the pillar division."
"I believe that that too is, and will be, an important element in the further development of our common policy."
"I should like to point out that the European Council has rarely been so outspoken over the past few weeks as it was in that context."
"We have decided to adopt a voluntaristic policy vis-à-vis the Arab-Muslim world and we are united with many to give out the same message, namely that the crisis that has broken out and the fight against international terrorism can in no way be considered a war between civilisations."
"This morning, we were reminded of the importance of resuming the peace process in the Middle East."
"You know that the presidency will be making a visit to that region shortly in the hope of giving out that message and of receiving backing for this."
"As I have already stated, our campaign in the Middle East is still based on the implementation of the roadmap, as can be found in the recommendation of the Mitchell committee."
"(FR) With regard to the Western Balkans, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is committed to the systematic implementation of the conclusions of the Zagreb Summit."
"Cooperation with the International Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia is one factor allowing progress to be made on negotiating stabilisation and association agreements with every country that participated in this summit, of which the transfer of Mr Milosevic to The Hague was the most striking symbol, although not the only one."
"We welcome the progress made by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia since its return to democracy a little more than a year ago."
"With regard to Kosovo, we are focussing our action on the preparations for the general elections of 17 November, and we are delighted to see that more than 170 000 Serbs have enrolled on the electoral registers, which provides hope that the result may be a balanced one."
"The situation in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is unfortunately not so straightforward and, here also, it has taken all the efforts of our representative, Mr Solana, of Commissioner Patten, and many others, to prevent the crisis that took place there from unfolding into a true civil war."
"As you know, the situation remains extremely delicate and Mrs Pack even drew my attention to the matter when I reported on the General Affairs Council decisions of 8 October."
"We are all aware of this and we are monitoring the situation, as you and many others are, extremely closely."
"I should nevertheless like to emphasise that events in Macedonia have shown that close cooperation between NATO and ourselves is possible and that we are able to play a role in the prevention and management of crises."
"(NL) Another region in crisis where the European Union is pursuing an active control and prevention policy is Africa."
"The troika will shortly be making a few visits to that region, too, in order to keep the two peace processes that are running there, and are sometimes faltering, I have to say, namely the Lusaka peace process for Congo and the Arusha peace process for Burundi, on track and to ensure that they can herald the end of the military action and hence peace."
"For without peace, the reconstruction of Africa is not possible."
"Could I finally draw your attention to the meeting of the European-African Ministerial Conference of 11 October? It was a great success from the point of view that a political dialogue was entered into, whereby, needless to say, due consideration was given to the development of democracy and human rights."
"Lastly, with regard to our strategic partnerships, I should like to emphasise that our relations with Russia have also been given a new boost at all levels."
"Little by little, we are seeing the establishment, not so much of mechanisms but of forms of contact and dialogue, which enable us to envisage genuine cooperation and a genuine strategic partnership."
"This development can only contribute to the stability not only of our own continent, but also to stability throughout the world."
"I must, however, state quite clearly on this subject, that this rapprochement between the European Union and Russia, in no way means that we will be any the less vigilant over the situation in Chechnya."
"We are continuing to discuss the matter and to insist on the need to find a political solution."
"Lastly, I should like to mention the Fourth EU-China Summit, which also enabled us to strengthen political dialogue but, once again, this political dialogue includes the issue of human rights."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have limited speaking time and the fire drill did not, of course, help and for this I apologise."
"Out of all that has been said, however, I should like to take up, in conclusion, the three following aspects: a strong Europe, a Europe that is able to project its influence onto the international stage is, above all, a Europe in which internal cohesion supports external action; secondly, it is a Europe in which the synergies between Presidency, Member States, Commission and High Representatives are exploited to the full and, lastly, it is a Europe in which action, whether it be in the field of justice, defence, cooperation or anything else, matches the rhetoric."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Brok, ladies and gentlemen, thank you."
"I am sorry for the reasons to which you alluded, President."
"The fire drill has meant that this important debate is in a sense an inadvertent victim of the importance of enhancing our parliamentary security."
"I will unfortunately have to leave shortly because the minister and I have to get to Bucharest by dawn - a challenging journey at this time of evening from Strasbourg!"
"We have to be there for the opening of the Stability Pact conference tomorrow, which, and it is not entirely irrelevant to what the honourable Member says in his report, at least indicates a measure of success over the last couple of years for the evolving common, foreign and security policy."
"I would like to congratulate the honourable Member, on what is a very comprehensive and valuable report."
"As he said in his own remarks, the evolution of a common foreign and security policy is shown to be even more timely by the appalling events of the autumn of 2001."
"The honourable Member's report gives a very accurate overview of what has been achieved so far."
"I particularly welcome his proposals for a strong parliamentary dimension in the common foreign and security policy."
"It is very important that we put down deeper democratic roots for the common foreign and security policy and that should involve not only this distinguished Parliament but also national parliaments."
"I have made a point of trying to appear in front of the select committees in national parliaments on bilateral visits to the Member States."
"If anybody challenges the progress that we have made in developing a CFSP they should compare what happened during this crisis with what happened in the run-up to the Gulf War at the beginning of the 1990s or how we coped with the Balkans in the early to mid-1990s."
"We cannot yet, as pop singers would perhaps suggest, 'strut our stuff'. But we have some reason for being modestly proud of the achievements that have been made so far."
"I fully agree with the report's analysis of the prerequisites of successful CFSP action."
"We have to bring together the resources and instruments of all the EU players: the Community, the Council and the Member States."
"I doubt whether history will regard the present institutional structures as ideal."
"I do not put it any more strongly than that, but the High Representative and I have worked as hard as we could make these structures work as effectively as is possible."
"What will happen in the future is for other people greater than me to determine."
"I do not want to go through all my agreement with the honourable Member on individual regional and geographical areas, not least because Bucharest calls."
"But I want to stress one or two points he made."
"I could, for example, have gone into a detailed paragraph or two agreeing on Russia and the Ukraine, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, on the Balkans in general and on the importance of getting back to Mitchell in the Middle East."
"The two points I should like to mention briefly are these: firstly, we rightly talk about the importance of trying to ensure that the international campaign against terrorism is not seen as a conflict between the West - Europe and North America - and the world of Islam."
"It is absolutely right that we have to make it clear this is not a clash of civilisations."
"But we have a real opportunity and responsibility in the European Union to use the mechanisms of the Barcelona process, to use the mechanisms of the Euro-Med partnership in order to strengthen the relationship between Europe and the Islamic world."
"We have a real chance and a real responsibility to do this."
"I hope we will seize it."
"I also hope we will look very hard at our relationship with the Gulf Cooperation Council in this regard."
"The other point that I want to pick up from Mr Brok's remarks and from the report is simply this: in my judgment, we have to try to ensure that we can make use of this crisis to open doors and windows which have otherwise been shut."
"That affects, for example, our future relationship with Pakistan."
"It also, in my judgment, very clearly touches on our relationship with Iran."
"I have no doubt at all that the Iranians are serious in wanting to establish a better, more profound relationship between themselves and the European Union."
"I have no doubt at all that they are serious about wanting to negotiate a trade and cooperation agreement with us."
"They know perfectly well that any arrangements with us will involve a dialogue on human rights and related matters."
"But I believe they are serious interlocutors and that it is incumbent upon us to respond as positively as possible to the overtures they have made."
"On Afghanistan I will only say that I look forward - I hope sooner, rather than later - to the time when I will have to come back to Parliament and the Council and point out the financial consequences for all of us of the political promises and pledges we have made about the future of Afghanistan."
"There will be an important moment when we have to put our money and our diplomatic efforts where our convictions have been and should remain."
"Finally, I would like to say once again how important it is to mobilise all our institutions, all our competences, as effectively as possible in pursuit of a common foreign and security policy."
"Sometimes it is possible to underestimate the contribution which the Commission can make and wants to make in the CFSP field."
"There is a great deal that we can do in order to make sure that the CFSP develops effectively as a way of reflecting Europe's growing clout in the international political arena."
"The rapporteur has been well ahead of his time in pressing us to do more in this field."
"I hope that we will live up to his expectations in the months and years ahead."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate Mr Brok on his report on the progress achieved in the implementation of the common foreign and security policy, a report whose objective is not only to sing the praises of this policy, but also to point out its inadequacies and deficiencies."
"It goes without saying that the European Community, making a virtue out of necessity, has, thanks to the determination of the Commission, the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the High Representative, seen its visibility increased since the attacks on 11 September."
"This morning, during the debate on the European Council in Ghent, the President-in-Office of the Council fairly diplomatically said that an awkward situation had arisen as a result of the tripartite meeting that had taken place outside the summit."
"To a certain extent, Mr President, it is logical that in times of crisis each person tries to save their own skin, but, in my opinion, it is important not to give way to the temptation to act unilaterally, or, to be more precise, on this particular occasion, trilaterally."
"Europe is strong when united, but when fragmented is weak."
"For this reason it is important that Europe should be able to speak with one single voice."
"And the European Union, in the aftermath of the situation that has arisen as a result of the September 11 terrorist attacks, has to rethink its common foreign and security policy, including within it the fight against terrorism, speeding up the achievement of its objectives and making the common strategies mechanism more efficient."
"Today, unilateralism, including that of the most prosperous and powerful countries, as we have already witnessed, is nothing but a pipe dream."
"In the globalised world we are living in today, politics, diplomacy, security and defence are interrelated concepts that have to respond to the new threats we are having to face."
"Security becomes a universal idea that cannot be split up, far removed from the traditional concepts of state and status quo."
"In turn, defence is constantly changing its boundaries in a world in which the perception of these is ever more blurred: nowadays, we cannot only consider the territorial defence of one State faced with a possible attack by another, but rather, as has been correctly said, we have armies that lack clear enemies and enemies that lack armies."
"In this world of globalisation, not only economic, but where terror, politics, diplomacy, trade, aid to development, security and defence are all interrelated concepts, it will depend on us to be capable of understanding and accepting that dangers and conflicts affect us all in the same measure and the response to these will also have to be the same for all those concerned."
"But we will have to start - and I am convinced of this - by creating a true common EU foreign and security policy with a common conscience that is efficient, coherent and visible, as Mr Brok' s report recommends."
"Mr President, Mr Brok's report, which, as usual, is very carefully drafted, has come just at the right time, a time when we need some pointers for where the common foreign and security policy is heading."
"For us, 'common' means above all, and I am saying this deliberately now, that we must not have, or even give the impression of having, a board of directors issuing instructions and determining policy."
"'Common' also means, and here I would support my colleague, Mr Brok, that the High Representative's duties need to be combined with those of the relevant Commissioner."
"'Common' also means ensuring that we have a European Union Rapid Reaction Force as soon as possible."
"The policy has to be European to the extent that it clearly defines European objectives, and this means that we show solidarity with the United States of America but also insist that this solidarity is not a one-way street."
"If I have to read at a time like this that the United States of America is still rejecting the International Criminal Court and that Congress is even debating whether or not those who cooperate with the Criminal Court should be penalised, then this is not what I understand by developing a policy based on solidarity between the European Union and the United States."
"Solidarity with the United States must therefore also mean our drawing the United States' attention to those areas where it is necessary to pursue a common policy in the world community."
"My third and final point is that if we form alliances, in particular this alliance against terrorism, an alliance which we must and should form, we will more often find ourselves facing a contradiction or conflict between our strategic concerns on the one hand and our human rights concerns on the other."
"We should be under no illusion about this."
"Anyone who wishes to enter into an alliance, and I do, with the Soviet Union, with Russia, with China and with the Islamic States, will repeatedly encounter this contradiction."
"We should simply realise that we also need to make it absolutely clear to the public that this contradiction exists."
"We need to work towards both objectives."
"We should never abandon our aim of securing respect for human rights in the medium and long term when we have to form a strategic alliance, because if you support the shahs of today you will get the Ayatollah Khomeinis of tomorrow."
"This can happen if we do not remain vigilant and at the same time put the issue of human rights at the centre of our foreign policy."
"Mr President, our group recognises the efforts made by Mr Brok in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, which has been a positive effort to reconcile the various contributions."
"However, we do not agree with the fundamental aspects of his report and, for this reason, we cannot support it with our vote."
"As an example, I will now briefly mention three of these aspects."
"Firstly, 11 September was an opportune moment for the European Union to demonstrate that it could play a positive, peaceful and reflective role with the United States, in order to find, in the International Criminal Tribunal and through International Law, a solution to the conflict."
"What appeared to be taking place in this direction has now been frustrated by the emergence of the Schröder - Blair - Chirac triumvirate which has missed this opportunity."
"Secondly, the report gives great importance to NATO, when we think that NATO works against the interests of the European Union."
"Lastly, it is very important that the European Union should play a role in the Middle East and in the Western Sahara, and we are also wasting this opportunity."
"Thank you very much."
"Mr President, entirely in line with the current international situation, the rapporteur, my fellow MEP Mr Brok, is of the opinion that the fight against international terrorism should become one of the European foreign and security policy' s core tasks."
"This task allocation allows me to draw the Council' s and Commission' s attention to the security situation in the Western Balkans and the Indonesian Archipelago."
"Further to a recently published scientific analysis of the question whether Bosnia might function as European base for Osama bin Laden' s terrorist network, I should like to find out from the Council and Commission whether they have any concrete indications that Bin Laden followers are indeed active in the Western section of the Balkans and if so, how the EU and its Member States, obviously in close cooperation with the US, intend to stand up to this dangerous destabilisation of that region."
"Furthermore, the Brok report calls for a continuation of the political dialogue with Indonesia."
"I expect the Council and Commission to constantly monitor the security situation on the Moluccas where Bin Laden followers are also conducting a jihad against indigenous Christians."
"Finally, I happily vote in favour of the amendment by Mr Gahler which states that the NATO and its extension on our continent are still vital as a guarantee for security across Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I know I am repeating what others have already said when I say that the tragic attacks of 11 September have changed the course of this century' s history for ever, but I feel that I can never stress enough how true this is, that the international Community is now faced with a crisis that is as great as it is unprecedented and unfamiliar, with rules and trends that not even the most experienced of political analysts is able to predict."
"However, at a time such as this, it is important for the European Union to show itself to be as, and more, united than before and as, and more, capable than before of reacting with one voice."
"At a time such as this, when all our worst fears are unexpectedly realised, we realise the importance of this Europe that we are integrating, the importance of being united and having coordinating structures able to operate in real time, of being able to think and act all together and in respect for all the positions."
"It is certainly true that we still have a long way to go: the common foreign and security policy is not yet operative and there are still complex issues to be ironed out in its operating mechanism, particularly in the area of national sovereignties, but we now need, more than ever before, to speed up our work."
"I therefore cannot fail to congratulate the rapporteur, the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, Mr Brok, on his report and on the priorities he has set for the forthcoming year in this area, particularly with regard to what - as we have been witnessing in recent months - will be the real challenge of the new millennium: preventing conflicts, finding a non-military solution to the crisis and, most importantly, combating terrorism."
"You see, the greater the possibility of seeing Europe united in terms of foreign policy, of making our foreign policy practical reality, the more successful Europe' s internal politics will be."
"Quite frankly, the acceleration of the euro, acceleration on the economic side of things, has not been matched by acceleration on the political front. Well then, there must be acceleration in political matters, and the foreign policy is crucial if that is to happen, particularly at this time."
"If we do this, we will achieve a stronger, more resilient Europe and a stronger euro, and we will certainly be able to take a better approach to enlargement and, moreover, to compete on equal terms with the dollar and NAFTA - Canada, the United States and Mexico - the Agreement as it stands, a market which already exists and already presents important political points of reference."
"We must act and we must be fully confident in what we are doing: the foreign policy will become vital in the short-term future, especially for the new generations."
"Mr President, Commissioner, if you would be good enough to take an interest in the debate, ladies and gentlemen, in our efforts to construct a common foreign and security policy we must not lose sight of the fact that, in the future, as in the present and the past, the European Union will certainly face the risk of its forces becoming involved in armed action."
"Let us not be under any illusion: if this were to happen, it would never be in a 'clean' war."
"No one is in a better position than a soldier to know that a war will always be 'dirty' and that, despite advances in technology, mankind will never be able to kill off all evil people just by pressing a button if only because it will find it impossible to tell the good from the bad with any degree of certainty."
"War will always be dirty and will always be an evil, but it could be 'the lesser of two evils' , if it is only embarked upon in the aim of achieving a political objective that cannot be achieved through any other means."
"To quote Clausewitz, 'War is only the continuation of politics by other means.'"
"It must, therefore, be ended as soon as its political objective is achieved and must not be embarked upon if there is no chance of achieving this objective."
"What is the objective of the war we have just embarked upon in Afghanistan?"
"Everyone can see that it is to enable the Afghan people to rid themselves of a regime that has proved its barbarity."
"This seems today to be not only desirable, but also possible."
"We are sensitive to the suffering that this war is inflicting on the population and hope, therefore, that this objective is achieved as quickly as possible."
"We must therefore understand that a halt to hostilities, even a temporary one, would only strengthen the position of the Taliban."
"Let us show ourselves to be capable, having learned from the unfortunate experience of the Gulf war, of seeing it through to the end, in other words, to the establishment in Kabul of a regime that is acceptable to all Afghans. Let us show that we are capable of ensuring that country' s gradual return to peace and stability."
"To this end, many of us hope that the European Union will give its support to the negotiations currently taking place under the auspices of the United Nations, between the former king, Zaher Shah and the opposition' s representative."
"I would have liked to hear the personal opinion of Commissioner Patten on this matter."
"I realise that he is not present to be able to give an answer, and so I ask you, Mr Lamy, whether you would be good enough to give us your personal reaction to this idea."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, Mr Haarder could not make it to this session, and so on behalf of the Liberal Group I would like to thank Mr Brok for a well-drafted report, and to congratulate him on this."
"The report is a good one, but it still fails to take the full measure of the profound change which has taken place in international politics following 11 September."
"We are still unable to grasp the full ramifications of this change; but we know that it is a very profound one."
"The representatives from the United States have stated that a second Cold War has begun, and some have even talked of a third World War."
"Here, in Europe, we have been wary of excessive dramatisation and have avoided using the word 'war' ."
"My personal view, however, is that, in time, history books will come to refer to this period as the Third World War."
"We must very carefully analyse what has happened and what is currently happening, and very prudently come to grips with those problems which are now facing us."
"We need a broad global perspective and grasp; we need something which, in English, can be called 'global governance'."
"Finally, there is the matter which I intended to mention in my own intervention. The progress achieved in the common foreign and security policy during the last few years has been based on the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Rapid advances have been made, particularly in crisis management."
"In the Treaty of Amsterdam we also took as our joint task the safeguarding of the Union's integrity and the maintenance of peace on its external frontiers."
"Up to now, no definite content has been given to these new treaty obligations."
"In the initial phase at any rate, the main question is probably this: how are the different geographical positions of the various Member States to be taken into account in sharing the burden and dividing the work among them?"
"From the point of view of the Union as a whole it may make sense for those Member States situated on its common external frontiers to direct their resources to the control and defence of these borders, and for them to take part in crisis management in a way which is in harmony with this primary task."
"I hope that debate will be initiated within the Commission and the Council on the practical implications of the provisions of the Treaty concerning the integrity of the Union and the safeguarding of its frontiers."
"Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I should like to join with other speakers in commending the excellent work of the rapporteur, my colleague Mr Brok."
"Any analysis of the evolution of the CFSP would regrettably have to conclude that the Maastricht Treaty sacrificed political integration to ensure economic integration and, as a consequence, undermine the EU's potential to be a major foreign policy player on the world stage."
"Nowhere was this more apparent than during the Bosnian crisis when there was significant disunity among Member States."
"Our mediation efforts were dogged by bad luck."
"It is also true to say we were ineffective peace-makers."
"We finished up as the United States' junior partner instead of an equal one."
"It seemed for a while that we had learned from this grim experience and there was a determined effort in the Treaty of Amsterdam to ensure more coherence in our common foreign and security policy approach."
"Although the end-result of the Treaty negotiations represented a step forward, they did not go far enough."
"However, I suppose we must be thankful that considerable progress was made at the Cologne, Faro and Helsinki Summits."
"Whatever institutional and other changes take place, there will never be real progress unless and until all Member States act and speak as one."
"The current situation in the wake of 11 September underlines this point."
"The EU had an opportunity to be an equal partner with the United States in responding to this crisis."
"Regrettably, the solo run by British Prime Minister Tony Blair has seriously undermined the EU's influence and our foreign policy strategy."
"This problem was further compounded by the decision of the UK, Germany and France to hold a mini-summit prior to the Ghent Council."
"If actions like this continue, either on the part of an individual Member State or a group of them, the EU's common foreign and security policy will be in tatters, despite the best efforts of Commissioner Patten and Mr Solana."
"Mr President, allow me to start by echoing the congratulations by my fellow MEPs for the excellent report that Mr Brok has presented again this year."
"However, I have to add that I am very interested to find out how the report would fare next year, for just when the common foreign and security policy is being further detailed, it is meeting with enormous new challenges."
"The events of 11 September and subsequent events greatly impact on that policy."
"They will put it to the test."
"It is too early to gain a complete overview of the new security framework and the new threat."
"However, we would like to ask the Council and Commission to produce an initial evaluation as soon as possible."
"This evaluation should also touch upon the question to what extent the pillar structure forms an obstruction to effective action in the new situation."
"External policy has become internal policy, and vice versa."
"The European Union is not sufficiently prepared for this at this time."
"Conflict prevention and crisis management have taken on a different aspect."
"Our approach is often still too regional and too geographic. Horizontal issues must now be thrown into the spotlight."
"Increasing use must be made of regional policy in an integrated manner to tackle terrorism and international organised crime which are interrelated in many ways."
"The guiding principle in this should be to help each other."
"Take countries such as Ukraine."
"They form part of the problem which we are now facing because the lack of transparency in countries such as those, forms the ideal breeding ground for all kinds of crimes, to put it mildly."
"We have too little control over this because we have not sufficiently developed this kind of cooperation."
"Maybe we have focused our attention too much on the Balkans."
"That region, too, is a source of security problems, but anyone who studies the 'map of evil' will realise that the new secondary routes of drugs, arms, illegal immigrants, etc. traverse the Slav Commonwealth."
"I am pleased that rapporteur Brok insists on a more effective implementation of EU strategies."
"There is more cause for this than ever before."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to echo the congratulations expressed by previous speakers and address just two points in Mr Brok's report."
"My first point concerns conflict prevention."
"The case of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia provides us with an example of unsuccessful conflict prevention."
"If all of the Members of the Council had worked as intensively as Members of this Parliament have for years to put pressure on all Macedonian governments finally to put an end to the discrimination of the Albanian citizens of that country, then we would not be facing the difficulties and problems which we are now."
"If this issue had played a part in the Stabilisation and Association Agreement then the Members of the Council would also have seen it as a precondition and the terrorists from Kosovo would not have had any support for their campaign in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"The Macedonians would not now be under pressure of time to change their constitution almost because of the success of the terrorist campaign, because they would have already done so."
"So much for our failure to prevent conflict in this country!"
"A second matter which is very important to me was addressed by Mr Brok."
"I think that the Stability Pact should finally mark the end of the conferences and quick start packages."
"The Stability Pact should be closely linked to the work of the Agency for Reconstruction and should perhaps be extended to the Agency for Reconstruction and Development in this region."
"For this reason, the Stability Pact should be incorporated in the Commission's remit; this is where all of the work has to be done in any case."
"We would then be able to avoid resources being wasted because of friction, we would be able to achieve synergies and we would be able to make progress on establishing real stability in the region."
"In this way, we would, for example, be able to foster significant and large-scale cooperation in the energy sector."
"We would be able to make progress on the free trade area in the region, on constructing transport infrastructure and on combating trafficking in human beings and other commodities."
"Many Commission officials will in any case very soon be unemployed because the enlargement negotiations in the Commission are as good as closed in some areas."
"Let us give these people something to work on. Let us hand over responsibility for the Stability Pact to those who can manage it and take it away from those who have in any case already begun to abandon it."
"Let us give the Stability Pact to the Commission and, perhaps, to one other wise man, Martti Ahtisaari, in addition, so that it really is a success for the entire region and for the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report under consideration states that the struggle against terrorism must become a central plank in the EU's foreign and security policy."
"What should this policy be?"
"September 11 revealed with one bang the prevailing error of the old security policy."
"A missile shield gives no defence against terrorism - I said this the night before at the meeting of our committee - nor can justice be created with weapons; at times, perhaps, it may be possible to put a stop to the perpetration of injustice."
"But we are so vulnerable that we are dependent on one another."
"The benefit of each depends on that of all others."
"I propose that a new fundamental policy line of dependency be created for the Union, both at the United Nations and at the WTO (concerning which we were speaking) and also within the Union."
"Internal and external security policy must be connected; the difference between them, after all, has disappeared."
"In this policy of dependency, we will use, in the first instance, social workers instead of soldiers; nurses instead of bombs; and teachers instead of missiles."
"The more people and nations receive justice, the less terrorism will be generated; this is something which we all know."
"I therefore ask the Commission to shape a clear fundamental policy line of dependency for all fields."
"We must get away from armed security, this hangover from the cold war."
"Who could sleep peacefully with bombs under the bed?"
"Mr President, there has only been one victim of this afternoon' s emergency drill and that is the answer to the question Mr Morillon asked the Commission, to which the Commission must, of course, reply!"
"I shall, therefore, try to play the role of nurse, by answering, at least in part, Mr Morillon' s question, which concerns the role of the King in a future Afghan government."
"The Northern Alliance, as its name suggests, is composed of various ethnic groups from Northern Afghanistan."
"It clearly does not represent the Pashtuns, who account for half of the Afghan population and it goes without saying, therefore, that a government formed or dominated by the Northern Alliance would not meet the criterion of being representative, any more than the Taliban government does, not to mention neighbouring Pakistan' s position on the Northern Alliance, with which we are all familiar."
"We feel that the objective is, therefore, to bring together, in a government, sufficiently representative groups, with the support of Afghanistan' s neighbours."
"The King' s role, if he is to have one, must, in my opinion, be considered with this objective in mind."
"This, Mr Morillon, is basically all I can say on the subject."
"I admit that it does not provide a completely adequate answer to your question and I shall ensure that you are given a more precise answer tomorrow."
"Commissioner, I asked you whether you might consider my idea, which is that the Stability Pact should be linked to the Agency for reconstruction and development and, in particular, to the work of the Commission, which, very soon, will have enough staff to be able to undertake the work."
"I am sorry; I thought this was a suggestion and not a question."
"I am not going to comment on this point."
"You are probably aware that there are various ideas about the way in which the Growth and Stability Pact should be managed."
"This is part of a network of institutions set up a few years ago, probably in conditions where concern for total coherence did not prevail."
"We can probably do better in the future."
"I agree with you, Mrs Pack, that the European Agency for Reconstruction in Kosovo has done a good job and I think that everyone would recognise that."
"The links between the Stability Pact, the Agency and the action undertaken by my colleague, Mr Patten will probably, at the right time, be open to suggestion."
"It remains to be seen whether these suggestions will emanate from the Council or from the Commission."
"On this point, I reserve the position of the Commission."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 10.00 a.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.45 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"Turkey"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following two reports:"
"(A5-0343/2001) by Alain Lamassoure, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the 2000 Regular Report from the Commission on Turkey' s progress towards accession (COM(2000) 713 - C5-0613/2000 - 2000/2014(COS));"
"(A5-0338/2001) by Alain Lamassoure, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council regulation on pre-accession financial assistance for Turkey (COM(2001)230 - C5-0219/2001 - 2001/0097(CNS))."
"Mr President, since the last resolution adopted last November on the basis of the report by Philippe Morillon, which I welcome, Turkey has been through a year of great contrasts: it was a black year in terms of the economy, a tense year politically, and a year of progress, though unequal progress, in terms of the pre-accession process."
"On the one hand, we should welcome the real advances."
"Given the very serious financial crisis in Turkey since the beginning of the year, the government has had to play by ear."
"At the instigation of Mr Dervis, a radical stabilisation and recovery plan was signed by the three coalition government partners."
"It came into operation in the spring, under relatively satisfactory conditions, which have made it possible to undertake basic reforms, which had been put off for too long, and, more generally, to establish a healthier relationship between politics and the economy."
"In the short term, however, one of its unavoidable effects has been a severe drop in GDP, of 8% this year, which may have serious social consequences."
"The worsening of world economic conditions, both before and after 11 September, can, unfortunately, only make efforts to recover more difficult."
"During 2001, Turkey has been genuinely committed to a process of bringing itself closer to European democratic standards."
"We should welcome the fact that, at a particularly difficult economic time, a large part of government and parliamentary activity has been devoted to basic reforms linked to this European process."
"In March, the government presented its national programme for the adoption of the acquis."
"It is true that this first list of reforms is still vague as to the timetable for implementation and the exact scope of the proposed measures. However, since September, the Grand National Assembly has begun to consider several dozen - around 34 - constitutional amendments, the first half of which were adopted at the beginning of October."
"The results still lag behind current democratic standards: the death penalty has not been totally abolished, the non-Turkish languages are no longer banned, but are not fully recognised, the National Security Council remains, but civilians play a more significant part within it."
"Above all, most regrettably, the principle of the supremacy of international law - and thus, possibly, in the near future, of European law - over national law has been expressly ruled out."
"Undeniable progress has nonetheless been made, which the European Commission and the Council of Europe have welcomed as such."
"Furthermore, on 8 October, the government tabled a second legislative package of rights and freedoms, which relate to the penal code and penal procedure and the laws on anti-terrorism, the press, political parties, associations and demonstrations."
"The third advance outside parliament was that this summer saw the beginnings of a public debate on the taboo subject of the role of the military in political life."
"Finally, I would also like to highlight President Sezer' s courage in denouncing corruption, an endemic disease of Turkish society, and in using his legislative veto against texts which represented a step backwards for democracy."
"Because there are also delays and even retreats."
"In the political sphere, the year was marked by dramatic events in Turkish prisons."
"I will leave it to Mr Daniel Cohn-Bendit, who chaired the parliamentary committee which visited Turkish prisons, to express our views on this subject in a moment."
"The draft reform of the audiovisual legislation was rightly criticised by the president of the republic, since it did not comply with the principle of the independence of the audiovisual sector in relation to the political powers."
"The dissolution of the main opposition party (the Virtue Party) demonstrated that the political system has not stabilised and that changes in the law regarding the status of political parties are required as a matter of urgency."
"In general, a gulf persists between good intentions and reality in the human rights field, where progress is too slow: the torture and degrading treatment of detainees continues to be widespread, freedom of expression is still unusually restricted and several thousand people currently in prison for offences would, under our laws, be considered prisoners of conscience."
"The main groups working to defend human rights remain subject to what amounts to legal harassment."
"In the South-East, the end of armed terrorism by the PKK has not yet been turned to account in embarking on an overall policy towards the south-east provinces and Kurdish identity, and, likewise, the unambiguous European Court of Human Rights judgment has not been used as an opportunity to set free Leyla Zana and the other former parliamentarians from the Democratic People' s Party (HADEP) who are still in prison."
"Finally, since the consideration of the Poos report by Parliament, we have seen Mr Denktash' s surprising refusal to restart the negotiations proposed by Commissioner Verheugen, which I welcome, and the UN Secretary-General on the status of Cyprus."
"And we note that Turkey continues to block the draft agreement between the European Union and NATO, a draft which is all the more urgent given current international tension."
"In this area, as in others, the impression remains that the signs of openness which are, on occasion, expressed by governmental authorities, may be challenged by military powers, which still have an unusual influence on Turkish politics."
"Since our resolution of 15 November 2000, which is cited in our current motion for a resolution, our Turkish partners have been aware of the importance our Parliament attaches to the official recognition of the Armenian genocide."
"We hope that the processes of dialogue, such as those which bring together former diplomats and academics from Armenia and Turkey, will lead to a common understanding based on scientifically-recognised historical facts."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the coming year will be crucial in testing the real desire of Turkish political leaders and Turkish society as a whole to move closer to the European Union."
"Over the coming weeks it will be possible to gauge the exact scope of the constitutional and legislative reforms regarding the rule of law."
"Coming months will be vital in judging efforts to modernise the economy."
"Finally, on the crucial issue of the status of Cyprus, after 27 years of political deadlock, the moment of truth extends from now until autumn 2002."
"The end of negotiations on Cyprus' s accession to the EU are set for that date, and this will make it necessary, finally, for both parties to adopt a clear position."
"Our judgment will be based on the facts."
"Turkey wishes to have its own models for society and democracy."
"This is a perfectly legitimate objective."
"The European Union does not impose one single model."
"On the contrary, its special achievement lies in bringing about the coexistence and collaboration of peoples who have had very different histories, for a long time mutually hostile, and who, on occasion, have very different ideas on fundamental subjects such as the organisation of society, changing moral values, relations between religion and politics, the status of minority communities or races and the application of the subsidiarity principle."
"But there are two needs which we all acknowledge."
"First of all, that there are universal values which make it necessary that fundamental human and democratic rights are guaranteed in the same way everywhere; secondly, that the models conceived in previous centuries must be adjusted to the needs of this one."
"European integration is a way of helping one another to comply with these requirements and to preserve our special qualities in an exciting and dangerous world."
"Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, I should like to comment on the issues which relate to women's rights in Turkey, to which the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy has paid too little attention."
"Allow me, therefore, to point out that very little progress has been made with women's rights in Turkey, rights which we, the Committee, consider to be a sine qua non to the integration of Turkey into the European Union, because women's rights are human rights."
"I understand that the Turkish National Assembly started a debate today on the reform of the Civil Code, numerous articles of which infringe the United Nations convention on abolishing all forms of discrimination against women, despite Turkey's having ratified the convention."
"I trust parliament will pass this bill, as adopted by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs in June."
"However, the crucial question which arises is whether the law will also apply to existing families because, unfortunately, the Justice Committee submitted an amendment exempting existing families at the last minute."
"It is quite unacceptable to introduce changes to the Civil Code that only apply to future generations and I know that women's organisations in Turkey have expressed their total opposition to this."
"The national programme for integration into the European Union talks of revising the constitution so as to guarantee sexual equality; however, there are no plans, whatsoever, to adopt positive measures which, as the women's organisations have pointed out, would allow all the laws which institutionalise discrimination against women to be amended."
"As far as women's right to work is concerned, I should like to highlight both the high rate of unemployment among women - 39.6% and even higher in agricultural areas - and the limited number of women who benefit from national insurance."
"I should like to call on Turkey to abolish all forms of discrimination against women and I should, of course, like to call on Europe to provide the economic and technical assistance needed to put this into practice."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mr Lamassoure for his report, in which he also points out that, as a Member of NATO, Turkey is a very significant partner particularly at this time."
"Despite all of the criticism which we have rightly voiced in the past and still do today, in respect of the constitution and human rights, we have to say that, compared with most of its neighbours, Turkey is a country which is exceptionally pro-western, democratic and respectful of human rights."
"Everything is relative and must be seen in its context."
"We also have to recognise that progress has been made in a number of areas and that, despite the severe economic problems which Turkey is currently experiencing, it is still attempting, by amending its constitution and changing the composition of its security committee, to ensure that the civilian political forces are given more powers to act in more areas."
"We will have to check to see whether all of this is sufficient."
"Commissioner, you will have to help us to respect the Copenhagen Criteria."
"The Copenhagen Criteria explicitly state that we need to see developments on the political aspects for accession negotiations even to be justified."
"We will have to assess this on a case-by-case basis."
"If further negotiations get underway we will also have to answer the question of whether Turkey is in a position to meet the conditions of the European internal market."
"At this stage, I should like to mention just two points, which will provide a tangible touchstone as the European Union embarks on this very complex development against the background of a very dangerous situation for security policy."
"Personally, I cannot understand why Turkey refuses to seek a compromise under the European security and defence policy over the issue of the conditions under which it will be involved and what kind of cooperation there will be with NATO."
"For me this is a test case."
"We should not allow there to be any blackmail on this issue."
"I believe that there has to be a willingness to accept a compromise which was negotiated in Budapest and blocked by the military."
"Surely we should now be in a position to find our way back to these criteria and agree on them."
"The second point concerns what should be done about Cyprus."
"Is Turkey prepared to seek a constructive solution in Cyprus?"
"If a solution is not possible, how will it react when the European Union enlarges?"
"I believe that these are two very tangible issues on the basis of which Turkey's credibility can be judged."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Mr Lamassoure on his report."
"It is a very good report."
"Some people think that it is too soft."
"I do not believe that it is too soft; it simply uses a language which leaves the way open for a dialogue with Turkey and we want to enter into this dialogue."
"There are a number of hard points, however, which we need to discuss with Turkey, and certainly there is still a need to discuss the issue of human rights, in particular."
"It has been mentioned that people are in prison who should not be, first and foremost Leyla Zana."
"Turkey could and should, particularly in the light of rulings made by the European courts, ensure that they are released without delay."
"On the issue of Kurdish rights too, much remains to be done."
"It is obvious that the language, which, thanks to constitutional amendments, can now be used, should also be employed in the official media as soon as possible."
"The state of emergency could then be lifted relatively quickly in the provinces in which it is still in force."
"The constitutional amendments which Turkey has made are positive steps."
"We definitely wish to take note of them."
"However, now it is a question, firstly, of removing the constraints still connected to them, for example the death penalty, and, of course, of ensuring that the constitutional amendments are also implemented."
"A major task for Turkey is to do this in the very near future."
"On the subject of time, I should like to come back to an idea which I put forward when I had the honour of drawing up a report for this Parliament comprising a road map or timetable, and that is why tomorrow we will also be proposing that Turkey, itself, should table a timetable next year showing how it intends to meet the political Copenhagen criterion."
"Satisfaction of this political criterion is the precondition for our also being able to negotiate with Turkey."
"After all, this is the aim of the whole exercise, of which this report is also a part."
"I should also, however, like to address two points, which continue to be crucial for relations between the European Union and Turkey."
"The first point is Turkey's assistance in shaping an active and efficient external security policy."
"We know that at the end of the day this also presupposes that we are able to use NATO resources and this is still a stumbling block for Turkey."
"Turkey needs to know that this is damaging its prospects."
"The final problem is Cyprus."
"Here, too, I should like to say quite clearly that it is important to resolve the Cyprus problem, firstly, for the Turkish population of Cyprus and secondly, and undoubtedly, for the Greek population of Cyprus, the whole of Europe and Turkey itself."
"Turkey simply has not realised this."
"I would stress something which I have said repeatedly in the past: Turkey's path to the European Union is via Cyprus."
"Its assistance with resolving the Cyprus issue is not a precondition for our accepting Cyprus into the European Union, but it would be a basis on which we could enter into serious discussions about Turkey's membership of the European Union."
"Mr President, the Liberal Group welcomes Mr Lamassoure's report, which we find balanced and thoroughly informed."
"It will be closely studied in Turkey, where the reformers will find much to encourage them in their efforts to bring Turkey forward on the track of modernisation, liberalisation, full respect for fundamental rights and social and economic progress."
"So far the majorities in the Grand National Assembly for reform are great, but could I urge our colleagues inside the Turkish parliament to respond to this report in a truly parliamentary fashion?"
"Why not pass a resolution calling for their government fully to respect the rulings of all the international courts, including the European Court of Human Rights here in Strasbourg?"
"Why not pass a resolution supporting the setting up of the Rapid Reaction Force and why not pass a resolution to bring pressure to bear upon Mr Denktash to work towards the integration of Turkish Cypriots into the European Union?"
"Such reciprocity between our two parliaments would demonstrate, in a dramatic way, that Turkey is truly advancing upon its European journey."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the interpreters for being here in greater numbers than us to translate this very important debate which is being held at such a late hour."
"Yes, Mr Pasqua, you will have the right to speak. That will be very interesting."
"It is not late. It is the morning for you."
"As you know, in any event our political leanings vary from morning till night. So there is no problem."
"I would like to say, not to repeat what we have said amongst ourselves since Mr Lamassoure began his report, that it is actually not only a well-packaged report, but also one which rightly says things clearly, being wise and measured. It is also based on a high degree of consensus, since Mr Lamassoure has really tried to bring together all the opinions in this House."
"One thing is clear: Turkey is trying to make reforms, Turkey is making efforts, but, nevertheless, things are moving very, very slowly."
"And things are moving very slowly not out of wickedness but because of the fact that democratic culture, the culture of openness, is not a culture which, in a still very authoritarian society, has been imposed on the behaviour of all parties; on the behaviour of governors, on the behaviour of certain political forces or on the behaviour of the military."
"Our role as the European Union is not, therefore, simply to give lessons, but, rather, to accompany Turkey on the journey towards democracy, in other words, to have positions to defend."
"And that is why I will make a comment, and I would ask all those who still wish to tell Turkey that there was a genocide seventy-five years ago - which is true - in what way does that help the debate in Turkey today?"
"I do not think that that helps it."
"So, what we have in today' s resolution, in this report, is the possibility of holding a genuine, heated dialogue with Turkish society, with the Turkish government, on our notion of democracy, on the notion of freedoms, on our notion of the enlargement of Europe, and, therefore, of the place that Cyprus can and must hold within Europe, and the place which Turkey can and should hold in this process."
"I think we should be clear, however."
"This evolution will perhaps be more discouraging at some times than at others."
"The European Parliament, the societies of the Member States of the European Union, will not show indefinite patience if the situation does not appear to be improving."
"I would therefore like to end by appealing to the Turkish parliamentarians up there in the gallery, and say to them that if they really want the Turkey which they love and govern today to join the European Union, they must be aware that the efforts which our notion of democracy requires of Turkey are efforts which go beyond what is being undertaken at the moment by the Turkish Grand Assembly."
"They are efforts which go beyond what seems acceptable to the Turkish military."
"If they do not go further, our future will perhaps not be a common one, which would be a shame."
"Mr President, I think it important that we send two clear messages today."
"The first must be that we want Turkey as a member of the EU and as a member of the European family."
"It will be good for Turkey, but it will also be good for ourselves."
"The second message must be that Turkey is faced with a number of tasks, including that of being honest about its history and its genocide of one and a half million Armenians, half a million Assyrians, Chaldeans and Syrians and several hundred thousand Greeks."
"In addition, there are the tasks - not only on paper but also in practice and in the real world - of improving the conditions in Turkish prisons, ceasing to keep prisoners in solitary confinement, guaranteeing the rights of minorities and ensuring democratic progress not only for minorities but, I would emphasise, for the whole of the Turkish people."
"There are the tasks of completely abolishing the death penalty and of getting the political process under way that is necessary if political life in the Turkish state is to be democratised."
"I have read my fellow MEP' s, Mr Lamassoure' s, report very carefully."
"I have to say that he is very diplomatic."
"I think the report is excellent, but I also think it needs to be more precise on a number of points, and a number of amendments have, therefore, also been tabled, not only by my group but also by other groups, and I believe that most of them must be supported."
"There is a single exception."
"I do not think that the EU should interfere in the matter of where Turkey has embassies."
"However, I also think that the report is sound, and I shall recommend voting in favour of it, but also, of course, in favour of the amendments tabled by, for example, my group."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I have listened carefully to Mr Lamassoure and the Members who have just spoken."
"I will surprise nobody by reminding you of the position of the French delegation of my group."
"I have tried in vain to understand why the majority of this House have an absolute desire for Turkey to join the European Union."
"For a start, most of the territory of Turkey is not in Europe."
"You have decided to urge her to join us."
"In reality, this decision has but one justification, which Mr Brok has just confirmed, and that is that Turkey belongs to NATO, and that it is therefore desirable for there to be a certain resemblance between the European Union, as some people imagine it, and NATO."
"I have just listened to what Mr Lamassoure said, and what he said in his report, which was full of reservations, of observations which should lead us to ask questions, and while I believe that we should be careful about trying to promote or impose our institutional system or our value system, which is too often our tendency, there are naturally things which are not acceptable."
"And it is true that while we are perfectly aware of the difficulties faced by Turkey as a result of the presence of Islamic fundamentalist elements on their territory, which are a danger, which require certain measures to be taken, at the same time we must accept that, in terms of democratic principles, the journey they have to make is still, to say the least, very long."
"And besides, many of you have said so before me."
"But I will add something else. What I do not understand, even though a certain number of countries have, unanimously in some cases, such as France, condemned the genocide suffered by the Armenians, is why the current Turkish government and Turkish people, who are not responsible for the past, but who are responsible for a collective history, are determined not to accept responsibility for that genocide."
"Other countries which have been responsible for genocides have been better able to accept their responsibilities."
"I think it is justifiable, here and now, to ask them to do the same."
"In any event, as long as it has not been recognised, as far as we are concerned, we will remain firmly opposed to Turkey' s entry into the European Union."
"Mr President, earlier this month, a leading Dutch newspaper sported the following front-page headline: 'As terrorists we can go about our own business in Europe' ."
"Could this be an arresting and, therefore, not very truthful headline?"
"Not really, for the enlightening interview with an anonymous member of the extreme-left terrorist movement, Dev Sol, was in total agreement with this disconcerting title."
"The outspoken Turkish terrorist left the reader in no doubt as to the fact that his organisation makes full use of the EU' s territory as their base of operation for their murderous actions against the Turkish state and as a willing reservoir of funds, as and when required."
"'For in Europe, anything is possible' , the man simply declared. And should Europe be serious about fighting terrorism, then action will also be taken here, he threatened."
"Mr Lamassoure hardly touches upon this highly topical and acute problem in his report. Despite this, it has been Turkey' s criticism of the EU Member States for years."
"The rapporteur' s appreciation, expressed in Paragraph 29, of the Turkish contribution to the fight against international terrorism counts for very little in this."
"About terrorism in Turkey, the Lamassoure report concludes in recital G ""that Turkey has largely overcome the difficulties posed by various forms of terrorism in the past"" ."
"I should like to find out from the Council and the Commission whether they share this, in my view, far too rash, conclusion."
"Official Turkish sources produce very different noises."
"These are voices which, following the satanic terrorist attacks on the US, have gained a great deal of support."
"They express the feelings of authorities that are deeply hurt."
"For years, they could not even count on European solidarity in their bloody fight against Turkish terrorist organisations. Quite the reverse, in fact."
"EU Member States offered, and still offer, the activists of those movements shelter. And while the Ankara authorities condemn the West' s specific policy of tolerance, this time round, Turkey is allowed to take part in the international coalition against terrorism."
"After the memorable date of Tuesday, 11 September, Turkey considers that the time has come for the European Union and its Member States finally to issue effective anti-terrorist measures."
"In specific terms, this translates into meeting Turkish requests to extradite Turkish terrorists instead of offering them asylum or a residence permit."
"The European Union and its Member States should, at long last, recognise the permanent internal and external threat to the Republic of Turkey."
"The double standards applied by the Europeans should, at least from the Turkish angle, come to a definite end."
"The EU' s emphasis on human rights in Turkey coinciding with the fact that it turns a blind eye to the fight against international terrorism is unacceptable."
"At least, this is the Turkish point of view."
"Is this harsh criticism levelled by Turkey at Europe justified?"
"It is a fact that various violent groupings of Turkish origin maintain organisational structures in EU Member States."
"Certainly after 11 September, it is more difficult for Brussels and the capitals of the EU countries to ignore this in silence."
"How do the Council and the Commission intend to cooperate with Turkey, a country which has, after all, formally acquired candidate country status, in future in the fight against international terrorism?"
"Indeed, there is no shortage of legal and political pitfalls."
"The far from gentle criticism levelled at the Lamassoure report speaks for itself."
"Despite this, the progress of Turkey' s accession to the European Union will also depend on Europe' s reaction to Turkey' s 'open flank' , also known as the country' s Achilles' heel for terrorist attacks."
"Mr President, I would not like to miss this opportunity to join the other Members, with knowledge of the subject, in complimenting Mr Alain Lamassoure on the quality of his report."
"I say 'with knowledge of the subject' because I know how passionate the debates on this subject have been over the last two years or more."
"I would like to expand on just two points of the report, which have already been mentioned by Mr Brok and others."
"The first relates to the geostrategic importance of Turkey, which has certainly increased as a result of the events which have just taken place and by the European Union' s realisation of the need to enter into a coalition to combat Islamic fundamentalist terrorism."
"To this end, I would like to say to our Turkish colleagues who are in the gallery, how in vain it would be, to fear that European defence might develop in competition, in parallel, and therefore redundantly, with defence based on the Atlantic Alliance."
"European defence is based on the Atlantic Alliance and it will continue in that direction, quite simply because Europe would not have the means to do otherwise."
"My second comment concerns Cyprus."
"It has been said that the resolution of the Cypriot problem is one of the conditions, in my view a prior condition, of any possible decision on the entry of Turkey into the Union."
"I do not believe that the Turkish populations in Cyprus are really in danger today and I believe it would be a very important gesture for Turkey to accept, as a first step, during the current negotiations, a reduction in the number of its armed forces in Cyprus, or even better, their evacuation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I should, of course, also like to congratulate my colleague, Mr Lamassoure, on his success in drafting a good report."
"I am saying this, above all, because in Turkey, I often come across people making a certain assertion: those in Turkey who repeatedly accuse the European Parliament of being hostile to Turkey will now have to admit yet again that this assertion is not true."
"Like the report of my colleague, Mr Swoboda, this report, too, is an objective opinion on the situation in Turkey."
"As the rapporteur states, the flurry of legislative activity in the Turkish Parliament to reform the constitution really is laudable."
"Given the current constraints in Turkey, our Turkish colleagues, some of whom are also here today amongst us, have really been very successful."
"Now, however, they are asked to continue the work which they have begun."
"The Ministries for Home Affairs and Justice in the Turkish Republic play an important role in this area."
"The long-awaited implementation of the reform is urgently necessary, particularly now after 11 September, but also in spite of 11 September."
"It is easy to ascertain through the Turkish media that people are still being tortured in some police stations."
"There are still strange cases of people committing suicide while in police custody."
"For as long as this kind of thing continues to happen in Turkey, and, for as long as Turkey is not prepared to meet the Copenhagen Criteria, there will obviously be no date for the start of accession negotiations and Turkey will remain the only country, out of 13 countries with candidate status, not to have started negotiating."
"I hope that this last report will motivate those responsible in Turkey to move forward and, not only to talk about reforms, but also to really implement them."
"Mr President, this very good report shows Turkey is making progress towards Europe, but more is needed."
"For instance, 19 people are being prosecuted for insulting state officials because they attended a conference at which victims who had suffered torture in the form of rape in custody spoke out against their tormenters."
"It is not only women to whom this happens."
"It is clearly outrageous that the state should condemn the victims, rather than their aggressors."
"I call on the Turkish authorities to drop these shameful prosecutions."
"Secondly, I want to urge the Turkish government to take an initiative towards a political settlement with the Kurds."
"The PKK have observed the cease-fire for over two years."
"Its leader, Abdullah Ocalan, is appealing to the European Court of Human Rights against the unfairness of his trial."
"It is time to launch peace negotiations."
"Finally, now is not the time to eject 80 000 Kurds, breach environmental standards and human rights, in order to construct the Ilisu dam."
"It must not be built and EU governments, such as the UK government, must not grant export credit."
"Mr President, what efforts has the Turkish government made since the Helsinki Summit to guarantee human and fundamental rights, to find a peaceful solution to the Kurdish issue and to abolish the death penalty?"
"The latest amendment to the Turkish constitution does not go far enough."
"The death penalty has only been partially abolished and the Kurdish language has not been recognised."
"Is this a genuine reform?"
"I would answer, no."
"Turkey must not be given any special treatment in the enlargement process."
"I think that we run the risk of giving in to Turkey's wishes if we adopt the Lamassoure report as it stands."
"The report is guarded on a number of issues so that we leave Turkey room for manoeuvre."
"We must insist that a political solution be found to the Kurdish issue and that human and fundamental rights be guaranteed."
"The time is right for sweeping reforms."
"In my conversations with people on my trips to Turkey they have repeatedly expressed a wish for peace, brotherliness and freedom."
"I, too, carry this message in my heart and will also do all I can in the future so that one day this wish will come true."
"Mr President, I, too, should like to take my turn in congratulating the rapporteur Mr Lamassoure on his recent effort to draft as objective and balanced a report as possible on Turkey's progress towards accession to the European Union, a task rendered all the more difficult by the particular nature of this country's problems in various sectors of special interest to Parliament, such as its record on human and minority rights, its democratic principles, its international conduct, its refusal to admit to tragic historic events and so on."
"Having said which, I think that, thanks to certain amendments approved by the rapporteur and despite certain other amendments dictated by the policy of expediency, the final report which has taken shape is generally acceptable, even to the official Turkish side."
"And, of course, we all know what that means, we just have to make allowances for the usual abusive response by the Turkish foreign secretary towards the honourable Mr Poos and his report, which is seen as negative towards Turkey."
"So all that remains is to ascertain the extent to which Turkey will basically respond to the good will and to the spirit which dominates the report, by which I mean the spirit of constructive criticism of numerous Turkish shortcomings, the deliberately indirect reference to the continuing Turkish military occupation of Cyprus, which is unacceptable in a civilised society, the fact that previous Turkish crimes, such as the genocide of the Armenians, have been passed over in silence, contrasting with praise for any minor progress made by Turkey or any circumstantial compliance by Turkey with its contractual obligations, such as Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty."
"Time will tell if Turkey recognises and appreciates these well-meant messages, although I fear that experience to date does not give us cause to be optimistic that we shall soon have a clear response from Turkey to the effect that it really is prepared to prove itself worthy of its candidate status and of integration into the European Union."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Lamassoure report maintains that Turkey has a right to become a member of the European Union."
"That is its basic message."
"I, for my part, believe that membership is not just Turkey's right, it is vital to the country."
"Historically speaking, Turkey has made an admirable effort to move towards Europe."
"An effort which started not today but a long time ago."
"Turkey's efforts to modernise started at the end of the nineteenth century."
"We Greeks, as Turkey's neighbours and 'historic adversaries' , if I may put it thus, know this better than anyone else."
"We know from our own experience how difficult it is move forward from a tradition of eastern despotism towards a modern society."
"Turkey has a particularly long tradition in this respect because it was at the top of the pyramid of despotism in our region."
"Turkey suffered the historical accident of basically coming out unscathed - not unscathed as such, because it suffered a great deal - but it was not defeated in either the First or the Second World War."
"Sometimes it is better to lose than to win a war."
"We must not forget that France and Germany, the mainstays of the European Union, were both defeated, one at the beginning and the other at the end of the Second World War and I think that they learned that armed force and confrontation are not the way to survive in today's world."
"The disaster on the 11 September has taught us, I think, that today's world needs reconciliation in order to survive, by which I do not of course mean reconciliation with the terrorists, I mean reconciling tensions between us, precisely in order to isolate terrorists and establish a safe and fair world."
"Turkey is a third world European country which needs to learn the same lesson as France and Germany, that is, that if we want to move on, we have to stop waging the wars of the 1920s or the wars of the 1940s in the present day."
"I think that Turkey has built up an internal mechanism and a system of external relations which is dominated by the idea of authority and it uses this to tyrannise its people - witness the terrible story of prisoners' suicides and much else besides."
"Of course, the move which Turkey has to make is a difficult one."
"But it is trying to make it and we must help it and our reception of it in the European Union must be commensurate with its efforts to move towards us."
"Mr President, the report acknowledges certain obvious truths."
"That is a fact."
"However, at the same time it makes findings which have no bearing on reality."
"It sees progress where there is none, it extols the famous 'national programme' and a number of individual reforms which, basically, do no more than pull the wool over the eyes of the world in order to conceal the continuing and, from certain sides, the worsening situation for the working classes."
"We warned that the decision taken in Helsinki would help not to democratise but to embolden the regime."
"The army is still the determining factor in political life."
"The grass-roots movement is being dealt with in the crudest fashion."
"Arrests, over 10 000 political prisoners, torture chambers, murders, inhumane conditions in prisons, which are extolled in the report, are on the agenda."
"The hunger strikers have been fighting to the death now for 370 days and dozens have already died."
"The death penalty has only been abolished for criminal prisoners, not for people fighting for democracy and freedom."
"The report calls these fighters extremists and the Turkish state calls them terrorists, while the Kurds are deprived of fundamental rights, the occupying forces remain in Cyprus after their barbaric invasion 27 years ago and the report says not a word."
"However, the key point of the report is Paragraph 29, which extols Turkey's contribution to the fight against terrorism, clearly dismissing the Kurdish fighters, and its peace-brokering efforts in the Balkans, obviously meaning its open support for the KLA criminals, and it incites it to facilitate the application of the ÍÁÔÏ treaty."
"Allow me to finish by saying that my brotherly love towards and solidarity with the Turkish people prevent me from voting in favour of this report."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, I think I was right to take my headphones off relatively early on."
"It spared me somewhat."
"Mr Lamassoure has submitted an excellent report, as numerous Members have said."
"I should like to qualify the report as a fair report, because I think that Turkey, like every other candidate, is entitled to a fair report, meaning that we duly address all the shortcomings, but we also acknowledge any progress made."
"I should like to call on our Turkish counterparts and the Turkish people to take note of the report as a whole and not just selectively, just as we are making an effort to take note of all the developments in Turkey."
"Finally, I take the view that a Turkey that has made a start on fulfilling the Copenhagen criteria is preferable to a Turkey which has not made a start on fulfilling the Copenhagen criteria."
"It is a Turkey that is motivating the forces trying to overcome the unacceptable shortcomings still remaining within the country in relation to the political criteria."
"It is not in a position to expect political discounts."
"We do, of course, realise that we rightly wish that all Muslim countries in the world were structured like Turkey and that we would then have fewer problems, especially in the light of 11 September."
"But this discount does not mean turning a blind eye when it comes to the candidate countries."
"On the other hand, however, Turkey is also entitled not to have any additional conditions imposed."
"For example, I think that Mr Lamassoure has chosen exactly the right wording for the point on Armenia."
"Having expressly referred to the genocide last year, we note this year that things are clearly moving in the right direction."
"We realise that people are getting together to talk about the past."
"My own country found this a very worthwhile exercise and I think that this is an approach which we should support in this specific case, so that good neighbourly relations can develop in the future between Turkey and Armenia."
"Mr President, I, too, agree that not-insignificant progress has been made, and not just in terms of the Copenhagen criteria - a rather cold, aristocratic expression which conjures up an image of this Europe that always wants to be seen as a model of democracy."
"I am thinking, rather, of the extremely tangible progress made in the field of honesty: the courage and honesty of a President who is able to condemn the corruption present in his own country."
"However, we would be wronging Turkey if we did not make things absolutely clear to her - being clear, not hypocritical - and being clear means telling her that a great deal remains to be done in terms of democratic civilisation and behaviour, and that means reforms."
"In this sense, the ability to implement political and social reforms benefiting the Kurdish minority is a highly effective parameter."
"It is true and important that the Turkish Constitution intends to remove some of the restrictions placed on the use of the Kurdish language but, Mr President, I am appalled by this idea of partial removal of restrictions: the idea of partial removal of restrictions applied to a fundamental right such as the use of one' s own language is a quite horrific contradiction in terms."
"I am also appalled by the fact that only a cultural right is being recognised to a minority that does not enjoy even the most basic political and social rights."
"Mr President, we expect Turkey to show signs of cooperation, and a sign in precisely this area - addressing this long-standing dispute with the Kurdish people with courage and tolerance, in a tolerant, civilised manner - would be very well received by the entire European Parliament."
"Mr President, I would also like to pay tribute to Mr Lamassoure's excellent work as rapporteur."
"Although I have been a constant critic of Turkey's human rights record and its treatment of the Kurds, I also strongly support the decision of the 1999 Helsinki European Council to recognise Turkey as an candidate country."
"I do not agree with those who believe the boundaries of Europe should be narrow and exclusively Christian."
"I want to see a pluralistic Europe."
"I have always believed that Turkey could be a very important bridge-head between the current Members of the EU and the Islamic world."
"This would facilitate greater understanding and mutual respect."
"It is especially important in the changed world that exists after 11 September."
"However, Turkey still has a long way to go."
"In last year's annual assessment report the Commission concluded that, although a wide-ranging debate on political reforms had begun and Turkey had signed several international human rights instruments over the past year, the situation on the ground had hardly improved."
"Let us hope that the publication of next month's annual report will show significant improvement."
"In this context, I welcome the recent decision by the Turkish parliament to adopt a constitutional reform package to bring Turkey further in line with the acquis communautaire."
"At the launch of the EU-Turkish Foundation of 17 October, Commissioner Verheugen said that these reforms are a significant step towards better protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Turkey."
"It is clear that continued support for a closer EU-Turkey relationship, including eventual accession, is the best way to accelerate political reform and progress in human rights."
"However, the timetable for possible accession lies in Turkish hands alone."
"Negotiations can only begin when Turkey fulfils the Copenhagen criteria."
"It must strive harder to fulfil its obligations in that regard."
"Mr President, I think that this debate, once again, underlines the fact that we all share the same premise: that it is imperative that we, in the European Union, should have increasingly close relations with Turkey, until the opportunity arises, when the time is right, that it should become a Member State in its own right."
"But it also underlines another point of view that we should make very clear to the Turkish authorities: that in order for this to take place, Turkey must become a full democracy."
"I agree with what Mr Lamassoure has said in his report."
"The Turks have made advances."
"It is also true, however, that this constitutional reform contains three elements that impair its credibility."
"First of all, it ceases to class as crimes actions that are still crimes because they fulfil the conditions as such."
"Secondly, the constitution is being reformed, but other laws remain in force, such as the Penal Code, the anti-terrorism law and the audiovisual law, which continue to uphold the existence of certain crimes of expression, of opinion, of public demonstration and association. Thirdly, and most importantly, the constitutional reform is not being put into practice."
"Arbitrary detentions and violations of human rights continue to take place."
"We all receive, as I do myself, constant complaints, of which, today, there have been many, that are continually causing problems for the defenders of human rights and their organisations, not to mention, of course, the situation of the Kurdish people."
"Yes, the Kurdish people."
"It is not enough to lift the restriction of using a language if this is upheld in law and there is no recognition of the existence of a Community as a people in their own right."
"This is the case with the Kurds."
"This is even more the case, Mr President, where a Sakharov Prize winner, Mrs Leyla Zana, remains in gaol, and we must continue to strongly demand that she be freed."
"Mr President, I would like to call on history to remind us that, while it serves its purpose on occasions to demonstrate a point, it can also let us down."
"I would particularly like to remind Mr Pasqua that he should recall where the Presocrats originate from, that Ionic art was born in Turkey, and that the truly Christian French Kings did not hesitate to call upon the Ottoman Empire to fight against the Pope and other European States in the Sixteenth Century."
"However, if we continue to look into history, we will also see both good things and bad things about Turkey."
"Turkey, in the strategic position it occupies, is the only truly secular state, and Europe has been founded upon this great battle to achieve secular states."
"On this level, then, yes, Turkey is a totally European State."
"Its efforts to eliminate religious interference, whilst having truly fundamentalist communities within its borders, is something to be admired, and which could be a factor for future stability in the region."
"On the other hand, under the Ottoman Empire, the Greek monasteries, the Sufis and the Sephardis all survived."
"This was because, at their respective moments in history, the authorities did not attempt to destroy them."
"Today, it is also a strong state fighting for the education of its people."
"On this subject I would like to remind Mrs Uca, with a heavy heart, that 30% of women in Turkey do not go to school, nor are allowed to do so, so in this way they miss out on an education."
"To conclude, I would like to say that there are also bad points."
"The major black cloud over the Ottoman tradition is its perception of the unlimited rights of the conqueror over the conquered."
"This gives rise to the great problem of prisons and exterminations: the loss of rights of the conquered, the weaker party, rape, exterminations, silence and death."
"I think that it is in this area that we should offer our help, for Turkey is a stabilising factor in this region: it is establishing agreements with Syria and is an important element in the creation of a peaceful border with Europe."
"We have to contribute to the strengthening of this strategy and its improvement, with European ideas used in governance."
"Mr President, here is another chance for Turkey to exploit its strategic position and use its proverbial military capabilities: let us hope that, this time, its attachment to the West will be more effectively translated into vital internal reforms."
"Mr Lamassoure has painted an objective, clear picture of the country but, despite some positive elements, he does not hide his concern that Turkey might regress to a state which is worse than the current situation."
"It is positive that the Turkish government has presented a programme of conditions for joining Europe and it is positive that it is working on the Constitution, but it is negative that neither the 'road map' nor the timetable for the reforms has been clearly defined."
"The European Union is not asking every country to follow the same procedure, but there are certain values, certain individual and democratic rights which must be respected - and Europe does know how to be patient - in Turkey and in its prisons too."
"One final point: the question of the Armenian genocide is, strangely, becoming increasingly important with the passing of time."
"Today, humanity no longer tolerates lies or inaccurate accounts when it comes to the horrific events of history."
"It is not necessary to say, for example, how much the descriptions of the blood baths of the two world wars by former enemy historians helped to soothe feelings and cool emotions, and this example should be followed as soon as possible by Turks and Armenians, with a view to starting to normalise relations between the two neighbouring countries."
"Lastly, I am sure that Armenia would be quite willing to erect a monument in front of one of the European institutions commemorating its sacrifice and entrusting it to history."
"This would also make it possible for us, too, to produce documents on Turkey without worrying about how to address the question of Armenia."
"It is necessary to remember the past in order to do better in the future."
"Mr President, being one of the last to speak, I am in a strange situation in which basically everything has already been said, but not by everybody."
"Nonetheless, I should like to comment on two points which I think are particularly important."
"First, however, I should like to thank our rapporteur."
"This is a superb report, couched in very moderate terms."
"We can live with it quite nicely and, more to the point, it is a report which is conducive to consensus."
"We must bear in mind that this is a progress report."
"I think there will be a great many more progress reports to come on the question of Turkey's pre-accession to the European Union."
"Now to the points on which I should like to comment."
"First, the question of the death penalty which has not, I think, been adequately evaluated in the House this evening."
"The general political reforms which Turkey recently introduced are very promising and we fully acknowledge them."
"However, we all know, and Turkey should also know, which is why we must say so loud and clear, that they represent enormous progress within Turkey itself."
"Naturally, from our point of view, they are just a beginning."
"I must say, we always get a bit carried away when it comes to Turkey."
"But, perhaps, the means are basically the end at the moment, especially when we consider human rights."
"But, to come back to the death penalty. We obviously feel that it must be abolished completely."
"There can be no partial abolition of the death penalty from a democratic point of view."
"There can only be complete abolition."
"That this is difficult in Turkey at the moment for domestic political reasons is patently obvious."
"The second point which I think is important is the fight against corruption within Turkey."
"Because as long as sleaze runs public and social life in Turkey, the people will have no faith in politicians and as long as they have no faith in politicians, they will put more faith in the military."
"But it is out of the question in a democratic community for the military, in the form of the national security council, always to have the last word, de facto, on parliament's resolutions."
"I think that a great deal of work is still needed on this within Turkey."
"And that can only mean fighting corruption and ensuring that the people have faith in politicians."
"Mr President, I want to thank Mr Lamassoure for his sterling work."
"I wish to put the following question to the Commissioner with responsibility for enlargement, Mr Verheugen. Is it possible for Turkey to become a member of the European Union in view of the continued Turkish occupation of Northern Cyprus, continued Turkish migration from Anatolia to Northern Cyprus and the documented destruction in that part of the island of the historic heritage in the form of monasteries, churches and cultural buildings?"
"If, in the future, it is possible for a country, such as Turkey, to continue to occupy a part of another future EU country, namely Cyprus, and yet remain a Member State, what will have happened to that democracy and spirit of reconciliation that forms the very soul of European cooperation and the very values that underlie it?"
"In that case, what will have become of our credibility in working for peace?"
"I also think that it is necessary for Turkey, in the same ambitious way as Germany, to deal with the dark and sombre chapters of its twentieth century history."
"It is not acceptable for Turkey to go on denying the Armenian genocide of one and a half million Christians."
"It is not acceptable for it to deny that Christian Assyrians, Chaldeans and Syrians were also exposed to a genocide in which hundreds of thousands of people were murdered following a fatwa concerning holy war on the Christians, issued in 1914 by the top Muslim leader."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission welcomes the broad agreement in this debate on Turkey's progress."
"I hope that we can use this common ground when assessing the work in store for us."
"I should also like to emphasise that the Commission agrees with the conclusions and views expressed by the rapporteur, Mr Lamassoure, in his report."
"Here, too, there is a broad agreement and this, too, will be helpful as we continue in our work."
"Several speakers have said, and I should like to stress this, that Turkey has become more, rather than less, important to us."
"And this does not only have to do with its geo-strategic position."
"I have always warned about reducing Turkey to a locality of special geo-strategic importance."
"I prefer to believe that Turkey's uniqueness also lies in its cultural and historic heritage and in the political role which it can play at this global political interface."
"The political elite in Turkey have demonstrated that they are absolutely determined to keep modernising the country and bringing it closer to European standards."
"The constitutional reform which has now been decided is an important indication of this."
"For me, this constitutional reform represents real progress."
"Parliament adopted these important resolutions very quickly and with an overwhelming majority."
"I think this large majority is particularly important, because it clearly shows that there is broad social consensus on the need for democratic and rule-of-law reforms."
"These changes need to demonstrate that they are effective in practice, however."
"The crucial question to Turkey is always, what has actually changed?"
"Which is why everyone is right who said, during the debate, that the point now, as far as they were concerned, was to see how Turkey implements these promising constitutional reforms and what actually changes."
"In this respect, the Commission agrees with the European Parliament's appraisal that, the constitutional reforms and further legislative initiatives announced, notwithstanding, a great deal still needs to be done if human rights really are to be securely and permanently protected in Turkey."
"Our relations have progressed well since Helsinki."
"The pre-accession strategy has been implemented."
"As with all the other candidate countries, the priorities for Turkey have also been set out in an accession partnership."
"This year Turkey adopted a national programme for incorporating the acquis which also includes the timetable for new legislation which has been called for on numerous occasions here in the House."
"This legislation will need to be in keeping with the acquis of the European Union."
"We want to continue the pre-accession strategy for Turkey on the basis of the principles adopted in Helsinki."
"This obviously means that there can be no talk of starting negotiations until the political criteria for accession have been met."
"I would stress here that we are not in the business of offering discounts on the political criteria for accession to the European Union to anyone anywhere."
"It is in keeping with the philosophy behind the Helsinki resolutions that, with the exception of negotiations, Turkey must be treated in exactly the same way in all other areas as the other candidate countries."
"The Lamassoure report refers to the difficult economic situation in Turkey."
"I should like to encourage Turkey to continue with the economic reforms agreed with the International Monetary Fund."
"As for us, we shall release the first tranche of EUR 75 million from the European Union structural adjustment facility for Turkey as quickly as possible."
"As far as Cyprus is concerned, we continue to abide firmly by the view that the peace process should be resumed as quickly as possible under the auspices of the United Nations."
"Turkey has promised to support this process."
"But I must say quite unequivocally that the European Union expects this support to translate into specific action and result in our actually resolving this problem."
"I am confident that accession negotiations with Cyprus will be concluded during the course of next year, which is why it is particularly important that the parties involved make every effort to find a lasting political solution."
"The components for a solution, which take account of the interests and concerns of all involved, are well documented."
"What we need is the political courage to grab this opportunity and resolve the Cyprus question now."
"The window of opportunity is open."
"But, it must be said, it will probably not be open for much longer."
"A solution to the Cyprus question will benefit future relations between the European Union and Turkey enormously."
"Relations between Greece and Turkey have already improved considerably."
"The Commission welcomes the confidence-building measures agreed."
"I congratulate the two foreign secretaries, Ismail Cem and Georgios Papandreos on their initiative and their success."
"Both foreign secretaries did a great deal to foster a climate conducive to further progress in the region."
"As far as outstanding problems with European security and defence policy are concerned, I called on Turkey, just a few days ago, to help achieve a constructive solution as quickly as possible."
"In all events, this problem should be resolved before the meeting of the European Council in Laeken in December this year."
"A little extra effort and it should be possible, and I am convinced that it is possible, to reach an agreement."
"We are fully aware of Turkey's concerns, especially, as regards, possible action in its neck of the woods."
"But I call on our Turkish partners to take a constructive attitude so that an agreement can be reached soon."
"We should be able to expect a country which is a candidate for membership of the European Union to support rather than block one of the most important future projects of the European Union."
"The Commission considers that it is important to improve relations between Turkey and Armenia in order to foster security and stability in the region."
"The Commission therefore welcomes the very recent initiative by the civil society in the two countries to bring the two nations closer together and, with the help of independent historians, to reappraise the tragic events of the past."
"I welcome the European Parliament's position on the programme of financial assistance."
"The proposed amendments are acceptable to us."
"I particularly agree with the European Parliament that care must be taken to ensure that various sources of funding and programmes are properly coordinated."
"It is true that we are probably now in a decisive stage of relations between the European Union and Turkey."
"Once the Lamassoure Reports have been adopted we shall have all the elements needed for our pre-accession strategy to hand by the end of the year."
"We can then go on to the next stage in which we shall have to focus mainly on stepping up and putting Turkish preparations for accession into practice."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 10 a.m."
"Loading and unloading of bulk carriers"
"The next item is the report (A5-0326/2001) by Rijk van Dam, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive establishing harmonised requirements and procedures for the safe loading and unloading of bulk carriers (7193/1/2001 - C5-0292/2001 - 2000/0121(COD))."
"Mr President, our group supports the work carried out, thus far, by Mr Van Dam and the Council, together."
"We feel that this recommendation is a major step forwards, particularly in the field of maritime safety, especially since the statistics of past years are extremely alarming: in the last 10 years, between 1990 and 1999, we recorded the sinking of 146 bulk carriers and the deaths of 780 crew members, all of which occurred during the loading or unloading of these carriers."
"The Commission' s directive harmonises, at last, a field of legislation which has allowed too many, too dangerous exceptions in the past."
"We are going to harmonise the loading and unloading procedures, the safety standards inside and outside terminals and the levels of responsibility on board vessels and ashore."
"I welcome the fact that all this has served to improve quality, first and foremost; we feel that quality must be an essential, basic condition if safety standards are to be satisfactory."
"I welcome the fact that a balance was found quickly between Parliament and the Council' s positions, a balance which, moreover, respects the spirit of the amendments proposed and adopted by Parliament as well."
"At last, as of today, we are on the way to more stringent legislation, to a code of procedure which has the merit of courageously placing safety above all other concerns, including economic and financial concerns."
"That is why we are totally satisfied with the final version of this report."
"Mr President, I wish to thank rapporteur van Dam for the successful preparation of the report."
"Increasing marine safety requires ongoing work."
"Increasing the safety of loading and unloading of bulk carriers is an important aspect of work for the improvement of safety in the shipping sector."
"As is the case in many matters concerning marine safety, these rules are also agreed at the International Maritime Organisation on a voluntary basis."
"Since the regulations are currently being applied only intermittently, it is good that they are being incorporated into Community legislation."
"Improving the loading and unloading of bulk carriers and the efficient performance of ports will also further the development of important intermodal transportations."
"Along with a further tightening of the rules, care must be taken that the decisions made are realistic and feasible."
"The biggest shortcoming in the position of the Council is that, as the rapporteur states, information need not be given on all damage caused to the structure and fittings of a vessel."
"In addition, I wish to call attention to the fact that decisions to increase marine safety, which are made only within the Union, are not sufficient."
"Questions of safety and liability must, as far as possible, be dealt with on a worldwide basis."
"The matter needs to be given a rapid passage, even though the common position of the Council has not included all the proposals of the Parliament's first reading."
"Our group supports approval of the common position as it stands."
"Mr President, the Commission is delighted by the report which has been drawn up by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, in relation to this proposed directive establishing harmonised requirements and procedures for the safe loading and unloading of bulk carriers."
"I wish, in particular, to thank Mr van Dam for his report and for the help he has given the Commission in its efforts to increase the safety of bulk carriers."
"This directive will transpose into Community legislation the code of the International Maritime Organisation, which is currently in force in relation to the safe loading and unloading of ships, as well as certain parts of the convention for the safety of life at sea."
"This code, which is, in fact, a recommendation, was established by the IMO in 1997, but, so far, it has not been widely applied."
"As soon as its application becomes obligatory in all the Union' s ports, this code will be much more widely used and will, therefore, contribute to the safety of all bulk carriers visiting the Union."
"As the rapporteur has indicated, this directive is aimed at combating the phenomenon of the disappearance of bulk carriers, that is, the sinking of these ships, which suddenly break up in open sea and sink in a few minutes, thereby causing the loss of considerable human life."
"As Mr Fava has said, these statistics are unfortunately quite clear: over the last ten years, these wrecks have caused the loss of 134 ships with 743 victims, and there is a consistent tendency in terms of the average age and the total annual dead weight of the ships which have disappeared."
"It was, therefore, necessary to deal with this issue of the safety of bulk carriers, and it is known that bad loading and unloading methods are considered to be one of the main causes of these tragic accidents."
"As the rapporteur has said, the directive is designed to ensure that the handling of cargo in our ports respects strict rules, so as to prevent damage to ships during loading or unloading of heavy bulk cargo."
"Before and during loading and unloading, the crew on board and the dock personnel must be in contact and in agreement, and, furthermore, a plan must be agreed in advance in relation to the way the loading and unloading will be carried out."
"Heavy equipment which is often used in these operations must be handled with caution, and, in the event of a disagreement between the two parties, the dock personnel and the crew on board, the competent authority must be able to intervene to suspend the operations in order to prevent possible damage to the structure of the bulk carriers."
"The Commission is therefore very pleased that Parliament intends to accept the common position of the Council without amendments, because, if it is adopted rapidly, this directive will be able to enter into force very soon."
"This also shows that, on sensitive maritime issues, the European Parliament and the Council are able to rapidly reach a decision with the greatest degree of cohesion, and the Commission hopes that the cohesion demonstrated in this case will also be demonstrated in relation to the other great issues which are currently on the agenda."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 10 a.m."
"Reporting formalities for ships"
"The next item is the report (A5-0327/2001) by Ari Vatanen, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on reporting formalities for ships arriving in and departing from Community ports (COM(2001) 46 - C5-0051/2001 - 2001/0026(COD))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, and those ladies and gentlemen who are still awake, the economic integration of Europe is an objective which many, even among those who oppose political integration, can swallow without indigestion."
"The promotion of local shipping also enjoys broad favour, since preservation of the environment and a significant reduction of congestion on our roads are essential."
"The Commission's proposal for a common form for ports is a sensible step (even though on this occasion it does not arouse political passions) towards the simplification of port formalities."
"It must be said that the forms in use at present vary greatly between Member States."
"The proposed directive would mean that the International Maritime Organisation's FAL forms would always be approved in our ports."
"For once we are getting a proposal from the Commission which does not increase bureaucracy in any way."
"It would be nice if this could happen more often."
"This stems from the fact that the Member States are by no means obliged to demand any forms; whereas, if a Member State regards it as necessary to obtain information covered by the proposed directive, it must always accept the FAL forms."
"I support the Commission's proposal, and take the view that we should welcome it with open arms."
"I have made a few technical adjustments which are in line with the Council of Ministers' preliminary position."
"I believe that we can now, exceptionally, get by with a single reading."
"I also thank the members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, who succeeded in keeping the political animal which lurks in all of us under control, and did not churn out revisions of their own."
"Putting our own stamp on everything must not lead to the objectives themselves being obscured and timetables being interfered with."
"This time we neatly avoided this pitfall."
"The general adoption of the IMO's FAL documents will promote the efficient functioning of the common market, and it definitely represents a welcome improvement."
"I do not, however, wish to overestimate its importance, since what is involved here is merely a very small part of a larger whole."
"We will not bring dynamism to ports merely by standardising forms; we need to introduce competition to ports as well."
"The significance of my report does, in fact, largely hinge on the question of whether we will have the courage also to approve the Commission's proposal for deregulating port services."
"I hope that Parliament will continue the project of building Europe by dismantling monopolies."
"And, in this context, I look symbolically and appealingly in the direction of my highly esteemed colleague Mr Jarzembowski."
"Finally, I wish to give thanks once again for the cooperation of the Commission and of the Council."
"Europe needs constructive action and less politically-motivated confrontation."
"I trust that we will be able to improve the status of shipping by the action now proposed."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the rudder is set."
"Let us steer Europe in the direction of competitive ports!"
"Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists supports both this Commission proposal and the report by Mr Vatanen, who, having already demonstrated his adventures as a driver on roads throughout the world, now amazes us with his knowledge of a subject as difficult as maritime transport and the certificates that have to be completed when ships arrive at, or depart from, our ports."
"Very gradually, people like ourselves, here, today, in this House, Mr Vatanen, myself, and all of you, are building a common Europe."
"We are now eighteen, it is true, years behind with regard to 1 January 1983, which already seems like such a long time ago, when the Community institutions and the then ten Member States approved the Single European Act."
"The standardisation of reporting formalities will, without a doubt, contribute to an improvement in maritime transport between ports situated in Member States, encouraging the promotion of short sea shipping."
"By encouraging the transportation of goods by sea we will free up, to a certain extent, the amount of heavy traffic on our already saturated roads."
"We can only regret that this proposal, as noted by Mr Vatanen in his explanatory statement, does not cover dangerous goods."
"We ask the Commission not to limit this standardisation of reporting formalities to the Community."
"The Community should press for this type of information to be common to the whole international community, promoting the International Maritime Organisation's Convention on the Facilitation of Maritime Traffic."
"We would also invite those Member States who have not done so, to ratify this Convention, although the Commission proposal does not oblige them to do so."
"I would like to finish by congratulating Mr Vatanen on his excellent work."
"Mr President, I, too, would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Vatanen, for his excellent preparatory work, which aims to ensure the rapid passage of this important business."
"An efficiently functioning internal market requires smooth working and more standardised practices than previously in the transportation sector."
"However, the reporting obligations of ships arriving in ports and leaving them vary greatly from one Member State to another."
"Most Member States have already signed the IMO's Convention on the facilitation of maritime traffic."
"The proposal for a directive, now under discussion, is a good example of practices which are already internationally recognised as being good ones."
"In my opinion, besides the safety of shipping, it is important to facilitate practical procedures."
"By clear, uniform yet flexible procedures, shipping will be made a more attractive alternative mode of transport."
"There may be a particularly positive impact on local shipping."
"Improving the effectiveness of port practices will also facilitate the development of important intermodal transportation systems."
"Since several forms are in use, attention needs to be given, in the future, to how electronic communications can be better utilised."
"A positive aspect of this proposal is that the directive is intended to pass into law within a rapid timetable."
"The rapporteur has made good revisions to the proposal for a directive."
"Our group supports the approval of the report and its rapid passage through the legislative process."
"Mr President, once again, I would firstly like to congratulate Mr Vatanen on this very good report, and to thank the other speakers in the debate, and also welcome the fact that all the institutions have studied this proposal within a very short timescale, and that it will be possible to reach an agreement in due course on this subject as we did on the previous one."
"This demonstrates the importance which we all now attach to short sea shipping."
"For several years, the Community has been implementing a complete strategy aimed at making short sea shipping a viable and realistic alternative to purely road transport."
"This strategy has, furthermore, been reinforced in the White Paper on European transport policy until 2010."
"One of the elements of this strategy is to remove the obstacles preventing the development of short sea shipping."
"Our recent exercise in recording these obstacles showed that the complexity of the administrative documentary procedures was considered to be one of the main bottlenecks."
"Mr Vatanen was kind enough to say that the Commission was dealing with the paperwork, for once."
"I give credit for this U-turn to him."
"The Commission has therefore presented a proposal aimed at simplifying certain documentary procedures."
"We have chosen to deal with the routine procedures which ships have to go through each time they enter or leave a port."
"The procedures currently in force are not in themselves unreasonable, but the methods for conforming to them are so different from one Member State to another that they often lead to confusion amongst shipowners and operators."
"Moreover, the International Maritime Organisation has produced a number of standardised forms in order to harmonise these procedures, and we therefore believed that standardisation was necessary, so that ships may know what information they need to present to the authorities and the way in which they must do so, whichever port they are visiting."
"Given that there are already internationally recognised standardised forms, we have opted for the simple solution of using them."
"This will probably lead to the worldwide application of the IMO forms."
"This proposal, therefore, simplifies the necessary complex documentary procedures in the field of maritime transport."
"It does not impose new obligations on shipowners. Instead it allows them to carry out certain obligatory declarations in a harmonised and simplified fashion."
"Since these declarations will be identical regardless of the flag or sector of activity, there is no reason to exclude any of them from the scope of our proposal, which therefore applies to both short sea shipping and ocean navigation, and which will not distinguish between flags."
"Thank you, once again, to Mr Vatanen."
"Thanks to the amendments which he has presented in his report, we believe we will be able to reach an agreement with the Council with a view to adopting this proposal at first reading."
"This is good news and we are grateful for it."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 10 a.m."
"Accession to the WTO"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following two reports:"
"(A5-0366/2001) by Per Gahrton, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council decision establishing the Community position within the Ministerial Conference set up by the Agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation on the accession of the People's Republic of China to the World Trade Organisation (COM (2001) 517 - C5-0487/2001 - 2001/0218(CNS));"
"(A5-0367/2001) by Per Gahrton, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council decision establishing the Community position within the Ministerial Conference set up by the Agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation on the accession of the Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu (Chinese Taipei) to the World Trade Organisation (COM(2001) 518 - C5-0488/2001 - 2001/0216(CNS))."
"Mr President, the accession of the People' s Republic of China to the WTO is, without doubt, one of the major ventures and experiments of our time."
"The People' s Republic of China, which is still a country formally governed by a Communist party, is now to be a part of what might be called the stronghold of the free market economy, the WTO."
"If the Commission is to be believed, that is a huge victory from the EU' s point of view."
"It is said that this is a one-way market opening process."
"It is thought that, for the EU, China' s accession to the WTO will signal an enormous gain in enforceable rights, with no significant change in the EU' s own commitments towards China."
"It is really quite a one-way process that is described in the Commission' s proposal."
"China must adapt."
"The EU does not need to do very much."
"Certain China-specific quantitative restrictions are to be phased out."
"However, these are of relatively little importance."
"If the Commission' s description in Paragraph 13 is to be believed, accession to the WTO will be good for China' s economy."
"I have a number of doubts on that score."
"Clearly, the Commission has to look after the EU' s interests, but the issue is whether, in the era of globalisation, we might not have passed the point at which trade policy could be judged as if it were a football match, in which winning is everything and there is complete indifference to how things are for the other side."
"I therefore think it is quite remarkable that, in its proposal, the Commission does not say so much as a word to hint that accession might nonetheless lead to problems for the other party, namely the People' s Republic of China."
"I must briefly relate a number of facts to indicate that there may be certain problems for this large, but, nonetheless, still underdeveloped, country."
"Criticisms are being made in China."
"When, in connection with my official visit as chairman of the European Parliament' s China delegation, I recently visited China, I was able, on the fringes of this visit, to meet authors of books which are very highly critical of China' s accession to the WTO."
"Both books are published by legal publishing houses and, obviously, in Chinese."
"One of the books is known in English translation as Collision: Globalisation and China' s Reality Choice."
"The author, who is an economist at Beijing Aeronautic University, maintains that China will lose to a system that is dominated by transnational companies."
"His sympathies are with the lower social classes, he says, and he believes that Chinese companies will be swallowed by transnational giants."
"This will hit those groups of people in China which have little in the way of wealth."
"His main argument is that China is not ready for accession to the WTO."
"The Chinese economy is not strong enough, and it will be the poorest classes that will have to pay a heavy price in the form of unemployment and social insecurity."
"This book attracted a certain amount of attention in China when it was published last year."
"A relevant article was published in the journal belonging to the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and the book received many positive reviews."
"The second book is known in English as China in the Shadow of Globalisation and constitutes a warning to the effect that accession to the WTO might cause China to split into five parts."
"That is one of the things that the Chinese leaders fear most."
"The fact that the chaos which might result from accession to the WTO could lead to the division of the country touches a sensitive point in China' s understanding of itself."
"In spite of the fact that China is not a democracy and, to put it mildly, does not allow complete freedom of expression, and despite the fact that the Chinese government is in favour of accession to the WTO, a book of this type was nonetheless allowed to be published."
"That means that there is uneasiness, considerable uneasiness, in Chinese society."
"This uneasiness is, in all likelihood, about the possible consequences within the governing party, too."
"You only have to log on to the Internet."
"There are many web sites: China Online, South China Morning Post and such like."
"There is a lot of information about what different commentators, including those outside China, believe might happen because of accession to the WTO."
"China Online reported, for example, in August of this year, that approximately 18 per cent of the total number of employees within the State sector are estimated to be surplus to requirements."
"It is said that they will be still more surplus to requirements following accession to the WTO."
"Unemployment in city areas is already estimated at over 15 per cent."
"This report from China Online also maintains that unemployment will increase further in connection with accession to the WTO."
"The prospects for new jobs are very limited because those who are made redundant are often older, unqualified workers."
"According to China Online, an estimated 30% of the agricultural labour force is surplus to requirements, meaning that 120 million farmers will have to look for jobs in the cities."
"Agriculture was one of the most important areas raised by China in the negotiations."
"China received certain concessions."
"Many commentators still believe, however, that accession will lead to enormous changes in the countryside and have enormous consequences when China is opened up to imports of food and agricultural products from, for example, the United States."
"China has nine hundred million people employed within agriculture."
"The Chinese government itself, which does not exactly exaggerate the difficulties, estimates that, because of cheaper grain imports, 9.7 million farmers will lose their jobs within seven years of Beijing joining the WTO."
"I could go on at length quoting and referring to different sources indicating the difficulties for China, but I think these examples suffice."
"The point of the quotations is that I, again, wanted to emphasise how odd I think it is that the Commission should be presenting the Council and Parliament with a document in which there is not a single word to suggest that accession to the WTO might lead to difficulties in the world' s most heavily populated country."
"That is an odd information policy, in my opinion."
"China' s accession to the WTO may, of course, lead to problems for ourselves, too, if stability in China is seriously undermined."
"What conclusions do I draw, then?"
"I do not draw the conclusion that we must say 'no' ."
"Even if China is not a democracy in our sense of the word, I think it would be unreasonable for us to try to assume the responsibilities of the Chinese government and say that, what the Chinese government has judged to be correct might, in actual fact, be wrong."
"Nonetheless, I believe that we should be aware of the fact that we are embarking upon an incredibly risky game."
"It places great demands upon European companies to be responsible and not misuse the opportunities they are given when they now go into China with the freedom granted to them by the latter' s membership of the WTO."
"In spite of this serious criticism and these serious misgivings, I naturally recommend that we vote in favour of China' s membership."
"I only have a small amount of speaking time left to devote to Taiwan."
"That was intentional, because Taiwan is in a quite different situation."
"Taiwan is a developed modern democracy, a developed modern market economy and industrial state and the world' s tenth largest trading power."
"I cannot see any real problems with Taiwan' s accession to the WTO."
"We are concerned there, with an entirely different set of problems with which no comparison can be drawn."
"Taiwan will be accorded a local collective agreement with China and become a member the day after China has become a member."
"I have no comment other than that we naturally ought to vote in favour of Taiwan' s membership."
"Mr President, our group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left supports the two proposals presented without question, both for the People' s Republic of China and for the customs territory of Taipei, and agrees with all the arguments and pertinent issues put forward by Mr Gahrton, who has a profound knowledge of this issue."
"For this reason, we think it is of fundamental importance that the European Union should take an extremely responsible attitude when facing this momentous challenge for the world."
"The People' s Republic of China' s accession to the World Trade Organisation will have repercussions in China itself, as we have already seen."
"They have now had many years to prepare for and take control of the possible consequences."
"There will also be significant repercussions for the European Union: I am aware, for example, of what could happen to us with regard to agriculture."
"There will also be repercussions for the functioning of the World Trade Organisation, which is going to be completely restructured, although it must be said that this is already a matter of some urgency."
"For this reason, although we are aware of the whole range of problems, dangers and possibilities that this accession brings, our group supports these two proposals without reservation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, what a pity that such an important issue is again being debated at such a late hour and, needless to say, before almost empty benches, because the repercussions of the accession of the People's Republic of China to the WTO are of global significance in every sense of the word and therefore deserve even more attention."
"The history of the creation of the World Trade Organisation can be traced back a long way, to a time when the Second World War had left a trail of destruction in its wake and there was a great deal of uncertainty as to what shape peace would take in the future."
"The key elements for a peaceful world, and this was as clear then as it is now, are freedom, security and stability, democracy and human rights."
"We have used these basic principles to lay the ghosts of the past in Western Europe and finally bring about an era of peace of which, in my view, we can be proud."
"But we have to defend this peace anew every day, a painful lesson each and every one of us now has to learn."
"Today we are on the threshold of major enlargement of the European Union."
"In a few years, we shall live in a Europe which can be an area of stability and freedom."
"But how shall we achieve this?"
"We shall achieve it through integration."
"Integration means inclusion, unification, political, as well as economic, completion."
"I do not think anyone disputes the fact that this is an absolutely winning recipe for peaceful development and that this does not just apply to Europe."
"Other parts of the world have not been blessed with peace in the last 50 years."
"The Cold War was synonymous with conflict and discord for numerous regions in the world."
"We must bear this in mind if we are to understand the significance, today, of an organisation, such as, the WTO."
"Here, too, the watchword is integration."
"The more countries commit themselves to the peaceful principles of trade, the more stable and peaceful the world can become."
"For these reasons, I expressly welcome the accession of the People's Republic of China to the WTO."
"For the same reason, I also welcome the accession of Taiwan to the World Trade Organisation."
"We want to integrate, not leave part of the world standing on the doorstep."
"The EU has clearly formulated the important objectives in its strategy on Asia."
"Political dialogue with the People's Republic of China should be stepped up, the transition to an open society should be supported and China should be further integrated into the global economy."
"This last objective is now within reach."
"Only with China, both the People's Republic and Taiwan, will the WTO become a real world trade organisation."
"I can assure you that we shall not lose sight of the other objectives and I would also stress that this includes dialogue about human rights."
"The numerous negative aspects of China's accession to the WTO, which you choose to identify in your explanatory statement, Mr Gahrton, cannot be supported by us in the PPE-DE Group in their present one-sided and, in my view, somewhat disproportionate wording."
"I think the advantages to all sides of these accessions outweigh the disadvantages."
"The award of the 2008 Olympic Games to Beijing became as acute a topic of discussion as the accession to the WTO is now."
"But I am positive that we are on the right path, the path of integration, not segregation, the path of inclusion, not isolation, the path, I trust, towards a more peaceful world, which we need, today, more than ever."
"We are still in shock from the horror of 11 September."
"And that is another reason to stand together."
"Mr President, my thanks to the Commissioner for the work which he has carried out."
"Of course we welcome China and Taiwan, because I think we should be pleased, as the previous speaker said, that China and Taiwan are joining."
"A whole host of reforms is being initiated, as the Commission has rightly pointed out."
"For the rest, China will take up a key position within the WTO and this will also bring about considerable changes for the West."
"I am fairly certain that this will present the Commission with further challenges."
"For the rest, we are supporting the accession of China with considerable funds and I think we should do more here."
"For the first time, Parliament has been consulted."
"This is a result of excellent collaboration with the Commission and, of course, with the Council."
"But I have one thing to say to Mr Gahrton: it is true that accession to the WTO is not without its opponents in China."
"But I think that to overemphasise this in the report without, at the same time, trusting in the fact that China is more than capable of evaluating whether or not it is in a position to cope with accession is to underestimate China's capabilities considerably."
"I rather think that the doomsday scenario which you have conjured up in your report is highly exaggerated."
"I would like to see you evaluate matters in a somewhat fairer and more balanced manner in the future."
"Mr President, after fifteen years of negotiations, we are now in the final stage of China and Taiwan' s accession to the WTO."
"The Commission submitted the accession conditions to you for your opinion."
"I would like to thank the House, in particular, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and the rapporteur, Mr Gahrton, for your willingness to treat this subject as a priority."
"If you accept the recommendation of your rapporteur, the Union will be in a position to give the green light to China' s accession at the next Ministerial Conference of the WTO, which, as you know, will take place in Doha on 9-13 November."
"The documents you have been issued with, will have informed you of all the technical elements of the negotiation."
"I will not return to them today, but I would like to share with you some thoughts of a more political nature, at the same time giving my reaction to Mr Gahrton' s document and speech; they both warrant it."
"I would, firstly, like to stress the special nature of negotiations for accession to the WTO and try to correct the impression - created by your report, Mr Gahrton - that it is something which we have handled in an excessively unilateral fashion."
"An accession to the WTO is not negotiated within a traditional multilateral framework, where concessions are made on the basis of the principle of reciprocity."
"On the contrary, in an accession negotiation, at least to the WTO (I say that prudently, since this seat was occupied by Günter Verheugen less than an hour ago), a country puts itself forward as a candidate to join a club whose members have already negotiated commitments amongst themselves."
"The candidate country must therefore pay for entry into that club by offering commitments in terms of access to markets which reflect what the members have already accepted amongst themselves."
"On several occasions your report points out, and with a degree of reproach which has not escaped me, the positive tone taken by the Commission to describe the results we have achieved after fifteen years of negotiations."
"Even if, contrary to what the report says, the Commission' s report is not jubilant, I nevertheless believe that we can be satisfied with these results as a job well done."
"Our task was primarily to defend the interests of the Union in these negotiations, and that is what we have done."
"It is also the case, however, that this agreement is not some kind of unilateral victory for the Union, which is something, if I have understood correctly, that you rather reproach us for."
"If there has been any victory, I am tempted to say that it is a multilateral one, since it is the multilateral system as a whole which has been strengthened as a result."
"We cannot claim that the WTO has a global vocation if it excludes a country which represents more than 20% of the world' s population."
"The issue was not, therefore, whether China should join the WTO, but rather when."
"Well, after fifteen long years of negotiations, the different parties involved, China and its trading partners, have reached the conclusion that that time has arrived."
"One of the Union' s main objectives was that these negotiations should lead to a strengthening of the multilateral system."
"It was therefore necessary for China to accept what we could describe as the multilateral acquis, and I will not make any controversial parallel here either, in other words, the advances made within the framework of GATT and then the WTO over the last half a century."
"We have ensured that the level of Chinese commitments offers this guarantee."
"But this accession to the WTO is also a victory for China, since we believe it to be an essential condition if she is to continue her exceptional economic development."
"Chinese external trade has increased by an average of 15% per year over the last twenty years."
"It is, therefore, literally an explosion. And accession to the WTO ensures China a stable framework for her commercial policy by guaranteeing the outlets which are crucial to her."
"Her status as a member will also allow her to defend her commercial interests by participating fully in the round of negotiations."
"At the end of the day it is clear that accession to the WTO is only one element, perhaps an essential one, but, nevertheless, only one element in the reform process launched by Deng Xiaoping in 1978 and continued by his successors."
"More than an end in itself, accession is a consequence of these past reforms and a springboard for new reforms to come."
"The justification for these reforms does not lie in accession to the WTO, and I feel that it would probably be presumptuous to try to distinguish between, what would result from accession itself, and, what is connected to the reform process taking place in China."
"This close connection between the timetable for internal reforms and accession to the WTO has been recognised by China' s trading partners, the Union, in particular, by means of the acceptance of transitional periods for the implementation of certain obligations."
"In fact, our objective was more the eventual result rather than the speed with which that result comes about."
"Mr Gahrton, you referred to two works which stress the dangers which may arise in China as a result of accession to the WTO in terms of regional tensions or social problems."
"I do not believe that these problems are being underestimated by the Chinese authorities, whose fundamental political objective seems to me, to be to guarantee the stability and integrity of their country."
"From the conversations I have had with them, I understand that China sees accession to the WTO as an essential element in the continuation of these twenty years of reforms, and, therefore, a continuation of this growth which has allowed internal tensions to be kept under control, here or there."
"China' s per capita GDP has multiplied by four over these twenty years."
"This is therefore a classic, if specific, case of the relationship between commerce and development."
"We all know, and I have often said to you, that commercial liberalisation is a good thing, as long as it is accompanied by the means to translate growth into sustainable development, that is to say, internal social and environmental policies, without which the beneficial effects of commercial liberalisation are not enjoyed."
"From this point or view, we believe that China' s accession promotes that type of better internal policy."
"I believe that this accession will strengthen the rule of law in China."
"The fundamental principles of transparency, non-discrimination, efficient administration and independent judicial control, which are included in the acquis of the WTO, will contribute, we believe, to the positive evolution of China' s economic, legal and social systems."
"In any event, for our part, we have been concerned, throughout the process of negotiations, to propose progressive measures which will prevent any particular section of the Chinese economy from being exposed to foreign competition overnight."
"In conclusion, I would like to insist on the fact that the result of these negotiations is balanced."
"It is true that we have defended European interests, and our document to Council and Parliament reflects that strategy."
"No, we have not ignored the consequences for China and for the WTO."
"Yes, accession will have a positive impact in terms of the quest for economic development in China, and therefore on the quest for internal reforms."
"In any event, it is the Chinese themselves who have chosen to integrate themselves into the international economy, and so much the better."
"At the same time we can only rejoice at the fact that, for the first time, Taiwan is becoming a full member of an international organisation, in a way which reflects its economic development and its status as an industrialised country."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will end by saying to the House that these two results are due to the wisdom of my predecessor, Sir Leon Brittan, who had made these two accessions one of the priorities of the Union' s commercial policy."
"All I have done is finish the work which he had largely and judiciously started."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 10 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.15 p.m.)"
"Address by His Holiness the XIVth Dalai-Lama"
"It is a great honour to speak and share some of my thoughts and feelings with you."
"As my prepared statement is in Tibetan, I want to read in Tibetan to show respect for my own unique, separate language."
"So I will speak Tibetan."
"(Loud applause) Recently, in Calcutta, at a function, at the beginning, as usual, I spoke in Tibetan and then in my broken English."
"The next day a local newspaper reported very favourably on my remarks but said that the Dalai Lama spoke at the beginning in Chinese."
"So I hope you will realise that this is not Chinese, but the Tibetan language."
"(Laughter and applause)"
"(The speaker continued in Tibetan, what follows is a translation)Madam President, ladies and gentlemen."
"It is a great honour for me to address the European Parliament."
"I believe the European Union is an inspiring example for a cooperative and peaceful co-existence among different nations and peoples and deeply inspiring for people like myself who strongly believe in the need for better understanding, closer cooperation, and greater respect among the various nations of the world."
"I thank you for this kind invitation."
"I consider it as an encouraging gesture of genuine sympathy and concern for the tragic fate of the Tibetan people."
"I speak to you today as a simple Buddhist monk, educated and trained in our ancient traditional way."
"I am not an expert in political science."
"However, my life-long study and practice of Buddhism and my responsibility and involvement in the non-violent freedom struggle of the Tibetan people have given me some experiences and thoughts that I would like to share with you."
"It is evident that the human community has reached a critical juncture in its history."
"Today' s world requires us to accept the oneness of humanity."
"In the past, communities could afford to think of one another as fundamentally separate."
"But today, as we learn from the recent tragic events in the United States, whatever happens in one region eventually affects many other areas."
"The world is becoming increasingly interdependent."
"Within the context of this new interdependence, self-interest clearly lies in considering the interest of others."
"Without the cultivation and promotion of a sense of universal responsibility our very future is in danger."
"I strongly believe that we must consciously develop a greater sense of universal responsibility."
"We must learn to work not just for our own individual self, family or nation, but for the benefit of all mankind."
"Universal responsibility is the best foundation both for our personal happiness and for world peace, the equitable use of our natural resources, and, through a concern for future generations, the proper care for the environment."
"Many of the world´s problems and conflicts arise because we have lost sight of the basic humanity that binds us all together as a human family."
"We tend to forget that despite the diversity of race, religion, culture, language, ideology and so forth, people are equal in their basic desire for peace and happiness: we all want happiness and do not want suffering."
"We strive to fulfil these desires as best we can."
"However, as much as we praise diversity in theory, unfortunately often we fail to respect it in practice."
"In fact, our inability to embrace diversity becomes a major source of conflict among peoples."
"A particularly sad fact of human history is that conflicts have arisen in the name of religion."
"Even today, individuals are killed, their communities destroyed and societies destabilised as a result of misuse of religion and encouragement of bigotry and hatred."
"According to my personal experience the best way to overcome obstructions to inter-religious harmony and to bring about understanding is through dialogue with members of other faith traditions."
"This I see occurring in a number of different ways."
"In my own case, for example, my meetings with the late Thomas Merton, a Trappist monk, in the late 60s, were deeply inspiring."
"They helped me develop a profound admiration for the teachings of Christianity."
"I also feel that meetings amongst different religious leaders and joining together to pray from a common platform are extremely powerful, as was the case in 1986 during the gathering at Assisi in Italy."
"The recent United Nations Millennium World Peace Summit of Religious and Spiritual Leaders held last year was also a laudable step."
"However, there is a need for more of these initiatives on a regular basis."
"On my part, to show my respect for other religious traditions I went on pilgrimage to Jerusalem - a site holy to three of the world' s great religions."
"I have paid visits to various Hindu, Islamic, Christian, Jain and Sikh shrines both in India and abroad."
"During the past three decades I have met with many religious leaders of different traditions and have discussed harmony and inter-religious understanding."
"When exchanges like these occur, followers of one tradition will find that, just as in the case of their own, the teachings of other faiths are a source of both spiritual inspiration and as well as ethical guidance to their followers."
"It will also become clear that irrespective of doctrinal and other differences, all the major world religions help to transform individuals to become good human beings."
"All emphasise love, compassion, patience, tolerance, forgiveness, humility, self-discipline and so on. We must therefore embrace the concept of plurality in the field of religion, too."
"In the context of our newly emerging global community all forms of violence, including war, are totally inappropriate means of settling disputes."
"Violence and war have always been part of human history, and in ancient times there were winners and losers."
"However, there would be no winners at all if another global conflict were to occur today."
"We must, therefore, have the courage and vision to call for a world without nuclear weapons and national armies in the long run."
"(Loud applause)Especially, in the light of the terrible attacks in the United States the international community must make a sincere attempt to use the horrible and shocking experience to develop a sense of global responsibility, where a culture of dialogue and non-violence is used in resolving differences."
"Dialogue is the only sensible and intelligent way of resolving differences and clashes of interests, whether between individuals or nations."
"The promotion of a culture of dialogue and non-violence for the future of mankind is a compelling task of the international community."
"It is not enough for governments to endorse the principle of non-violence without any appropriate action to support and promote it."
"If non-violence is to prevail, non-violent movements must be made effective and successful."
"Some consider the 20th century a century of war and bloodshed."
"I believe the challenge before us is to make the new century one of dialogue and non-violence."
"Furthermore, in dealing with conflicts too often we lack proper judgment and courage."
"We fail to pay adequate attention to situations of potential conflict when they are at an early stage of development."
"Once all the circumstances have progressed to a state where emotions of the people or communities involved in disputes have become fully charged, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to prevent a dangerous situation from exploding."
"We see this tragic situation repeated time and again."
"So we must learn to detect early signs of conflict and have the courage to address the problem before it reaches its boiling point."
"I remain convinced that most human conflicts can be solved through genuine dialogue conducted with a spirit of openness and reconciliation."
"I have therefore consistently sought a resolution of the issue of Tibet through non-violence and dialogue."
"Right from the beginning of the invasion of Tibet, I tried to work with the Chinese authorities to arrive at a mutually acceptable, peaceful co-existence."
"Even when the so-called Seventeen Point Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet was forced upon us I tried to work with the Chinese authorities."
"After all, by that agreement the Chinese government recognised the distinctiveness and the autonomy of Tibet and pledged not to impose their system on Tibet against our wishes."
"However, in breach of this agreement, the Chinese authorities forced upon Tibetans their rigid and alien ideology and showed scant respect for the unique culture, religion and way of life of the Tibetan people."
"In desperation the Tibetan people rose up against the Chinese. In the end in 1959 I had to escape from Tibet so that I could continue to serve the people of Tibet."
"During the past more than four decades since my escape, Tibet has been under the harsh control of the government of the People´s Republic of China."
"The immense destruction and human suffering inflicted on the people of Tibet are today well known and I do not wish to dwell on these sad and painful events."
"The late Panchen Lama' s 70,000-character petition to the Chinese government serves as a telling historical document on China' s draconian policies and actions in Tibet."
"Tibet today continues to be an occupied country, oppressed by force and scarred by suffering."
"Despite some development and economic progress, Tibet continues to face fundamental problems of survival."
"Serious violations of human rights are widespread throughout Tibet and are often the result of policies of racial and cultural discrimination."
"Yet they are only the symptoms and consequences of a deeper problem."
"The Chinese authorities view Tibet' s distinct culture and religion as the source of threat of separation."
"Hence as a result of deliberate policies an entire people with its unique culture and identity are facing the threat of extinction."
"I have led the Tibetan freedom struggle on a path of non-violence and have consistently sought a mutually agreeable solution of the Tibetan issue through negotiations in a spirit of reconciliation and compromise with China."
"With this spirit in 1988 here in Strasbourg at this Parliament I presented a formal proposal for negotiations, which we hoped would serve as a basis for resolving the issue of Tibet."
"I had chosen consciously the European Parliament as a venue to present my thoughts for a framework for negotiations in order to underline the point that a genuine union can only come about voluntarily when there are satisfactory benefits to all the parties concerned."
"The European Union is a clear and inspiring example of this."
"On the other hand, even one country or community can break into two or more entities when there is a lack of trust and benefit, and when force is used as the principal means of rule."
"My proposal which later became known as the 'Middle Way Approach' or the 'Strasbourg Proposal' envisages that Tibet enjoy genuine autonomy within the framework of the People' s Republic of China."
"However, not the autonomy on paper imposed on us 50 years ago in the 17-Point Agreement, but a true self-governing, genuinely autonomous Tibet, with Tibetans fully responsible for their own domestic affairs, including the education of their children, religious matters, cultural affairs, the care of their delicate and precious environment, and the local economy."
"Beijing would continue to be responsible for the conduct of foreign and defence affairs."
"This solution would greatly enhance the international image of China and contribute to her stability and unity -- the two topmost priorities of Beijing -- while at the same time the Tibetans would be ensured of the basic rights and freedoms to preserve their own civilisation and to protect the delicate environment of the Tibetan plateau."
"Since then our relation with the Chinese government has taken many twists and turns."
"Unfortunately, I must sadly inform you that a lack of political will on the part of the Chinese leadership to address the issue of Tibet in a serious manner has failed to produce any progress."
"My initiatives and overtures over the years to engage the Chinese leadership in a dialogue remain unreciprocated."
"Last September, I communicated through the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi our wish to send a delegation to Beijing to deliver a detailed memorandum outlining my thinking on the issue of Tibet and to explain and discuss the points raised in the memorandum."
"I conveyed that through face-to-face meetings we would succeed in clarifying misunderstandings and overcoming distrust."
"I expressed the strong belief that once this is achieved then a mutually acceptable solution of the problem can be found without much difficulty."
"But the Chinese government is refusing to accept my delegation till today."
"It is obvious that Beijing' s attitude has hardened significantly compared to the eighties when six Tibetan delegations from exile were accepted."
"Whatever explanations Beijing may give concerning communications between the Chinese government and myself I must state here clearly that the Chinese government is refusing to talk to the representatives I have designated for the task."
"The failure of the Chinese leadership to respond positively to my Middle Way Approach reaffirms the Tibetan people' s suspicion that the Chinese government has no interest whatsoever in any kind of peaceful co-existence."
"Many Tibetans believe that China is bent on complete forceful assimilation and absorption of Tibet into China."
"They call for the independence of Tibet and criticise my 'Middle Way Approach' ."
"Others are advocating a referendum in Tibet."
"They argue if conditions inside Tibet are as the Chinese authorities portray it to be and if the Tibetans are truly happy, then there should be no difficulty holding a plebiscite in Tibet."
"I have also always maintained that ultimately the Tibetan people must be able to decide about the future of Tibet as Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India, stated in the Indian Parliament on December 7. 1950: ""...the last voice in regard to Tibet should be the voice of the people of Tibet and nobody else."""
"While I firmly reject the use of violence as a means in our freedom struggle we certainly have the right to explore all other political options available to us."
"I am a staunch believer in freedom and democracy and have therefore been encouraging the Tibetans in exile to follow the democratic process."
"Today, the Tibetan refugees may be among the few communities in exile that have established all the three pillars of democracy: legislature, judiciary and executive."
"This year we have taken another big stride in the process of democratisation by having the chairman of the Tibetan Cabinet elected by popular vote."
"The elected chairman of the Cabinet and the elected parliament will shoulder the responsibility of running the Tibetan affairs as the legitimate representatives of the people."
"However, I consider it my moral obligation to the six million Tibetans to continue taking up the Tibetan issue with the Chinese leadership and to act as the free spokesman of the Tibetan people until a solution is reached."
"In the absence of any positive response from the Chinese government to my overtures over the years, I am left with no alternative but to appeal to the members of the international community."
"It is clear now that only increased, concerted and consistent international efforts will persuade Beijing to change its policy on Tibet."
"Although the immediate reactions from the Chinese side will be most probably negative, nevertheless, I strongly believe that expressions of international concern and support are essential for creating an environment conducive for the peaceful resolution of the Tibetan problem."
"On my part, I remain committed to the process of dialogue."
"It is my firm belief that dialogue and a willingness to look with honesty and clarity at the reality of Tibet can lead us to a mutually beneficial solution that will contribute to the stability and unity of the People' s Republic of China and secure the right for the Tibetan people to live in freedom, peace and dignity."
"Brothers and sisters of the European Parliament, I consider myself as the free spokesman for my captive countrymen and women."
"It is my duty to speak on their behalf."
"I speak not with a feeling of anger or hatred towards those who are responsible for the immense suffering of our people and the destruction of our land, homes, temples, monasteries and culture."
"They too are human beings who struggle to find happiness, and deserve our compassion."
"I speak to inform you of the sad situation in my country today and of the aspirations of my people, because in our struggle for freedom, truth is the only weapon we possess."
"Today, our people, our distinct rich cultural heritage and our national identity are facing the threat of extinction."
"We need your support to survive as a people and as a culture."
"When one looks at the situation inside Tibet it seems almost hopeless in the face of increasing repression, continuing environmental destruction, and the ongoing systematic undermining of the culture and identity of Tibet."
"Yet I believe that no matter how big and powerful China may be she is still part of the world."
"The global trend today is towards more openness, freedom, democracy and respect for human rights."
"Sooner or later China will have to follow the world trend and in the long run there is no way that China can escape from truth, justice and freedom."
"The consistent and principled engagement of the European Parliament with China will accelerate this process of change that is already taken place in China."
"Since the Tibetan issue is closely related with what is happening in China, I believe there is reason and ground for hope."
"I would like to thank the European Parliament for the consistent display of concern and support for the non-violent Tibetan freedom struggle."
"Your sympathy and support have always been a deep source of inspiration and encouragement to the Tibetan people both inside and outside Tibet."
"The numerous resolutions of the European Parliament on the issue of Tibet helped greatly to highlight the plight of the Tibetan people and raise the awareness of the public and governments in Europe and around the world of the issue of Tibet."
"I am especially encouraged by the European Parliament' s resolution calling for the appointment of an EU special representative for Tibet."
"I strongly believe that the implementation of this resolution will enable the European Union not only to help promote a peaceful resolution of the Tibetan issue through negotiations in a more consistent, effective and creative way but also provide support for other legitimate needs of the Tibetan people, including ways and means to preserve our distinct identity."
"This initiative will also send a strong signal to Beijing that the European Union is serious in encouraging and promoting a solution of the Tibetan problem."
"I have no doubt that your continued expressions of concern and support for Tibet will in the long run impact positively and help create the conducive political environment for a constructive dialogue on the issue of Tibet."
"I ask for your continued support in this critical time in our country' s history."
"I thank you for providing me the opportunity to share my thoughts with you."
"(The House rose and accorded the speaker a standing ovation)"
"As you can see, your Holiness, we are all very moved and I would like to thank you, on behalf of the European Parliament, for the great, noble message you have just addressed to us."
"You have been kind enough to point out that the European Parliament has always supported your action and your people."
"We have seen that you are well acquainted with the resolutions we have voted for in Parliament, always by a huge majority, if not practically unanimously, including as recently as last February."
"It is true that we realise, as you have pointed out, that the Tibetan people are being deprived of their fundamental freedoms, threatened with the destruction of their monasteries, which forge their moral and spiritual souls, and are threatened by a policy of marginalising the Tibetan people."
"You have reminded us of all these things, and you have told us very frankly that, unfortunately, the hand held out to the Chinese authorities has so far been ignored, and we have also noted, your Holiness, that you have never lost hope."
"You have this concern, but at the same time the great hope that the day will come when China, on opening up to the rest of the world, will finally hear your appeal, and that is a wish which we passionately share, but we can only join you in your desire, your Holiness."
"We have clearly heard the powerful appeal you have made to us."
"You have told us that if the international community, in this case the European Community, can join you in your efforts, perhaps the result we all wish to see could be within reach."
"I would simply like to assure you that you can count on the active support of our European Parliament, on the active support of our political groups, on the active support of the intergroup which, as you know, has been created precisely to further strengthen our friendship with the Tibetan people."
"You can count on our support, you can count on our indestructible loyalty so that, in the spirit of your proposals, Tibet can regain its freedom."
"Thank you again, your Holiness, for your presence and your message."
"(Loud applause) (The formal sitting was closed at 12.25 p.m.)"
"Madam President, I should like to put a point of order before Parliament today, at a time when we are about to vote on the most important act we are called upon to approve, that is, the budget."
"Nine people died yesterday in the St Gotthard tunnel because of a road accident."
"This places a greater onus on us when - under the heading of 'infrastructure' - we come to vote on the much-needed and now ever more pressing engineering works which must be Europe' s response to the problem of traffic across the Alpine passes."
"Today we shall be debating the reopening of the Mont Blanc tunnel, with all the economic and environmental problems that involves."
"Let us also remind ourselves of this: the incident in the St Gotthard tunnel was caused to a great extent by the additional volumes traffic that the St Gotthard, Brenner and other Alpine passes have had to absorb as a result of the closure of the Mont Blanc tunnel."
"We must therefore vote with conviction for the infrastructure funding to speed up the procedure involved in rebuilding the Brenner rail tunnel and the Fréjus rail tunnel, and move road vehicles onto trains, with benefits for the safety of those who travel and also for the surrounding environment."
"Let us remember that when we vote."
"Of course, Mr Santini."
"VOTE"
"Madam President, I am against this oral amendment."
"(With more than twelve Members standing, the oral amendment was not considered) Following the vote"
"Madam President, there has just been some enthusiastic applause because this vote has ended."
"I can understand why, as this is always a protracted event."
"However, I would like to ask you to put one other amendment to the vote."
"I should have said this at the beginning, but we were already proceeding with the voting."
"It is about the Court of Auditors."
"We have now voted on an amount of 1 million in the line to build an extension for the Court of Auditors."
"As the Committee on Budgets, we would like to ask for another EUR 6 million to be entered in the reserve so that additional capital can be injected during the coming year."
"This will ultimately produce considerable savings for the taxpayer and will also create extra scope in future budgets."
"I would also like to ask you to put this last amendment to the vote, which entails entering a further EUR 6 million in the reserve in budget line 206."
"(Parliament gave its assent)"
"Report (A5-0330/2001) by Mr Costa Neves, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2002 (C5-0300/2001 - 2000/2324(BUD)) and Letter of amendment No 1/2002 (12733/2001 - C5-0495/2001) to the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2002 (Section III - Commission)"
"Following the vote"
"Madam President, the vote has now been taken, but during the vote on the budget, we spoke against this idea and, as a result, this item was removed from the budget."
"We are now voting in favour of this paragraph, which is not how we voted on the budget."
"There is, therefore, a contradiction now, of which the House must be aware."
"The fact is, however, that the vote has been taken."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Report (A5-0329/2001) by Mrs Buitenweg, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2002 (C5-0300/2001 - 2000/2325(BUD)) and Letter of amendment No 1/2002 (12733/2001 - C5-0495/2001) to the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2002"

"Section VII - Committee of the Regions"
"Section VIII (A) - European Ombudsman"
"Section VIII (B) - European Data Protection Supervisor"
"With regard to Paragraph 39"
"Mrs Buitenweg, you have an oral amendment, I think, on Paragraph 39, following the vote on the budget."
"Would you be so kind as to explain this to us once more, so that we can proceed to the vote?"
"I will do it in English."
"It is about what I originally said about the conditions under which we will release the amounts or the items which we entered in the reserve in the last vote."
"These are the conditions specified in Amendment No 73 of the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"This is in accordance with what we discussed earlier, and this is the most straightforward way."
"We must therefore amend the text in the way we have just voted."
"It says:"
"""The money can be released after a favourable opinion from Parliaments' committee responsible for the relations with the Court of Auditors, once the Court has given updated information on its current staffing problems and on how additional staff would enable the Court to assess the performance of financial control systems in the candidate countries, improve its cooperation with the national audit institutions (requirement of Treaty of Nice) and establish more detailed specific DAS assessment."""
"(The President noted that there was no opposition to the oral amendment being considered)"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Madam President, on Tuesday Mrs Morgan raised the issue of the letter that the Bureau sent to Mr Prodi on reform of the Commission, taking a very different stance from the position taken by the Commission."
"We have just voted on the report by Mrs Buitenweg and have approved Amendment No 4 by Mr Elles, which reiterates Parliament's wholehearted support for the Commission reforms."
"Will you now write to Mr Prodi and convey to him the reconfirmed, wholehearted support of this Parliament for radical reforms of the Commission's staff regulations?"
"Madam President, I think that we have all noticed from your tone of voice that you have shown a great deal of personal stoicism in presiding over this part-session despite your ill health."
"I would like to say, on behalf of all the 'budgeteers' and in the name, I believe, of all my fellow Members, that we are very grateful to you for presiding over the votes on the budget in the first and second reading."
"Madam President, I of course share the sentiments expressed by Mr Bourlanges."
"However, we have to look into the question asked by Mr van Hulten, because, when it was raised by Mrs Morgan earlier on this week when Mr Provan was in the chair, he said he would examine whether it was possible to see what was going to happen."
"Therefore, maybe you could respond to Mr van Hulten' s question and possibly discuss this matter with the Bureau, that will meet to clarify the situation."
"Mr President, I am sorry Mrs Fontaine had to leave, so perhaps you would pass on my remarks to her."
"As the House will know, I spent a great deal of time studying the reform process on behalf of the House last year and continued to follow it through the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"I understand exactly the points that Mrs Fontaine made but, I ask you, on behalf of all Members of this House, to keep us better informed of the process."
"This was the point that I raised back in September when I asked the presidency to give us the same level of information about the progress of the reforms as we are receiving from the Commission."
"Mr Kinnock has given us a comprehensive timetable about the progress of the reform discussions."
"This House, these Members, have no information whatsoever from the Bureau about the reform process."
"I ask you to be much more transparent and to give us a progress report on these reforms."
"Your request will be passed on, but you will understand that, given the votes that have yet to be taken and that will take up much time, I cannot extend this debate any longer."
"Have courage. Mrs Fontaine showed hers in remaining in the chair despite her state of ill health."
"Mr Fatuzzo still has much work to do this morning, so we should all take heart."

"On Paragraph 9"
"Mr President, on behalf of my colleagues in the Socialist and the Christian Democratic Group I would like to make an oral amendment to paragraph 9."
"It should read as follows: ""...welcomes the fact that the Commission came forward with the announced packet of the three climate change proposals""."
"The Commission came forward the day before yesterday with the three proposals, we have to correct that."
"I also want to congratulate the Commission for doing this before the very important climate change conference in Marrakesh, COP 7."

"On Amendment No 8"
"Mr President, by agreement with the rapporteur I would like to make an oral amendment."
"I only have the English text with me now."
"It should read: ""Insists on the immediate abolition of the death penalty..."" instead of ""Reiterates its call for the immediate abolition of the death penalty..."""
"(The President noted that there was no opposition to considering the oral amendment) On paragraph 10"
"Mr President, for the sake of compromise here, too, we would like to propose the following, which is submitted with the rapporteur' s cooperation and agreement."
"It should read: "" Urges Turkey to propose in the coming year a precise timetable ..."", in other words we would insert: ""in the coming year""."

"Motion for a resolution (B5-0695/2001), by Mr Wurtz, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on the conclusions of the Ghent European Council of 19 October"
"Mr President, I want to make a point on the European Council in Ghent."
"It is a suggestion from the ELDR Group, the Greens and the Socialists on paragraph 7, where we each have tabled an amendment, Amendments Nos 13, 9 and 5 respectively."
"The suggestion is an oral amendment to merge all of them to add at the end of paragraph 7: ""which adequately represents women, respects their human rights and ensures that Afghan women participate fully in building such a future""."
"The only problem, Mrs Ludford, is that we are at present dealing with a resolution by our Group."
"We have not yet moved on to the joint motion for a resolution, so you are jumping ahead."
"We must first ascertain whether or not there is a majority on the first resolution."
"(Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution)"
"Joint motion for a resolution on the results of the informal meeting of the European Council held at Ghent on 19 October 2001."
"Mr President, I would like to ask for an explanation as to whether, when the amendments are merged, the word ""commitment"" should be kept in the text as set out in the Socialist amendment."
"In other words, it would be ""a commitment"" to do this."
"I think the implication is that this is the case, that the word ""commitment"" should also appear in the merged text."
"Mr President, one of the reasons that I was motivated to suggest this oral amendment which brings the three together is that in the English text, the Socialist amendment does not read very well."
"When it says we should include a ""compromise in favour of Afghan women"", that, in English, could be read as suggesting that we compromise the interests of Afghan women."
"It is not a happy wording in English."
"It means a settlement."
"""Compromise"" is not a good translation of ""compromis""."
"That was one of the reasons why I ventured to suggest that we try to merge the three and therefore, in English, we get rid of the word ""compromise"", which is ambiguous."
"Mr President, I would just like to make a correction of a linguistic nature."
"The translation into English of the Spanish word 'compromiso' is 'commitment' and not 'compromise' ."

"Mr President, I would like to point out that we, the Group of the European People's Party/European Democrats, tabled Amendment No 6 to recital A and that we want the words ""supply constraints"" in the fourth line of the English text to be replaced by the word ""quotas"" because that is the correct term."

"Are any Members opposed to this oral amendment being considered?"
"Mr President, by agreement with the proposers I would like to ask that we keep ""looks to the Member States"" and add ""and the Council"" ."
"Is there any opposition to the addition of ""and by the Council""?"
"There seems not to be."
"We will therefore include this oral suggestion."

"In the spirit of compromise and in order for this amendment to passed, I suggest that we add on the end of paragraph 37: ""and to assist in the fight against terrorism""."
"(The President noted that there was no opposition to considering the oral amendment)"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution) EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE"
"General Budget for 2002"
". (NL) During the vote on the 2002 draft budget, the delegation of the Dutch People' s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) in the ELDR group stated that it was against the increase in the category 2 payment appropriations."
"The European Commission stated that these increases could not be absorbed by the corresponding budget lines, and furthermore that these increases would result in higher contributions for Member States."
"The VVD delegation therefore does not regard this increase in payment appropriations as necessary."
"Nevertheless, the delegation did vote in favour of the increase in the category 2 commitment appropriations because it is of the opinion that proper programming of the structural funds is needed."
"We have generally voted against the Committee' s proposal to increase the agricultural expenditure in category 1."
"We think it unreasonable that approximately half the EU' s total annual budget should go on subsidising the production and export of agricultural products."
"Today' s common agricultural policy is not only expensive for the EU, it also contributes to higher consumer prices."
"The agricultural sector is, moreover, well protected from competition from foreign imports."
"This has a very distorting and destabilising effect on the world economy."
"The EU' s common agricultural policy constitutes, above all, a problem for the developing countries, for agriculture is an area in which the developing countries are competitive in relation to the industrialised world' s producers."
"The EU' s common agricultural policy presents major obstacles for the developing countries, partly due to the fact that the agriculture concerned is subsidised and protected against competition in the form of imports."
"The fact that the EU also subsidises tobacco cultivation is particularly anomalous."
"Subsidies for tobacco cultivation should be abolished as soon as possible."
"The EU' s activity and budget should instead be directed at cross-border problems which the Member States themselves cannot solve."
"The common agricultural policy shows a lack of solidarity with the developing countries and must be reformed immediately."
"Costa Neves Report (A5-0330/2001)"
"Mr President, the radical Members have a certain reputation for efficiency which my explanation of vote will go some way towards dispelling, as we made a mistake, a serious mistake, in the Budget vote, in respect of Amendment No 75 on the contribution to the funding of European political parties."
"Whilst being signatories to this amendment, which was intended to abolish the Budget line in question - because we not only believe that the idea of funding of European political parties is not at present justified, but there is no legal basis for it - we voted against the amendment which we had ourselves proposed."
"My explanation is therefore intended to correct, as far as possible, the result of the vote."
"We have already asked for the record to be adjusted."
"There is a mistake in our list of votes, which we are keen to put right."
"Otherwise, we judge the Costa Neves report in a positive light, but we were keen to emphasise this minor technical error with regard to Amendment No 75."
"Thank you very much, Mr President."
"Thank you, Mr Dell'Alba."
"The House had been wondering."
"Now it is completely enlightened."
"Mr President, should I give up making explanations of vote just because I have lost my voice?"
"With regard to the budget, I should like to say something about the section on the Commission."
"I voted for it, but this will be the last time, because I want to get some light on how the Commission works."
"On 1 January 2002 I shall set off on a long journey, like Odysseus when the Trojan War ended, through the maze of bureaucracy in the 13 523 offices of the Commission and its 33 728 staff."
"It will be a long, hard and difficult journey: I shall meet Polyphemus, I shall meet Circe, the sorceress, and perhaps in the end I shall see Penelope looking like our President Prodi."
"It will certainly be a shock, but I hope to be able to vote for it again next time."
". (FR) As is the case every year, the second October part-session is principally devoted to the adoption of the Community Budget."
"This is the only area in which Parliament can influence Community policy, as it possesses the power of codecision with the Council and, above all, has the right of veto."
"In a Europe where technocracy reigns and the democratic deficit prevails, it is, therefore, one of the few powers exercised by representatives elected by universal suffrage."
"Just like last year' s budget, the 2002 budget is a reflection of the free-market."
"As a Budget, it is characterised by austerity (0.3 % of European GDP), with an overall lack of financial resources, especially for employment policy, enlargement, and the management of crises, whether they be in food supplies, Afghanistan, Palestine or the Balkans."
"The rapporteur, Mr Costa Neves, rubber-stamps these tendencies as a whole by proposing an increase in payment appropriations - which is something of a positive step - but, at the same time, proposes the allocation to reserve of structural funds and somewhatobscure transfers from operations to administration - which is rather a backward move"
"For these reasons, we cannot support either the report or the 2002 draft Budget."
"Buitenweg Report (A5-0329/2001)"
"Mr President, I voted for Mrs Buitenweg' s report on the budget, but I should like to stress very strongly and loudly here in Parliament, with so many members present on this occasion, that the Pensioners' Party - which I have the honour to represent in this House - believes that the European Parliament, which now legislates on fifty per cent of all national laws, which are adaptations to the directives that we approve here, should have greater funding and better organisation in order to function as befits a supranational Parliament, a Parliament with so many important duties."
"- (FI) I, together with my group, supported the change over to a reimbursement system based on receipted costs with regard to reimbursement of travel expenses, secretarial costs and office costs."
"My group interprets the wording used in the first amendment to mean that there is now no proper procedure at all."
"At the same time, the amendment totally ignores the fact that the decision is now in the hands of the Council."
"Parliament has proposed the procedure intended by this amendment and is prepared to adopt it, but the Council has not been able to give the necessary approval."
"On the basis of the above, my group feels that the amendment puts Parliament in a bad light, unduly and unfairly."
"Budget debates are great moments for Parliament because they afford us an opportunity to make a comprehensive review of past and future policy."
"Unfortunately time does not allow me to do so."
"I would therefore like to confine myself to just one point, that is the situation in the border regions of the Member States adjoining the candidate countries."
"It is beyond question that today' s border regions will benefit from European Union enlargement in the long term since there will be totally new opportunities for economic, cultural, social and administrative regional cooperation."
"Nevertheless, in the short term there will be tremendous pressure as they adjust to specific problems arising out of the very different levels of development, especially in the social field."
"I need only point out that the earnings gap between East and West is around 60%."
"This raises questions that did not arise with earlier enlargements and which take on a new dimension."
"The anticipated problems on the local labour and service markets will not be overcome without a great deal of effort."
"Large numbers of daily commuters will put enormous pressure on an already tight labour market - in Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania alone unemployment rates in excess of 20% are quite common."
"Cheap services with wage costs around 60% lower will be a tremendous challenge for SMEs and craft trades."
"Local and regional governments and administrations believe that the Commission' s proposed programme of assistance to border regions fails to match the scale of the challenge."
"I therefore welcome the inclusion of a special budget line for border regions."
"But I also call for additional Union funding to be made available as quickly as possible to reassure the border region citizens affected that their concerns and needs are not going unnoticed."
"We need a basis in law, and the Commission must create it very quickly."
"Seppänen Report (A5-0342/2001)"
". (FR) As is plain to see, we voted against the ECSC budget, which, as it will do until the expiry of the ECSC Treaty, continues to pump subsidies to shareholders in the steel industry."
"Substantial sums have already been handed out to the bosses in this sector, allowing them to move over to lucrative new sectors, while many of the workers whose jobs have been abolished are still unemployed."
"This report proposes the integration of social security assistance into the Budget of the European Union; but there is a need to guarantee, as a minimum, that all the workers affected by future job losses will receive the whole of their salary up to the age of retirement."
"van Dam Report (A5-0326/2001)"
"Mr President, you know - as, I believe, everybody does - that in the early years of my working life I was a seaman."
"I am therefore particularly concerned about safety and the safeguarding of human life at sea, and not only at sea but also when freight is being unloaded from ships in port."
"This document is attempting to do something to improve safety for the lives of the seamen who work in ports."
"Ports are very important for Italy - especially the port of Genoa, where I was born, and the port of Livorno, where I was a short time ago."
"All ports are important, like the port of Marseille and those on the other coasts of Europe, which is the union of countries that has the largest number of seafaring people."
"We must continue to do everything possible to safeguard human lives at sea, as we are doing in this document."
"Vatanen Report (A5-0327/2001)"
"Mr President, I voted for the report by my friend Mr Vatanen, who will be disappointed at having been the rapporteur of a document that can do so little for transport; it does, however, do something for bureaucracy."
"Well, I would like to tell him: we have not managed to get rid of bureaucracy - and not just in sea transport - but can we manage to get rid of bureaucracy at least in the payment of pensions and the granting of pensions?"
"Mr President, there are pensioners who die because of bureaucracy, without having drawn their pensions."
"Of course, they go to Heaven; they know when they get there."
"These pensioners deserve to go to Heaven, as all pensioners do, but it would be better if their pensions arrived while they were still alive!"
"Lamassoure Report (A5-0338/2001)"
"Mr President, I voted for the report on aid to Turkey, but I want to say that the Pensioners' Party and I personally ask the European Union to be braver."
"The 12 countries that have applied to join the European Union should all be admitted in 2004 without any further conditions, because this would be a courageous political act: they have been waiting for fifty years to feel really European."
"Did the six countries that signed the Treaty of Rome, Mr President, have to include the Community acquis in their own statute books before signing?"
"There was no Community directive, but even so a great Europe was formed through an important political act."
"I tell you: we can let in all 12 countries in 2004, whatever their legislative situation may be."
". I have voted against the Report on Turkey."
"Turkey has not yet taken the necessary measures to fully restore the political rights of the Kurdish people, suppress torture and abolish the special security courts and prisons that drive prisoners to go on hunger strikes which have claimed more than 70 victims already."
"Turkey has not even fixed a precise timetable for fulfilling the political criteria of Copenhagen."
"We are giving up human rights for geopolitical and military reasons."
"That is not admissible in a democratic Parliament."
". (NL) Some politicians are keen to bring Turkey into the European Union before that country has radically changed."
"They are therefore prepared to turn a blind eye to a number of extremely negative consequences."
"Admitting a country like this, which is an exceptional case, will have a fundamental impact on the existing standards for democratic freedom and human rights in the EU."
"The rapporteur wanted to create the impression that in Turkey it was a question of minor deficiencies which could be resolved quickly and easily."
"Fortunately, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence Policy has adopted a more critical stance, but still not critical enough by far."
"In fact, the announced reforms are heading in the right direction, but do not yet go very far at all."
"The release of prisoners and the abolition of the death penalty apply to criminal prisoners but not yet to political opponents, whose rights they refuse to recognise."
"The mass murder of Armenians is still denied or justified as a normal way of suppressing opposition, which they want to continue to be able to use in the future."
"The displaced populations from 3 500 destroyed Kurdish villages in the south-east are not being allowed to return to the area."
"Fear of what is called ""separatism"" results in a language, songs and writings being punishable."
"This country is still a long way from being en route to the EU."
". (FR) The issue of Turkey brings us back with a jolt to the question of what kind of Europe we want."
"If the question is framed in terms of membership of a monolithic bloc, the Turkish question will be extremely difficult to resolve."
"It will suffice to consider the example of our shared external frontier."
"On the hypothesis that Europe will develop steadily towards variable geometry, nothing, then, prevents the involvement of Turkey in certain European policies in fields where there is a real commonality of interests."
"If, on the contrary, we hold fast to a rigid conception of the European Union, the only outcome, in the long term, will be the reversal of the decision made at Helsinki and the resumption of an association process with Turkey of the same kind as those we are developing with the other Mediterranean States which geography and history have placed outside Europe."
"I am, by the way, astonished to learn, from the Turkish Ambassador, that the rapporteur, Mr Lamassoure, was opposed to the amendments referring to the Armenian genocide, whilst the political group to which he belongs played an active part in having this crime recognised as such by the French National Assembly."
"Could this be a case of 'doublespeak' ?"
"Lamassoure Report (A5-0343/2001)"
"(FR) We voted against the Lamassoure Report ""on Turkey's progress towards accession"" as we cannot see how the rapporteur manages to reconcile Turkey's inclusion and his conception of a federal Europe with strong supranational powers."
"The rule of law must in fact relate to the identity of a people, and the practice of democracy falls under this heading."
"To date we have still not found a European people."
"What chance then of a Turco-European people?"
"In fact, the Lamassoure report's sole merit is that it brings into the cold light of day the contradictions of present-day Europe."
"If it proves necessary to establish firm cooperative links with Turkey, this cannot under any circumstances come about through a supranational power enacting regulations uniformly applicable to all, but must result from dialogue between one nation and another, within the European variable-geometry structure."
"Moreover, the Lamassoure Report finesses with the recognition of the Armenian genocide of 1917, doubtless aiming to appease Turkey."
"We believe there is a need to be more frank and to ask Turkey to acknowledge that the genocide took place."
"Obviously it is difficult, but it would not be the first country to regret a dark episode in its history."
"Turkey would then have to act consistently with the objective of true peace-making by re-establishing diplomatic relations with Armenia."
"."
"(FR) There are questions that will not go away; nor will the historic wounds that remain open in the Armenian community throughout the world."
"In its resolution in June 1987, the European Parliament asked Turkey to have the courage to look at its past with open eyes in order to be able to look towards the future."
"Democracy is guaranteed by historical truth, which cannot be bought or sold and cannot suffer at the hands of special interests, be they financial or economic."
"What is at issue today is not recognition of the Armenian genocide's reality, as this House has already had occasion to declare that in 1987."
"In asking that the Lamassoure Report should make reference to the genocide, I was not seeking to revive ancestral hatreds or to blow on the embers of intolerance, but to echo the legitimate concerns expressed in Armenian communities."
"The children of Armenia who were exiled to our countries at the beginning of the century expect today an act of justice."
"They want a 'moral resting-place' for their ancestors."
"Remembrance is an even more pressing duty at this time when the last witnesses to the exile, the last to escape the carnage, are themselves quietly dying away."
"I am convinced that joining the EU implies adherence to the fundamental principles in accordance with which it was created; democracy, respect for human rights and for the rights of minorities."
"Such a step invites each one of the candidate countries to take up the burden of its past in order to be able to make its peace with its own history."
"I regret that this House has not followed me in doing this."
". (FR) I abstained on this motion for a resolution."
"I regret that the European Parliament has not felt able to show consistency in rejecting the amendments asking Turkey to continue dialogue on acknowledgement of the Armenian genocide."
"In fact, last year, Parliament openly committed itself to calling upon the Turkish government to recognise this period of its history."
"Today, under a cloak of expediency, this House has demonstrated its hypocrisy."
"As regards Turkey's possible accession to the European Union, I would remind you that the real question of the frontiers of Europe is still an open one."
"At a distance from the peoples involved, we carry on discussing the hypothetical accession of this country to the EU without putting the real question, which is to do with the identity and outline of Europe."
"The Commission and Parliament would be better advised to explore ways by which Turkey can be associated with the EU rather than directly integrated into it."
"), in writing. (FR) This report on progress towards accession to the European Union is being presented in a very specific context."
"Firstly, Turkey is weighed down by the burden of its foreign debt (over EUR 120 billion) and in consequence has to set aside almost 70% of its budget to service it."
"The spiralling debt results in a programme of austerity and structural reform which has brought in its wake massive unemployment and broad cuts in social security expenditure."
"As well as economic difficulties, there is a worsening political situation, especially for prisoners of conscience, a persistent denial of the rights of the Kurds, failure to acknowledge the Armenian genocide, and in more general terms a lack of regard for the democratic rights of Turkey' s population."
"Despite the fact that the report takes account of the social repercussions of the prolonged economic and financial crisis, pleads in favour of rapid payment of EU financial aid to accompany reforms especially in the social sphere, especially as regards the establishment of the rule of law and the promotion of civil society and even though it considers the - admittedly increased - amount of aid granted to Turkey not yet to reflect the importance attached to Turkey's trade relations with the EU; and insists on the need for Turkey to equip itself with modern legislation on the right to strike and on collective negotiation, it is not for European governments or for the Turkish Government to determine the conditions for membership."
"It is for the people of Turkey to decide and they must be consulted by means of a referendum."
"It is for these reasons that we did not vote in favour of this report."
"Gahrton Report (A5-0366/2001)"
". (NL) Given the characteristics of the World Trade Organisation, I wonder how a large and poor country hopes to benefit from it."
"I would advise China to stay out of it and to rather rely on self-support than participation in world trade."
"But I also agree that China' s accession should not be refused if she asks for it herself. The People's Republic of China was internationally isolated for many years and was not recognised by most countries."
"Since it was ultimately recognised, the territory on the island of Taiwan that is controlled by the successors to the government driven out in 1949 is regarded as a non-recognised state, which is something we should now try to find a solution for."
"On the one hand, there are economic and military ties, and on the other, some people act as if she does not exist."
"It is just as contrived to automatically allocate Taiwan to China as it was to allocate China's territory to Taiwan in the past."
"The two territories have grown far apart over the past 50 years or more, and there have always been ethnic differences anyway."
"I reluctantly endorse the proposed structures, but they will not solve the real problems."
"Ghent European Council (RC B5-0696/2001)"
". (EL) The leaders of the European Union found yet another opportunity at the interim summit in Ghent to side with American imperialism and support their audacious plans in central Asia, which involve bombing and murdering the Afghans."
"They clearly stated that they intend to prepare a regime (obviously which meets with their approval) to succeed the Taliban and are willing to help ""reconstruct"" Afghanistan, thereby revealing their ulterior motive of ensuring that they are involved in sharing out the booty when the time comes."
"In addition, they are planning close collaboration with the USA on a whole series of issues, including judicial assistance."
"As regards the ""enemy within"", the summit is planning to speed up anti-democratic legislative arrangements on a common definition of terrorism and a common European arrest warrant at a speed which is revelatory of their intentions."
"As for the Middle East, the summit confines itself to a few general pronouncements on a Palestine state and talks of stopping the violence, without making any reference to Israeli aggression."
"This is a summit which, just like previous summits, is brimming with anti-grass roots measures and aggressive action against the people; a summit which should give the people of the Member States and of the entire world cause for concern and every reason to step up their fight; a summit which confirms the imperialist nature of the European Union yet again and should be a lesson to all those who proclaim that the ÅU can act as a counterweight to American aggression."
"The joint motion contains nothing more than sickening praise for the summit's decisions and shows absolutely no sign of sensitivity to the consequences which these decision will have both within the EU and in the world as a whole, which is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against it."
"(FR) The European Council in Ghent has just taken note of a Commission report on the preparation for the changeover to euro notes and coins, which presents forty ""good practices"" suggested to banks, governments and retailers in Member States ""in order to make up for lost time""."
"This parenthetical remark by the Commission must surely pull us up short."
"Why has time been wasted, although the date for the changeover of notes and coins has been set for a long time, and governments had all the time in the world to prepare themselves?"
"The most probable explanation is this: the authorities seem to have thought that private citizens, being in any case caught in the trap, would be obliged to adapt themselves."
"Under these circumstances, why should they tire themselves out?"
"This attitude says much about the thinking behind an operation which was deceitfully presented as being entirely centred on the improved comfort of citizens."
"In addition, when you look down the list of the ""forty good practices "", you notice that they are minor low-level gimmicks - ranging from the early labelling of prices in euros to longer opening hours at bank counters - whose effect can only be marginal."
"But major actions that could conceivably lessen citizens' difficulties, whether financial (reimbursing tradesmen and small businesses for their efforts at adaptation) or technical (stating both the euro value and the value in the national currency on notes and coins), have been firmly excluded."
"It is true that dual-denomination notes or coins would have required thought at an earlier stage and for that there would have had to be a real concern to lighten the burden on private individuals."
"Nothing, though, could be more foreign to the inventors of the single currency."
"Perhaps - as, after all, clouds do have silver linings - citizens will see at the beginning of next year that in fact they had counted for little in the introduction of the single currency. And then they might learn a few truths about the true nature of Brussels."
"Although we welcome some aspects of the resolution that has been adopted today by the European Parliament, we must express our reservations and criticism of some very negative aspects, specifically its support for the war strategy that the USA is implementing in Afghanistan, which will not only fail to resolve any problems but will actually worsen the humanitarian crisis and incidences of racism and xenophobia."
"We are also critical of the relentless political pressure to speed up the militarisation of the EU and the communitisation of aspects of 'justice and home affairs' , through the 'creation of a genuine European judicial area.'"
"What is particularly worrying is the fact that proposals have been tabled for creating a 'European search and arrest warrant' or the controversial and dangerous common definition of terrorist acts as well as measures that represent a serious attack on fundamental freedoms, guarantees and rights linked to the coordination and effectiveness of law enforcement in the framework of cooperation with the USA."
"Nor can we fail to mention the symptomatic absence from the resolution of any critical reference to the Ghent Council decisions on confirming compliance with the 'Growth and Stability' pact, with maintaining the policy of wage moderation, or the reform of the labour markets, the processes of liberalising public services - of which the recent decision on postal services is one example - the reform of public services in social provision or the Council' s announcement of the launch of a new round of negotiations at the WTO."
"These measures will have a serious effect on the interests of workers and of the communities in the various countries of the EU."
"With regard to the creation of a 'preparatory convention' for the new IGC, we feel its prime objective is an attempt to limit or impose conditions on the sovereign decisions of governments and national parliaments."
"This is why we have voted against this motion for a resolution."
"(FR) Like its predecessors, the informal summit in Ghent showed the disagreements that exist between the various Heads of State, which have been the subject of a great deal of comment in the media."
"Over and above this apparent discord, though, there has been unanimity on one essential point: the EU is well and truly at war and it is going to back up its commitment to join in combat."
"Its repressive arsenal is moving ahead by leaps and bounds:"
"The Rapid Strike Force will become reality;"
"A European Judicial Area will allow the creation of one public prosecution authority and harmonise punishments;"
"The prerogatives of Europol are going to be strengthened."
"Without doubt, the most immediate threat to citizens' liberties is the introduction of a European arrest warrant, which, by creating an exceptional law for all the supposed terrorists, will make greater repression possible across the whole of the EU."
"The definition of a terrorist has been made broader, and will be able to be applied to all who resist an unjust and intolerable order."
"There was clearly no space at this summit for a social Europe; on the contrary, the summit demanded pay restraint and far-reaching reform of the labour market."
"In Ghent, social Europe was on the streets - in the demonstrations organised by the young and by the workers."
"Therefore, out of support for these events, we will be voting against this resolution on the results of the Ghent Summit."
". (IT) The fundamentalist terrorist attacks have not only destroyed the 'twin towers' in New York but also seem to have played a major part in demystifying two other 'pillars' on the eastern shores of the Atlantic: the common defence policy and the European foreign policy."
"The devastating success of this latest attack was helped by the theatrical contribution of certain European governments. Throwing aside years upon years of declarations of intention to define a European foreign policy and good proposals for military integration, they have raised their banners as 'national powers' without even having either any real power by themselves to address the world crisis or the credibility to ensure European security."
"The three-sided mini-summit, held an hour before the informal Summit of the Fifteen, was a demonstration of the collapse that has also hit Europe."
"The statements on fighting terrorism handed out for signing at the end of the informal Summit are worthless."
"We have be accustomed to reading wonderful final declarations for decades now, but these contradict the facts and create genuine bafflement about this 'non-existent Europe' , which unites around statements and then vanishes immediately when it comes to operating and acting in unity to address the crises that threaten world peace."
"Given these conditions, I believe the promotion of the European Union as a political entity is the principal task we need to address."
"The Ghent 'triumvirate' , which did not even invite the High Representative for European foreign policy, did not have this objective, concerned as they were - and are - with fighting for their leadership or the next elections."
"One of them spoke of 'a new leading role in foreign and defence policy for Germany' , forgetting to add - as has been the case for 56 years now, as an attentive leader writer pointed out - 'within Europe' ."
"Just an oversight as regards 'precedents' , or clear national political will?"
"This 'triumvirate' would not deserve any critical mention if there were not another triumvirate looming up on the horizon, a really heavyweight one this time, formed by the USA, Russia and the People's Republic of China."
"The Ghent triumvirate - 'an affront to Italy and Europe,' as Mr Prodi has said - with a Europe deprived of strength, will be a featherweight in the international ring and, what is more, will weaken the little bit of Europe that exists."
"In its place there should, instead, be a new, strong Europe, proud to be so, and seen as essential in maintaining regional balances of power."
"The forthcoming European Council in Laeken must cancel out the ambiguities and contradictions found in Ghent."
"To achieve this goal, it must issue itself a momentous challenge: to turn words into deeds and initiate 'enhanced cooperation' in the sphere of a political Europe."
"This will also benefit economic and financial stability, because it would also correct the anomaly of a European central bank without a European government behind it."
"With the current situation in tatters, however, is such a challenge feasible?"
"I cannot help thinking that the road of integration will lead to greater cohesion of the parties involved."
"15 countries acting more cohesively in the area of security and defence - and therefore with a definite foreign policy - will, without doubt, be a much more effective force in the fight against international terrorism and in peacekeeping."
"Having said that, and expressing a reservation about the 'convention' method for drawing up the institutional reform project, I vote for the resolution, in the hope that declarations will, at last, be followed up with deeds."
"Twenty million Afghans are being hit hard by bombings being carried out for reasons over which they have had no influence."
"The UN Commissioner for Human Rights has appealed for a necessary suspension of the bombing in order to get food out to the population before the winter."
"Three years of drought have made the supply situation untenable."
"I have therefore supported Amendments 2 and 3 in the vote on the resolution concerning the European Council' s informal meeting in Ghent."
"A further prerequisite, however, is that the Taliban should allow supplies to reach those who need them."
"We also appeal to Pakistan to allow the refugees to be afforded protection."
"Poos Report (A5-0308/2001)"
"Mr President, I voted for the report but, both personally and on behalf of the Pensioners' Party and as a convinced Europeanist, I ask that the Council should have less powers and Parliament have more powers."
"We know that the Council is elected by those elected by the citizens, but the European Parliament is elected directly by the citizens."
"We are Europe!"
"Parliament should have the power to legislate, and the Council can have some little legislative duty that affects all the Member States, like defence and foreign policy, but not too much."
"I therefore insist that everything possible should be done to give the European Parliament all the power it deserves, as against the Council, whose powers should instead be reduced, since it does not deserve them."
"We note that you want to pension the Council off, which is fairly normal in view of your political career."
"The reason why 'the role of High Representative for the CFSP and that of the Commissioner responsible for external relations should be merged and assigned to a Commission Vice-President' is that it will be difficult in the long term to maintain the double channels of command that apply to policy in the second pillar."
"It is problematic - from the points of view both of clarity and of the budget - for the EU to maintain two external relations administrations for the purpose of implementing foreign policy."
"That does not however mean that we in any way support supranationalism within the areas of the second pillar."
"We do not therefore want the CFSP to be incorporated into the first, or Community, pillar."
"The above position also applies to the relevant passage in paragraph 3 of the report on the progress made in implementing the Common Foreign and Security Policy (A5-332/2001 Rapporteur: Mr Brok)."
". (FR) The Poos Report sets out some interesting technical reforms to enable Councils to work better ""in a permanent legislative framework"" without amending the Treaties."
"It is, though, surprising that we do not find there the most obvious reform to make the work of the General Affairs Council easier and reduce the overload on it which is the main problem today: its division into a General Coordination Council (dealing with the general organisation of work, and issues concerning the EU institutions) and a Foreign Affairs Council, which would obviously be of a purely inter-Governmental nature."
"This simple and practical reform is not endorsed by the federalists, fearing as they do that it would draw the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy from the new Foreign Affairs Council, whereas they want to bring him into the bosom of the Community by installing him at the Commission, thereby giving it powers in terms of foreign policy."
"Their proposal is not realistic."
"More broadly speaking, the Poos Report does not seek to anticipate what the Europe of tomorrow will be like and to work out from that how the Council should evolve."
"It will be a Europe with many and diverse Member States, so it will have to be a variable-geometry Europe."
"For the same reason, it will be a Europe in which the Community method will often be seen as too rigid, and in which there will be a lot of room for the intergovernmental approach, hence a Europe in which the distinction between the ""pillars"" of the Treaty will have long-term validity."
"It will, finally, be a Europe in which the present-day appropriation of power by Brussels will have come to an end - at least let us hope so - and in which national democracies will again make their voices heard."
"These broad strokes lead us to design a future central position for the Council, one which should give it a greater initiatory role (although the task of drafting legislation will have to be better shared) and one of coordinating the pillars, the various circles, the national and European levels."
"It would now be useful to begin discussing these ideas."
". (FR) The fact that we have voted against Council reform does not imply that we prefer the way it works at present."
"It is not the constitutional form of the Council that is important - although much could be said about its anti-democratic character - but its essence."
"The basic reason for the Council's existence is to manage the collective affairs of the property-owning classes in the various European countries, so that their respective interests do not conflict and that a general consensus may be established."
"The European Council, though, no more represents the interests of the majority of the EU's population than the various governments represent the real interests of their own peoples."
"The apparently democratic way in which national governments are appointed after elections does not prevent them being at the service of their countries' big bosses."
"All the more is this true of Europe's executive, which is not even obliged to seek election."
"We do not guarantee the present or the eventually reformed functioning of the European institutions."
". (PT) The Poos report on the reform of the Council is controversial and contradictory and, albeit rather timidly, further clears the way for European federalism."
"On the one hand, it contains positive aspects on improving transparency, not to mention the concept of change in the institutions in an enlarged European Union, in its references to the workings of the Council and to greater participation by national and regional parliaments in EU policy."
"On the other hand, it puts forward some highly controversial ideas, specifically transferring the responsibilities of the High Representative of the CFSP to the Commission, thereby reducing the powers of the Council and further communitising this important policy, which we must, of course, oppose."
"At the same time, it puts forward working methods for the Council that could have a damaging effect on the role of national governments, moving towards greater federalism, which include: strengthening the General Affairs Council, so that its meetings are held regularly, weekly even, attended by ministers; and a distinction being made between the legislative and executive Council, which must operate openly, which would seem to be moving towards the creation of some kind of European Union Senate."
"Therefore, in voting against this motion, we confirm our opposition to this path to federalism without undermining the report' s positive aspects."
"."
"(FR) Council reform?"
"Public opinion throughout Europe plainly sees evidence that this is needed, as also evidence of the democratic deficit in European structures."
"The absolute requirements of this reform should be the reinforcement of democracy and transparency, the involvement of citizens and control by them."
"One should also beware of explaining, as the rapporteur does, that all the dysfunctions result from disregard of the Treaties or even from the loss of power by the Commission and the ""General Affairs"" Council."
"Over and above structural improvements such as the strengthening of Parliament's role, control and monitoring of the Commission and the Council, greater power being given to citizens, whether directly or indirectly - by way of associations, trades unions, etc - there is the need today to discuss the direction of this European project which is dominated by free-market thinking, the very antithesis of democracy and of provision for social needs."
"New institutions for another Europe - that is what should be the topic put forward for the peoples of Europe to discuss and vote on."
"It is for this reason that we have not voted in favour of the Poos Report."
". I was delighted to cast my vote in favour of the excellent report by Mr Poos."
"As a representative of Scotland and a member of the European Free Alliance section of my Group, I particularly welcome paragraph 13 of the report, calling for the involvement of ""national parliaments and, in federal or highly regionalised States, the regional authorities including participation in the Council itself according to Article 203 of the EC Treaty."""
"For Scotland and similar countries this will only be a start, but it will be an important one."
"This Parliament is concerned about the democratic deficit."
"To remedy this, let us seek to secure a greater role for devolved parliaments in making European law."
"If parliamentarians at all levels in Europe are to be engaged effectively, there must be open and public legislative debate in the Council."
"We must highlight the need for publicity and openness in the Council, as stipulated in paragraph 26 of the report."
"The reforms urged in this report all go in the right direction."
". (NL) As former Luxembourg minister, Mr Poos knows how the Council works, and he has put this to good use."
"He is right to raise the matter of meeting behind closed doors, which is inconsistent with the principles of democracy and openness."
"He also proposes that joint committees only prepare resolutions instead of taking them themselves."
"He also wants the strange new post of High Representative for the common foreign and security policy, which is developing into a European super-minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence, but which cannot be called to account politically in this area, to be integrated into the European Commission's portfolio for external relations."
"Mr Poos limits himself to what is feasible within the existing treaties and the current power relations, because this would be able to be achieved quickly."
"I support him in this. However, even if these reforms are implemented, the Council remains an absurdity, a remnant from the early days of the three European Communities, which is backing out of national parliaments and the EP."
"National ministers used to act as negotiators on the formation of an interest grouping and were also entitled to exercise their veto rights."
"They no longer have this in their current function, in which they act as a senate which cannot be called to account and a government at the same time."
"The national parliaments must take over their task."
"The continued existence of the Council will have an adverse effect on parliamentary democracy."
"World Trade Organisation (RC B5-0691/2001)"
"(FR) We have voted against the joint resolution submitted by the European People's Party and Socialist Groups on the forthcoming ministerial conference of the WTO in Qatar in November, as it seems to us that it is yet again trapping us by agreeing to the opening of new international trade negotiations without adequate clarification of what the ground rules are and what objectives are in view."
"Commissioner Lamy's speech yesterday leads us to conclude that, even though he is striving to present a wide range of objectives for future negotiations (liberalisation, regulation, the involvement of developing countries, the taking into account of sustainable development), liberalisation is still indeed the primary objective."
"Moreover, the WTO's reference documents, which are centred on too strictly commercial a view of trade, inherently tend towards the adoption of this objective."
"Matters would be made worse still if the negotiating mandate included investment among the WTO's competencies, as this would risk the revival of the Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI), of infamous memory."
"We would, though, not wish to suggest that liberalisation is in itself bad, as a party of the Left thinks."
"We do think, though, that there is now the need for a pause."
"Time must be found to draw up a clear balance sheet on the Uruguay Round."
"On that basis, negotiations must indeed be opened, but with this primary mandate: to consider how to guarantee to every society, to every national democracy, the right to choose how to live."
"Liberalisation will produce all its benefits only if we have first provided a definite answer to this question."
". (EL) The demonstrations in Seattle, Prague and Genoa were an expression of the increasing anxiety at grass-roots level about the consequences of globalisation."
"This massive popular reaction shows that even the regulations of the WTO are socially unacceptable."
"The demonstrations, which were attended by demonstrators from around the world, were one of the deciding factors in bringing down the talks."
"The WTO, the main objective of which is to fully liberalise trade, is basically promoting a process of neo-colonialism and is now one of the mainstays of the new world order."
"The rules of the WTO serve to promote the interests of dominant multinational companies which already monopolise certain international markets and are therefore the stuff of nightmares for developing countries and workers as they watch their rights being eroded."
"The large countries are promoting the interests of their multinationals, at the expense of the less developed countries, without so much as a word about the long-standing request of these countries to have their debts cancelled."
"In the agricultural sector, rapid restructuring is being called for in order to concentrate the land in a few hands and forge another link in the chain controlled by the network of multinationals."
"Furthermore, the liberalisation of trade and the abolition of duty and subsidies have hit agricultural production directly, reducing farmers' incomes, decimating farming and increasing unemployment."
"Agricultural production in Greece - and elsewhere - is being sacrificed in order to protect and corner a larger share of the international market for processed products from central and northern Europe."
"We believe that, rather than defending the interests of the people, the EU will again endeavour at the new round of talks to stake a bigger claim for the European monopolies, in competition with the other imperialist centres, i.e. the USA and Japan."
"The rules which govern international economic relations and trade should serve the interests of the workers, leave their fundamental social rights untouched, help to develop less developed countries, respect the environment and respect the rights of all nations to exercise control and decide on their future themselves."
"The WTO is, by its very nature, an imperialist structure interested in the maximum possible return on capital and more secure, flexible and unimpeded ways of moving capital, especially from trade and the stock exchange, impoverishing huge swathes of the world's population and contaminating and destroying more and more of the natural environment in the process."
"Under this new world order, which uses every possible means to impose the law of the jungle and where might is right, people are beginning to understand that the only solution is resistance and counterattack."
"The movement against globalisation and the WTO may be uncoordinated and disparate, but it is the first counterattack on the dictatorship of the monopolies and economies of interest."
"It is sending out a message of resistance and counterattack to the millions of workers, unemployed, small and medium-sized farmers and other victims of the capitalist world order which the WTO is trying to impose."
"The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the motion because most of it sides with the major corporations planning to bring about unbridled liberalisation, plunder even more poor countries, wipe out farming and attack the achievements of the workers and the rights of the people throughout the world."
". (FR) I regret that Commissioner Lamy was not more explicit yesterday about the discrepancies between the Council's negotiation mandate and the draft declaration by the Ministers at the Doha conference."
"I thought I heard - the Commissioner was speaking sotto voce - that they particularly related to the new reduction in external protection and internal support for our agriculture which certain States had demanded."
"I also regret that the joint resolution that Parliament has just voted on commits the sin of incoherence by remaining silent on Community preference, whilst rightly emphasising the right of WTO members to apply agricultural policies adapted to their needs and conditions and especially the right of EU Member States to defend a European model of agriculture founded on family holdings, safe and high-quality food, protection of the environment and a balance between town and country."
"Food safety constitutes a strategic dimension, on which the tragic events of 11 September throw a new light."
"It is not feasible that the European Union should depend long-term on imports - some 75% of its requirements - of a family of products as important, vital and strategic as oilseed proteins."
"How can the European Union condemn itself to zero growth in a crucial sector in which production worldwide is increasing by 5% per annum?"
"What would happen in the event of weather hazards in the Americas?"
"It is therefore imperative that the fatal error of Blair House, the absurd and severe self-limitation agreed to in Marrakech be put right in the next round of negotiations."
"The complete elimination of animal fats makes it all the more necessary to be able to support the development of Community-wide production of vegetable proteins: this objective must be a priority for the European negotiator."
"We will be extremely watchful on this issue."
"Désir Report (A5-0331/2001)"
"I have, of course, voted for this report, Mr President, on democracy in international trade, but I should like to do more."
"As the representative of the pensioners that I have had the chance to meet over these two and a half years, I should also like to launch a new slogan here today: 'Pensioners of the world, unite!'"
"Pensioners are citizens who have more money than young people and would be able to influence the trade and economy of the whole world."
"I therefore appeal to all pensioners and all elderly people throughout the world to unite in an organisation that can make its weight felt - a weight they are entitled to have because of their numbers - so they can influence international trade to make it more humane and friendlier to those in need, as we all hope."
". (FR) We voted in favour of the report on ""Openness and democracy in international trade"" in order to assert our demand for a reform of the World Trade Organisation towards greater transparency and fairness (especially in regard to the settlement of differences) and also the strengthening of control by the peoples."
"A double ambiguity, though, exists in this regard, both at European level and at the level of the WTO."
"As regards the European Union, successive reforms of the Treaties have practically excluded the national parliaments from control and ratification of the common trade policy."
"The Nice Treaty, which is currently in the process of being approved, effectively completes the work while excluding them from negotiations touching on services and intellectual property."
"Neither de jure nor de facto does the European Parliament take over, and in any case, even if it did gain a real right of ratification, the end result would still be the overall enfeeblement of democratic control, because of the abolition of any direct power on the part of national democracies, which are closest to the peoples."
"From this point of view, the European Parliament's proposal that a consultative parliamentary assembly should be created within the WTO looks like the beginning of work on another level of dispossession."
"Such an assembly would in fact risk giving greater legitimacy to the disregard of the opinions of national democracies, and the putting in place thereby of ""regulations"" the effect of which would be to confine them even more."
"There is then a need to assert most clearly that the objective of the consultative assembly is to improve information, but not under any circumstances to replace the national parliaments in any way."
"For us, in fact, the first of these ""regulations"" to retain, is that each and every people, expressing itself directly or through its national parliament, has the right to choose what kind of society it wants to be and what laws shall apply within it."
". (FR) The rapporteur cannot be naïve enough to think that the terrible inequalities in world trade are due to the fact that most member countries of the WTO ""are marginalised because of non-inclusive working methods or because they are not, or not effectively, represented in Geneva"" or even due ""to practices inherited from the GATT"" ."
"Economic relations between countries, and trade relations in particular, obey only one law - the law of the strongest - and certainly do not involve the type of ""democracy"" that the rapporteur would like to see."
"The imperialist countries impose their law on third world countries and the United States impose their own, even on second-ranking imperialist powers."
"Clearly, giving the poorest countries a few extra posts within the WTO or in any other international body is not going to change the balance of power."
"The report' s real motives are to be found in the fact that international trade, whose laws resemble the law of the jungle, is giving rise to protest and demonstrations."
"Although it does not have the power to change the substance of the matter, the European Parliament is invited to put a democratic spin on a type of relationship that is poles apart from a relationship of equality and democracy."
"We have not, of course, given our support to this playacting and have voted against the report."
". (NL) The existence of a World Trade Organisation could perhaps be useful if it were limited to helping individual states to set up trade contacts with other, remote states."
"Unfortunately, the pretensions of the current WTO go much further than that."
"It is trying to impose standards on Member States in which the protection of jobs, the environment and public services is subordinated to freedom of trade and the protection of big multinational companies."
"The WTO has become a kind of alternative United Nations, but one in which it is not the power of the number of inhabitants but the power of money that counts."
"As a result of the imposed globalisation, the gulf between rich countries who export expensive, high-tech products and poor countries who are dependent on exports of cheap raw materials from agriculture and mining is widening."
"The profits from investments in these countries flow back to the richest countries."
"This WTO is trying to maintain these abuses, and in doing so forms a threat to welfare, the environment and democracy."
"Mr Désir is making a creditable attempt to promote openness and democracy in international trade."
"I support him in this, but I fear that it will be insufficient without further changes."
"Brok report (A5-0332/2001)"
"Mr President, while I was on the plane taking me from Bratislava to Prague and then on to Malpensa, on my way back from my visit to Slovakia, I was reading the Brok report to decide on how to vote when, as often happens to me, I fell asleep."
"I had a dream."
"Knowing that Mr Brok is so good at foreign policy, Mr President, I dreamt that he had become Foreign Minister in the Europe of the future."
"I also dreamt that on the plane, as well as Mr Brok, there were some beautiful blonde hostesses from the Czech Republic."
"I woke up, Mr President."
"I am sure that the beautiful blondes will remain a dream, but will Mr Brok as Foreign Minister come true?"
". (EL) I have to admit that our rapporteur, the German Christian Democrat Elmar Brok, does not mince his words."
"Both the motion for a resolution and the explanatory statement are exercises in militaristic, aggressive cynicism about the substance of the CFSP (common foreign and security policy) and the CSDP (common security and defence policy)."
"He considers that, especially from mid-2001 onwards, the common political will to act at the operational level has been visibly in evidence and cites ""crisis management"" in the Middle East and the FYROM as examples of successful autonomous intervention on the part of the European Union."
"The report then includes a long-winded list of means and institutions currently available to the European Union to carry out its ""God-given"" job of ""conflict prevention"" and ""crisis management"" (crises which the EU will be sure to provoke) throughout the world: the rapid reaction force, the primary objective of which is to create a Euro-army by 2003, initially with 60,000 troops, measures for the rapid flow of resources, non-military - but armed - crisis management (by creating a corps of 5,000 police officers), the (new) Situation Centre and the Policy Planning and Early Warning Unit (both of which come under Mr Solana's department) and so on."
"Russia, the Ukraine, Moldavia, Africa, Latin America and so on are all seen as military partners outside our area. The stated aim is to impose policies which serve imperialist interests, to get these countries to accept the rules of the capitalist market and - naturally - to respect human rights, or rather what the ÅU understands by human rights."
"Furthermore, ""global responsibility for peace, stability and sustainable development"" is used to justify the need, highlighted in the report, for the EU to develop its strategic plans in Iran, China, Korea and Indonesia."
"In other words, the Brok report cynically illustrates the imperialist nature of the ÅU which - necessity being the mother of invention - wants to promote its interests in glorious collaboration with the USA, using NATO resources."
"The report is crystal clear on the division of roles between the two imperialist powers, viz. the USA and the ÅU, which will act in concert with the USA, where possible, or on its own if the USA is not willing or prepared to act."
"This position marries perfectly with its wholehearted support for the USA in the new imperialist war in Afghanistan and Eurasia in general, fronted by the coalition against international terrorism which has come along, like manna from heaven now that the USSR and the Warsaw Pact have broken up, to give the imperialists an alibi, a modern day ""red under the bed"" to justify intense arming, curtailing the rights of our people, fortifying their system every which way and any type of intervention - military or otherwise - anywhere in the world."
"Mr Brok's statement during his presentation to plenary captures the tone of the report perfectly. He said that, if we want to be convincing and reliable in our foreign policy, we need to demonstrate on a daily basis that we are prepared to use military means to enforce what is not accepted using other means."
"Who today can dispute the Marxist tenet that war is in the nature of capitalism and, even more so, in the nature of imperialism?"
"That is why the people cannot afford to rest on their laurels."
"The peace movement at national, European and global level against the warmongering imperialists is the only prospect of survival for mankind."
". (NL) The existence and maintenance of an army is always justified by the argument that it was necessary in order to defend the freedom of the country's own territory and to discourage potential occupying forces."
"Because nobody likes to be occupied, the existence of such an army is accepted by a majority of people, albeit often with doubt or reluctance."
"Action by armies outside their own borders, on the other hand, is always rightly regarded as a form of aggression and imperialism."
"In recent years, there has been an offensive to justify the action of armies outside their own territory."
"This happened in Iraq and in Kosovo, and it is now happening in Afghanistan."
"When Mr Solana took up office, I heard him say that he knows of many places outside the territory of the EU where an army could be deployed."
"Mr Brok wants a decision on the operational readiness of a European 'Rapid Reaction Force' to be reached soon."
"I reject this part of his proposals, although I do share his views on the struggle against money laundering and against the international drugs trade, finding a humanitarian and political solution for Chechnya, strengthening the peace-building capacity of the United Nations and making aid for Macedonia dependent on the implementation of the agreed amendment to the constitution."
". (FR) One cannot fail to be struck by the huge disparity between Mr Brok' s report and the new course taken by international relations since 11 September."
"The rapporteur does, admittedly, mention that date but fails to draw any conclusions from it with regard to taking the CFSP in a new direction."
"Instead, he clings to the reassuring dogmas of the old school of thought, organised around the concept of 'everything for the Community' : the High Representative of the CFSP must be communitised, decisions on joint action must be reached by a majority, and so forth."
"The new international landscape that is emerging as a result of the ongoing fight against terrorism forces us to act on two levels: the national level, the sovereign prerogatives of which will prove crucial in this new type of war, and the world level, which is the only level appropriate for the large-scale cooperation that is necessary."
"The European level is only an intermediate phase, all too often too limited to lay hold of the global circuits and networks of international terrorism."
"In times of tension, decisive cooperation tends to take place directly between States."
"This was the case with the significant military contribution that the United Kingdom made to the United States' action, the tripartite Ghent Summit, and the bilateral cooperation between France and Germany."
"The CFSP will have to adapt rapidly to the new diplomatic climate."
"The focus for the necessary coordination between the various pillars, as well as between the intergovernmental approach and the Community aspects, must be the Council, which is the only institution capable of playing a pivotal role."
"The same requirement for effectiveness must lead to the creation of a specific 'Foreign Affairs' Council, separate from the Council."
"This is a point that Commissioner Barnier made in his speech."
"Unless these changes are made, the CFSP is in danger of being rapidly marginalised and relegated to role of merely issuing declarations."
". British Conservatives strongly support European cooperation in foreign policy and the use of EU civil instruments in conflict prevention, where shared interests exist."
"However, they insist that national governments must retain absolute sovereignty over foreign and defence policy."
"We do not, therefore, support movement towards establishment of an EU diplomatic service or the ""communitarisation"" of foreign policy; the extension of Europol competence into operational areas; or measures that will lead to the development of a European Army."
"We believe that NATO should be the international organisation of first resort, not just for collective defence, but for all relevant crisis management tasks requiring the use of military assets."
"COM in sheepmeat and goatmeat"
"The next item is the report (A5-0340/2001) by Mr Adam, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the proposal for a Council regulation on the common organisation of the market in sheepmeat and goatmeat [COM(2001) 247 - C5-0214/2001 - 2001/0103(CNS)]."
"Mr President, the present organisation is manifestly unsatisfactory to all the parties involved, particularly the sheep and goat farmers, but also to Member States and the Commission."
"It has allowed the income of sheep farmers to fall behind the general levels of income of other sections of the farming community."
"This widening gap is a serious matter when considering that large areas of the Community are highly dependent on sheep and goat farming."
"The method of calculation of the premium is complicated and statistically suspect."
"The figures on which the eventual sheep premium is agreed cannot be justified in a satisfactory manner because it requires detailed information of what is happening in the market and that cannot readily be obtained nor easily substantiated."
"Another drawback is that the premium is based on deficiency payments."
"This is not acceptable to the WTO and is therefore a barrier to negotiations in agricultural issues generally."
"For farmers there is uncertainty over a 12-month period as to what annual premium will be paid eventually."
"Because of this uncertainty the premium does not allow effective management planning."
"All these drawbacks were recognised by the Commission and are largely reinforced by a study that was carried out prior to the preparation of the proposals which we are now debating."
"The Commission proposal, in essence, is simpler, less bureaucratic and will be easier to understand."
"The fundamental difference is that it is based on a fixed annual payment."
"This is less objectionable to the WTO and therefore will help with the overall agricultural negotiations in which the Commission is involved."
"More importantly, from the farmers' viewpoint, the premium will be known in advance and this will make farm business decisions easier."
"My discussions in contact with the sheep and goat farmers of the Community confirm that the proposals are broadly acceptable to them."
"The information that I have from Member States is that it is broadly acceptable to them as well."
"There is agreement that it is desirable to agree the revision in time for 1 January 2002 so that the benefit to the farming community can come in as quickly as possible."
"The principle of the Commission's proposals is broadly acceptable to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, though there are differences in emphasis."
"The committee proposes a premium 50% higher than that put forward by the Commission."
"The lower premium for milking-sheep and goats is rejected and a higher supplement proposed for sheep and goats in less favoured areas."
"There are strong pressures within the committee that the market organisation should make greater provision for national differences. A number of proposals have been put forward."
"There are also proposals which would allow Member States to make additional headage and area payments."
"These would be based on objective criteria which could cover, inter alia, environmental considerations, tagging and traceability."
"Sheep farming has not made the productivity advances seen in other agricultural sectors."
"Amendments have been introduced calling for Commission support for increased marketing promotion."
"Targeting young people to encourage consumption will be important for success."
"The committee recognises that this is an interim stage and looks forward to reports from the Commission on environmental impact, traceability and pasturing techniques."
"It is anticipated that this will lead to wider reforms in the Agenda 2000 mid-term review."
"The Agriculture Committee looks to the Commission for a positive response to the amendments it has proposed."
"Mr President, my report on behalf of the Committee on Budgets is brief, because the Committee on Budgets was asked to give its opinion on the proposal by the Commission."
"We were broadly supportive."
"First of all, it streamlines the policy, making it simpler and much more defensible within the GATT negotiations, thereby providing longer-term security for farmers engaged in sheep and goat farming."
"We proposed an amendment in relation to individual tagging."
"We did not propose in that way to enter into the area of food safety, or indeed the business of the Committee on Agriculture."
"We simply wanted to ensure that premiums were paid on sheep and goats that actually existed and that we had a means of ensuring that the animals could be counted and accounted for."
"Since I am responsible to the Committee on Budgetary Control for animal products, I felt it my duty to insert that amendment."
"Speaking for myself, I can say that the Committee on Budgets has its responsibilities."
"This is largely a neutral proposal by the Commission, but the Committee on Agriculture has its responsibilities to farmers."
"I support the position it has taken in this respect."
"I support the Doyle amendment which was passed by the Committee on Agriculture."
"As regards costs, the Committee on Budgets added approximately EUR 400 million in horizontal cuts that the Council deducted from the budget so we added EUR 400 million this morning."
"We added another EUR 400 million in relation to animal health measures."
"The budget this year is 2% more in real terms than we started with last year, and in real terms it is more than 5%, when you consider the outturn."
"It is my opinion, and the opinion of EPP members in the Committee on Budgets, that there are sufficient funds to meet the request of the Committee on Agriculture: if the Doyle position is accepted by this Parliament and by the Council there are sufficient resources to finance the policy."
"It will be a shift of money from the rich areas to the poor areas, from the bigger farmers to the smaller farmers."
"It is a social and regional measure that we could do with."
"Mr President, I reiterate what my colleague, Mr McCartin, has just said."
"He is speaking on behalf of the Committee on Budgets."
"There is money there to support the proposals that were passed by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, for a EUR 30 fixed rate premium and a EUR 9 supplement premium."
"There is money there."
"I appeal to colleagues to support the views of the Agriculture Committee."
"I fear tonight's vote - on a Thursday night - may be unrepresentative of the large majority decision at the Agriculture Committee on this particular issue."
"The Community average income of sheep and goat producers is generally amongst the lowest of all sectors, especially in northern Europe where lambs are reared in meat production systems."
"I quote the words of the Commission: ""Unlike beef and other commodities, the Community is deficient in sheepmeat and, under the present regimes, there is a major exodus from sheep production, especially in northern Europe."
"The beef regime unwittingly also supports this exodus from sheep production as ewes are counted for extensification payment under this regime but are not paid for, thereby encouraging farmers who have the option to decrease their sheep and increase their cattle on a holding to draw down more extensification payments."""
"The most cost-effective solution from a common agricultural policy point of view is to ensure that the sheep and goat regimes, together with the impact of the beef regime, encourage as much land as possible to be kept in Europe in sheep production."
"It is at least four times as expensive to support a livestock unit of beef, compared to that of sheepmeat."
"While beef producers need all the support they are getting, given their present difficulties, it is not in their interest either to have competition generated between dry stock sectors by imbalance in the respective regimes."
"The main proposal for a fixed, single annual premium I fully support, at EUR 30. I fully support it, in place of the unfair, uncertain and - from a WTO perspective - unacceptable present deficiency payment system."
"We support the flexibility amendments to send a message to the Commission that there is room for different treatment in some Member States in relation to this regime, providing that it does not come from the flat rate payment."
"We cannot support the identification and traceability amendments because this is a matter for DG V, not because we do not support the principle but because it is for another DG, and for that reason solely."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like, first of all, to welcome the work of Mr Adam, our rapporteur, and to congratulate him on his desire to give some hope to sheep and goat farmers, who are, by and large, at the lower end of the scale of agricultural earnings."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has used its vote, as you quite rightly pointed out, to confirm the principle of a basic deficiency payment, of a rural premium and of a supplementary flexibility premium based on the criteria of produce quality, the environment or financial management."
"It is also the case that the levels set by our committee will have to be readjusted in plenary if Parliament hopes to influence Council and, therefore, maintain credibility."
"The Commission recommended a maximum of EUR 28 per head but the Committee on Agriculture raised the amount to EUR 44, which far exceeds the expectations of rearers and could, furthermore, prove difficult to reconcile with the room for manoeuvre provided by the budget."
"On behalf of my group, I have, therefore, retabled two of the rapporteur' s amendments designed respectively to reset the basic premium at EUR 25 per head and the premium for milk herds - ewes or she-goats - at EUR 20."
"In the 'meat' sector, the maximum aid per head would therefore, be EUR 39, which would ensure equal treatment in terms of public premiums per hectare for sheep breeders and milk-cow breeders."
"I would say that this is a totally logical approach, because these two types of production often exist side by side in the same regions and areas and even within the same holdings."
"In terms of the markets, we now have two situations at variance with one another: a surplus of beef and veal and a deficit of sheepmeat."
"If per-hectare premiums are set at an equivalent level, this could restore the balance of production, with the choices made by producers being influenced by market conditions."
"Furthermore, I recommend maintaining a difference between the basic premium for the 'meat' sector and the premium for the milk sector because to do otherwise would leave the sheep and goat milk sectors with no future, which nobody wants to see."
"This is why I hope, ladies and gentlemen, that this evening you will support these amendments, which I think are both realistic and responsible."
"Mr President, on behalf of the liberal group, I can say that we broadly support the Commission's proposals."
"We find the new system better than the old system, which was more or less a system of deficiency payments."
"We also find the amounts specified by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development excessive."
"We will therefore support Mr Garot's and Mr Adam's amendments, which are slightly more modest but which do in fact provide a good negotiating position in respect of the Council."
"My group has submitted new amendments which relate to the identification of the animals."
"We consider it to be of the utmost importance that when money is being distributed - animal premiums and suchlike - the control system is spick and span and there is very little wrong with it."
"The Commission should therefore introduce a new identification system as soon as possible."
"Finally, and I am saying this on behalf of the group, I have tabled amendments stating that dikes and salt marshes in Europe will also be regarded as least favoured areas."
"I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on his very hard work on this difficult report."
"Farming has taken a blow over the past year in the United Kingdom, and sheep farming, of course, is no exception."
"Given the fact that 80% of my own nation - Wales - is designated by the EU as less favoured and that sheep farming is the only available method of farming in many part of Wales, this report has far-reaching implications for Wales and its hill and upland farmers, as indeed it has for their European counterparts."
"I therefore welcome additional financial support for farmers situated in less-favoured areas such as Wales and I urge fellow MEPs to support additional payments for these areas."
"Now although this premium will not solve overnight the immediate crisis, we need to get the proposal through as quickly as possible to ensure that the sheep annual premium payments will be in place by January 2002."
"The original proposal was disappointing, and a lot of hard work has been put in to get the best deal possible for farmers in this regard."
"Of course, I want to see farmers get the fairest and highest possible premium."
"However, we have to work within the budget, and this is why I fully support Mr Adam's proposal of EUR 25 and am confident that the Council will consider this proposal as a very viable option given the constraints."
"Pitching the figure higher than this would lose money to other sectors including rural development."
"I will be voting against Amendment No 21, as I believe the wording to be too vague, and I would like to see a clause stating that any money put back into the national reserve from a region or country within a Member State should be ring-fenced to ensure the benefit of this fund is maintained for that particular area - that is a very important point."
"We must protect our sheep-farming industry because to lose more farmers from the industry would have a catastrophic effect on the make-up of rural communities where small family farms play such a vital role."
"Seldom have I seen a greater degree of unanimity on the need for reform of the sheep and goat sector."
"The rapporteur, the Commission, Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and farming organisations are all at one on the need for reform."
"It is now down to this Parliament and the Council to give meaningful effect to this consensus."
"There is, however, one important bridge to be crossed if this desired objective is to be achieved."
"Unless we succeed in reaching a fair consensus on the level of financial support for sheep farming, this attempt at reform will fail and the decline of sheep production will lead to a significant imbalance in the European meat sector, thereby putting greater pressure on the beef sector as farmers switch from one enterprise to another."
"So, it makes good economic sense to get the balance right now."
"There will not be another bite at this cherry."
"We talk a lot about the sustainability of European agriculture."
"To me it means maintaining a reasonable balance between all sectors, including the profitability of each."
"I do not have to remind the House of the relevance of sheep farming in areas not suited to other agricultural enterprises and the importance, from a rural development perspective, of sustaining farm families in those areas."
"I do, however, wish to acknowledge the positive aspects of the Commission proposals, including the findings of the Evaluation Committee report, the simplification of procedures and the introduction of a single premium."
"Here, however, I differ with the Commission on its method of calculation, based on averaging."
"This does not fairly reflect the difficulties experienced by the sector over a longer period."
"During the debate, I tabled a number of amendments."
"My proposal for a flat rate premium of EUR 32 was not supported; it was based on a fair and thorough evaluation by agricultural economists of the level of support necessary to restore equity to the sector."
"On behalf of my Group, I then supported proposals for EUR 30 - a figure which I believe is the very minimum necessary to close the gap and help restore profitability to the sector."
"I ask the House not to deviate from this figure, which can be accommodated within the existing guidelines, and also to support amendments on compensation for extensification, the rural world premium and funding for market developments."
"Like all Members of this House, I am conscious of the budgetary implications of reform."
"I caution against reform of sheepmeat at the expense of other sectors, particularly beef."
"Those who take pleasure in pointing out that agriculture takes up almost 50% of the budget should keep in mind that this general support is as much a subsidy to consumers as it is support for the farming community - the people who are expected to guarantee food supply and quality and at the same time maintain the rural environment."
"Those who believe that agriculture is oversubsidised should take note of the continuing decline in the number of farm families and ask themselves why this is happening."
"We should note, in my view, with alarm the reluctance of young people to take up farming and ponder the consequences for food security and employment in the agricultural food sector."
"In evaluating the relevance of agriculture to the European and world economy, you cannot apply the same economic criteria as we apply to other sectors."
"Mr President, I apologise for my absence."
"The report by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is an improvement on the Commission proposals but, for all that, it does not make any significant changes in the sheep and goat farming sector."
"For example, we agree that it is good idea to increase premiums and special aid, which have not risen since 1993 and have since been eroded by inflation."
"We also agree that it is a good idea to make the conditions for payment of supplementary aid more flexible."
"However, we do not agree that it is a good idea to maintain the difference between mixed meat and milk production subsidies, which the report justifies on the grounds that mixed production unit holders generate additional income from milk production."
"This is not comparing like with like because meat production units, which are mainly located in northern countries, are large operations which afford a satisfactory income and profit to their owners, while mixed production units, which are mainly located in the Mediterranean countries, are family-run holdings in the most barren areas which do not afford their owners a viable income, with the result that they are declining year on year and these areas are being abandoned."
"The headage payments in Greece for each holding have not risen since 1989-1991."
"The report accepts the philosophy of quotas and even tries to add to it with management quotas, despite the fact that the European Union's self-sufficiency in sheep- and goatmeat is around 80%, sheep and goat farms are to be found in the poorest areas of the European Union, where no alternative form of farming is generally possible, and sheep and goat farmers are the poorest social group in the European Union."
"If we really wanted to provide income support for these regions and for sheep and goat farmers, we would abolish quotas, increase subsidies and provide other additional incentives."
"This sort of policy would help to reverse the rate of abandonment of mountain and mainly barren areas and, at the same time, make the European Union self-sufficient in sheep- and goatmeat."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis besetting livestock farming in Europe is of an unprecedented scale."
"If it is not checked it will have terrible consequences for our economies, our societies and for life in our territories."
"In the beef and veal sector, despite the mollifying proposals that Commissioner Fischler has put to us - he would have us believe that the crisis is now behind us - we are still in a slump."
"In my own country, for example, producers can no longer find takers for their animals even at tragically low prices, which no longer cover production costs."
"Despair is gaining ground."
"Every day, livestock breeders are being forced out of business in the most tragic way."
"Waiting patiently for our remaining producers to go out of business would be a suicidal policy."
"I repeat, there is a considerable deficit in the European Union' s sheepmeat sector and looking at the average age of livestock breeders, which is increasing, it is not hard to predict that this deficit will increase in coming years."
"Sheep-farmers' incomes are amongst the lowest in agriculture, as the Commission itself acknowledges."
"In the current economic climate, we also see many producers in desperate situations and who are forced to stop farming because their income is insufficient."
"Apart from the human and social tragedy that this represents, it is also an ecological tragedy because sheep breeding and goat breeding are often the last defence against desertification in regions where farming is difficult."
"This is why your Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development felt that it was crucial to make some slight improvements to the Commission' s proposal for a regulation, in order to simplify, to be able to forecast and to increase aid to a sector that is suffering harshly, whose economic, social and ecological impact is so important and which gives cattle farmers the opportunity to convert, if it is increased sufficiently."
"The very coherent proposals that have been presented attempt to bring the system of aid for the sheepmeat sector into line with aid for milk-cows, whilst complying with budgetary constraints, because the COM in the sheepmeat sector is relatively cheap due to the number of customers for each producer."
"These proposals also comply with our international commitments, since the proposed reform aims to separate aid and an income insurance system, which could act as a safety net."
"The sheepmeat sector today needs to be stabilised and supported, otherwise it will disappear from many regions."
"It requires a reform which is both generous and responsible, and this is what Parliament' s Committee on Agriculture has proposed."
"I hope that the House will support us and that the Council will listen."
"Mr President, the Commission proposal to create a single annual premium is to be welcomed because it will simplify farmer' s incomes and provide stability."
"Nevertheless, it contains various loopholes and shortcomings."
"The first is the unsatisfactory level of the proposed premium of EUR 21, which continues to reflect the discrimination against the small ruminants sector in favour of large ruminants."
"The proposal of EUR 30 that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development approved will, therefore, resolve this discrimination."
"Nevertheless, if this proposal does not have the support of the majority of this House, I will, of course, support any other level that contributes to this objective."
"The second shortcoming lies in the continuing discrimination between sheep bred for meat on the one hand and ewes and she-goats on the other, with the latter receiving only 80% of the premium given to meat sheep."
"The proposals approved by the Committee on Agriculture will also remedy this unfairness, by making all premiums the same."
"The third shortcoming concerns the non-inclusion of flexibility mechanisms that would enable the Member States to make adjustments to national and regional situations."
"In this sense, the Committee on Agriculture' s amendments, which are intended to create an additional premium in certain situations, will be of enormous benefit to the implementation of the COM and will make the scheme more realistic and more feasible."
"As the Commission itself acknowledges in the explanatory statement, sheep and goat breeders have the lowest incomes of all meat producers with the additional disadvantage that 80% of the animals eligible for premiums are located in parts of the European Union that are both remote and poor."
"For this reason, and also because there is a deficit in this sector, which can only meet 80% of domestic consumption, it is becoming very important to make the changes I have just outlined and to increase the supplementary premium for Objective 1 regions."
"I therefore hope, that the House approves the Commission proposal and that when the Ministers for Agriculture meet in Council, they do their job properly, and accept the positions of this House."
"Lastly, I wish to pay tribute to Mr Adam, who has been an excellent rapporteur, who has put in a great deal of hard work and whom I thank for his generous support."
"Mr President, in addition to congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Adam, on his magnificent report, I would like to tell the Commission that some of the terminology in their proposal needs to be amended in order to take account of gender differences."
"That is to say, that it constantly forgets that there are female producers and stockbreeders."
"I would ask the Commissioner to make these terminological amendments to this proposal and, Commissioner, you can also do this for all of your other proposals, and please inform your staff that this must be done."
"Behind this seemingly formal request is my firm determination that, from now on, we recognise female farmers for the important role they play."
"Secondly, Commissioner, your proposal contains a renationalisation, which is the cause of a great deal of suspicion, because, to a certain extent, it sets a precedent in this field."
"To avoid these suspicions escalating into protests, you should compensate for this shortcoming in your proposal by increasing premiums."
"We ask for this unanimously; I hope that Parliament' s proposals will not fall on deaf ears."
"Lastly, I have to say that we all recognise that this 'safety net' initiative to compensate the fall in income suffered by farmers and producers of both sexes in times of crisis is a great success."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I also wish to thank the rapporteur on his work for a new organisation of the market."
"There are two basic factors here supporting all those speeches which express the desire to raise the status and underline the importance of these professions."
"The first one is that this is especially important for the regions - absolutely vital for large regions. The other is that we can produce a lot more - as we have heard here - because there is underproduction in this area."
"For that reason, all attempts to help and revive these products and this production trend, and highlight their importance, is work done for the common good - the cheapest and most economical of regional policies - and this is an area where agricultural sector has quite obvious shortcomings."
"Here, if anywhere, a certain sort of Robin Hood policy will be especially good and useful."
"I hope that when it comes to the vote, those of the opinion that we should start to move these matters forward, through greater investment, will win."
"Mr President, the Commission proposal dwells on the strategy of separating production aid and prices with the argument that this will simplify the current Organisation of the Market."
"The problem is that the level of the per head premium is clearly low, given that the basic price base has not increased since 1993."
"Furthermore, although the current system does need to be simplified, we must also take account, as the rapporteur stated, of the fact that sheep and goat breeding is of particular importance to the Community' s least-favoured areas, in which they are concentrated. The prime objective of any reform of this COM must, therefore, be to improve the income of sheep and goat farmers."
"Furthermore, we must consider the fact that, in recent years, the relative position of sheep and goat farmers has seen a decline."
"We therefore welcome the per head aid increases to EUR 30 and the additional aid of EUR 9 for the least-favoured regions, because this is a sector whose production is concentrated in poor areas, in which the viability of farms is more precarious, despite the fact that they play a major role in preserving the rural fabric of these regions and, in certain cases, are even the only economically possible activity."
"Also to be welcomed is the removal of the distinction between sheep bred to produce milk and those bred for their meat and that the same increase is to be applied to goats."
"I am also happy to support the new aid of EUR 5, given the difficulties that this sector is experiencing, although we must bear in mind the danger of renationalisation that the creation of national packages entails."
"I hope, therefore, that the House - and especially the Commission - will respond positively to this report and that some of the main demands of sheep and goat farmers will be met."
"Mr President, there is unanimity in the House about the importance of this reform, about how simplification is a good thing and how vitally important the sheep industry is."
"In all those things Mr Adam has done a good job."
"But I have to take issue with him in one contentious area which is: what is to be the level of support for sheep farmers?"
"I am deeply disappointed that the socialists, the liberals and the nationalists are telling the House that they all intend to vote to cut the recommendation of the Committee on Agriculture by EUR 5 at least in relation to each animal."
"They put that forward on the basis of the budget, but in the part of the UK that I represent, Wales - just like Mr Wyn who is sadly no longer in his place - we have seen a huge amount of stock slaughtered because of the foot-and-mouth epidemic."
"We see a crippled industry."
"We see a situation in which there is no confidence at all in the farming industry today and, as has rightly been said, if you look to an area like Wales, it is no good talking about diversification."
"It is no good talking about putting money into Community schemes and improving public transport in rural areas."
"We must ensure greater financial support for sheep farmers who have no economic alternative."
"Today there are sheep farmers in my constituency who are raising questions about whether they should even restock after foot-and-mouth."
"I say to Mr Adam this his government is not helping them by indicating that the compensation scheme that was previously in place is one that they do not intend to continue with, whilst, at the same time, not saying what they intend to put in its place."
"That adds to the existing desperation in the countryside."
"So, yet again, we hear warm words about the industry, but farmers want deeds, and this means supporting the recommendation made by the agricultural industry for the maximum amount of support for our hard-pressed sheep farmers."
"Mr President, the Commission proposal is satisfactory because it clearly attempts to simplify matters by replacing the variable premium with a single premium, meaning that the sector will now know in advance the amount it is to receive and will no longer have to suffer from the uncertainty it has had to endure up until now."
"We naturally support the idea that the premium should guarantee an income that is acceptable to the producer and my personal opinion is that this income should be the same for producers of both heavy and light lambs, as approved in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"The market in sheep' s milk is not regulated in the same way as the market in cow' s milk and income from milk is balanced by a lower level of income from meat production, especially in Mediterranean countries where mixed farms that produce wool, milk and meat slaughter these animals at lower weights, once again, largely in accordance with eating habits."
"With regard to the supplementary premium that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development proposed and approved, I have to say that the Commission should be very vigilant that this supplementary premium should in no case be used to reduce the linear premium, the headage premium or the premium for rural development."
"The Commission should understand that Parliament' s Committee wants to see an increase in the premium, comprised of three parts: a headage premium, a premium for rural development and a supplementary premium, in order to be able to help States implement the principle of flexibility."
"However, I would strongly urge that this introduction is not, at the end of the day, used to achieve a reduction in the headage premium or in the premium for rural development."
"Finally, I would like to say, and the Commissioner is well aware of this, that this sector makes an important contribution to land-use planning and to all the environmental services that we say we are going to defend in this new future common agricultural policy."
"However, I think that that truly guaranteeing an income in both this COM and this sector that could pay for the non-food services that this type of livestock farming provides throughout the Community would send an important political signal."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to congratulate the Commission on the proposal it has put forward, mainly because it will simplify the COM and will give security and stability to the sector, and also the rapporteur, because he has been able to reconcile the various political sensitivities in this House, sparing no effort to achieve this."
"I would ask the Commission to listen to the political message from this Parliament, which is asking for an increase in the premium. This premium is much needed, because it has remained unaltered since 1994; in fact, it has stagnated."
"This is the reason why this is one of the sectors that receives the least aid and is the most discriminated against within the COM at the present time."
"I think that the proposal from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is reasonable."
"However, we will not give our support to amendments put forward a posteriori, because we think that some, such as those put forward by Mr Mulder, should be dealt with in another context, although, it must be said, we are not against what he is saying. Others run counter to what has already been discussed and on which consensus has been reached in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and would, consequently, blur the political message of this Parliament."
"I would ask the Commission, in its debate with Council, to make the necessary effort to give the sector what it needs."
"Given that it has already made such an effort when putting forward the proposal, by simplifying the premiums, on the subject of the single premium, and on the possibilities of the Member States managing these premiums, it should make a reasonable budgetary effort - which the Committee on Budgets is not against - so that the objective the sector considers necessary can be achieved."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to expressly welcome the Commission' s proposal for reforming the market organisation for sheep and goat meat."
"The previous speakers have already given all the reasons why we so much welcome this proposal."
"I would also like to thank our rapporteur most sincerely for his work."
"I believe the revision of the premiums is one of the most important points."
"The introduction of a fixed rate premium is a major step forward."
"But I would like to stress that the figure proposed by the Commission is much too small."
"This premium must also be an incentive for sheep and goat farmers and that means EUR 30 and no less."
"The premium must also be the same for farmers regardless of whether they produce ewes or milking ewes."
"A distinction between the two cannot really be justified."
"I also believe that the EUR 9 supplementary premium for ewes and she-goats is particularly justified under the more difficult conditions in the less-favoured areas."
"Beef and veal and sheep meat prices generally follow the same trends, which means there is no justification for treating the two sectors differently as regards the premium."
"On the contrary, there is a deficit in sheep meat in Austria and in many other countries of Europe."
"If we fail to create reasonable conditions and security for this sector, we shall drive sheep and goat farmers into other areas, such as beef and veal, or they will go out of production altogether."
"Such a policy would be ill-advised."
"Finally, I would like to say that sheep and goat farming should not be supported only in areas that have no alternative, but also in those where sheep and goat farming is traditional."
"I therefore hope, Mr President, that the Commission and Council will follow these sensible proposals from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to welcome the proposal."
"It is perhaps long overdue, but certainly welcome."
"I also take this opportunity to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report on this very important subject."
"Sheep production is important especially in hill areas, not only because of the environment there and the role it plays in keeping the social fabric of society together, but because it has proven through the centuries to be one of the most important aspects of production in the agricultural sector."
"In the United Kingdom because of foot-and-mouth, sheep farmers have suffered greatly."
"I recognise that in Northern Ireland we have had a distinct advantage over our colleagues in the mainland UK, including the prices we have been receiving recently."
"Our producers have been very lucky."
"Over recent years, farmers have been getting less for their sheep than they were 15 years ago and they are receiving less support."
"Is it any wonder that young farmers and sheep farmers are actually leaving the industry?"
"We have to ask ourselves how best we can support them."
"I want to make it very clear: I will support the EUR 30 in the amendment in the vote in this House this afternoon."
"I hope all of you will be here to vote in favour of this amendment because we must give the political leadership this requires."
"For far too long, the sheep sector has been the poor relation."
"It has been the poor relation with respect to the milk, beef, tobacco and wine sectors."
"It has been the poor relation because it has been deemed to lack a strong voice in Europe."
"I would like to congratulate the Commission in coming forward with this proposal because it will be fairer than the present system."
"Yes, there will be some budgetary problems but we can get over them."
"I ask this House for its support."
"Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by sincerely thanking you, Mr Adam, for producing the report and the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their contributions to the discussions in committee and also for today' s debate."
"I am also very grateful because it is important that we press ahead with this proposal quickly and take a vote on it soon so that it can then hopefully be adopted by the Council as quickly as possible and this reformed market organisation for sheep and goat meat can come into force on 1 January next year and the premiums can then also be paid under this new regime next year."
"As many of you have also emphasised, the most important point of the proposed reform is the replacement of the variable deficiency payments by a fixed-rate form of aid."
"That has a number of important advantages."
"This new aid is stable."
"It can also be calculated in advance."
"This means that farmers can also plan with certainty."
"Above all, it is also a lot less bureaucratic because none of the expensive market intelligence on which the deficiency payments are currently based and all the complex calculations involved will any longer be necessary."
"Moreover, it is also of course much, much easier for sheep and goat farmers to understand."
"It allows producers to respond correctly to the needs of the respective markets because the support is not affected by changing prices."
"The Commission proposal also guarantees budget stability and in particular is also more consistent with WTO objectives over all."
"I believe there is broad agreement about these principles, as the debate has shown."
"Let me turn briefly to the most important amendments."
"Some are concerned with improving the text and are extremely welcome."
"I would, for example, be very pleased to accept Amendment No 11 because a more precise definition of the terms ""producer"" and ""holding"" will help to make the regulation much easier to understand."
"I can also support Amendment No 16, which proposes that premiums be paid not later than 31 March instead of 30 June."
"That will mean that producers will get their premiums even earlier."
"I also welcome the proposal to change the definition of producer in less-favoured areas, but I think the term could be simplified even more here."
"The wording of the amendment therefore needs to be made even more precise in this respect."
"On the other hand, I do not think it is necessary, as proposed in Amendment No 44, to specify the supplementary premium for dykes and salt marshes."
"They ought to be covered by the rule for less-favoured areas."
"So I do not really think this amendment is necessary."
"I also consider Amendments Nos 1, 6, 9, 22, 36 and 37 superfluous or pointless in the context of the regulation."
"Other amendments are concerned with the need for a degree of flexibility that would enable Member States to provide additional support for the sector or, more especially, to manage the various Member States' individual quotas better and more actively."
"The questions that were raised in the discussions in this connection are concerned with a number of aspects and possibilities, ranging from extensification and environmental concerns to the development of quality products, improvement of marketing structures and the creation of producer groups."
"I would like to say to you in this connection that while I cannot accept the proposed amendments directly, I do understand very clearly the message they are intended to convey."
"I would therefore like to pursue further the concern that lies behind them in order to find solutions that will take better account of the different requirements of the sector in the individual Member States."
"But they must be simple solutions."
"I do not think we should be creating a new bureaucracy."
"The same also applies for Amendments Nos 25 to 30 concerning the national financial frameworks, which should also be placed in the context of the proposals for greater flexibility."
"We must ensure that these framework provisions are also practicable and consistent with the objectives stated in the amendments in question."
"Amendments Nos 12, 13 and 15 are in fact the ones with the greatest direct effects."
"They are concerned with the question, discussed here, of increasing the premium to EUR 30 for all producers and increasing the supplementary premium for producers in less-favoured regions to EUR 9."
"If these proposals were accepted, expenditure would rise to EUR 2.7 billion."
"Even the more moderate amendments, as you termed them, Nos 45 and 46, would still entail additional expenditure amounting to EUR 385 million."
"We based our proposal on the financial framework agreed in Berlin, and I regret that I cannot therefore go along with your suggestions, especially in view of the fact that at virtually every summit the Heads of Government stress the importance and immutability of that financial framework."
"I must also reject the suggestion that producers of sheep' s milk and goat' s milk be paid the same aid as farmers who only produce meat."
"On the other hand, I was interested to note Amendments Nos 31 and 35 proposing additional premiums in the event of a price crisis."
"But the draft regulation does already provide for a kind of safety net to come into effect if falls in prices disrupt the market."
"I cannot therefore agree to those amendments."
"The proposal in Amendment No 20 that the first 15 sheep livestock units should be disregarded for calculating the stocking density for the beef and veal arrangements refers to a problem that actually belongs not in the context of this regulation but in the context of the market organisation for cattle, and I must therefore reject this proposal in this connection."
"But I would willingly agree to return to this point in the Midterm Review when we shall be discussing the question of the beef and veal arrangements and how they work."
"Amendments Nos 5, 7 and 33 are concerned with imports from third countries."
"Unfortunately, these amendments run counter to our international obligations and cannot therefore be accepted for that reason."
"Traceability is another important aspect."
"Amendment No 8 proposes that the report on the environmental effects of sheep and goat farming to be prepared by 31 December 2005 should also look into this question."
"I understand that and fully share your concerns, but I believe that this problem really needs to be solved sooner and that we cannot wait until 31 December 2005."
"The first step towards better origin safeguards requires the creation of a reliable marking and registration system."
"Since such a proposal requires a different basis in law, the proposed amendments are simply outside the scope of this regulation because under this regulation the relevant legal basis would be lacking."
"But I do think that part of Amendment No 42, which links the granting of premiums to compliance with the marking and registration rules, seems a sensible approach."
"I shall at any rate put such a proposal before the Council."
"Amendment No 19 is concerned with allowing Member States to show greater flexibility when setting application periods."
"This question will be settled in the implementing provisions."
"A Council decision is not therefore required here; it falls within the competence of the Commission."
"To avoid cases of fraud, however, an efficient marking and registration system ought to be operative for that reason, too."
"Finally, I would like to thank you again for the report and the amendments."
"In some areas there is a consensus, in some I shall pass your concerns on to the Council even though I cannot formally accept the amendments in their present form, and unfortunately there are also amendments which I am unable to accept because I do not have the authority to approve the funding."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.25 p.m. and resumed at 3.00 p.m.)"
"Reopening of Mont Blanc Tunnel"
"The next item is the statement by the Commission on the reopening of the Mont Blanc tunnel."
"Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, the tragic accident in the St Gotthard Tunnel yesterday morning reminds us of the tragic fire of 24 March 1999 in the Mont Blanc Tunnel."
"But before I say anything about the reopening of the Mont Blanc Tunnel, I would like on behalf of the Commission to express my deepest sympathy to the families of those who have lost their lives and also to extend our sympathy to the Swiss authorities and the Swiss people."
"Even if the causes of the accident are not yet known, this event again raises in a most pressing and dramatic manner the question of the safety of long road tunnels."
"The reopening of the Mont Blanc Tunnel does not require Commission approval."
"This decision is the sole responsibility of the French and Italian authorities."
"The imminent reopening of the tunnel has, however, revived a number of controversies."
"First and foremost is the question of the tunnel's possible closure to heavy goods vehicles, something that the people living in the Chamonix valley had been calling for long before the disastrous fire."
"However, the Commission takes the view that safety criteria alone should determine the reopening of the tunnel and the only condition should be that all the safety requirements are satisfied."
"According to information available to the Commission, the tunnel has now been equipped with modern safety devices under French and Italian responsibility."
"An electronic control centre has been set up, the electrical installations completely renewed, the ventilation system modernised, ventilated refuges created every 300 metres and emergency stopping bays every 100 metres."
"In addition, the training of operating personnel and emergency services has been greatly improved."
"As an additional safety measure, new rules have been introduced for the minimum distance to be observed between vehicles using the tunnel."
"Finally, the two original operating companies, ATMB in France and SITMB in Italy, have been replaced by a single administrative structure, an important step bearing in mind that, according to a number of technical reports produced after the fire, the large number of casualties was due, among other things, to poor coordination between the two operators."
"The Commission has contributed EUR 22.5 million to the repair work, which cost around EUR 200 million."
"As a result of this disaster and the two subsequent fires in Austria - the fire in the Tauern Tunnel on 25 May 1999 caused by a pile up that claimed 12 lives and the fire in the Kaprun glacier railway on 11 November 2000 that cost 156 people their lives - the Commission decided that, together with experts, it should also examine how tunnel safety might best be optimised."
"Our conclusions form part of the White Paper on transport policy up until the year 2010."
"Knowing that tunnels are important features of many cross-border transport links, the Commission is planning European rules."
"These are intended to create the necessary conditions for guaranteeing users of road and rail tunnels, especially tunnels forming part of trans-European networks, a high level of safety."
"The Commission will pass a proposal to this effect to the European Parliament and the Council early in 2002."
"The most recent accident once more underlines the fundamental importance of controlling transalpine traffic flows."
"The Commission considers it an absolute priority that the two rail links already mentioned in the 1996 guidelines for the trans-European transport network, namely the Lyons-Turin link and the section across the Brenner, should be developed and taken into service without delay."
"It has informed the competent ministers of this on many occasions, urging them to take the necessary measures to expedite these projects and in particular to give thought to how they will be funded, not excluding public-private partnerships."
"Apart from creating new infrastructures to cope with the bulk of freight transit traffic in the region, the Commission will be formulating minimum requirements for safety in tunnels, as announced in its White Paper."
"In the White Paper, the Commission also proposes a new scheme for transport infrastructure charges to take greater account of the external costs of the various transport operators."
"This new charging policy should make a major contribution to creating a balanced relationship between transport operators, especially in sensitive regions like the Alps, favouring the most environmentally friendly among them."
"As part of its strategy for sustainable mobility, the Commission will also be proposing revision of the Euro-toll disc directive to allow cross- financing for new railway infrastructures."
"Accordingly, the Commission has also proposed signing the transport protocol to the Alpine Convention on behalf of the European Community, which will be a political signal for the creation of a balanced relationship between transport operators, even if the corresponding provisions may in some cases be handled with a degree of flexibility."
"In general, the Commission intends to make European transport systems sustainable and to take into account medium and long-term environmental objectives when doing this."
"A Communication to be presented by the Commission next year, will discuss this in greater detail"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot begin a debate on this subject without remembering the ten latest victims claimed by the St Gotthard tunnel, and Mr Fischler was quite right to pay tribute to them, but we must also remember that, this very morning, yet another incident took place in the Petit St Bernard tunnel."
"It seems almost to be an unfortunate coincidence, placing a greater onus on us, now that we are preparing to debate the proposal and the timeliness of whether or not to reopen the Mont Blanc tunnel."
"As I shall say later, I have no doubts on the matter, but there are many considerations I must air before I make this statement."
"First of all, the St Gotthard accident is directly connected with the one in the Mont Blanc tunnel, where, as everyone will remember, 39 people lost their lives on 24 March 1999, but there is an even more direct link than just the similarity between the two accidents, which it is only right to recall."
"It is a link of cause and effect: it seems clear to everybody that the mass of traffic that the Mont Blanc has not been able to cater for during the two and a half years or so since it closed has inevitably shifted to other Alpine passes, starting with the St Gotthard itself, which in turn is now closed, and then the Brenner and the Tarvisio and the whole Alpine arc, which, in short, has absorbed the surplus traffic that used to go through the Mont Blanc tunnel before it was closed."
"It is clear, therefore, that the cause of the accident can be quite easily identified and predicted, given the situation. Alongside the negative effect of the accidents, however, there is, of course, another negative effect, which is the impact on the environment."
"Heavy vehicles, especially those crossing an Alpine pass, certainly have an environmental cost that nobody would want to pay."
"Quite rightly, therefore, people have started discussing the subject of the Mont Blanc tunnel, particularly in the last couple of days, and proposals have been made to try to prevent the tunnel from reopening and thus protect the land around it."
"I must say that I totally disagree with this proposal, although I understand the legitimate aspirations of those living in a particular area to protect their environment."
"This proposal, however, not only contravenes the Treaty - in that it would violate a fundamental principle, that of the free movement of goods, persons and so on - but I would say it is also an ethical violation."
"By closing the Mont Blanc tunnel or keeping it closed, one is in fact just shifting an ecological problem from one part of the Alps to another; we would just be shifting the problem from the Mont Blanc region to the Fréjus region, to Switzerland, and to the Brenner and Tarvisio routes, as I said before, which does not seem right to me."
"I ask those who advocate this solution: what kind of proposal is this?"
"What has become of the spirit of Alpine solidarity? What has become of the feeling of belonging to the Community, to the European Union?"
"On the other hand, as the Commissioner has also reminded us, the opening of the Mont Blanc tunnel will certainly be accompanied by special safety arrangements."
"It goes without saying that, in addition to the environmental damage, there is also the economic damage that we have a duty to consider here: during the two and a half years that it has been closed, it has been calculated that Italy alone has lost EUR 1 500 million, and the Val d' Aosta region will have seen its own regional gross domestic product fall by 10 %."
"France, too, has probably had losses comparable to these: perhaps Mrs Grossetête will tell us, as I know she is to speak afterwards and she lives in that part of the world."
"We must not be ashamed to talk about the economic aspect as well, since the Mont Blanc tunnel, like all passes through the Alps, responds to demands which are not solely economic but may be expressed in economic terms, and which need to be met to enable the various nations, citizens and groups operating in the fields of industry, trade and tourism to carry on their activities."
"All this serves not only the countries on either side of the border but also and especially more distant countries - I am thinking of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Germany - whose traffic inevitably has to cross the Alps, which are today almost closed off and practically impassable."
"It is also clear that the Italian and the French authorities have, at last, found a common language in which to propose solutionsand have invested almost EUR 300 million, the burden being shared equally by the two countries, to ensure safety."
"It is said that once this tunnel has been restored - which I hope will be very soon - it will be the safest in the world, with features that I will not repeat now because they have already been mentioned by the Commissioner himself."
"Now we need to take one further step: to speed up the bureaucratic and technical process to complete the Munich-Verona link, which means the Brenner tunnel, and the Lyon-Turin link, which means the Fréjus tunnel."
"These are priority projects."
"I shall end, Mr President, by reminding the House that there is a new proposal that might help: the Aosta-Martigny rail link, which starts in Milan, is not one of the European priorities but could be included if France and Italy take the matter up."
"By the way, I shall close with some news: tomorrow the Italian Minister, Mr Lunardi, and his French counterpart, Mr Gayssot, will be meeting to agree on a date to reopen the Mont Blanc tunnel, which I hope will be very, very soon."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the opening of the Mont Blanc Tunnel is a European event, a happy European event, just as the accident in the St. Gotthard Tunnel is a tragic, sad European event."
"Transport knows no borders."
"It makes no difference whether you are a member of the European Union or not."
"We need transport that connects the regions of Europe, but we also need transport that respects the environment."
"I believe the Commission' s approach is correct in seeing the question of tunnel safety in the overall context not only of transport policy but also of environmental policy."
"The Commissioner mentioned, for example, the transport protocol to the Alpine Convention."
"I just wonder - the Council is not here - where the ministers are who signed it because it is high time the governments took action here."
"Secondly, the Commissioner spoke of a shift from road to rail, where that is possible and worthwhile."
"Here, too, a number of European governments - the Austrian government among them - have been slow in putting that into effect."
"The plans are good."
"But the financial resources must also be made available if the measures in question are to be taken."
"I also know that in many countries the railways have the capacity to carry more freight than they do at present."
"The White Paper that was mentioned and which the Vice-President of the Commission has presented, is a very positive and important step in the restructuring of transport policy."
"Our Group strongly supports it and I hope that the announced presentation of the amendment to the Euro-toll disc directive and the infrastructure costs directive will not be delayed, and that we shall be able to discuss the Euro-toll disc revision very soon."
"Finally, there has been a lot of talk recently of a fast-track procedure."
"We have talked about it a great deal and very often, and this is a subject where we really could introduce a fast-track."
"I am sure it is right that it is not only a question of overriding transport policy but also of the level of safety."
"We welcome the Commission' s intention of prescribing safety standards here because if the tunnels we travel in are unsafe we are all affected."
"A number of things have been mentioned."
"I would like to add that the question of working hours is particularly important for lorry drivers, as is the matter of controls, because it does not matter how good the rules are that we adopt if these things are not enforced."
"This, too, is a matter for the individual countries to act on."
"My Group and I are quite clear in our own minds that this is not about pitting one country against another."
"France, Italy, Germany, Austria and all the other countries of the EU have a right to the free movement of goods."
"But the people who live in the Alpine regions also have a right to a healthy environment."
"Some people may laugh or smile at the fact that the UN has designated next year the year of mountains."
"However, it really is high time special attention were paid to the environmental situation, in the Alps and the Pyrenees in particular."
"Now, Mr President and Mr Commissioner, I must ask to be excused."
"I am going to be rude and leave the room now because I am going to Romania on Parliament' s behalf."
"But we nevertheless endorse these principles of a really environmentally-friendly transport policy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted this debate is happening at last."
"As the Member for the Val d' Aosta, I have been calling for a moment' s reflection in this House for many months, because I believe these issues should be resolved through institutional channels, this is the true alternative to futile protests."
"It is sad that this should happen on the day after the accident in the St Gotthard tunnel, which used to be referred to as one of the safest of tunnels, and, what is more, in Switzerland, which is the only European country - not yet part of the European Union - that has truly embarked on a policy of transferring freight from road to rail."
"Mont Blanc has always been a symbol: it has been the symbol of mountaineering and also the symbol of road transport, with this tunnel built in the 1960s, which for many years was the most important tunnel in the Alps."
"Nobody could ever have imagined that we would see such intense growth in road transport, and I must say that 24 March 1999 was, for those who saw it, like me, a tragic day: the sight inside the tunnel was truly appalling."
"I believe that all these events should serve to make it clear that extreme positions on both sides are useless. The extremist approach adopted by those who say 'stop the HGVs' is unrealistic."
"It offloads HGVs onto someone else and proposes a utopian world without transport and without mobility; naturally, however, we must also say no to those who call for 'unlimited transport for all: the economy needs it.'"
"I believe this is an unsustainable position for mountain peoples like those in the Val d' Aosta, whom I represent, just as a pretence at a setting a limit would also be unsustainable."
"In fact, we are asking for a daily ceiling on HGV numbers - a genuinely effective serious limit."
"On the eve of this meeting, Società Autostrade, the motorway operator, told us that, according to the tunnel calculations, traffic will be 30 per cent lower than before the tragedy."
"I do not know if this will suffice, but I must say that the right approach is in the White Paper, the Alpine Convention transport protocol and the Swiss model. Under the swiss model, it was decided to agree to HGVs if they pay a tax and to invest the revenue, together with other capital, in rail tunnels."
"We want rail tunnels: we want the Turin-Lyon tunnel; we also want the Aosta-Martigny tunnel, this rail project that may acquire vital, decisive importance."
"In the meantime, however, we want real, serious limits for the sake of safety and the environment."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the St Gotthard disaster, which has caused many victims, incontrovertibly belies the arguments that prevailed in Mr Gayssot' s decision to reopen the Mont-Blanc tunnel."
"We cannot limit ourselves to lamenting the victims."
"We must finally take action to definitively stop this flood of disasters and we have good reasons for demanding this in Parliament."
"From the environmental point of view, reopening the Mont-Blanc tunnel goes against the commitments given by the European Union and its Member States on reducing greenhouse gas emissions."
"What is the point of our voting in favour of sustainable transport and switching from road to rail if, at the first opportunity to show determination to reverse the 'everything by road' trend, this option is removed?"
"In the two years of work on the tunnel, rail freight transport has not increased."
"It has remained static at 10.5 million tonnes per year, whereas additional rail capacity does exist and the 13.5 million tonnes that transit every year through the Mont-Blanc tunnel could have been absorbed by rail if capacity had been doubled for transit through Mont-Cenis, through the link that runs south of Lake Geneva and through the Dijon-Valorme link."
"It is incomprehensible that this rail solution should have been ignored, since it represents a transit capacity of up to 20 million tonnes per year via trans-Alpine routes."
"I should like the Commissioner to take note of this point, because I am giving him very practical proposals."
"It seems, however, that he is not interested."
"I would, therefore, like to say to him that we completely disagree with his analysis of the safety of the Mont-Blanc tunnel."
"This is another reason why we do not accept that it should be reopened."
"The EUR 200 million' s worth of work that has been undertaken, without an impact assessment or a public inquiry, does not meet the highest safety requirements."
"The tunnel is still a narrow (seven metres wide) single-direction tube that has no tarmac-covered and, therefore, fire-resistant surface, central escape hatch or parallel evacuation tunnel."
"The old ventilation duct will be used for evacuation."
"Safety must be of primary importance for all forms of transport and not only, as you stated, for air transport."
"The Commission must, therefore, reject the reopening of the Mont-Blanc tunnel and accept the proposals that the Commissioner has ignored, but which are perfectly appropriate alternative proposals, which seek to use the railways for transit through the Alps."
"Mr President, this debate comes just a few hours after another terrible tragedy in the St Gotthard tunnel, with ten people known to have died and eighty missing, according to the latest news."
"This tunnel has the same specification as the tunnel rebuilt under Mont Blanc: substantially the same technical specification as regards safety, with the same carriageway width of about seven metres, or even worse, in that the Mont Blanc tunnel has no parallel service tunnel."
"Having heard the Commissioner, I have come to the following conclusion: more disasters will have to happen in order finally to persuade the European Commission to give up its policy of White Papers, which no longer apply, and the associated illusion that technology can solve any problem, and make it realise that a 40-tonne lorry in a seven-metre-wide tunnel is a lethal weapon."
"Commissioner, we must ask the governments involved to delay the reopening of the Mont Blanc tunnel so that we can seriously reconsider what kinds of vehicles should be allowed to use it."
"We must say no to large HGVs; we should place a strict limit on the number of HGVs that can go through each day and we should ban dangerous loads."
"This is the only way we can prevent further disasters."
"Mr President, the events of yesterday morning have, unfortunately, plunged us once again into the Mont-Blanc tunnel disaster and this debate that we are having today has become more topical than ever."
"I totally agree with Mr Santini when he says that closing a link such as a tunnel beneath the Alps causes real economic problems, and I fully understand this, but nor do I feel that we can call for it to be reopened unless all safety guarantees are met."
"Furthermore, even today we still do not know the real causes of the accidents that take place in these tunnels, any more than we know what guarantees we may be given that they will not happen again."
"I am sorry first of all that the Council is not present to hear this debate, even though the Commissioner made it quite clear that this concerns a principle of subsidiarity."
"I am sorry that the Council is not here to say what it intends to do within the framework of a land-use planning policy."
"We are never given answers to our questions on the real trans-European networks, be they railways or roads."
"Incidentally, Mr President, Commissioner, I should like us to jointly put pressure on the Council to give us answers."
"We cannot keep on asking the same questions, when terrible accidents unfortunately occur, which are still unanswered two or three years later."
"I would, therefore, say that it is now crucial that we question the Council and that we should have a real land-use planning policy that takes account of the railways and which plans the trans-European road networks so that such disasters cannot happen again."
"Mr President, allow me to add my condolences to those expressed to the families of the victims and the citizens of Switzerland in general for yesterday' s terrible accident in the St Gotthard tunnel."
"Road tunnel accidents have been on the increase in recent months, and this makes it particularly urgent for safety measures not to be delayed any further with White Papers and vague proposals."
"The reopening of the Mont Blanc tunnel, already well behind the schedule agreed on by the Italian and French Governments in January 2001, must take place within the framework of a number of conditions to ensure traffic safety and reduce environmental problems to a minimum."
"In concrete terms, it is a matter of putting into operation traffic control mechanisms inside the tunnel, so that, with the application of new technologies and the constant presence of surveillance personnel, any accident will be picked up straight away."
"Traffic must also be regulated to prevent too many heavy goods vehicles being in the tunnel at the same time; such vehicles could be allowed through in only one direction at a time, for instance, and there could be tighter speed limits and other similar measures."
"A definitive list should be drawn up of goods banned from being transported through the tunnel, and, in this respect, let us remember that the St Gotthard incident would not have been so serious if one of the HGVs had not been carrying material as flammable as tyres. We should also adopt any other provisions that will help distribute commercial vehicle journeys evenly among the all-too-few road tunnels linking Italy to Europe."
"We will only find a solution to the many problems posed by road tunnels if, of course, there is a definite shift of freight from road to rail, and it is in this direction that the Union should be directing its efforts."
"Such a shift, however, is a process that takes time, and so it seems rather unrealistic for those people, who are without doubt moved by the best environmentalist intentions - which we all share - to call today for the total closure of the Mont Blanc tunnel to commercial traffic."
"It should be noted that in Italy, at least, those same people are also protesting at the building of a new, faster high-speed railway line between Turin and Lyon, designed precisely to help distribute goods transport more evenly, which just shows how contradictory or even absurd such positions, held by certain Italian political groups, can be."
"While, therefore, we share the environmental concern to protect the alpine environment of the Val d' Aosta, we must not fail to take into account the economic interests - including jobs - that the tunnel implies, particularly for the valley itself and also for Italy as a whole."
"These legitimate interests are in fact reflected in surveys carried out in the valley, according to which the great majority of the citizens want the tunnel to reopen."
"What we ask is for the tunnel to be reopened with the safety measures mentioned above implemented, and, at the same time, for there to be a decisive international initiative to develop a new rail infrastructure, including, in particular, the new Turin-Lyon line, improved commercial traffic handling on the Turin-Bardonecchia-Amberieu line, and the widening of the Col di Tenda tunnel and the Aosta-Martigny tunnel."
"We call on the Italy-France intergovernmental commission, set up under the January 2001 declaration, to report to the European Parliament on all this as soon as possible."
"Mr President, Commissioner, so despite the proven risks, despite the hostility of the communities of the valleys, it has been decided to reopen the Mont Blanc tunnel to heavy goods vehicles, deliberately sacrificing the alternative of rail transport."
"The Maurienne valley, the Fréjus tunnel, the valleys of Briançon, the Mont Genèvre pass and the Chamonix valley deserve a better fate than being merely HGV fodder', as the Savoy League put it."
"Alas, it seems that the road transport lobbies come before the health of the inhabitants, the safety of travellers or respect for sites of outstanding beauty."
"What have the countries concerned done since March 1999 to replace road with rail?"
"Not a thing."
"Between the first half of 2000 and the first half of 2001, rail freight between Italy and France fell by 8% and combined transport by 10%."
"In face of such lack of foresight, I can only support the request from the Savoy League for an independent international agency - which could be the Commission - to draw up a report on the Alpine passes between France and Italy and for, in the meantime, the Alpine tunnels to be reserved for tourist traffic and regional and inter-valley traffic, with strict limits on size and tonnage."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in 1999 we had the Mont Blanc tunnel disaster."
"Yesterday, we had another tragedy, in the St Gotthard tunnel."
"This chapter of disasters is certainly not coincidental, it is the human price we pay for basing our goods transport system on HGV transport and pursuing the maximum profit, which creates terrible risks."
"Since the Mont Blanc tunnel was closed, the Maurienne valley has had to absorb the weight of all the traffic and is suffocating as a result."
"The St Gotthard tragedy will lead to even more re-routed traffic for the valley to absorb."
"Even in normal times there are not enough crossing points."
"So we need to tackle the problem of transit transport."
"We have to look for global solutions."
"In this context, reopening the Mont Blanc tunnel would mean ensuring that the correct distances between vehicles are observed, that road traffic is regulated, that partial traffic bans are observed, that ceilings on lorry numbers are imposed and observed, that the limits laid down for lorry-drivers' working hours are observed and that safety rules are continuously monitored."
"Finally, it would mean undertaking to develop 'piggybacking' and making immediate use of the existing transverse lines, which are under-used."
"We urgently need to review the entire policy of goods transport in Europe."
"The Union must finance adequate investment to that end."
"I think that in sensitive areas we should give up road goods transport, which means that, as of now, we have to mobilise the necessary resources for speeding up the development of piggybacking."
"The European Union must now show the political courage to make new and bold choices."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, the recent tragic accidents have again made us all aware that we have a lot of catching up to do in road transport in particular, especially when it comes to developing infrastructures for intermodal transport systems."
"I do not want to prolong the debate unnecessarily, but I would like to ask a very open question. Which way will the traffic go if the Mont Blanc Tunnel, the St Gotthard Tunnel and the St Bernard Tunnel are closed?"
"I am very much afraid - and that fear is shared by the population of Austria and the population all along the Alps - that the traffic will then go over the Brenner Pass and that we will have major problems in that highly sensitive region of the Alps, problems that will affect not only North and South Tyrol but also Trentino."
"I therefore implore you to be really forward looking in tackling this issue because it is not only a matter of road safety but of the environment in which many people live."
"Mr President, I was told I had three minutes' speaking time but no matter."
"I would like to say briefly, now that another accident has occurred in the St Gotthard tunnel, that I think there is a difference between learning lessons from that accident and exploiting its emotional charge for political ends."
"If we use the deaths in the St Gotthard tunnel, which, of course, we all deplore, as a pretext for saying that we must not reopen the Mont Blanc tunnel, then we should also close the Fréjus tunnel, the Arlberg tunnel and the Brenner Pass."
"In fact, we should close every Alpine tunnel that presents the same accident risks."
"Clearly, that would totally paralyse southern Europe because, quite simply, we no longer have a choice today."
"As everybody here knows, the railways are not ready either institutionally, technically or economically to take over from the roads."
"Therefore, it seems to me that we have to take two kinds of measures, short term and long term."
"In the short term, we must make the tunnels safer and take urgent measures, whether in Mont Blanc, where this has now been done, or in other tunnels, to regulate the traffic, ensure that no hazardous materials are carried through, strengthen the security, safety and intervention systems and speed up the adoption of a European directive on tunnel safety."
"This is much talked about but it has not yet materialised, so we must put it on the agenda very soon."
"That aside, like everyone else here I believe that, in the long term, we should quite simply be able to ban, once and for all, heavy goods vehicles in tunnels because they are, in fact, the most dangerous vehicles, but that assumes that alternatives exist, and the Commission has, indeed, presented them in its White Paper."
"There are other projects too that need to be speeded up, including, in the case of the Alps, the two rail tunnels, the one between Lyon and Turin and the Brenner tunnel; there are similar projects in the Pyrenees, where the traffic situation is even more serious, although this is never mentioned."
"I believe we must also assume our responsibility here and speak out."
"For my part, I feel we are still far from doing so."
"The Commission has produced an excellent White Paper; it is very good at laying down requirements, but it has not as yet paid out enough to enable us to make the transition to rail in the very short term."
"We therefore need to allocate far, far greater resources to improving rail capacity."
"Let me finish by saying that public opinion is now concerning itself with transport policy - which is a good thing - and as a result, it is no longer a matter just for the specialists, for the large State bodies."
"It means we will all be judged by whether we can implement rapid solutions, not just the politicians but also the railwaymen and the hauliers."
"Let me conclude by saying that I also hope we will not confine ourselves to imposing constraints while rejecting all the solutions. In regard to north-south transport, I think we should also look again at adapting the Rhine-Rhone canal to heavy goods transport."
"We cannot say that we have to put a stop to road transport while, at the same time, rejecting transport by river and inland waterway which would relieve much of the pressure on the roads."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking you for your contributions to this debate; they were all very constructive and sought to find a solution to this very grave problem."
"On the quite specific question of signing the Alpine Convention, the Commission will endeavour to get the Council to sign during the course of the Belgian Presidency."
"On the other hand, the primary concern is naturally for safety."
"I do not think it will work if we now quite simply push all safety matters up to the European level."
"Everyone must see to it in the areas for which he or she is responsible."
"The national authorities must do that just as much as we have to fulfil our own responsibilities, but we cannot take over the responsibilities of the national authorities."
"So the fact is that the question of reopening and the question of safety standards must be settled primarily by the French and Italian authorities."
"There is a procedure for that."
"That procedure has been completed and we have the result."
"If those authorities come to the conclusion that reopening is justified, then that is what must happen."
"On the other hand, we must also be clear at European level that we can only act within the framework of our own competencies."
"The fact is, too, that the very White Paper that my colleague Mrs de Palacio has presented, is intended first of all to clarify those competencies and secondly also to see that traffic becomes even safer and also that the environmental effects of traffic are kept in check so that there is no further damage to the particularly sensitive areas of the European Union."
"Regarding the question of the Euro-toll disc regulation, as I said, we shall be submitting a draft for it in 2002."
"In this connection we shall also be considering whether it is necessary to create some kind of transitional arrangement for the transit agreement with the Republic of Austria."
"Essentially, this depends on how quickly our Member States and the European Parliament can agree on the contents of the White Paper."
"It will not be possible to actually implement these things until we are in a position to create a new, improved infrastructure costs directive and adopt the other parts of the White Paper."
"We therefore have the answer to the question."
"The Commission has no way - no legal way in particular - of preventing the opening of the Mont Blanc Tunnel."
"But I am very much in favour of an appropriately intensive debate on the new White Paper so that definite decisions can be taken as soon as possible."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have come to the end of the Commission statement on the reopening of the Mont Blanc tunnel earlier than expected."
"The following report, by Mr Lannoye, is set for debate at 4.00 p.m., and this time cannot be changed."
"This being the case, we have no choice but to suspend the sitting and resume at the previously fixed time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 3.46 p.m. and resumed at 4.00 p.m.)"
"Fisheries and poverty reduction"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0334/2001) by Mr Lannoye, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the Commission communication on fisheries and poverty reduction [COM(2000) 724 - C5-0071/2001 - 2001/2032(COS)]."
"Mr President, this communication from the Commission deals with a key issue for the developing countries: how can the fisheries policy conducted by these countries help reduce poverty?"
"I will now present the resolution adopted by the Committee on Development and Cooperation under a special procedure - the Hughes procedure - which means the Committee on Fisheries was closely involved in drawing up the report."
"Let me also point out that the resolution fully endorses the opinion delivered by the Committee on Fisheries."
"In the report and the resolution, we start from two key premises."
"Firstly, in the developing countries, the respective contribution of the coastal communities to food security and employment make this sector a major factor of sustainable development and poverty reduction in these regions."
"Secondly, and unfortunately on a less positive note, we find a constant depletion of fish resources in these developing countries' fishing zones."
"In the context of fisheries relations between the European Union and the developing countries, the Committee on Development believes that we need to encourage observance of the principles of the FAO's Code of Conduct for Responsible Fishing."
"Let me remind you of the main points of this code: application of the precautionary principle in resource management, giving priority to the needs of coastal communities in the developing countries and, in particular, those engaged in small-scale fishing, active participation by those directly concerned, namely the local communities, and, finally, cooperation at sub-regional, regional and global level in promoting the conservation and management of resources."
"To that end, the Committee on Development proposes a range of strategic measures focused on the need to ensure coherence between the European Union's sectoral policies and its development policy."
"I am thinking, of course, mainly of fisheries policy but also of regional policy."
"The first proposal set out in the resolution is that EU development policy must pay greater attention to the developing countries' fishing industry by drawing up country-specific cooperation strategy documents resulting from the political dialogue between the European Union and the country concerned."
"The second is that account must be taken of the need to improve the living conditions of coastal communities in the context of the various priority intervention areas defined within this cooperation strategy."
"Thirdly, we must apply specific mechanisms to reinforce the organisations representing the small-scale fishing industry, and in particular in the area of processing fisheries products."
"I am thinking here of women's organisations, which are extremely important in the developing countries and have relatively few operating resources."
"Fourthly, in the context of the fisheries agreements, abiding by the precautionary principle means carrying out prior scientific assessments of available resources; if there are any doubts, this precautionary principle must indeed be applied, meaning we must take the lowest hypothesis as the basis."
"Fifthly, it is important for the European Union to support surveillance and monitoring programmes in the developing countries' exclusive economic zones."
"We are all aware that some of these countries do not have the necessary technical means to do so."
"That is why it is important for the European Union to make its contribution, so as to avoid over-fishing and the poaching activities of certain vessels."
"In that spirit we must also help these countries combat flags of convenience and other vessels which fish illegally in their exclusive economic zones."
"Finally, our resolution calls on the Council to amend FIFG, so as to put a stop to grants of subsidies to Community ship-owners for transfers to flags of convenience."
"I have not gone into every aspect, but I am sure my colleague, Mr Varela, in the Committee on Fisheries, will be happy to present the particular points his committee has proposed."
". (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Fisheries has unanimously approved the report for which I was rapporteur and that today is included in the Lannoye report."
"I requested the Hughes procedure, because the matter has a profound effect on both fisheries and development cooperation."
"I sincerely believe that we in the Committee on Fisheries have significantly improved the original draft of the Lannoye report."
"We have contributed to focusing and balancing the hitherto exclusive point of view of the Committee on Development and Cooperation and particularly the opinions of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, that were held on this matter."
"International fisheries agreements are not harmful to fishing, to the European Union, or to third countries, as is sometimes claimed."
"On the contrary, they are beneficial to all."
"We should try to ensure that this mutual benefit is enjoyed by all those concerned, and this cannot be achieved only by means of the CFP."
"The development cooperation policy should become more involved, with more economic, financial and technical measures, as requested by our report and as shown in the information given in the explanatory statement."
"International fisheries agreements are trade agreements as the Council of the European Union acknowledged, even though they are dedicating more and more of their own funds to cooperation, yet they are of fundamental importance to cover the deficit in the supply of fish in the European Union and for jobs in Europe' s Objective 1 regions that we must also treat as a priority."
"Employment and economic and social cohesion in Europe are fundamental political principles of our Union."
"Are we keen to preserve the resources of third countries?"
"Of course."
"Is anyone more conservation-minded than the European Union?"
"Would other foreign fishing powers, in Asia, for example, which would take our place if we left them to it, have more respect for these resources?"
"Of course not."
"I think that the criticisms voiced in the Lannoye report on the agreements with Mauritania and Senegal are completely unfounded."
"I also disagree with the regional approach that is proposed, because international fisheries agreements apply to exclusive economic zones that are come under the sovereignty of third countries, and each State is sovereign and has different political and economic interests."
"Multilateral cooperation in international waters would be another matter altogether."
"I think, Mr President, that our Parliament has taken a positive step forwards."
"We would still ask the Commission to coordinate its cooperation and fishing competences."
"Parliament has set an example by coordinating our two committees and I think that this is right way to defend European interests, combining principles that we all advocate, such as the conservation of mankind' s natural resources and the eradication of poverty in the Third World, which requires development cooperation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, as we all know, reconciling various Community policies is a task that is necessary, but not always easy."
"To put it simply, when we are involved in the fight against world poverty, our work is not only important: it is crucial."
"Fish are a universally scarce resource."
"For the coastal communities of the poorest countries that live exclusively from fishing, it is a precious resource on which their very survival depends."
"We are, therefore, very pleased with the Commission statement on fisheries and poverty reduction and endorse Mr Lannoye' s report, both of which provide an intelligent definition of principles and suggest options that will enable us to reconcile supply for the Community market with the catching, processing and marketing of fish from the countries with which we have fisheries agreements."
"There is a wise Chinese proverb, which teaches that acting responsibly involves 'not giving a man a fish but teaching him how to fish' . This proverb is also applicable here, but with some changes because the fish we catch in other waters belong, first of all, to other countries."
"Promoting scientific research into resources and the equal sharing of this knowledge with developing countries, aid for the organisation of local communities that depend on fishing, improving and promoting mechanisms for regional cooperation and support for fighting against flags of convenience and illegal fishing are, therefore, only some of the measures that show that the course of action now being proposed is the right one for us to take together."
"Mr President, on many occasions I, like many other of my fellow members, have lamented the lack of coordination between different Community policies and between the various Directorates-General of the Commission. I could even say the same for the Parliamentary Committees in this House."
"There would be no contradictions between the common fisheries policy (CFP) and the development cooperation policy if Community instruments - the budget, to be precise - were more transparent."
"The European Union funds cooperation in fisheries with these countries in two different ways: international fisheries agreements and projects funded by the European Development Fund."
"An increasingly large proportion of financial compensation from the agreements is for this purpose - with regard to Madagascar, for example, it is 62% - which is not, of course, the ideal situation, given that the CFP is being asked to fund actions or compensations that have nothing to do with its real objectives."
"Those who say that the Community does not help the fisheries sector of developing countries are wrong."
"In response to a question I asked recently, Commissioner Nielson informed me that the Community had undertaken, with funding of EUR 421 million from the European Development Fund, 334 programmes, projects or actions to support the fisheries sector in these countries."
"I would remind you that the largest current fisheries agreement, the agreement with Mauritania, involves around EUR 80 million per year."
"I think that nothing could be of more use to the progress of developing countries than mutual trade with the European Union."
"Fisheries agreements allow them to obtain financial resources in return for giving the Community fleet fishing rights on various perishable resources whose capture, processing and marketing, require specialist companies and methods that these countries do not have themselves."
"In the same way that it would be absurd for us to oppose these countries' exporting their agricultural products to Europe, it would be appalling if we were to deny them the opportunity of selling their surplus fish supplies at international prices."
"This ill-informed approach to development cooperation would lead us to prevent developing countries from exporting their mining products to us, or to ask European energy companies to abandon these countries so that local companies can carry out operations, or to not pay Gabon or Nigeria the international price for a barrel of oil."
"Lastly, it is worth pointing out that the fishing grounds where the Community fleet operate are in international waters that do not belong to any one country, but are in Exclusive Economic Zones, according to the International Law of the Sea Treaty, that obliges all countries to leave the surplus resources from these zones that they cannot exploit themselves for other countries to use."
"This should take place within the framework of the sustainable management of resources, which is what the CFP is designed to achieve."
"The fishing carried out by the Community fleet that operates in these waters is compatible with the local small-scale fleet, which maintains the monopoly within a 12-mile zone."
"An interesting project for all those involved would be to help those countries to better manage this zone where spawning takes place and where the highest concentration of young fish is to be found."
"I congratulate Mr Lannoye on his excellent report and I ask everyone here to continue working on this cooperative approach."
"Mr President, poor, small fishermen are missing out because there are too many big rich fishermen."
"The European Union is suffering from severe excess capacity in the fishing industry, and is solving this problem by shifting some of the production to developing countries."
"Instead of modernising the fisheries sector, more than EUR 1 billion of government money is being spent on doing so every year."
"Naturally, the governments of poor countries are delighted to receive large sums of money for allowing large-scale fishing in their waters."
"However, it is better to facilitate the development of the indigenous fishing industry in economically weak countries than it is to let local fishermen bob about in their boats while the enormous proceeds from the catches are credited to the accounts of big European ship-owners."
"The precise consequences for fish stocks and the environment are unfortunately still unknown. However, it is certain that small, local operations will not be able to compete without subsidies or state support, and will thus continue to suffer a marginal existence."
"The Spanish and Portuguese fleets in particular will have to be curtailed in the foreseeable future."
"Furthermore, there must be much stricter supervision of the way in which the developing countries spend their compensation payments."
"This spending must fit in with the policy of targeted poverty reduction."
"Local fisheries must also be involved in the spending to a much greater extent."
"The European fisheries policy must be brought much more closely in line with European development policy."
"The European Union must systematically provide technical assistance for transferring knowledge about fisheries resources to developing countries."
"Most importantly, the poor countries must gain the know-how, the capacity and the investment they need in order to be able to fish in their own waters in a responsible way."
"In the longer term we must move away from these fishing agreements, which maintain redundant European fishermen but which cause developing countries to miss out."
"Mr President, a debate on fishing and poverty is not simple."
"And, since the rapporteur belongs to the Group of the Greens, Mr Lannoye' s efforts towards synthesis are all the more creditable."
"Poverty is the world' s main problem today and it unfortunately will continue to be so for many years."
"For some of the poorest countries in the world, fishing is one of their main resources; in fact, for many of them, it is their only economic resource."
"Mozambique receives 75% of its total income from the export of crustaceans, and this is a perfect example of a model of sustainable development."
"The rapporteur, Mr Lannoye, should be credited with proposing a realistic text, which retains a laudable dose of utopianism."
"I must say that the Commission' s proposal is coherent with the objective of responding to European interests, while making it compatible with a frame of reference for the development of countries for which fishing is an essential resource in their fight against poverty."
"I have mentioned the case of Mozambique, but it would be unfair not to say that there are other very positive aspects to this African country' s efforts to move forward, and there are other African countries which are acting well in relation to fishing, such as Namibia, to give but one example."
"It seems pertinent to insist on the need for the Union to be especially careful in complying with the code of conduct for responsible fishing, to which we are committed as members of the FAO."
"We must wait for the authorities of the developing countries to make the same effort."
"It is true that certain practices - as Mr Lannoye has mentioned - in certain specific cases of Community operators are unacceptable, but it is also the case that, sometimes, these practices would not be possible without the cooperation of the local operators involved."
"This problem is serious and complex and I therefore repeat that the efforts of the Commission and the rapporteur are creditable in that they offer us a balanced approach to it."
"Mr President, at a meeting a few days ago of Portuguese and Spanish Socialists in Santiago de Compostela, we said that European Union policies must always be judged in terms of the added value they contribute in the field of social cohesion."
"We thereby insisted that our Union must be, amongst other things but, for us, essentially, a great framework for intra-European solidarity."
"Naturally, this approach also goes for the actions of the united Europe in its relations with other countries, in particular the developing countries."
"So the policies of the European Union relating to these countries must also be judged in terms of the added value they contribute in relation to social cohesion, in other words, in terms of their contribution to progress towards a more balanced world with fewer inequalities."
"Therefore, while agreeing with the excellent and - in my opinion - not utopian report by Mr Lannoye, and speaking for the Parliament' s Committee on Development and Cooperation, we Socialists believe that we must take this criterion into account in assessing our fisheries policies and the agreements with third countries which make up these policies."
"I will not say that these agreements must be seen fundamentally as instruments of our development cooperation policy."
"We understand that there are other legitimate objectives, including the defence of the interests of the fisheries sectors in the Member States of the Union."
"But we would say that this fisheries policy must not contradict what we do in the field of cooperation and, above all, it must not contradict, either in the immediate, medium or long terms, the priority strategic objective we have set in the field of development cooperation, that is, the eradication of poverty in the countries of the South."
"In summary, we aspire to a fisheries policy which is coherent with what we are doing in relation to development cooperation."
"A fisheries policy which, at least as a collateral effect, contributes to the eradication of poverty in the countries with which we sign agreements so that we may fish in their waters."
"As well as respecting our partners and their rights as owners of those waters, we must learn the necessary lessons from our experience, which led us to exhaust the fish stocks off our coasts."
"It would be intolerable to repeat the same mistake in the fishing grounds of people for whom fishing may provide resources which are important for their own future."
"This respect and coherence with our goal of sustainable development for all must prevent egotistical and conceited actions by us, and by others who, equally irresponsible, through fishing activity in the third world, brought to reality the Spanish saying which says that we 'brought these people bread for today and hunger for tomorrow' ."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, fishing is an activity that mankind has practised throughout history, but it has never been a great source of wealth, as demonstrated by the fact that the Neolithic revolution was achieved through agriculture and not through fishing."
"Although the European Union' s fishermen currently enjoy a degree of protection and guarantees that offer them an acceptable standard of living, albeit lower than that of many other workers, the same cannot be said, unfortunately, of the fishermen and fishing communities to be found throughout the developing countries."
"For these reasons, the Commission communication should be welcomed, praised and supported, since it contains a clearly humanist approach that is enlarged upon in Mr Lannoye' s report. This acknowledges that fishing is an essential activity for many developing countries, but is threatened with extinction because resources are scarce and pressure on the various species is increasing."
"The fisheries agreements that the European Union concludes with third countries are essential to the survival of activities and cultures that are an integral part of the history and identity of many European countries."
"Nevertheless, these agreements cannot ignore and fail to respond to their impact on the vulnerable economies of the world' s poorer countries and regions."
"We therefore need to reconcile the legitimate interests of Community fishermen and consumers with the interests of poor communities in developing countries and with the preservation of fish stocks that are often devastated by an irrational method of fishing, that is also carried out under flags of convenience."
"In conclusion, the golden rule in this field must be to integrate the external requirements of the common fisheries policy into the overall policy of support for development already embarked on by the European Union."
"Lastly, I should like to express my support for the excellent work by Mr Lannoye, which shares, as I have already said, the Commission' s inspiration and contains extremely constructive and fair proposals to which we must give our support."
"Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission welcomes the very wide-ranging report and the proposed motion for a resolution, the content of which was formulated by the Committee on Development in close cooperation with the Committee on Fisheries."
"I also would like to sincerely thank you, Mr Lannoye, for your valuable work on this in your capacity as rapporteur."
"Your motion for a resolution stresses the need to take greater account in future of the development potential of local fisheries, especially small-scale coastal fisheries, and the needs of fisheries-dependent coastal communities."
"As is clear from the Commission communication entitled 'Fisheries and Poverty Reduction' , the Commission wants to take a more sector-based approach in promoting closer partnership and political dialogue with the developing countries."
"The developing countries' responsibility for determining their own development priorities and interests will be recognised and also directly encouraged."
"Let me now turn briefly to the various development problems that should in future be taken into account in fisheries agreements and to which you expressly refer in your resolution."
"The following in particular are mentioned as necessities. The quantities that the Community fleet is allowed to catch must not result in local fish stocks being decimated, and fisheries agreements must be signed only if they are compatible with sustainable development of the sector in the developing country concerned."
"The Commission is of the opinion that these principles, mentioned in the resolution, for taking account of development questions in the external aspects of the common fisheries policy are in harmony with the principles set out in the Commission communication on fisheries and poverty reduction and in the Green Paper on the future of the common fisheries policy."
"And we do in fact respect them when concluding fisheries agreements with third countries."
"In accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, we base our fisheries agreements on the available surplus stocks that the third country in question does not fish."
"The Commission also expressly shares the view that the principle of sustainable management of natural resources must be more strictly applied."
"These same principles will also be taken into consideration in the debate on the reform of the common fisheries policy initiated by the publication of the Green Paper a short while ago."
"Let me come to a final point, which concerns improved coordination between development cooperation policy and the external aspects of the common fisheries policy."
"I can say that the Commission shares Parliament' s view on this."
"The country and regional strategy papers produced in cooperation with the developing countries must pay greater attention to the link between development cooperation and the external aspects of the common fisheries policy."
"We will therefore also be addressing this subject in connection with the reform that is now being prepared."
"This really is my final point: Mr Lannoye, you pointed out that it would be important to suspend structural aids from the structural programmes if a ship is transferred to a third country."
"On this I can say that in the discussion about the extension of MAGP IV, which is coming next, we shall have to bear in mind that this thought has already been taken up in the proposal for extending MAGP IV and it is already part of the proposal."
"I hope that this will also meet with Parliament' s approval."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place this afternoon at 6.30 p.m."
"Community fisheries (1997-2001)"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0316/2001) by Mrs Attwooll, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a"
"1. Council decision amending Council Decision 97/413/EC concerning the objectives and detailed rules for restructuring the Community fisheries sector for the period from 1 January 1997 to 31 December 2001 with a view to achieving a balance on a sustainable basis between resources and their exploitation (COM(2001) 322 - C5-0308/2001 - 2001/0128(CNS));"
"2. Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999 laying down the detailed rules and arrangements regarding Community structural assistance in the fisheries sector (COM(2001) 322 - C5-0309/2001 - 2001/0129(CNS))."
"Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, the Committee on Fisheries accepts that in extending the rules concerning restructuring and structural assistance in the fisheries sector for one year, changes need to be made in the pilot reduction rates in order to maintain current levels."
"It welcomes the tightening up of provisions concerning the transfer of fishing vessels to third countries."
"Amendment No 6 to Article 1(3) asked the Commission to produce a list specifying which transfers are permissible and which are not."
"We hope it will be acceptable to them."
"The committee also welcomes the possibility of financial assistance being made available where any Community legislation imposes technical restrictions, but feels that Parliament should be kept informed of such cases - that is Amendment No 10."
"From this point, the Committee on Fisheries has difficulties with the Commission proposal in that it goes beyond an extension of the rules to making three substantive changes to them. These are: removing the possibility of an increase in capacity on safety grounds; allowing financial assistance for fleet modernisation and renewal only where objectives have been met purely by reduction in capacity; and allowing such financial assistance to any segment of the fleet only where every segment of the fleet has met its objectives."
"In voting the report, the Committee on Fisheries rejected each of these three changes."
"The motivation was mixed, relating both to the desirability of the changes themselves and the desirability of making them in the course of a one-year extension of the programme."
"For example, both the Committee on Fisheries and the Committee on Legal Affairs took the view that requiring every segment of the fleet to have reached its objectives before any segment could benefit from financial assistance ran counter to the principles of natural justice."
"Similarly, the proposal that financial assistance could be given only where objectives had been met purely by a reduction in capacity seemed unfair to those fleets where capacity and activity reductions had been combined."
"There are also doubts about making such a change in circumstances where there is increasing agreement that a variety of measures are needed to reduce fishing effort."
"Amendments Nos 4, 7, 8 and 9 are intended to maintain the status quo in relation to both these requests."
"The most difficult point has concerned the removal of the possibility of capacity increases on safety grounds."
"The Committee on Fisheries is highly committed to fishing safety."
"There is serious concern that shipowners simply will not make safety improvements unless they are given additional capacity for this."
"It was also argued that abuses of the provision should be prevented by proper controls and that such a change, if to be made at all, would be more properly done in the reform of the CFP as a whole."
"It is largely on the capacity issue that I part company with a number of my fellow committee members."
"Of course, we must find ways of ensuring that vessels are safe, but we can no longer afford to take risks with conservation either."
"The perilous state of cod stocks in the North Sea is but one example."
"Amendments Nos 2, 3 and 5, approved by the Committee on Fisheries, reject the changes on the capacity rules altogether."
"Amendments Nos 11 and 12, submitted by the ELDR Group, however, accept the Commission's approach in principle, but seek to allow capacity increases on safety grounds by way of exception for existing vessels under 12 metres. The justification for this exception is that taking away the possibility of financial assistance is likely to bear hardest on the sector and put safety improvements more seriously at risk in circumstances where they are likely to have only minor effects on capacity."
"I know that many of my colleagues - for reasons that I respect - will wish to take a different view, but I urge everyone in deciding how to vote on this report to bear in mind just how imperative the need for conservation has become."
"Mr President, it is a pleasure to speak on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, substantially in support of what my colleague, Mrs Attwooll, from the Committee on Fisheries, has said."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs looks at this issue through legal spectacles, as you would expect."
"From our point of view, it is not just important that the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy be achieved, though that is indeed important."
"We have to remember that the means through which the Community does this are means of the law, and therefore the principles of the law have to be respected in what is done."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs thought that the Commission's proposals fell down on two important legal principles, at two important points."
"The first was the principle of proportionality, and in effect Mrs Attwooll has already spoken about that this afternoon."
"In recital 3 the Commission said: ""Measures to improve safety should not lead to an increase in fishing effort and such measures should therefore be applied within the existing capacity objectives for the fleet""."
"That is to say that improvements in safety can be ignored just if the capacity objectives are not being sustained, regardless of effort."
"But the aim we all have is to prevent over-fishing, and it is effort that catches fish, not capacity."
"Therefore proportionality requires deletion of that."
"Secondly, in relation to the effective provisions about vicarious penalties."
"To require all segments of a national fleet to have achieved the annual objectives, as the Commission suggests, before any public aid for fleet modernisation or renewal can be granted, would be unlawful."
"It is contrary to the most rudimentary principles of natural justice."
"It would permit one fisheries segment to be penalised for things done, or left undone, in another."
"It could result in fishermen being penalised for the acts or omissions of their government and would thus constitute vicarious punishment."
"As a Scottish Member, I insist that these issues matter vitally to all parts of the Scottish fleet."
"Those who meet their targets for reduction of capacity should not be punished for those who do not and should not carry the can for failures by the UK Government or the Scottish Government."
"Mr President, first of all, I commend my colleague, Mrs Attwooll for the work she has done in this report."
"Although we are only dealing with an extension of MAGP IV for one year, the Commission proposals seek to reduce over-fishing and achieve the 40% reduction in effort across the EU fleet which they have been consistently pointing out is absolutely essential, if we are to have any hope of a sustainable industry in the future."
"I know that some controversy has arisen - and Mrs Attwooll mentioned this - over the question of aid for measures to improve safety in navigation; working conditions; and hygiene on board fishing vessels."
"It goes without saying that all of us wish to see our fishermen working in the safest, cleanest and most secure conditions."
"But there is no doubt that such aid has been abused in the past to increase fishing effort, leading to further over-exploitation of dwindling fish stocks."
"It seems to me pointless that we try to achieve a reduction in over-fishing as a core policy objective on the one hand, while continuing to facilitate cheating at the taxpayer's expense on the other."
"The whole point of the MAGP is to reduce fishing effort and bring it into better balance with the existing fish stocks."
"Only this week the need for continued for vigilance in this area was again highlighted with the publication of the ICES report on the prospects for catches in 2002."
"They point out that a number of fish stocks remain in a state of great jeopardy, particularly cod, although they also point out that there have been slight improvements in haddock and whiting stocks in the North Sea."
"In that respect I was horrified to read that Danish fisheries inspectors last month boarded a Danish industrial fishing boat and discovered 114 tonnes of juvenile cod in a 543 tonne total catch that was supposed to be composed entirely of sand eels."
"Pulverising valuable young haddock into fishmeal to feed to salmon in the fish farming sector is complete madness."
"It is a crime against everything we are trying to achieve."
"I hope that when we come to vote on this report later today, we bear in mind that the whole point of MAGP philosophy is to reduce over-exploitation and nothing we do in applying public aid to the EU fleet should undermine that principle."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Attwooll for the magnificent work she has done on this report which is going to be so useful to us."
"Adjusting the Community fleet to the resources available is a fundamental objective of the CFP."
"Furthermore, it is a common sense requirement if we want our fishing to be a viable economic activity and our fishing sector to be a viable economic sector."
"We therefore welcome the extension of the current MAGP IV until 31 December 2002."
"As I have said, the Socialist Group supports Mrs Attwooll' s report, which was approved by consensus in the Committee on Fisheries, and we thank her for the compromise achieved in our committee, together with the Members presenting amendments, a compromise which the Council is still far from reaching."
"Parliament is sending a good signal by anticipating an agreement which the Council can accept."
"The Commission' s proposal is not restricted to extending the current MAGP by one year, but it also intends to introduce, as has been said, criteria relating to safety, which should be debated in the context of a new MAGP."
"I regret that the Commission has not made any reference to the question of safety in the White Paper on the reform of the CFP."
"I would like to point out that, as this House approved (on debating and approving my report on fishing accidents), Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the application of measures to promote the improvement of health and safety of workers in the workplace is also fully applicable to vessels of less than 12 metres."
"We ask for preventive measures, with a view to preventing accidents, both in relation to the design of vessels and life-saving equipment and to the introduction of rules of management of resources with consequences for human safety, the size and power of vessels."
"Lastly, I would like to point out to Commissioner Fischler that if there is one thing we were unanimous on during the hearing organised by the European Commission to present the Green Paper, it was precisely the fact that Community aid for the modernisation of the fleet should remain in force."
"Let me begin by saying that the Greens support the proposal of the Commission for both the FIFG and the MAGP."
"We also agree with the rapporteur's amendments seeking to restrict the derogation for safety to vessels less than 12 metres in length and we would like to thank her for retabling these important amendments."
"However, we are entirely opposed to the proposal as it has now emerged from the committee."
"The amendments are removing the most progressive elements that the Commission is proposing."
"After all, both the MAGP and the FIFG are already so full of loopholes that you actually sail The Atlantic Dawn through."
"The proposal would simply close a couple of these more blatant loopholes."
"Glancing through a scientific report on the status of fish stocks makes for very depressing reading these days."
"It does not matter whether it is ICES, or the STECF or any of the regional bodies such as NAFO."
"Everywhere you look fish stocks are over-exploited and far too often severely depleted."
"The EU has had to take emergency measures for three cod stocks and northern hake and it is clear that other stocks will soon be added to the list."
"There is pretty much universal agreement that this deplorable situation is due to the excess capacity of the world's fishing fleets."
"The Commission is always reminding us of this, but the Member States and certain segments of the fishing industry are clearly in denial."
"The Community has agreed to several international instruments which seek to control fishing capacity and/or fishing effort."
"For instance, the FAO Code of Conduct provides that states should take measures to prevent or eliminate excess fishing capacity and should ensure that levels of fishing effort are in line with sustainable use of fisheries resources."
"But whenever the Commission tries to put these obligations into effect, they are shot down by Parliament and the Council."
"Some have argued that it is not reasonable to try and change a programme in the last year or that certain aspects of the proposal are contrary to the idea of natural justice."
"The FIFG is due to continue until 2006 and so there are several years in which these reforms could bring some sort of positive effect."
"Surely it is far from natural justice to refuse to take action now and to continue as if the future is bright, only to have more and more stocks decrease and to impose even further temporary or permanent closures."
"I would ask the Members of this House to consider the case of the northern cod stock off Newfoundland which provided 200 000 tonnes of fish every year for five centuries."
"In 1992, the Canadian Government had to close the fisheries even for subsistence fishing and there is still little if any sign of improvement in the stock."
"Is that the kind of future we want for our own coastal communities?"
"The time has come for us to take a long-term rather than just a 6-months to 12-months view."
"We really have to deal with this issue and I would like to support what the Commission is proposing."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the decision to extend the expiry date of the MAGP-IV until the end of next year, so as to include the results of the negotiations on the reform of the common fisheries policy, must not be used to undermine the interests of the countries that have so far met and even exceeded the reductions laid down in the MAGP, such as Portugal, whilst there are other Member States have not only failed to meet any of their targets but have even increased their fishing capacities."
"Equally, it is incorrect - as the rapporteur and various other Members have stated - to attempt to table amendments on the expiry date of the MAGP-IV that would have a detrimental effect on maritime safety, on the quality of life and safety of crews, on the value and quality of catches and on health and hygiene conditions."
"The Commissioner must, therefore, review the position he expresses in the proposals submitted to the European Parliament and accept most of the positions put forward by Parliament' s Committee on Fisheries."
"Mr President, Commissioner, if policy instruments are not working well, you adapt them, and if the adaptations do not produce a result, you abolish them."
"With this principle in mind, I was unpleasantly surprised by the Commission proposal before us."
"I well understand that the Commission does not want to introduce a new structure policy which may be obsolete within a year as a result of the fisheries policy reforms."
"However, I cannot shake off the impression that the Commission still does not realise that they are missing the boat with the current multiannual guidance programmes."
"To try to control fisheries with two very different instruments - the TACs and the quota on the one hand and the fleet structure policy on the other - will result in serious problems, particularly if the policy instruments serve different objectives, which is the case."
"TACs and quotas are the determining factor in managing fish stocks."
"Sustainable fishing can, nonetheless, only be achieved if there is room for an efficient fleet within the parameters set by the allowable catches."
"The fleet structure policy must support this."
"Unfortunately this is not happening."
"Under the MAGP, all kinds of subsidies are offered which are maintaining excess fleet capacity and therefore distorting competition."
"What is more, a number of Member States have introduced incentives which are further distorting competition."
"The common fisheries policy needs a clear objective, and the system of TACs and quotas must be the determining factor for this."
"This must also include a properly functioning control system with strict punitive measures."
"At the moment, the Commission is, nonetheless, holding onto its MAGP, with some changes which I can only describe as unfortunate."
"Under the guise of reinforcing the suitability of the MAGP, the Commission is ignoring the most elementary sense of justice in one of these amendments."
"By withholding government support, it is punishing one fishing segment for the excess capacity in another."
"Justice is further undermined by the Commission making a distinction based on the capacity reductions in the fleets."
"The fleet in my country regulates capacity by reducing activity (the ""days at sea restrictions"" )."
"Unlike other countries, the Netherlands is now excluded from European support for modernisation and renewal."
"In order to reverse these unfortunate changes, we will give our wholehearted support to the rapporteur's amendments."
"Mr President, under the pretext of extending MAGP IV for a further year so that it will coincide with the expected reform of the CFP, the Commission's intention was further to tighten up this instrument, which has become as disastrous for our small-scale fishing industry as it is ineffective in terms of regulating fishing."
"Thanks to the efforts of Mrs Attwooll and the Committee on Fisheries, I hope we have avoided the most unfair and dangerous aspects of this tougher line; more generally, however, the very principle of MAGPs needs to be questioned now."
"The professionals have never accepted this bureaucratic, brutal system, which is totally alien to the traditions and culture of the maritime world."
"Experience also shows that this instrument is crude, unfair, redundant and costly."
"Its negative effects are well-known and, coupled with the blocking of aid for new construction, it bolsters the second-hand market and dissuades young people from going into jobs connected with fishing."
"Within the framework of the debate in progress on reforming the CFP, we must therefore give absolute priority to the system of TACs and quotas."
"That has to be the instrument used to keep catches in line with resources."
"The new CFP must be based on the quota mechanism, which we need to fine-tune by putting it on a multiannual basis, making it more transparent and more scientific, relating it more closely to the fishing zones, closely involving the professionals and monitoring it effectively and fairly."
"Mr President, Commissioner, let us forget MAGPs and perfect the quota system; then we will be doing a good job."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we did not need the Green Paper on the future of the common fisheries policy to tell us about the serious problems facing fisheries in Europe."
"The Green Paper has merely made clear once again how serious they are."
"Our Committee is earnestly discussing the various approaches to solving the problems."
"We know we shall not be able to make all the difficulties simply disappear by waving a magic wand."
"If somebody really wants to pull the wool over our eyes about it, we must call it what it is, namely eyewash."
"The common fisheries policy as it has existed up until now has not succeeded in preventing the crises affecting a number of fish stocks or in reducing overcapacities in fleets."
"Whether we will all survive economically depends on the Union' s future ability to shape a fisheries policy in the new century."
"The Commission is now proposing extending the current multi-annual guidance programme for one year."
"In the light of the ongoing debate on reform, I think we also need such measures for the sake of continuity."
"We cannot of course solve the problems in this short space of time, but perhaps we can alleviate them a little."
"The crucial thing is that the programme should be properly carried out."
"We need data, but some Member States fail to provide that data or their data is incomplete."
"We therefore need a system of penalties to ensure the data is supplied at all, and we need comparable criteria and categories."
"Every shipowner wants to increase efficiency."
"But we must not shift the premises."
"We want better safety at sea."
"That is a central part of the European Parliament' s demands."
"But at the same time we should be careful to avoid negative effects on safety, even dressed up as increased efficiency."
"The proposed change to structural measures also misses the target at the present time."
"Making the achievement of objectives in all segments of the fleet a precondition for public subsidies is counterproductive because it penalises everyone for the failings of a few."
"Our policy will only find acceptance among fishermen if the conditions are fair."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, extending the multi-annual guidance programmes by one year to keep them in force pending the decision on future fleet policy after 2002 is sensible and I think it has everyone' s support in principle."
"The MAGP' s objectives are correct, but their implementation by the Member States still leaves much to be desired."
"The Commission' s reports in the past have shown us that over and over again."
"We have repeatedly criticised the failings in implementation and it is clear that the future fleet policy will have to remedy the situation."
"That is why the Commission wants to make changes to the MAGP and FIFG provisions as well as extending them by a year."
"I am opposed to some of those changes because I think these matters would be better resolved in the landmark decision about fleet policy."
"In my opinion there is no point in making extensive changes in the last year of MAGP IV' s validity, especially when they could have negative repercussions for safety on board fishing vessels."
"But if Member States are to continue to be able to apply for increases in capacity for measures designed to improve on-board safety and fishery product hygiene and these are to be paid for out of FIFG resources, something really must be done to ensure that those measures do not result in increased fishing."
"This condition is absolutely essential."
"We cannot have a situation where investments in on-board safety are prevented because the conditions for the application of the measures are not complied with or because many Member States are sometimes unable to ensure that they are or fail to do so."
"We ought to be using the debate about common fisheries policy reform to find solutions to the dilemma between on-board safety and careful management of stocks that has again been made clear by this report."
"No way must the one be at the expense of the other."
"Mr President, I should like to add my thanks to the rapporteur, a fellow Scot, for her work on this document, and likewise to my SNP colleague, Mr MacCormick, for leading the Committee on Legal Affairs' consideration of this report which I support."
"The size of our fishing fleet in the European Union is one of the greatest problems that we are faced with when considering CFP reform, but the real measure of activity should be effort as opposed to fleet size."
"In order to secure what we all want, sustainable fisheries, then surely fishing effort must be made to correspond to available resources."
"I agree with the need to extend MAGP4, but I have some concerns, in three areas in particular."
"Firstly, it is intolerable that safety has been taken out of the equation."
"The provisions that currently exist to increase objectives on grounds of safety should be maintained."
"We should be looking for tighter control and management to ensure that these provisions are not used to circumvent the rules."
"Safety must remain a priority and I hope the Commission will recognise this and also make up for its failure to include adequate provisions on safety in the Green Paper."
"Secondly, while there must be penalties for non-implementation of MAGP targets, surely they must be targeted at the guilty parties."
"It must be wrong to penalise one segment directly for the acts or omissions of another."
"It is also necessary to make sure that those Member States which claim to have met their MAGP targets are not simply transferring their vessels to other flags."
"Thirdly, the proposals which limit financial assistance from FIFG to segments where reduction of fishing effort is obtained through capacity reductions only seems to me unjust and would discriminate against fishermen whose Member States choose to reduce effort through schemes such as days at sea."
"One reason why these targets are not met is that some Member State governments have not been prepared to match funding for restructuring."
"The Commission must look at ways of ensuring that restructuring funds can be distributed in an equitable fashion throughout the EU fishing industry."
"There is a need for more standardised and more rigorous assessment procedures right across the EU."
"Only if we have fixed, clear and comparable criteria for the measurement of vessels, including engine power and tonnage, can there be confidence in the targets that are set by MAGPs."
"Mr President, I would also like to thank Mrs Attwooll for her cooperation leading to a compromise which, in my opinion, very much improves the Commission' s two proposals, which were originally untimely and doomed not to be complied with."
"It is hard to accept that, six months before the end of a programme to restructure the fleet, the sector can be told, without scientific or technical justifications, that fishing capacity cannot be reduced by means of restructuring efforts and that the only solution is pure scrapping, all because the Commission made a small calculation error four years ago."
"And that, furthermore, while they are at it, they take the opportunity to turn the bases of MAGP IV and key elements of the FIFG Regulation on their heads, which is completely unacceptable, and I believe there is general agreement on this here."
"If we add to this the fact that the greatest burden of the new requirements, as has been said, rests on the elimination of the facilities intended to improve the safety of ships, it begs the question of whether the Commission ever thinks about the fisheries sector when it starts coming up with brilliant ideas at the last minute."
"I therefore ask that you vote in favour of the amendments of the Committee on Fisheries because I still cannot understand, and the sector understands even less, what is the point in reserving safety measures just for vessels of less than 12 metres, when it is precisely the largest ships which have more crew and work furthest from the coast and therefore face considerably more risk and, in the event of emergency, have most difficulties getting back to port. And all of this with winter just around the corner and in waters which, like European Atlantic waters, are not exactly a mill pond."
"It is fair to recognise that the Commission tried, from the outset, to coincide the end of the MAGP IV with the reform of the CFP in 2002."
"But, since 1997, it knew that it was not going to manage it and on that basis the Commission should have started work on an MAGP V which would have eliminated the errors committed so far and, meanwhile, simply extend the MAGP IV."
"And extension, Commissioner, cannot in any way be used to change the rules of the game which we have had up to now."
"Mr President, I would also like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Attwooll, for the spirit of consensus she has created in our committee in order to arrive at compromise amendments, particularly with Mrs Fraga Estevez and to substantially improve, as has been said, the Commission' s proposal on a key issue, which we all recognise, in the current common fisheries policy and in the policy that we are creating for the coming years."
"European fleet policy is a sensitive and complicated issue - this is something we all agree upon."
"However, if each State defends its own interests and only complies when it is in its own interest, we clearly get nowhere."
"Therefore, the Commission must rise to the challenge, through an effective policy accepted by everyone, of designing a fleet that is really suited to our fishing needs."
"A safe, effective and competitive fleet."
"Mrs Attwooll' s report, like the report by Mr Busk, is currently of fundamental importance."
"We want it to draw attention, on the one hand, to the fact that the increase in onboard safety measures has nothing to do with increasing fishing capacity or power, and on the other, to the need not to introduce substantial last-minute changes to programmes which have been in operation for five years, because an annual extension is one thing, but to change fundamental conditions in the general philosophy of the MAGPs now, at the last minute, is quite another."
"I therefore hope that the House supports this message which the Committee on Fisheries wants to send this afternoon, and that the Commission will, of course, take it into account."
"Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking you, Mrs Attwooll, for preparing this report."
"I have been listening to the debate very attentively and now feel somewhat obliged to clarify a few things because there seem to be some quite serious misunderstandings about this Commission proposal."
"First there is the question, do we need a fleet policy or not?"
"In my opinion we do need a fleet policy and we need an effective - and more effective - fleet policy because the present rules are far from adequate."
"We have tremendous overcapacity in our European fleet as a whole, and if we do not adjust that fleet to possible future fishing opportunities, we will never be rid of these difficulties."
"I would also like to say to you clearly and in all honesty that we will not meet that objective at all with MAGP IV."
"With MAGP IV we are a long way from achieving a reduction of 30%, let alone 40%."
"There is a report with which you are probably familiar, I hope you are, which says that we will at best achieve 5% over the full MAGP period and even that is very unlikely."
"What is more likely is that the entire MAGP IV exercise will have had no effect."
"That is the reality, that is the truth and that is what we have to deal with."
"But there is a second principle we must see as well."
"In my opinion it makes little sense to isolate fleet policy from the rest of the common fisheries policy."
"We must see it in the context of the other essential political elements of our common fisheries policy."
"We therefore believe that it is entirely correct to include consideration of the future of fleet policy when devising our new common fisheries policy, which we intend to do next year."
"The proposal we have submitted can be understood only in this light."
"MAGP IV expires next year and that would mean that we would have to isolate all other areas of the new fisheries policy from that of fleet policy."
"That is why we had the idea of seeking this one-year extension so that they could be synchronised."
"But we do not really want at the same time to lay ourselves open to the charge of prolonging an ineffective arrangement for a year."
"That was why we also proposed a few measures to improve this MAGP."
"There is also the fact that a few Member States are not even keeping to the modest targets of MAGP IV."
"Unfortunately, the Commission has no other way of enforcing compliance with the MAGP objectives than to introduce proceedings before the European Court of Justice."
"That is why we have also submitted proposals to that effect."
"This brings me to the amendments that have been tabled."
"Amendments Nos 1 to 3 and 5 are concerned with the question of safety at sea."
"Here, too, I want to clearly say that no one should accuse the Commission of being against more safety at sea."
"We too are aware of the problems and accidents that have recently occurred at sea."
"So we are also aware of how necessary it is to improve safety, and we are also promoting that."
"Community resources are being deployed to improve safety."
"I do not dispute that in some cases enhancing safety increases the weight of the ships."
"But that has nothing to do with the fact that we cannot therefore demand that the increase in weight of just one ship should be compensated for by taking more ships out of use."
"That is what this is about."
"After all, there is no prohibition on installing more additional safety devices on a particular vessel."
"That is why we are not prepared to accept these four amendments."
"We are able to accept Amendments Nos 11 and 12 because the application of the safety clause remains confined to vessels under 12 metres in length that no longer fish with drag nets."
"This is of particular benefit to older vessels that are engaged chiefly in coastal fishing and for which an increase in capacity and engine power are justified, subject to clear conditions, if that enhances safety."
"I am quite concerned about Amendments Nos 4, 7, 8 and 9."
"They reject any form of restriction on access to FIFG aid."
"But this is after all the only mechanism we have for reducing fleet capacity at all."
"It must be obvious that the Community' s lavish modernisation aid is thwarting all our efforts to reduce the size of the fleet."
"How will it ever work if we first offer Community public funds for ships to be broken up and then also use Community funds to encourage the purchase of new ones?"
"At some point we are going to have to decide which of these two things is to have priority."
"Parliament has also said in this connection that it is not appropriate to amend the provisions of a regulation that was adopted less than two years ago for a period of six years."
"In view of the present difficult situation regarding stocks, I think the time has now come to talk about this question, too."
"Finally, Amendment No 6 amplifies a provision that was included in the regulation at your instigation, and that provision bans FIFG aid for exports or for the formation of joint ventures."
"We have already discussed this point in connection with the previous agenda item."
"The Commission is in total agreement on this point and suggests that the lists of countries that break these rules should also be published."
"Finally, the Commission is unable to agree to Amendment No 10 because it involves a procedure internal to the Commission, for which the Commission alone is competent."
"It ought therefore to be handled under the Commission's aegis."
"Thank you, Commissioner Fischler."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 6.30 p.m."
"EEC/Senegal fisheries agreement"
"The next item is the report (A5-0314/2001) by Mr Gallagher, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council Regulation [COM(2001) 422 - C5-0405/2001 - 2001/0168(CNS)] on the conclusion of two Agreements in the form of exchanges of letters concerning the extension of the Protocol establishing the fishing opportunities and financial compensation provided for in the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Senegal on fishing off the coast of Senegal for the periods 1 May 2001 to 31 July 2001 and 1 August 2001 to 31 December 2001."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this proposal for a Council regulation concerns the prolongation of the fisheries protocol which has been in force between the EU and Senegal for the period of 1 May 1997 to 30 April 2001."
"The prolongation concerns two periods."
"The first period is from 1 May 2001 until 31 July and the second from 1 August 2001 to 31 December."
"After several rounds of negotiations starting in Brussels in January 2001 no agreement was reached between the EU and Senegal on the renewal of the current protocol."
"Last June, Senegal suspended negotiations until October in order to gain time to analyse the fisheries issues and their effects."
"Breaking off the negotiations did not have the same negative impact as it had at the end of 1996 when all fisheries were suspended."
"This time there has been no suspension and good sense has prevailed on both sides."
"According to estimates by Senegal's research institute, which was carried out in 1996, the available resources at that time would permit catches of some 465 000 tonnes. However, recent scientific analysis has shown that, in spite of the satisfactory utilisation rates in this segment, coastal demersal resources have plummeted and have forced the small-scale and industrial fleet to fish in neighbouring countries."
"Of course, sustainable fishing is one of the leading principles of the common fisheries policy."
"Signals about the critical state of some fish stocks must be taken into account by both parties when negotiations are resumed."
"Until the date of resumption of negotiations, the Senegalese Government is carrying out a new study to determine the country's present fisheries potential."
"Since the question of durable management was one of the breaking points at the negotiations, the Senegalese Government will make use of the results of this study later this year in negotiating with the EU."
"The fisheries possibilities and the financial contribution from the Community have remained unchanged."
"The compensation to be paid by the Community for the eight months of this year will be calculated on a pro rata basis, meaning that the compensation for the period 1 May until the end of the year will be two-thirds of the yearly sum of EUR 12 million."
"That payment has to be made by the end of the year."
"I believe, as does the Committee on Fisheries, that it is important for Community fishermen that this agreement be renewed after 31 December of this year when the current prolongation expires."
"The renewal of the protocol is now more important than ever in terms of fishing opportunities, after the failure to reach agreement with Morocco."
"I am not trying to compare the opportunities in Senegal with Morocco, but the fact is that there are other opportunities there."
"We cannot compare them because the protocol with Morocco would have involved EUR 500 million over a four-year period."
"When, therefore, we consider the recently signed agreement with Mauritania, costing EUR 430 million over five years, the Senegal agreement is very modest in financial terms."
"In the light of all these considerations, I can recommend this report to the House."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Gallagher for the speed with which he has worked on his report in order to allow the approval of these two extensions which, as he has pointed out, allow the continuation of fishing activity until the signing of a new protocol with Senegal."
"We must also recognise the sensitivity shown by the rapporteur in not presenting amendments so as not to interfere with the result of the negotiations currently under way, although he indicates that the results of those negotiations will have to be analysed in line with the considerations expressed in his report."
"I almost entirely agree with the considerations, but I would like to expand on the rapporteur' s reference to the lack of utilisation of the agreement by pelagic trawlers."
"The rapporteur refers to the fact that, in the Northern agreements, criticism has been made of the existence of 'paper fish' or 'paper quotas' and that also, in this case, payments should only be made in exchange for real fish."
"I would like to point out that these situations are in no way comparable."
"In this case, fishing opportunities really exist and, being a Southern agreement, any interested Member State could chose to make use of them, just as in other categories of this same agreement entry has been granted to fleets that are not traditionally present in the area, such as those from Italy or Greece."
"If these opportunities are not taken advantage of, it will be because certain States have not been interested, but I doubt that with the non-existence or non-continuation of the agreement with Morocco, these opportunities will not be utilised in the future."
"In the Northern agreements, however, no Member State can fish."
"It is prohibited, even if a State is interested; and you all know that certain fleets are interested in being able to fish within these quotas which are already paid for."
"And we must also remember that, in this particular case, we are not talking about 'paper fish' because, as I have already stated, the fish really exist, unlike the cases of certain Northern agreements, where the state of resources is so poor that real fishing opportunities are not available, and which, by the way, are much more expensive than the agreement with Senegal."
"Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists is pleased that the Commission and the Senegalese Government have reached an agreement to extend the previous fisheries agreement with Senegal for eight months."
"We are grateful to the Government of Senegal for their willingness to allow our fleet to continue fishing until the parties have reached a new agreement."
"Fortunately, this time, the fleet has not been docked as it was five years ago."
"In the interim, the Commission and the Senegalese Government have reached a new fisheries agreement, which will be the subject of another debate."
"The catches the Community fleet can benefit from are the surplus resources which the local fleet cannot fish."
"Fishing relations between Senegal and the European Union are wholly satisfactory to both parties."
"We must not forget that fish products account for 30% of Senegal' s exports and these exports are mainly sent to Europe."
"Furthermore, many of the landings of the Community fleet take place in Senegalese ports."
"It would be wonderful if, in terms of what we are discussing here today (the coherence between the common fisheries policy and development cooperation policy we all want to see), the Commission could help the Senegalese authorities, and other developing countries, to manage their fisheries resources better, especially - as we have already said - in areas where there are young and spawning fish, which are in such need of it."
"I therefore congratulate Mr Gallagher on his wonderful and, above all, rapid report, as well as his excellent work."
"Mr President, thank you, first of all, to Mr Gallagher for a very fine piece of work on the report."
"On behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I should like to begin by adding a few remarks on the financing of the fisheries agreements concluded by the EU with third countries."
"We have proposed that fishermen should make a greater contribution to the financing of these agreements."
"It would be of benefit to themselves, but it would also, at the same time, be in line with current developments in the direction of a structure more in keeping with a market economy."
"It is gratifying that the Commission has begun to prepare evaluation reports on the previous protocol."
"The evaluation of existing agreements is an extremely valuable tool for improving the fisheries agreements. These must, of course, be to the advantage of European fishermen, who do in fact benefit from them, but also be to the advantage of local fishermen in the countries concerned with which the agreements have been made."
"The agreement should relate to the surplus resources that cannot be caught by local fishermen."
"Sustainability must be ensured."
"That is the EU' s responsibility."
"The fisheries agreements are exceedingly important to certain regions of Europe in which, in addition to jobs in the sector itself, there is a range of additional businesses dependent upon fisheries."
"We should focus more upon the degree to which third countries make use of subsidies for the development of local fisheries and ensure that the development aid we provide is used in the best way possible and, especially, to benefit local fishermen."
"These agreements are important to the Community, especially in the light of the fact that the fisheries agreement with Morocco was not renewed."
"Mr President, I would like to join in congratulating our rapporteur, Mr Gallagher, on the sensitivity and speed with which he has produced his report."
"I would also like to take advantage of the presence of the Commissioner to congratulate the Commission on the fact that, in the interim, we have been able to extend this agreement until the end of the year, which has allowed European fleets to continue fishing."
"I would like to take this opportunity to say to Mr Fischler that I am naturally concerned about the repercussions of this agreement for the fleets which, after the failure of the negotiations with Morocco, are in a truly delicate situation."
"All of this has its place within the framework of the debate we have held today on development cooperation and respect for the resources of third countries, certainly, but also in the knowledge that there are fishing opportunities which have not yet been utilised."
"The agreement that has been reached with Mauritania - on which we must also congratulate the Commission, and on which our rapporteur, Mr Gallagher is also working hard - has broken the curse that was stopping us from signing agreements and, therefore, the agreement with Senegal must come to fruition."
"I know that the Commission is working seriously and has meetings arranged for 20 and 23 November."
"I urge it to work as quickly as possible and I also urge this Parliament to deal with it with the urgency it deserves, because it is of great importance in terms of the situation of the European fishing fleet."
"First of all, I would like to thank you, Mr Gallagher, for your report on the extension of the fisheries agreement under discussion until the end of the year."
"I am glad that you agree with the Commission' s proposal."
"This will enable the Community' s fishermen to continue their activity in this region while - as the Senegalese side wanted - a further study of the fisheries sector is prepared."
"The extension of the existing protocol also enables us to pursue negotiations for the multi-annual protocol without undue pressure of time and to bring them to a conclusion."
"As you know, this agreement is a very important agreement for us."
"At EUR 12 million a year, the amount of money involved is considerable, and in purely mathematical terms it means EUR 8 million for the eight months extension."
"Apart from the considerable amount of money, the advantages for Senegal are not least that the agreement secures a major part of the raw materials required by the Senegalese fishing industry because EC vessels have to land part of their catches in Senegalese ports."
"The Commission is unable to accept the present amendment because it is, as you know, a fundamental component of the Community' s external fisheries policy that the costs of fishing rights should be met partly out of the Community budget and partly by the ship owners."
"That is included in all the negotiating guidelines for fisheries agreements."
"The financial compensation payable is specified in the agreements themselves."
"This is paid by the EU, while the ship owners have to pay the licence fees."
"May I conclude by saying that the next round of negotiations for a new agreement or a new protocol is due to take place on 20 to 23 November."
"Thank you, Commissioner Fischler."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 6.30 p.m."
"EEC/Madagascar fisheries agreement"
"The next item on the agenda is the Report (A5-0315/2001) by Mrs Fraga Estevez on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries on the proposal for a Council regulation [COM(2001) 409 - C5-0406/2001 - 2001/0161(CNS)] on the conclusion of a Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Democratic Republic of Madagascar on fishing off Madagascar for the period from 21 May 2001 to 20 May 2004"
"Mr President, I am speaking in order to present, and ask your support for, a new Fisheries protocol, this time with Madagascar - as you have said - with whom we have had relations since 1986."
"From the point of view of what has come to be called cost/benefit, it is an excellent protocol which clearly demonstrates the viability of this type of agreement for the European Union."
"In this case, the Community fleet, industry and market are ensured a stable supply of a raw material, tuna, of which we have a considerable deficit, by means of our own fleet, which means that many Community jobs will be retained, not only in the extractive sector, but also in the activities dependent on it."
"Furthermore, the protocol once again demonstrates that, in the Southern agreements, a high proportion of the fishing opportunities are utilised, in this case reaching 91% for tuna seiners."
"It is just as viable for Madagascar, which in addition to the EUR 308 000 in annual financial compensation, will receive a further EUR 517 000 for development aid actions, mainly aimed at improving the fishing control of the area and the training of its fishermen."
"Furthermore, the number of Malagasy seamen which must be employed rises from 6 in the protocol currently in force to 40 in the protocol under discussion."
"This is therefore a genuinely significant quantitative leap."
"Community fishing activity in itself does not interfere with small-scale fleets, since our fleet does not have access to the twelve mile zone."
"Meanwhile, the presence of the European Union in itself makes a significant contribution to the control and guarantee of greater sustainability of the resource."
"We must not forget that the fleet carries with it all the control regulations of Community policy, which is a very important element in terms of ascertaining the details of catches and the state of the resource in the region, to a degree which cannot be matched by all the other diverse foreign fleets that fish in those same Malagasy waters."
"Following this brief summary of the content of the protocol, and reminding you that, as a Southern agreement, the shipowners contribute to its funding, I would like to focus on two issues."
"I would like to draw your attention firstly to the fact that with this agreement, as in Southern agreements in general, there remains the possibility of granting licences to those interested Member States that would not have access to the fishing opportunities on the basis of relative stability, as demonstrated by the presence of Italy and Portugal."
"It is therefore time to ask the Commission once and for all to implement the views of the 1997 Council of Fisheries Ministers, which clearly request that fishing opportunities which remain unused may be used by interested Member State fleets in all agreements of the European Union."
"Secondly, I do not believe it necessary to point out that we are all committed to the development of third countries, as clearly demonstrated by the Lannoye report, which preceded the debate on fisheries."
"The fisheries sector has been one of the first to cooperate in this development, since its presence in the waters of third countries has been the catalyst for many of the first industrial centres in their coastal regions, if not the definitive element in terms of many nations now having taken on the genuine vocation of a fishing State."
"But, having said that, I believe things are reaching the point where clarification is necessary from several points of view."
"To begin with, we must not forget, as the aforementioned Council of Fisheries Ministers also made clear, that fisheries agreements are essentially of a commercial nature."
"However, they are increasingly becoming a complement to Community development aid policy."
"In the case of this agreement, the proportion intended for development cooperation actions is now rising to 62.6% of the total cost of the agreement to the Community budget."
"This situation raises many questions."
"Firstly, there is no reason why fisheries budgets should be financing the development policy budgets and, from the point of view of budgetary transparency, this state of affairs should be clarified as soon as possible."
"Secondly, this situation should also be clarified in order to silence those voices which complain about the high budgetary cost of the fisheries agreements, when in reality, as we have seen, considerably more than half of that budget is pure development policy."
"Mr President, the fisheries agreements the EU has signed with third countries have always formed a decisive part of its common fisheries policy."
"I want to pay tribute to the excellent work carried out by Mrs Fraga Estéves, the rapporteur. As a Member from Réunion, I am naturally interested in the conclusion of this seventh fisheries agreement between the EU and Madagascar, given its implications for fishing in the Indian Ocean and, obviously, off Réunion too."
"Let me start by pointing out that there is an enormous paradox between the restrictions imposed by the establishment of a European common fisheries policy and the precautionary principle the European Union advocates."
"In fact, at the same time that the Commission was refusing to countenance any increase in the rate of public aid for longliners in Réunion on the grounds that this resource could be at risk in this part of the Indian Ocean, it was also saying that this same resource was abundant enough to allow for an increase in catches under its fisheries agreements with third countries."
"For those of us who come from Réunion, this is rather difficult to understand, as, moreover, I explained, in Réunion, to some of our MEPs in the Committee on Fisheries, pointing out that the fishing resources of this sector are young, specific and over-abundant, with the result that the catch quota criteria imposed by the common fisheries policy are inappropriate."
"The rapporteur refers to the increased fishing opportunities given under the agreement between the EU and Madagascar, which will make it easier for fishermen from Réunion to acquire additional fishing rights in Malagasy territorial waters."
"We would be allowing them to increase their catch quota, which, at present, accounts for only 0.12% of the total EU catch in this zone."
"The fisheries agreements are the EU's main instrument for contributing to the development of the fishing industry in third countries."
"A large part of the total financial contribution is allocated to this under the agreement with Madagascar."
"Since it is quite familiar with the real situation in Madagascar, Réunion is prepared to offer its experience and to take part in co-development projects, based, in particular, on the creation of joint enterprises with Madagascar and the development of aquaculture."
"In fact, some projects of this kind have already been conducted and simply need reinforcing."
"Finally, I do hope the European Union will adopt a strict policy with regard to poaching in the Indian Ocean."
"Madagascar has recently signed bilateral agreements with Japan, Taiwan and Korea, the terms of which are not always entirely clear."
"I therefore feel it is crucial for the European Union to keep a very close watch specifically over the implementation of the special surveillance and monitoring measures aimed at restricting poaching activities in this zone and thus to ensure that the signing of the fisheries agreement with Madagascar is genuinely and indisputably valid."
"Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists supports this proposed regulation on the renewal of the fisheries agreement with Madagascar."
"We also support the excellent report by Mrs Fraga Estevez , and we ask the Council to incorporate the amendments approved by the Committee on Fisheries."
"On many occasions we have complained, always justifiably, about the lack of coherence of the Commission and the Council, which sometimes verges on the arbitrary, in relation to the negotiation and signing of fisheries agreements."
"It is the sector itself which suffers from this lack of direction, and it does not feel that it is supported by the Commission."
"The Commission sometimes gives the impression that it wants to forget the conclusions of the Luxembourg Council of October 1997 on the policy of fisheries agreements with third countries, which explicitly recognised the socio-economic advantages of those agreements for the Community, both in terms of the supply of raw materials and employment, and which are - and will continue to be - an essential element of the common fisheries policy."
"I share the concern mentioned by the rapporteur in her report relating to the fact that more than 62% of the cost of the agreement corresponds to development cooperation actions and has nothing to do with financial compensation for the agreed catches."
"We are in favour of development cooperation and budgetary transparency."
"These actions must therefore be financed by the European Development Fund which, to date, has financed the development of the fishing sectors of the developing countries to the not inconsiderable tune of EUR 421 million."
"This agreement, like all fisheries agreements with third countries, is aimed at a specific form of fishing - in this case, tuna - clearly outside the 6-12 mile zone, and includes absolutely limited and measured annual fishing opportunities for an also limited and measured number of ships - 80."
"The shipowners pay an amount per tonne - EUR 25 - which, as the rapporteur has pointed out, is something that only happens in the Southern agreements."
"The shipowners are obliged, furthermore, to employ a significant number of Malagasy seamen, which is rising from 6 to 40, as has also been pointed out."
"I congratulate Mrs Fraga Estevez once again on her excellent report which clearly demonstrates that, of the fisheries agreements signed by the developing countries with third countries, it is those which they sign with the European Union which achieve and guarantee a greater degree of transparency and control of fishing activities in those areas."
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank Mrs Fraga Estevez for a splendid piece of work in connection with the report."
"Just as I said earlier in connection with Mr Gallagher' s report, those of us in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party are concerned that, in line with developments, we allow the self-funding sector, that is to say the ship owners and fishermen, to pay a larger contribution towards those agreements from which they of course benefit most."
"The fisheries agreement with Madagascar is valuable not only for the Community but also for Madagascar."
"The high degree to which the Community' s fishing opportunities are exploited is impressive and worth emphasising."
"I should like to support Mrs Fraga Estevez in saying that, in the funding of the fisheries agreements, a sharp and clear distinction should be made between the portion used to fund fishing opportunities and the portion used to fund development measures which, in the EU' s budget, should appear as development aid."
"The agreements are exceedingly important to those regions of Europe in which fishing is the most important activity, and we are concerned here not merely with the work of the fishermen but also with associated businesses on land."
"It is the EU' s responsibility to ensure that, when we conclude agreements, it is surplus resources with which we are concerned."
"Matters must be arranged in such a way that local fishermen are provided with development opportunities, and that means that the EU must secure the concept of sustainability."
"This agreement, like the one with Senegal, is important to the Community, partly of course in the light of the fact that the fisheries agreement with Morocco was not renewed."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Fraga Estevez, I thank you for your report on the new protocol under the fisheries agreement with Madagascar, by which we can safeguard the operation of our tuna fleet in these waters up to and including May 2004."
"I am also pleased that you are able to adopt the draft."
"The new Protocol refers exclusively to tuna and offers fishing opportunities for 80 vessels."
"The financial contribution totals EUR 825 000."
"I would like to emphasise that over 60% of this amount is allocated to specific measures and thus benefits the local fisheries sector."
"These resources benefit, above all, monitoring and supervision, but also research and non-industrial fishing."
"Also, this is the first time this Parliament has dealt with an agreement with an ACP state, providing for the satellite-based surveillance of all Community ships operating within the scope of this Agreement."
"As regards Amendments Nos 1 and 3, I draw your attention to the interinstitutional agreements in force and most especially to the 5 July 2000 Framework Agreement between Parliament and the Commission."
"In the context of this Agreement, we are complying with the demands of these amendments, which are therefore not necessary."
"I cannot support Amendment No 2, as negotiations on a protocol to a fisheries agreement do not require their own new mandate."
"What I have already said about Senegal applies correspondingly to Amendment No 4."
"Thank you, Commissioner Fischler."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 6.30 p.m."
"The self-discipline of the speakers who, in contrast to their usual practice, have not wholly exhausted their speaking time, means that we have now closed the debate earlier than originally planned."
"Commissioners, too, Mr Fischler, usually require more time than you, with your characteristically Austrian succinctness, have done today."
"I ask for your understanding that we must now suspend the sitting."
"We cannot bring the vote forward, as it is fixed in the agenda for 6.30 p.m.."
"I shall suspend the sitting until 6.30 p.m. and request you to reassemble punctually."
"(The sitting was suspended at 5.51 p.m. and resumed at 6.30 p.m.)"
"VOTE"
"Mr President, I did not want to draw your attention to this point before the vote, so I waited until after the vote."
"I note that more than 80% of our fellow MEPs evidently had a good reason for not participating in the vote this afternoon."
"So I ask myself whether I actually have a good reason for being here to vote at 6.30 pm this Thursday evening with so few Members present - about one hundred."
"I am starting to wonder whether this is indeed wise."
"Should we not join the vast majority of our colleagues who evidently had a good reason for not being here during the vote?"
"In other words, Mr President, I would like to ask you whether you will discuss with the presidency of the Parliament whether there would be any possibility of either considerably increasing the number of Members present at 6.30 pm on a Thursday evening or finding another solution for this Thursday evening that does not entail a vote."
"Mr President, I would just like to tell Mr Blokland that it is not those who are absent who are in the right, but those who are present, and those who are not here should be ashamed of themselves."
"I take the view that we should be proud of doing our duty."
"We must, though, also be quite clear in our own minds that it is important to reintroduce Friday so that Thursday is made a correspondingly more attractive proposition."
"Explanations of vote"
"Adam Report (A5-0340/2001)"
". The British Labour MEPs have voted in favour of a sheep premium of EUR 25, an increase of 20% on the figure proposed by the Commission."
"Our objective was to pass on to sheep (and goat) farmers an increase in the annual premium but to keep within the expenditure limits set out in Agenda 2000 and keep us on track for CAP reform."
"The incomes of sheep farmers have not kept pace with other types of farming."
"This decision will help to correct the imbalance."
"Because the payment will be annual and known in advance, it will help farmers in their business planning."
"We particularly emphasise the importance we place on increased marketing support to encourage consumption and we look to the Commission to act with urgency."
"- (FR) It seems to us that the Adams report on the proposed reform in the sheepmeat and goatmeat production sector does not take account of the basic problems facing small-scale farmers, who have the lowest incomes in Europe."
"We would be happy to present the point of view of the Confédération paysanne, the French farm workers' confederation, which is protesting at the fact that the income of French sheep farmers is 45% lower than the average farm income and believes that 'at European level, the COM (common organisation of the market) in sheepmeat has not fulfilled its role, which was to guarantee the producers an income,' and that the proposed reform 'shows no signs of any political ambition to give new impetus to the sheepmeat sector.'"
"Allocating flat-rate aid per head of sheep and goats instead of the present system of compensatory payments is harmful to small-scale stockbreeders and in no way improves their incomes."
"That is why we abstained in the vote on this report."
"We are critical of Mr Adam' s report on the common organisation of the market in sheep meat and goat meat."
"In our view, the amendments tabled generally represent an antiquated agricultural policy which does not correspond to the conditions and needs of modern, global society."
"Against that background and with an eye to the impending general review of the EU' s agricultural policy, we have chosen to vote against the report in its entirety."
"Lannoye Report (A5-0334/2001)"
"(PT) The European Union must use its development cooperation policy to strengthen the objectives designed for cooperation with developing countries in the fisheries sector by means of more programmes, technical resources and budgets under the various frameworks for priority action. This will enable us to help the economic and social development of these countries, specifically in the fields of rural development, transport, health, education and the fight against poverty."
"The European Union must promote scientific research into resources and could support the implementation of an effective programme for monitoring the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of developing countries."
"That concludes the vote."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare this session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"(The sitting was closed at 6.47 p.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 25 October 2001."
"Announcement by the President"
"Ladies and gentlemen, since our last session, Spain has once again, unfortunately, been cruelly struck by terrorism."
"On 7 November, José María Lidón Corbi, a judge and professor of law in the Basque region, was murdered in a cowardly attack whilst leaving his home in Getxo."
"The previous day in Madrid, terrorists set off a car bomb, in which a hundred or so people were injured."
"On my own behalf, and on that of the European Parliament, I immediately sent my deepest condolences to the victim' s family and our best wishes for a speedy recovery to everyone who was injured in this attack."
"Yet again, ETA terrorists have shown that they deny the right to life, that they reject the very principle of the rule of law."
"By attacking a judge this time, the terrorists are demonstrating this once more."
"Yesterday, Algeria was struck by catastrophic weather conditions, which so far have claimed 538 lives and left 316 injured."
"I immediately expressed our deep sorrow to the Algerian people for the disaster that has struck Algiers, and our total solidarity for the human tragedy that the country is suffering."
"I also asked President Bouteflika to pass on a message on our behalf to express our deepest sympathy to the victims' families and loved-ones."
"I hope very much that the European Union will play an active part in supplying emergency aid, which must be sent as soon as possible."
"Yesterday, three journalists were killed in an ambush by the Taliban in Afghanistan."
"Johanne Sutton, Pierre Billaud and Volker Handloik died whilst carrying out their profession, which was also their passion."
"It was because of their courage that each of us was able to keep abreast of the events in Afghanistan."
"I would like to pay homage to them and to express our deepest sympathy for their families and colleagues."
"This afternoon, less than an hour ago, an American aircraft crashed not far from JFK airport in the Queens area of New York."
"There were more than 260 passengers and crew members on board."
"For the time being, we do not know the exact number of casualties or the precise circumstances surrounding this tragedy."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to ask you to observe a minute' s silence to pay homage to all the victims."
"(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank Mr Zimeray who travelled to Vientiane as soon as we had the opportunity to contact him, which was 10 days after we were imprisoned."
"He immediately offered to act in our defence, and informed us of the diplomatic steps that you had promptly taken."
"He also told us what many of our fellow Members had done to help us, particularly Mr Brok and our colleagues and friends in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, and many other Members as well."
"Madam President, I would like to give my sincere thanks to you and all the Members, such as Ignacio Salafranca, Jules Maaten and many others."
"I think that we should pursue this initiative and I see that this issue is also on the agenda of this session."
"The situation in Laos is tragic."
"I would like to reiterate to all my fellow Members that we were in Laos to fight the cause of five lost prisoners, known as the desaparecidos, but there are hundreds of other prisoners and the prison conditions in Laos are terrible."
"These people do not even have the right to a fair trial, they are passing their final days in oblivion without even being able to see their family."
"Unfortunately, this situation is nothing out of the ordinary."
"Corruption is endemic in Laos."
"I hope that we will have the opportunity to work together in order to change this situation as quickly as possible."
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of Thursday 25 October have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Madam President, immediately following the vote on the 2002 Budget I asked how exactly Budget line B3-306 had been voted on."
"My group's co-ordinator and I wrote you a letter asking for the vote to be re-scrutinised."
"We have as yet received no reply."
"I therefore wish to lodge an objection to the Minutes on this point in order to get the matter properly clarified."
"The background to this is that we had voted on a reserve - the amounts involved and the explanations of them."
"It was intended that we would vote on them together, with a separate vote only on one short passage in the explanations. Then, though, there were suddenly separate votes on the amounts and the explanations."
"That was not how it had been intended."
"I therefore ask that this be looked into, and wish to put on record my reservations about the Minutes."
"Mr Ferber, we shall take note of this."
"If I am not mistaken, during voting time on Thursday 25 October, my vote by roll call on the second part of Amendment No 559 on the budget, and more specifically on premiums for tobacco, has been incorrectly recorded."
"I voted against the second part, against the commentary, and I am shown in the register as having voted in favour."
"I sent you a note and I received confirmation from Parliament' s services that this will be corrected."
"As far as I know, this has not yet been done."
"I hope that this will be corrected, but I wanted to mention this to the House as well."
"Certainly, Mr Korakas."
"Thank you."
"(The Minutes of the previous sitting were approved)"
"Order of business"
"Madam President, my report on passenger transport by rail, road and inland waterway has been placed on Tuesday' s agenda under item No 16."
"In recent months, different groups have continuously called for either bringing the discussion forward or postponing it."
"Last week, I was informed that three of the groups, PSE, PPE-DE and the Verts/ALE, were in favour of postponing the discussion."
"I then agreed to this on the assumption that the other groups needed more time for a fully-fledged discussion."
"When on Thursday evening, much to my surprise, I heard that the Conference of Presidents had decided to go ahead with the discussion after all, I informed all Members that I was still prepared to postpone the debate."
"It since transpired on Thursday afternoon that the PPE-DE Group had not been in favour of postponement and that it is no longer an issue for the PSE Group either."
"Furthermore, the agendas of the two remaining plenary part-sessions of this year are already full."
"Now that I have found this out, I am withdrawing my offer which I made in writing and circulated and I assume that the debate will go ahead tomorrow."
"Of course!"
"Regarding Wednesday President."
"I have received a request from the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party to postpone Mr Fiori' s report until the Brussels session of 28 and 29 November."
"Is there a Member who wishes to move this request?"
"Madam President, Parliament must be an open forum whose business people are able to follow."
"That is something Parliament will not be if we debate the Fiori report this week, because it is only today that it has become available in ten languages."
"I do not know what the situation is regarding the eleventh language, Danish."
"According to our original timetable, to which the Conference of Presidents had agreed, it was to be debated during the November II part-session."
"Nor do we think there is any reason for debating it before the Caudron report."
"I would therefore ask, on behalf of the Liberal Group, that we move it to the November II part-session."
"I believe it is only right that you should check up on how the groups vote."
"On this point, as on many others, the groups are extremely divided. The main thing, however, is that the world outside should be able to follow what is happening."
"We MEPs should also be able to form views on the extremely difficult issues discussed in this report."
"Mrs Thors, I can give you an explanation which may not have been brought to Members' attention."
"The Conference of Presidents decided to put the debate on the Fiori report on the agenda at the same time as the debate on Mr Caudron' s report."
"With regard to the vote, it was decided that if there was insufficient time, Mr Fiori' s report could be put to the vote at the second November session in Brussels."
"I am simply giving you this information so that you are aware."
"If the report is kept on the agenda, I will see whether or not we have sufficient time to take the vote."
"We have just heard the speaker who moved the request."
"Is there a Member who wishes to speak in favour of the request?"
"Madam President, I would like to speak in favour of this request because, although, admittedly, only a small majority in the Conference of Presidents decided on Thursday to submit these two reports to a joint debate, it is certainly not straightforward for Parliament to allow the administrative services to take a decision that is political in nature."
"In other words, this is a difficult requirement to meet."
"We must not rush the vote on the Fiori report nor must we rush the debate."
"However, if we set a deadline for tabling amendments for 9 p.m. on Tuesday and expect the administrative services to work like Trojans so that the Rules of Procedure are observed and Members have the documents 24 hours before the vote, we would be racing against time and this would not do credit to the Fiori report or to Parliament."
"That is why we must support - and this is something that I support, along with my fellow Members from the radical group - the joint proposal to postpone the debate, so that we do not have to deal with this in a hurry."
"Madam President, taking the language question first, I am informed that everything is in order so far and available in all languages."
"I will now turn to the esteemed Mr Dell'Alba's comments and start by agreeing with him that this is a political issue, but then coming to a quite different conclusion."
"This is not only a political issue but also an ethical one, and of the greatest significance for the Fiori report."
"It had always been our opinion that the Fiori report should be considered together with both the Caudron reports."
"As we have just decided, Madam President, to begin the debate with the Commission and the Council at three o'clock on Wednesday afternoon, there will be sufficient time in the morning to debate the Fiori report and the two Caudron reports."
"If that were not the case, then we too would have doubts about proceeding with everything on the agenda as it stands."
"Now, though, that the debate with the Council and the Commission on the international situation is to take place on Wednesday afternoon, we take the view that the Caudron and Fiori reports belong together."
"It is, though, an ethical and a political issue requiring an answer now, and so we would be very grateful if it could remain on the agenda."
"So, we have heard the speaker who moved the request, one speaker in favour and one speaker against the request."
"Mr Barón Crespo, do you wish to take the floor again?"
"Madam President, I would like to point out that I have the right to speak, for my esteemed fellow Member Mr Poettering did not only talk about the Fiori report: he spoke about the whole of Wednesday' s agenda, and as proposer, I feel that I have the right to speak, because it was my group that put forward the proposal to once again include in the agenda for Wednesday morning the oral questions that were initially put to the Council on a subject that is so important, especially if we consider the free time that we - according to what we are led to believe - have available."
"I would like to take the opportunity, Madam President, to protest strongly and ask that you, yourself, do the same before the Council, for the representative of the Council, in the Conference of Presidents, gave a piece of information which I understand to be inaccurate, if not completely untrue, in relation to Council meetings."
"Justice and Home Affairs Council is going to meet, as expected, on Friday, yet the representative of the Council at the Conference of Presidents said that the meeting would be taking place on 7 December."
"This information is misleading, particularly at a time when Parliament is making a substantial effort to proceed with the emergency procedure on anti-terrorist legislation, and I think it was a serious mistake, because it has led to confusion that has had a negative effect on everyone concerned."
"Firstly, in relation to this apparently empty Wednesday morning agenda, according to Mr Poettering."
"Secondly, Madam President, I think it is a major political mistake to subordinate a legislative report such as the Caudron report to a question that will have ethical repercussions for all - not only for one particular political group - for we need to be working on that which is relevant to us all: the draft legislation."
"Furthermore, as anticipated, we can remain perfectly calm and still have the time needed to deal with matters as serious as those set out in the Fiori report without necessarily having to resort to the emergency procedure."
"We therefore agree that the matter should be debated in the November II part-session, as had initially been planned."
"Mr Barón Crespo, everything is, in fact, perfectly in order, since there were two speakers to move this request."
"Therefore, we were permitted to hear two speakers who are in favour and, in order to be fair, I shall now give the floor to Mr Lannoye, who I believe is going to speak against."
"Madam President, unlike Mr Barón Crespo, I think that the debate on the Fiori report depends on the Caudron report. I shall explain why."
"We set up a temporary committee to deal with the subject of human genetics."
"Why did we do this? Because there are considerable ethical problems and I believe that everyone is aware of what they are."
"In my view, we cannot express a sound opinion on research programmes lasting several years, whose ethical aspects are fundamental, and then suddenly vote on the Fiori report which could lose a significant amount of its political impact."
"I therefore believe that, in order to make the work of Parliament more coherent, it would be better to take the vote on the Fiori report at the same time as the Caudron report."
"That said, I also agree that if the physical conditions are not appropriate, it is better to postpone the vote than to proceed under the wrong circumstances."
"I think that we must respect Members."
"I shall therefore put to the vote the request by the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party to postpone the Fiori report."
"(Parliament gave its assent)"
"I have received a request from the Group of the Party of European Socialists to bring forward to this week the debate on criminal sanctions and Community law, which is currently scheduled for Wednesday 28 November."
"Justice and Home Affairs. Madam President, on behalf of the committee I have the honour to chair, I would ask that this topic be reinserted on this week's agenda, since, contrary to the advice given to the Conference of Presidents last week, the Justice and Home Affairs Council will be discussing it at its meeting this Friday."
"This evening the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs will adopt a text, drafted in cooperation with the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, which we believe is a strong basis for a Parliament resolution on this matter."
"If it is not possible to have a debate in plenary with the Council, we request authorisation to submit this text to the plenary in the form of a draft recommendation for a vote on Thursday, pursuant to Article 39 of the Treaty and Rule 94 of our Rules of Procedure."
"Madam President, after listening to the explanation given by Mr Watson, whom I would like to wish a long presidency of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, for he does this job so well, my group withdraws its proposal and adopts the one tabled by Mr Watson."
"Are there any objections to Mr Watson' s proposal?"
"(Parliament gave its assent)"
"Regarding Thursday"
"President."
"I suggest that, in view of the busy voting schedule at midday, the start of voting time be brought forward by half an hour, in other words, that we begin voting at 11.30 a.m."
"Even without the vote on the report by Mr Fiori, I think that this is necessary."
"With regard to the topical and urgent subjects of major importance, I have received a request from the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left to add a fourth sub-item entitled 'Floods in Algeria' ."
"I suggest that we add this item to item three, 'Effects of hurricane Michelle in Nicaragua and Cuba' , and we call this item 'Natural disasters' ."
"Madam President, if it is at all possible, I would like to add an oral amendment: 'on the effects of hurricane Michelle on Nicaragua, Cuba and Honduras' , which is where it has caused the most damage."
"Madam President, according to the British press today six Algerian nationals were arrested over the weekend by the French security services."
"They are allegedly associated with the terrorist group al-Qa'ida and with the five people arrested last year found in possession of maps which marked out the Parliament buildings in Strasbourg and the Cathedral."
"Given the proximity both in place and time to our current part-session, what information does the President have on their hostile intentions towards Parliament?"
"Given the current climate of suspicion, with another crash in New York of an airliner this evening, what additional security measures will be taken to protect us?"
"I, for instance, was allowed into Parliament this evening without even showing my security pass."
"What measures can be taken to protect us, given this danger?"
"Mr Tannock, as you can imagine, I carried out a very thorough investigation into the report you mentioned."
"I was told that the plans the terrorists had in their possession related only to Strasbourg cathedral and the Christmas market."
"But, of course, this information gives us reason to be even more careful, and I shall now give the floor to Mr Balfe, who will give you more details on what has been done to step up security."
"Madam President, I have no more information than you on this series of arrests."
"No-one has informed me about it but I am sure that will happen in the course of the evening and I will then tell Mr Tannock."
"I should like to point out, though, that whilst we welcome the new security on the periphery, this building has to operate in the interests of Members."
"I hope that the Bureau will reconsider the question of security and try to fine-tune it somewhat, because far too many Members are having their visitors and other groups seriously inconvenienced by the way the rules are being applied."
"They can be applied a little more subtly."
"I hope we can do that."
"As regards Mr Tannock's question, I will find out what I can and inform him and the House."
"In any case, I believe Mr Tannock welcomes the security measures that the Bureau thought it was necessary to take."
"I can inform you that many Members submitted this question. We cannot be too careful at the moment, which is, admittedly, an extremely testing time."
"Madam President, I would like to briefly draw attention to the case of one of our colleagues in Israel, Mr Bichara, whose parliamentary immunity has recently been waived by the Knesset, a step that was taken because Mr Bichara expressed his political views in public."
"I think that this step goes completely against the concept of parliamentary immunity, as this is never used by a country to punish MPs for expressing political views."
"I believe that Mr Bichara has an extremely important role to play in relations between the Israeli and Palestinian people and in bringing about a fair solution to this conflict."
"I also think that it is important that you bring up this matter with the Israeli authorities and express Parliament' s concern at this step which infringes freedoms and breaches the treaty signed by Israel and the European Union."
"We shall look into this matter very carefully."
"Thank you, Madam President, for your words of solidarity for Algeria at the beginning of the sitting."
"It is said that you find out who your true friends are in times of need and I believe, in fact, that now is the time to show our alliance with the Algerian people by providing substantial emergency aid of various kinds to help them contend with the extensive damage caused by the torrential rain that has struck Algiers and northern Algeria."
"A natural disaster of this kind is always a huge blow for any population, particularly the most deprived, but, in this case, Algeria is also a country that has already suffered so much due to Islamic terrorism, economic and political crises, which continue to dash everyone' s hopes."
"My group is, therefore, calling on the European Union to make the necessary resources available to help those affected by the disaster and, secondly, we believe that we must draw lessons, and not only in conjunction with the authorities and Parliament, but also with the relevant representatives of civil society in Algeria, from this tragedy and define priorities for our future cooperation."
"If I may, Madam President, I would like to briefly give some information about another subject, since the request to add this item to the topical and urgent debate was rejected, that of the case of Leïla Zana."
"The Bureau of my group recently held a meeting in Ankara."
"We requested the opportunity to meet the Sakharov Prize winner, of course, but we were refused outright, and what we find particularly disappointing, especially since this concerns the Sakharov Prize, is that we were unable, at a time when we are combating terrorism, to meet Leïla Zana."
"I think that it was only fair that my fellow Members are given this information and I also hope that the Commission is aware of this information since the Commission is currently drafting a progress report on relations between Turkey and the European Union."
"Madam President, while Mr Dupuis was held in Laos last week, a large number of your colleagues, including myself, were detained in Brussels airport for eight hours, from 3 p.m. to 11 p.m., because the government of Belgium would not ensure the free movement of European citizens around Europe, including that of MEPs."
"We could not get out of Brussels at all; we had to go back, and in the end departed from Charleroi the next day."
"It took me 23 hours to get home."
"Could you make representations to the Belgian Government, and to other governments, for that matter, to the effect that all European citizens, not just MEPs, should be entitled to free movement in Europe and that unjustified and illegal blockades of airports should be dealt with by the authorities in the proper manner?"
"Of course, Mr Purvis, I will certainly do this."
"Madam President, I would like to inform you that in July this year, in accordance with Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union, I tabled a question to the Council of Ministers with regard to the Sahara referendum and also to some statements made by Mr Solana, the European Union' s representative for Foreign Policy."
"A few weeks ago some EU Member States in the United Nations debated the common EU position on the Sahara."
"Curiously, France distanced herself from the Belgian presidency' s proposal and demanded that the line be adopted as set out in the response that the Council of the European Union gave me personally on 10 October."
"To date, I have received no such response."
"There was even talk of a diplomatic incident, of a crisis between Spain and France, and between Spain and Morocco."
"I would like to say two things for the record: firstly, it has never been my intention to create a diplomatic incident between Spain and France, nor between Spain and Morocco."
"And secondly, I would like to express my concern at the lack of transparency shown by the Council to this Parliament, for I have had no official answer to my question."
"Madam President, you will know that the City of Strasbourg is twinned with the City of Leicester, my home city."
"The Lord Mayor of Leicester, Councillor John Allen and the Lady Mayoress, Mrs Allan, are in the public gallery."
"This twinning is an important political and social union and I very much hope you will welcome the Lord Mayor and the Lady Mayoress here in Strasbourg."
"Madam President, I rise to draw your attention to a report broadcast by the BBC last week, about child trafficking between European Union countries and West Africa."
"This was a most disturbing report and I will send it to your services."
"On behalf of colleagues in this House who I know are very concerned about these issues, I ask that you raise this subject with the Commission and the Member States and ask whether action can be taken across the European Union to stamp out this appalling abuse of young people from a very deprived part of the world."
"Madam President, I should like once again to condemn the barbaric bombings which have been killing civilians and even destroying hospitals for days, or rather weeks now."
"Bombings which, unfortunately, have the support of our countries' governments."
"Statements by the US leadership that the objective of the attack is not Bin Laden but to break up Al-Qaeda, even though no one knows where it is, and that it is now the turn of other countries are particularly worrying and reveal the real purpose of the USA, proving that the attack on 11 September is merely being used as a pretext for pushing ahead with previous plans to gain control of this extremely important area and use up stocks of weapons."
"On the other hand, grass-root reaction is increasing both here and in the USA, with the people calling for this barbaric attack to stop at once and for our countries and governments to call off their plan to send troops to Afghanistan."
"The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece support these movements, heart and soul, and trust that they will become even stronger and put a stop to the crime which is being committed."
"Mr President, I would like to intervene to say that the television system here still does not receive images or sound from Finland."
"Since the beginning of September, we have intervened in this matter on four separate occasions: first orally, then by e-mail, following which all the Finnish Members signed and dispatched a letter to the Quaestors on 2 October; finally, I raised the matter once again during the first session in October."
"None of these requests has obtained any response whatsoever."
"We may as well be talking to Siberia."
"Finland is, technologically, at the top of the league; and we are ashamed of such behaviour."
"I am asking you to intervene promptly in this matter, since so much is going on in the world that this sole Member State which is left outside the information loop needs to be included without delay."
"I must say that I, myself, am very surprised."
"I certainly recall what the Finnish Members said on this subject and I thought that the problem had been resolved long ago."
"In any case, you can rely on me to remind the Quaestors of this, although I cannot see any of the Quaestors in the Chamber at the moment, because I believe that this is a very important issue and that we really must ensure that this is working as soon as possible."
"Madam President, as has already been mentioned, this week is certainly not a normal plenary part-session."
"For two months, this thing we call war has been in progress, a terrible war against terrorism."
"This very morning, Italy' s military involvement and its support for the United States have taken on a practical form, for indeed, today, Italian troops are leaving to go and help the United States and all the European Union troops which are actively, practically engaged in the war against this barbaric civilisation."
"Well then, in the light of this development, to which we must certainly not become used or accustomed, the debate on the agenda, a Commission communication scheduled for Wednesday, seems decidedly inadequate."
"Madam President, I expected something more! I do not know what is happening to the Members, but when I go home I am surrounded by European citizens, my fellow citizens, all asking me the same thing: ""What is your view of these events down at the European Parliament?"
"What can you say to reassure us and allay our concerns?"""
"Well then, I am frankly disappointed by the presence, with all due respect to her, of the Belgian Deputy Prime Minister, Mrs Durant, whose remit is transport, not war, and though she will, I am sure, have a dramatic speech from the Presidency to read out to us."
"I feel that it is almost an affront to Parliament that the Belgian Prime Minister is not going to be here at this important time."
"Moreover, I would ask you, Madam President, to see whether it would be possible for Mr Solana to be present here too, for he is our foreign policy representative and it is his duty, or rather his obligation, to provide us with clear, practical, specific information."
"We cannot be content with just another declaration of good intentions or the assumption of a political position."
"We are at war, but some people appear not yet to have understood the full implications of that fact or the importance of the present time."
"To give practical effect to this speech, then, I call upon Mr Solana to come to Parliament and tell us clearly what is happening in Afghanistan so that we know not just the details of the military operations but also the extent of our combined endeavours in the field of humanitarian aid to help the communities affected."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we were extremely worried to hear that the government of the United Kingdom is pushing through an emergency bill allowing terrorist suspects to be held indefinitely."
"We also hear that it intends to withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights, which bans detention without trial."
"This development, coupled with the recent anti-terrorist law passed by the US Congress, which also grants extensive detention rights, and plans for the European Union (arrest warrant, definition of terrorism, reinforced police collaboration) is a highly dangerous development."
"Unfortunately, it confirms our reading that the appalling attack on 11 September is being used by the imperialist powers not just to settle international accounts but also to defeat the enemy within, by eroding individual and collective rights."
"However, it is encouraging that the American Civil Liberties Union and numerous American, British and other human rights organisations have condemned this action outright."
"In fact, only grass-roots reaction, only a united grass-roots movement can bring about the repeal of such laws and prevent them from spreading throughout the continent of Europe."
"Madam President, on a point of order."
"It would be a pity if no Member from the United Kingdom were to stand up and say to Mr Alyssandrakis that we are also deeply concerned at this proposal and we hope it will not go through unchallenged."
"Madam President, since you have announced that the votes will start at 11.30 a.m. on Thursday, could you tell me what will happen to my report on the European Year of People with Disabilities?"
"It would be very wrong if a report dealing with disabled people's rights were put back to Thursday afternoon when most of the Members are not here and most of the Members will not be here to vote."
"We are very remiss about disabled people's rights in this Parliament in terms of access."
"It would demonstrate a great lack of awareness of the problems that disabled people face if we do not give them some degree of respect by scheduling this debate at a time when Members will be present to debate and vote on this important issue."
"Mrs Lynne, of course I understand what you are saying, but in any case, and you are well aware of this, it is not because we are bringing voting time forward by half an hour that your report cannot be dealt with in the morning."
"If you look at the agenda, which I have before me now, you will see that before your report, we are due to have a statement by the Council and the Commission on the economic and employment situation, and deal with the Figueiredo report and the Bouwman report."
"It is obvious that, with all these items on the agenda, we would not, in any case, have been able to finish dealing with your report between 10 a.m. and 12 noon."
"I am extremely sorry about this, but I think that you are quite right to highlight the problem."
"Public access to Parliament documents"
"The next item is the report (A5-0349/2001) by Mrs Maij-Weggen, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the adaptation of the European Parliament' s Rules of Procedure to the Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council regarding public access to documents of the European Parliament, Council and Commission (2001/2135(REG))."
". (NL) Madam President, this week marks the provisional end of the discussion on the 'public access to Parliament documents' Regulation."
"Technically, this Regulation is entitled 'access to documents' , but it ended up with a different name in the vernacular."
"In May, after months of negotiations with the Council and Commission, we were able to bring the Regulation to a successful end."
"This was an important moment for me personally, because I have fought for more transparency in the European Union for years."
"According to the Resolution, each of the institutions, namely the Commission, the Council and Parliament, must ensure that the Regulation has been incorporated in the institutions' own rules of procedure, work instructions and meeting procedures by 3 December."
"For our Parliament, this meant that we needed to check out our Rules of Procedure to establish whether more improvements were needed."
"We often feel that the Commission and the Council fail to come up to the mark in this area, but we have noted that there is room for improvement in one or two areas in our Rules of Procedures too."
"When I use the word 'we' , I would like to make it clear that I also want to include my fellow rapporteur, Mr Cashman, with whom I have worked closely. The assessment was made in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, but also in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs."
"That is logical because both committees had worked together before."
"I thank Mr Cashman very much for the constructive manner in which we have always managed to enter into consultation."
"So what are the proposed changes to our Rules of Procedure for which we are asking your backing?"
"First of all, what matters is the right of all citizens in the European Union, in other words, including those of third countries, to access EP documents."
"That right may have been in place for European citizens, but this was not the case for citizens from third countries registered in the EU."
"On that score, therefore, we need to broaden the scope."
"Moreover, this corresponds to the 'Freedom of Information Act' of the United States."
"We are therefore not doing anything out of the ordinary."
"Secondly, the definition of documents which are eligible for access must, according to the Regulation, be widened compared to the current Rules of Procedure."
"It should include all parliamentary documents, including the preparatory documents, such as working documents by rapporteurs or by parliamentary delegations."
"There is no need to include MEPs' personal correspondence or the groups' internal documents, because these are not official parliamentary documents."
"The European Court of Justice has made statements to this effect, which we should, and want to, observe, of course."
"The third requirement in the Regulation for which our Rules of Procedure do not provide, is the requirement to register all public documents and to include all documents by name and number in this registration."
"Furthermore, this registration must be available and accessible on the Internet."
"That will require the necessary efforts to be made and that is why the institutions have until June to achieve this."
"We must wish our team and the deputy Secretary-General all the best for this task, for it is quite a job to organise the whole system."
"We will have a look in June to see whether everything has turned out well."
"A fourth requirement for which our present Parliament does not provide, is access to the Minutes of the Parliament' s Bureau."
"That cannot be such a big problem because these Minutes become public after a certain time anyway."
"The only difference is that our Rules of Procedure did not make it compulsory before, and now this obligation has to be stipulated in the Rules of Procedure."
"In fact, my advice would be to publish those Minutes even earlier than is now the case."
"After all, our entire Parliament knows what is being discussed the afternoon after the meeting anyway."
"Fifthly, we still maintain the system of closed meetings in our Parliament when delicate matters are discussed."
"Our proposal is to leave those meetings in camera, but to verify the Minutes against Articles 4 and 9 of the Regulation."
"Anything which does not fall within this must be made public via the Minutes."
"I hope that this could persuade the committees not to have the meetings declared closed unnecessarily."
"The final point concerns the conciliation between the Commission, the Council and Parliament in the event of disputes."
"Parliament must be involved in the conciliation, and it appears to us to be the best solution if a Vice-President of the European Parliament were to be appointed especially for this purpose."
"We would also like to see this laid down in the Rules of Procedure so that it is clear who is responsible."
"This concludes the most important changes to our Rules of Procedure."
"At the final vote, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs backed these amendments by a large majority."
"There are not that many and I therefore believe that we can bring this to a good conclusion here as well."
"Four additional amendments have been tabled, including one by my group and three by the Greens."
"I do not have much of a problem with that of my group, but we should take another good look at those by the Greens, for it makes no sense to go beyond what is stipulated in the Regulation."
"As we should have dealt with this when we were discussing the Regulation, I am tempted to say no to these amendments."
"On a final note, this Regulation and change to our Rules of Procedure are very important because they grant our citizens more access to internal documents of our Parliament and of the entire European Union, which improves transparency."
"Public confidence, which is very much needed, will also increase as a result."
"I welcome this and that is why I hope that we can approve these Rules of Procedure on Tuesday."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Mrs Maij-Weggen for her comments."
"I have heartily enjoyed the way we have worked together on this and I am pleased to say that the work in her report represents our joint work."
"I also accept what she has said on the amendments."
"Before I speak further, I should like the services to rule whether Amendment No 17 from the Green Group is admissible, because it seeks to rewrite the regulation."
"It calls on Parliament to adopt criteria for the definition of sensitive information and documents."
"Now the definition of sensitive documents is contained in the regulation, Article 9, reference to Article 4(1)(a)."
"I should again like to thank Mrs Maij-Weggen for her consistent approach to transparency and openness."
"It is absolutely right that we adopt changes to our Rules of Procedure so that we not only conform to the regulation on access to documents but can also begin to be held accountable by the citizens whom we purport to represent."
"Therefore, now that Commissioner Barnier is here, it is important for me to refer to some of my concerns about the entry into force of this regulation on 3 December 2001."
"When the regulation enters into force, the citizen's right of access to institution documents will no longer be a discretionary concession but a fundamental right, rooted in Article 255."
"As no other legal basis on access to documents is provided in the Treaty, the regulation on Article 255 will be the framework for all other secondary legislation and for the internal rules of the institutions, which should be in conformity with it."
"The Commission, therefore, has the responsibility to present formal proposals to repeal or amend secondary legislation which is not coherent with the principles and limits defined in Article 18(3) of the regulation."
"This is extremely important if we are to bring this regulation into force."
"Similarly, on the wider definition of institutions and the bodies and agencies, the Commission is mandated by Recital 8 and by the joint statement to review the rules of agencies and, where necessary to propose amendments as soon as possible."
"On the matter of the Interinstitutional Committee - and all of these points are relevant if we are ourselves adopting changes to the Rules of Procedure - the Council presidency has said that it believes the Interinstitutional Committee should operate at secretary-general level."
"This differs from the opinion of President Prodi and of Parliament."
"Though I hesitate to say this, it is nonsense to suggest that secretaries-general should sit in this Interinstitutional Committee."
"The whole point of political presence is political accountability."
"Finally, Mrs Maij-Weggen has done an excellent job on this and now is the time for the Commission to ensure that the Treaty is respected and that the regulations flowing therefrom are brought before Parliament."
"Mr President, the report we are debating this afternoon in Parliament is important, because it relates to something we have always defended in this House: the principle of transparency, which means citizens' right to access documents and also the principles of openness and proximity to these very citizens."
"For this reason, we are debating Article 255 of the Treaty as reformulated in Amsterdam, and also an important article of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, Article 42."
"After the agreement reached by the Council and Parliament, we need to incorporate the principles promoted by the aforementioned Articles of the Treaty and the Charter of Fundamental Rights respectively into the Rules of Procedure of this House."
"I would like to congratulate Mrs Maij-Weggen most sincerely on her excellent work; her report, in addition to the amendments she tabled, was adopted in committee with 25 votes in favour to one against."
"I would also like to congratulate Mr Cashman."
"I think that a good relationship was maintained between all those involved, and I also believe that all of the proposals tabled by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs have been taken into consideration by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"Therefore, Mr President, in the vote that is going to take place tomorrow we shall be transposing a political principle of fundamental importance and incorporating it into our Rules of Procedure."
"In doing so, we will be including a fundamental principle in the interests of the aforementioned transparency and openness into the set of rules that regulates our relations."
"Mr President, my group is going to support an amendment it has itself tabled, not by pure chance, but because it is a good amendment."
"Furthermore, we will support Mrs Maij-Weggen' s proposals."
"I trust that the result of the vote will be sufficient, that is to say, more than 314 votes, for these proposals to be incorporated into the Rules of Procedure of this House."
"On behalf of the European People' s Party, I would like to once again congratulate the two rapporteurs for the great work they have done."
"Mr President, what is transparency?"
"Transparency is guaranteed, or so one might and should argue, when as many of the European institutions' documents as possible are made accessible to all citizens of the EU with an interest in them and also when meetings of the Council are guaranteed to be open to the public."
"It is to this banal sentence that we can reduce the foundation document of the European Transparency Initiative, called into being by a very wide range of parliamentarians and people in public life across Europe and only now beginning to become effective on the basis of Regulation 1049/2001 and the adjustments which we in this Parliament are now making to it."
"There are still different conceptions of what we want transparency to be like."
"I, myself, want the European transparency formula to be an American-Swedish hybrid, with unlimited access to almost everything, with not even a registry, and with a real possibility of watching over and permanently examining what we do in Parliament, and especially what is done in the Council, where the really important decisions are taken."
"This Parliament does not yet, unfortunately, have the majority required for this."
"It can be argued that the European public, in all its diversity, is far from ready."
"There is also room for the argument that, if an Italian or Austrian citizen writes to one of the EU institutions, and his letter is promptly recorded in a public registry, he would certainly not have reckoned with that and might react differently from a Swede, who would treat it as a matter of course."
"I think we must, in any case, carry on along this road, especially now that events around the world make the definition of European values an issue. Transparency is definitely one of them."
"What we now have in front of us is a step in this direction."
"Mention has already been made of the deliberations in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"I would like the Greens to come up with a substantially clearer explanation of Amendment No 15 than has been produced to date."
"I would personally have no problem whatever with the production of necessary documents in the context of budgetary control, or indeed with what is demanded at the end."
"But if it only scores an own goal, it would be better to leave it out."
"Mr Cashman has already said all that needs to be said about Amendment No 17."
"Amendment No 14 meets with our group's undivided approval."
"It represents an improvement."
"Even the deletion of the restriction to 'permanent' committees in the first part of Amendment No 15 is only to be welcomed."
"We must all be aware that there can be no democracy without transparency."
"We still have plenty of work to do before that is achieved."
"Mr President, as has been pointed out, this report is, of course, a consequence of the quite arduous work done on the report on Article 255 of the EC Treaty, which concerns public access to documents and on which we voted on 3 May."
"Thanks to the extremely strong alliance for transparency which existed, and still exists, in Parliament and in which Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mr Cashman have played a significant role, we finally succeeded in getting the Council and the Commission to endorse a proposal reflecting this House' s desire for as much transparency as possible."
"The legislation we adopted is deficient and unclear in certain respects but constitutes a first and very important step forwards in the fight for greater transparency in the EU' s work on behalf of its citizens."
"We also decided to review the regulations by January 2004 at the latest."
"In the same way as we did then, we must now take the lead in the work aimed at taking a further step forward."
"Transparency and public control are the bases for a democratic form of government and a prerequisite for people' s being able to follow, and participate in, public decision-making."
"The opportunity to access EU documents creates greater confidence and legitimacy, two things in short supply in the EU at the present time, unfortunately."
"When we adjust our regulations, let us not therefore make them too complicated."
"Let us interpret Article 255 as generously as possible and the concept of a 'document' as broadly as possible."
"There are exemptions in the legislation, in Article 4, but let us not leave the way open for new interpretations of secrecy or of classification of documents as top secret, and let us not construct unnecessary bureaucracies, either."
"It is important for people to be able to obtain documents to which they are entitled as soon as possible, as well as for documents to be available on the Internet."
"The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party tabled amendments along these lines in the committee, but they were not adopted."
"I hope that they will nonetheless be adopted in practice."
"My group supports this report because, for us, transparency and public control are efficient and democratic, not bureaucratic and unnecessary."
"Through progressive and extensive regulations in Parliament governing transparency, we can show that it is we who are there for the people, and not the other way around."
"Mr President, it is customary to thank rapporteurs but we genuinely want to pay tribute to Mrs Maij-Weggen for the work she has done on this."
"I would like to echo what Mrs Malmström has just said about the urgency of transparency and openness, especially in Parliament and I would like to endorse Mr Cashman's remark that this must be taken as a political responsibility."
"We, as elected politicians, are responsible to our electorate for ensuring that all proceedings are as open as possible."
"With that in mind, I should like briefly to mention the amendments in the name of our Group."
"I hope Mrs Maij-Weggen will accept the first one, extending the rules to cover all committees."
"I only have limited experience of being a vice-chairman of the recent Echelon committee, but I see no reason why special committees and committees of inquiry should not be bound."
"The further extension later in the amendment that broads out the range of documents from Members which count as parliamentary documents is helpful as well."
"I hope that will be accepted."
"On the question of political responsibility, it seems to us that for some questions the Conference of Presidents would be a better organ to decide matters than the Bureau, in the sense that in the Conference of Presidents people are representing their political party, whereas in the Bureau people are supposed to speak for the Parliament as a whole, rather than putting forward a political case."
"Our third amendment suggests that we need a parliamentary definition of sensitive documents."
"Mr Cashman has challenged the validity of this."
"We think that within our rules, there is room for an expanded definition in relation to parliamentary documents."
"We will check that and withdraw the amendment if, on reflection, we think we have gone too far."
"Finally, we should like a split vote in relation to the adoption of security rules for the EP to leave out the words 'on the basis of a proposal from the Bureau' which would again push the responsibility back on to the Conference of Presidents."
"However we very much appreciate the spirit in which Mrs Maij-Weggen has put this forward and we are grateful for her willingness to look carefully at our amendments."
"Parliaments must be transparent."
"It is very sad that the more we open our glass-houses, the less people seem to look into them."
"The media need to help in this as well."
"If this Parliament is to be transparent it must be reported, as well as open."
"Mr President, Mrs Maij-Weggen' s report on public access to Parliament documents is an advance we cannot but support."
"The problem is everything that is not included. The main problem is that the Commission and the Council do not supply Parliament with documents from the phase during which legislation is prepared, and that is, of course, the phase in which people have an interest in participating so as to influence the content of the legislation."
"Our rapporteurs and committee chairmen can often get hold of the relevant papers."
"Members of the executive can, more often than not, obtain what they need from their political friends in the Commission or the Council' s delegations, but such documents are not, and will not be, available to all MEPs or to the public."
"Nor does the report make any change to the disgraceful framework agreement which the majority of Parliament has entered into with the Commission and which divides MEPs into first and second class Members according to whether or not they have access to confidential information."
"It might be relevant to distinguish between rapporteurs and ordinary MEPs, but the distinction is not made according to who has need of the confidential information."
"It is all right to impose tough sanctions on MEPs who breach confidentiality, but it is contrary to the principle of equality, and thus unlawful, to regard committee chairmen as especially eligible, while a rapporteur with the same need does not have access in the same way."
"Moreover, it is completely insane and contrary to every parliamentary tradition that Parliament' s Committee on Budgetary Control, the ombudsman and the EU' s own Court of Auditors are never in a position to check all the documents concerning the Commission' s discharge of its office."
"This, too, is something which Mrs Maij-Weggen' s otherwise quite excellent report does nothing about."
"Nor are those of us who are to approve the enlargement agreements able to obtain the screening reports, even if they do not, in fact, contain anything other than an analysis of the gap between existing EU legislation and the candidate countries' arrangements for transposing the EU regulations into their own legislation."
"This situation will scarcely be changed when the regulation regarding public access to documents comes into force."
"We are still in the dark ages when it comes to transparency, but even a small step in the right direction must be endorsed, so it will be the green button I press tomorrow in order to encourage Mrs Hanja Maij-Weggen to continue working for greater openness in the EU."
"Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, Mrs Maij-Weggen, Mr Cashman, ladies and gentlemen, if, today, the window of the European Parliament is opened a little wider, as Mr MacCormick has put it, then Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mr Cashman will have played a great part in it."
"Thank you for your commitment and congratulations on the success you have achieved in making us more open."
"I certainly do not see myself as groping in the dark, as Mr Bonde put it, but I do think we are on the road towards the light."
"Tomorrow's resolution will also be our invitation to the citizens of the European Union to put our openness to good use, to look in on us, to, if you want to put it that way, take a look at the cards we hold, even to see behind the scenes."
"Openness makes little sense, of course, if nobody is interested in the work we do."
"We do not wish to complain about the lack of interest on the part of our citizens and voters, but we would like to seriously urge them to avail themselves of this new openness on the part of the European Parliament, as today's technology makes things conceivable which a few years ago would not have been possible."
"With the click of a mouse, they can see the original texts we discuss in this House."
"Even if press reports on Europe are sometimes incomplete, the interested citizen can nonetheless look straight in on us with the help of the Internet."
"That is an opportunity, and because of it we strongly support this report."
"I would have liked to say something to the representative of the Council of Ministers."
"Unfortunately, he is not here, but there was not going to be much to say about transparency."
"Mr. President, I also wish to congratulate Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mr Cashman on this second success."
"They already deserve our congratulations on their work on the original legislation, Council and Parliament Regulation 1049/2001, where their work was crucial in securing that positive result."
"Now they are coming back to translate that into our Rules of Procedure to ensure that our work is transparent."
"It is arguable that the European Union is in some ways already more transparent than some of our Member States."
"It certainly does not reach the highest standards set by some of our Member States, but we are moving in the right direction, although of course it is still not perfect."
"However we will review it in a few years in the light of experience."
"Looking at the package of amendments to our Rules of Procedure tabled by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, I can say on behalf of my group that we will support the thrust of what the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has put forward."
"We shall listen to the arguments that are being put forward in this debate and then review our position again, but our group is leaning towards accepting Amendment No 14 from the PPE-DE Group, the first half of Amendment No 15 from the Verts/ALE Group, and possibly Amendment No 16 from the Verts/ALE Group."
"We are opposed to the second half of Amendment No 15 from the Verts/ALE Group, which is entirely unworkable and would raise a number of practical problems if it were adopted."
"As Mr Cashman explained, we question whether Amendment No 17 from the Verts/ALE Group it is admissible, and I welcome the fact that Mr MacCormick was doubtful about that."
"I gather it may well be withdrawn and I would welcome that."
"That is the position of our group, subject to the arguments we are listening to now."
"However, whatever happens to those particular amendments, I am quite confident that there will be a successful outcome in the vote tomorrow."
"Mr President, I add my congratulations to Mrs Maij-Weggen for an excellent report."
"It is quite clear that Parliament must get its own house in order after the agreements we have had vis-à-vis the Commission."
"Access is important but too much lip service is paid to access."
"I thought that at the beginning Mr Corbett was being rather congratulatory."
"I agree with him that we are moving in the right direction, but we still have a long way to go."
"I want to bring to Parliament's attention the specific problem that the Committee on Petitions is still experiencing with access to documentation."
"I know the problem here is largely the Commission, but it impacts on Parliament."
"A number of European citizens have petitioned this Parliament about problems with Lloyds of London."
"A very detailed questionnaire was sent to the British Government."
"Only Members of the Petitions Committee have been allowed to see that questionnaire; no other Members of Parliament."
"Even Members of the Petitions Committee, behind closed doors, are not allowed to have any legal advisers, or political advisers, and are not allowed to take copies."
"Nobody in Parliament has been allowed to see the reply from the British Government."
"Mr Bolkestein said that he cannot reveal this information because it could be subject to legal action by the Commission against the British Government."
"The British Government reply was that they would not let us see it because they regard it as an informal communication at the request of the Petitions Committee by the Commission."
"Twenty-one detailed questions to the British Government and the British Government says that it is an informal communication!"
"We want some clarity here, so that we know precisely what we do and do not have access to."
"At present, Members, committees and Parliament itself cannot do their jobs properly because of excessive secrecy."
"I would certainly urge that a representative - the chairman of the Petitions Committee - should be on the Interinstitutional Committee so that citizens know that the Members of this Parliament who look after their interests ensure that this secrecy does not go any deeper than it does at present."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for allowing me to speak briefly on behalf of the Commission, about the work that we have done, and I am referring not only to myself and the Commission, but also to Parliament and the Presidency, to bring about the regulation of 30 May."
"This is also an important time for you, because Parliament' s adoption of the report by Mrs Maij-Weggen means that as of 3 December, you will be able to apply the regulation on public access to documents."
"The Commission believes that this regulation represents a very significant step forwards in achieving greater transparency and accountability on the part of the institutions towards Europe' s citizens."
"The efforts made by Parliament to ensure that the regulation was adopted within the time limits imposed by the Treaty, a point that I also highlighted during a previous speech, clearly indicates the importance that your institution also attaches to transparency in general, and to the public' s right of access to documents, in particular."
"You will, therefore, allow me to acknowledge and draw attention to the effort made, and to express my gratitude to the Chairman of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, Mr Watson, but also to you, Mrs Maij-Weggen, and to Mr Cashman, who has done a great deal of work with you, Mrs Maij-Weggen, on these issues."
"I would also like to tell you that the Commission is finalising a draft decision on the implementation of the regulation of 30 May."
"This decision will be adopted during November by the Commission, which will annex it to its own internal Rules of Procedure."
"The Commission will also be in a position, therefore, to implement this regulation within the required time limits, and this will guarantee that the public can fully exercise its right to access these documents."
"In these circumstances, it is natural for the Commission to pay particular attention to the approach that the European Parliament used to amend its Rules of Procedure."
"This approach will be a very useful source of inspiration for the Commission' s own internal rules, as I think it is important that the institutions follow a similar approach in applying these important rules."
"The way they are applied must, of course, respect the spirit of the Rules of Procedure."
"This is the main thrust of the message that the Commission wishes to give to you today, whilst we, of course, fully respect your autonomy in how you choose to amend your own rules."
"In conclusion, Mr President, I would like to make a very brief comment about a point that Mrs Maij-Weggen raised in her report, which concerns the framework agreement between our two institutions, and reiterated the different nature of the two acts - firstly, the regulation of 30 May 2001 and secondly, the framework agreement that I have just mentioned."
"As far as the Commission is concerned, we believe that there is no obvious incompatibility between these two documents, since Annex III of the framework agreement regulates the forwarding of confidential documents to Parliament which cannot, in any case, be forwarded to the public, due to the exceptions laid down by the regulation of 30 May."
"What happens in practice should naturally reflect this legal interpretation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would, however, like to confirm the Commission' s very clear intention to faithfully apply all the provisions contained in this framework agreement."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at noon."
"Membership of interparliamentary delegations and joint parliamentary committees"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0346/2000) by Mr Carnero González, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on the amendment of the Rules of Procedure as regards the setting-up of interparliamentary delegations and joint parliamentary committees."
"Mr President, until this current parliamentary term, the standing committees, the interparliamentary delegations and the delegations of the joint parliamentary committees of this House were set up using a uniform procedure: Plenary, at the proposal of the Conference of Presidents, appointed Members, and these, at the inaugural meeting, elected the bureau for each of these bodies."
"The reform of the rules introduced as a result of the decision made by this House in plenary at the end of the last parliamentary term changed this situation with regard to the interparliamentary delegations and the delegations in joint parliamentary committees."
"From that point on, both were elected and set up in a different way from the standing committees: their bureaux were approved by this House, at the proposal of the Conference of Presidents, which appointed the remainder of its Members."
"Proceeding in this fashion, at the start of this fifth parliamentary term, it was noticed that there was a contradiction in Rule 170."
"This Rule stated that the delegations of joint parliamentary committees would be set up in the same way as the standing committees, and, at the same time, it was stated that this would be carried out in accordance with Rule 168, that had already been amended in the way I previously mentioned."
"This gave rise to a contradiction, no doubt caused by an error in this House, which had adopted an oral amendment by simple majority without having removed the reference to the former procedures from the text of the Rules of Procedure."
"In order to resolve this contradiction, the Conference of Presidents asked the Committee on Constitutional Affairs to look into the matter."
"The report we are debating today is the result of the work carried out by this committee."
"It approved this report exactly one year ago, almost unanimously."
"I would point out that, for one year, this text has been 'sleeping the sleep of the just' ."
"The reasons for this escape me."
"In any case it is clear that, during this time, the chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, Mr Napolitano, and several coordinators, insisted that it should be included on the agenda of this plenary sitting."
"I have the report right here."
"The most important thing is that during this period there was time to be able to reflect upon the following: in the first instance, we have to remove the current contradiction in the Rules of Procedure; this is absolutely crucial if we want to prevent the same doubts we had in July 1999 arising next January."
"At the same time, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs proposed in its report to return to a uniform procedure with regard to the standing committees, the interparliamentary delegations and the delegations of joint parliamentary committees."
"It seems that this time used in 'sleeping the sleep of the just' with regard to this report has been of use for the parliamentary groups to consider that, although it is absolutely necessary to amend the Rules of Procedure to remove this contradiction in Rule 170, doubts still remain about the need to once again standardise the constitutional procedures of the three bodies in this Parliament that I mentioned at the start of my speech."
"I am clear on several points: when dealing with a reform of the Rules of Procedure, two principles should be given priority; firstly, consensus and secondly, efficiency."
"And, whilst we are talking about consensus, it is clear that your rapporteur understands the opinion of the political groups and, therefore, considers that tomorrow we should proceed to remove this contradiction in Rule 170 and leave the procedure for the setting up of interparliamentary delegations and the delegations of joint parliamentary committees as it stands at present."
"The second issue is efficiency."
"In January we will, once again, have to deal with a new process for setting up these bodies. This should take place quickly, so that they can continue to function as well as they have up until now."
"Whilst we are on this subject, I would also like to congratulate, personally, and on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, these interparliamentary delegations and the delegations of joint parliamentary committees."
"I would like, if you will allow me, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and its representatives, to insist on a third principle, coherence, which is also always of fundamental importance."
"Lastly, Mr President, I would like to remind you of that old proverb which says: 'a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush' ."
"Let us resolve this contradiction, which is the most important thing for us to do today."
"Mr President, Mr Carnero, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, am glad that the history of this legal contradiction will, it is to be hoped, come to its end for the time being when we adopt Mr Carnero's report tomorrow."
"Thank you very much, Mr Carnero, for the good work you have done, and, also, for finding your way through this apparently very technical material and bringing out the political dimension to the decision we are to take."
"In political terms, of course, it is a matter of some significance whether the chairpersons of the joint parliamentary committees and of the interparliamentary delegations are appointed en bloc by this, albeit rather thinned-out, House or whether every single candidate in every single joint parliamentary committee or every single interparliamentary delegation has to be elected or appointed as an individual."
"It is, of course, clear that the Rules of Procedure have to provide for a process ensuring political balance in the composition of the delegations and the joint parliamentary committees."
"It is likewise clear that the results of that process also have to be implemented and that this, too, can be safeguarded by the Rules of Procedure."
"It is also evident, on the other hand, that these important decisions about personnel cannot be completely removed from the plenary."
"We must, then, be clear in our own minds that the joint committees and interparliamentary delegations perform duties of a distinctly sensitive nature with respect to our partner countries, and also that the appointment of certain persons to chair these committees can become a political issue, may be seen as discourteous or even taken to be provocative."
"It must therefore be possible for this plenary to retain control over who is actually appointed to the offices in question."
"We cannot, then, have the situation in which Parliament gives, as it were, carte blanche for the appointment to specific positions, only for the individual groups, or even national delegations within them, to decide at the end of the day who is to be appointed."
"Parliament must hold on to its supremacy in this respect."
"I believe this also means that it must be ensured that, when we reassemble in January, we at least know the names of the people involved before proceeding to the ballot."
"This was not in fact the case at the start of this Parliamentary term."
"In the medium term, though, I think we must consider handing over the responsibility to the joint committees and delegations."
"That is where the Members sit who know the relationships with the partner countries and their sensitive aspects."
"In the long term too, they should also bear responsibility for deciding who should preside over them."
"Mr President, this proposed set of amendments to our Rules of Procedure that has been so ably drafted by our rapporteur is intended to resolve a contradiction."
"In one sense it is a very simple matter: we either resolve it one way or we resolve it the other way."
"In the view of myself and many in my group, it is not absolutely crucial whether it be resolved this way or that."
"There are arguments in favour of either solution. Some of these arguments have been put with great clarity in this short debate."
"But resolved it must be, one way or the other."
"As is so often the case when things are relatively simple, everybody has an opinion and these opinions do not entirely coincide."
"Some people have a preference for the solution that has been put forward by the committee. Others prefer the solution that has been tabled in an amendment signed by several political groups."
"The vote tomorrow will determine which way we go."
"Either way, it is crucial that we settle this tomorrow."
"It needs to be sorted out before the constituent sitting in January."
"I concur with our rapporteur that it is somewhat of a scandal that this report has been sat on for over a year since it was adopted in the committee and is only coming now, almost at the last minute, to plenary to be settled."
"It should have been settled a long time ago."
"I congratulate the rapporteur on his patience."
"I am glad he was still able to remember the crucial arguments underpinning his report a whole year after he steered it through the committee."
"Thank you, Mr Corbett."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Europol - joint investigation teams"
"Mr President, Commissioner, despite the importance of the initiatives before us, the European Parliament is, on this matter, only being consulted. That means that, as often happens in these cases, the decision we take with our vote will not be taken into any account by the Council."
"In spite of this, or rather, especially because of this, I want to focus on the need for urgent reform of Europol, in order to allow democratic and judicial control."
"Parliament has been calling for this for at least five years, since the presentation of the Nassauer report in 1996."
"The Nassauer report sent a strong political signal to the Council."
"It called upon the Member States not to ratify the Europol Convention until it had been placed under the control of the Court of Justice, that is, until the Court of Justice had been given the necessary decision-making authority over its interpretation and proper implementation."
"Mr Nassauer' s report was exemplary in its handling of the problems encountered by Europol and the Convention, which remain the same today."
"Resolution of these problems does not depend on the political groups, the rapporteur or Mr Nassauer: the judicial and democratic control of Europol is an institutional matter."
"The refusal to bind up this wound inflicted on European democracy, if we can talk about the system regulating the Union' s institutions today in these terms, implies that it would be impossible to make any tangible progress in creating an area which is genuinely an area of security, of justice and of freedom but which we feel must be first and foremost an area of democracy."
"Since the setting-up of Europol, the European Parliament has pointed out the need to supervise it."
"The plan to increase Europol' s powers to deal with the critical situation with regard to terrorism, the scandal involving a Europol senior official and the reluctance of the national police forces to transmit their data to Europol, as well as the creation of Parlopol - a group of national and European Members of Parliament upholding the importance of increasing democratic control over Europol and its decisions within the area of justice, freedom and security - have already led the Council to reflect at least on the need to introduce some reforms."
"Most importantly, the Council requested that the Commission draw up a communication on the democratic control of Europol by the end of the year."
"We know the opinion of Commissioner Vitorino, who has stated many times that he considers it appropriate to set up a committee composed of members of the national and European parliaments, but we hope to hear now that the timetable for this reform will be speeded up."
"We feel that, in a democratic framework, Europol should be subject to financial, budgetary and judicial control as well as democratic control."
"Financial and budgetary control are currently impossible in that Europol is funded by the national States and not by the Community budget; thus Parliament and the Commission have no power of budgetary or financial control and cannot therefore either criticise or direct the activities of that body."
"Judicial control has also been denied. Indeed, the Court of Justice has been denied full powers of judicial control."
"We should also note that Europol officials benefit from immunity that is so wide-ranging that it is like a guarantee of impunity, protecting them with regard to the judicial control which can be exercised at national level."
"Then there is the problem of the gradual increase in the mandate and powers of Europol."
"Although Europol initially dealt with drug-related crime, the act under consideration widens the powers of Europol to what is, in essence, all types of crime."
"To enable the European Parliament to express its concerns and requests to the Council and the Commission at a time when they are preparing to take decisions enlarging Europol' s powers and jurisdiction, we feel that, in addition to the amendments on the two Acts proposed by Belgium and Sweden, other amendments are necessary to resolve this issue."
"In our opinion, the amendments tabled may perform the function of clarifying and improving the initiatives under consideration and send the Council and the Member States a clear political message criticising the current situation and proposing several fundamental guidelines for reform."
"Lastly, the combination of the factors I have mentioned and the lack of codecision powers conferred on the European Parliament with regard to justice and home affairs must prompt all those who hold dear the principles of democracy and freedom to reject the two initiatives under consideration, for I feel this would make the Council and the Member States more aware of the urgent need to reform Europol."
"rapporteur."
"Mr President, as you would expect, I will concentrate on my own report, which deals with the establishment of joint investigation teams."
"I am very proud to be the rapporteur in an extremely innovative area, which has taken on great importance following the appalling events of 11 September."
"It is perhaps all the more important because we are trying to implement Article 13 of the EU Convention on mutual assistance in criminal matters which, although it was signed in May 2000, looks unlikely to be ratified for some time, making it vital that we have a legal framework in place as quickly as possible so that we can take these matters forward."
"Joint investigation teams will allow two or more countries to join together for the purposes of investigating terrorism, human trafficking, drug trafficking and indeed other serious organised crime."
"This is an important venture which we must all support."
"A joint investigation team will take the talent and ability from different Member States and join them together for a purpose which is clearly defined and with a clear termination date, but in a way which will allow that expertise to work effectively and sharply in dealing with criminality and with bringing criminals to book."
"It will be a flexible instrument and one which we have been in need of for some time."
"There have been concerns expressed, although not followed up in amendments, about the extent of participation in such teams."
"For instance, there have been references to the national criminal intelligence services of Member States."
"As a minister responsible in the United Kingdom for setting up our own national criminal intelligence service a few years ago, I am very confident that the make-up of these organisations in Member States is already well addressed."
"By giving those setting up the teams the discretion to determine their composition and to express objections when necessary, it seems to me that this point has been tackled very effectively."
"Although all the States concerned are signatories to our Human Rights Convention, I have nevertheless asked in this report that we draw particular attention to the need to protect and preserve human rights in the conduct of these teams."
"Terrorism is uppermost in our minds at present."
"But trafficking in human beings is something else we should be deeply concerned about and something which these teams could perhaps help with."
"Only recently it has been revealed in the United Kingdom that there are hundreds, even thousands, of young children who have been sold into the slave trade from other parts of the world and are now in Europe suffering the most appalling treatment."
"There has been a case of this nature in the UK, and there has also been a recent case in Italy."
"The operation of joint investigation teams, say between Italy and ourselves, or with the participation of the French expertise in this area, would help to bring this sort of appalling offence to an end."
"So the report does not concern just terrorism but these other matters too."
"Indeed it may also be possible to make a significant impact on a whole complex of issues currently of topical interest comprising fraud, money laundering and economic crime of that kind, if the talents and abilities of specific small teams able to operate in different countries can be brought to bear under the control of a single operation."
"There is one further point."
"I have made quite clear in my report that it is important that all these operations should be under the clear parliamentary control of the European Parliament."
"Within the annual debate on the area of freedom, security and justice, this particular debate should go forward as well."
"We should be sure that we consider these operations carefully."
"Finally, a lot of sensitive information may emerge as a result of this process."
"If something akin to a select committee were perhaps to be established to receive such confidential information, that could also help to boost confidence in the operation of these teams, which are a very important and significant development in crime prevention in the European Union."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was in 1999, at Tampere, that, for the first time in the history of European integration, the Heads of State and Government of the 15 Member States of the Union put justice-related issues at the top of their political agenda and gave the commitment that an area of freedom, security and justice would be established within a maximum of five years."
"One of the Union' s major objectives is, therefore, to enable its citizens to live in this area of freedom, security and justice, which must be an area in which freedom goes hand in hand with a high level of security, and it is in this framework that the creation and operation of joint investigation teams are being planned."
"The call for the rapid creation of joint investigation teams was made at Tampere as the first stage in the fight against trafficking in human beings and drugs and against terrorism."
"In the wake of the appalling events of 11 September, this initiative has come to the fore as part of a framework of measures to be adopted in the fight against terrorism and seeks to secure the adoption of a framework decision that will provide a legal framework to enable us to set up joint investigation teams made up of members of the police and judges who are specially trained in the fight against terrorism and of representatives of the Provisional Judicial Cooperation (Pro-Eurojust) unit and Europol, in order to coordinate investigations undertaken in this field."
"I share the rapporteur, Mr Kirkhope' s, enthusiasm for this initiative and I congratulate him on the work he has carried out, which seeks to speed up the entry into force of the provisions of the Convention, still not ratified to date, that are considered to be most urgent by the Member States."
"I must draw your attention, however, to the need for this Convention to be ratified quickly so as to prevent the risk of any potential fragmentation of this legal mechanism."
"Furthermore, we must also welcome the extension of Europol' s sphere of action to all serious forms of international crime, which are listed in the annex to the Convention, for this will help to make cooperation under the Europol Convention more effective."
"Priority areas for action must, nevertheless, be identified according to trends in crime in the Union."
"You will all agree that, now more than ever, we must devote particular attention to terrorism."
"Mr President, never has there been more need for a stronger Europe to address the issues of citizens' security and freedom, to implement that area of freedom, security and justice that the Treaty of Amsterdam promised us and the Tampere European Council planned to create."
"The momentum to implement the necessary measures has repeatedly faltered in the face of often short-sighted resistance on the part of the governments."
"It took the tragedy of 11 September to, at last, shake up a large number of our leaders and substantial impetus has been lent to the adoption of certain necessary measures."
"I fervently hope that it will not take more tragedies to set the Tampere process in motion, not least because the laws made under the emotional pressure of inhuman tragedies are not always wise ones."
"In these cases, we are sometimes in danger of disregarding the need to safeguard peoples' fundamental rights."
"I am glad to say that the three reports before us do not fall into this trap and I particularly welcome the contributions of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, which tabled amendments improving the proposal."
"Mr Kirkhope' s report calls upon us to support the proposal of four Member States to adopt a framework decision on joint investigation teams, already provided for by the Tampere European Council and the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union, endorsed by Parliament a year ago when it adopted the Di Pietro report."
"Therefore, Mr Kirkhope' s report deserves the widest consensus, not least because it contains amendments improving the proposal with regard to respect for fundamental rights, parliamentary scrutiny and extending the use of joint investigation teams to combat organised crime as well as terrorism and trafficking in drugs and human beings."
"Mr Turco' s reports, as adopted by the Committee on Citizen' s Freedoms, going against the rapporteur' s recommendation, move that we should adopt the two proposals on Europol with appropriate amendments."
"The first stipulates that Europol' s mandate may be extended to all serious forms of organised crime already listed in the Annex to the Convention in accordance with the priorities established by the Council upon the proposal of Europol' s management board."
"The Committee on Citizens' Freedoms' amendment on the subject moves that this decision should be a qualified majority decision adopted by the Council after it has consulted the European Parliament and obtained the opinion of Eurojust, a body which is particularly experienced in this field."
"I am sad to see that, although the Members of the European People' s Party voted for the motion in committee, they have now changed their minds and feel that Eurojust' s opinion should not now be taken into consideration. The opinion is certainly not binding but it is certainly very useful, and it would be absurd not to make use of it."
"We therefore support the first Turco report, as tabled in committee."
"The second Turco report on the transmission of personal data from Europol to third States also warrants full consensus."
"I would say that, irrespective of the rapporteur' s opinion which we have heard today, these proposals should be adopted en masse."
"However, I fully agree with what the rapporteur has said, which is also stressed in the amendments adopted in committee."
"They firmly reiterate the opinion, often expressed by Parliament, that it is becoming increasingly necessary to communitise the instruments of judicial cooperation and to consolidate the judicial and democratic control of these instruments, which are, in fact, quite vital."
"Ladies and gentlemen, our group backs the report by Mr Kirkhope and certainly the words he has spoken this evening."
"I believe that the joint investigation teams are a positive step in the fight against all kinds of organised crime."
"First of all, in connection with the Turco report, which specifically deals with the two aspects of Europol' s scope, extending the mandate appears to be a rather pointless exercise if Europol is unable to carry out the mandate properly."
"After all, Europol' s usefulness has so far proved very limited in practice."
"Moreover, Europol does indeed work with police and court information but is not involved in any way in the internal security service in practice."
"This creates an imbalance and repressive action after the events without sufficient preventive action."
"Secondly, with regard to the databases, the call for a decentralised system is justified on account of manageability."
"It would therefore be a big step forward if every Member State were to develop such a database."
"These initiatives are therefore to be welcomed, but the same cracks seem to be appearing again."
"On the one hand, we are relying too heavily on the benevolence, or lack thereof, of the Member States, while on the other hand, there appears to be an evident lack of confidence in democracy, notably parliamentary supervision of this highly important area of policy."
"If we are truly concerned about the protection of civil rights and the maintenance of democracy, we must, without delay, build an adequate system based on criminal law that can meet the challenges we are now facing, and invest in a powerful preventive policy."
"Internal security services, in particular, have an important role to play here."
"The cooperation between the internal security services and the judicial services, in other words, between preventive and repressive action, must be better coordinated as a matter of urgency, with the emphasis placed firmly on the prevention of serious crimes."
"Mr President, the European Union, in close collaboration with the United States, has used the terrorist attack on 11 September as a reason to speed up the witch hunt on anyone who stands up to their imperialist plans and preferences."
"And Europe, which is being given wider and wider powers, powers which go beyond national laws and constitutional protection for its citizens, is being called on to play the lead role here."
"The information collated in the Member States, the well-known files, are now common currency; joint files are being kept on potential suspects, that is, every one of us, and the distribution list for these files is getting longer and longer."
"Joint investigation teams basically have carte blanche, in that they are set up by however many Member States want to, for however long they want, with the involvement of any services they want and for whatever purpose they think fit."
"This is an orchestrated attack on grass-roots movements."
"They want to extinguish the personal and collective rights and democratic freedoms that workers have fought for."
"Unfortunately, not only do the reports make no attempt to put a halt to this anti-grass roots and anti-democratic development; on the contrary, they incorporate it in an overall reform of the means available for judicial and police assistance."
"Mr President, it has never been so appropriate as now, in the wake of the events of 11 September, to establish joint investigation teams to improve cooperation between all the national investigation teams, particularly with a view to enhancing and speeding up that necessary exchange of fresh information between all the information services of the Member States of the European Union."
"Clearly, this is a police cooperation tool that will be of truly strategic importance in preventing crime."
"It is a vital, useful tool which will help to tackle the critical terrorist situation in Europe in the wake of the severe international crisis caused by the attack on the twin towers."
"We have all had the opportunity, although, sadly, only since the New York and Washington carnage, to reconstruct the series of preparations for terrorist attacks made on our own European territory over the years by people and organisations linked to Osama Bin Laden: the many, apparently unimportant signs actually linked by a single thread and whose connection, sadly, we did not realise until it was too late, until after 11 September, when thousands of innocent people had already died."
"Clearly, closer judicial and police cooperation involving more joint investigations might well have made us more effective in preventing terrorist crimes."
"However, it is worth noting that, in addition to helping us respond to the critical terrorist situation, joint investigation teams would also play a useful general role in helping to fight the many phenomena linked to large-scale organised crime at international level such as the illegal trafficking of arms and drugs and the trafficking and exploitation of human beings."
"Mr President, I would like to end by thanking Mr Kirkhope and pointing out that the fight against crime, both terrorism-related and general, has, for years now, been the subject of the most insistent requests from European citizens, who are demanding increasing efforts from the national and European institutions fully guaranteeing the fundamental, inalienable right to safety, that precious thing which is under increasing threat."
"Therefore, I look forward to the greatest possible endeavours from the European Union too, making use, not least, of the tool of the joint investigation teams, precisely to restore the necessary confidence of the European citizens."
"Mr President, it appears that the Council may have arrived."
"If I am not mistaken, someone from the Council has arrived."
"Is that so?"
"Are you from the Council?"
"We don' t know!"
"I would ask you not to address the Commission or the Council in a direct or personal fashion."
"Any comment of this nature that you wish to make should be made through the Presidency."
"Thank you, Mr Cappato."
"Mr President, I was, in fact, addressing you in order to ask you whether we have, in effect, been honoured by the arrival of the Council."
"I just wanted to point out that the Council was not present at this debate and has arrived only now."
"I just wanted everyone to realise, to be aware of the consideration given to Parliament' s decisions and debates, the translation into 11 languages, the amendments translated into 11 languages, the speeches translated into 11 languages, which serve absolutely no purpose whatsoever."
"We are discussing the extension of the European police coordination mandate to include the most serious crimes; indeed we are aware that the coordination of information is, in itself, an implementing power, and that the distinction between coordination powers and implementing powers is very, very fine, hazy and difficult to define; we are therefore plumbing the depths of Member States' police and police cooperation policies."
"The implications for our countries and our codes of criminal procedure are huge, for, as we know, procedures vary greatly between the 15 Member States in terms of the relationship between the police and the law and the government."
"Well then, all this is taking place without Parliament being given any say whatsoever in the legislative process, the process by which laws are formed, and I would stress, none whatsoever, without any input from democratically elected assemblies."
"We know that President Prodi is in favour, yes, of course we do, but we also know that we are sacrificing with a single blow any balance of powers to the urgent, critical need for effectiveness in the fight against crime."
"The Council official blithely arrives here at the very end of the debate."
"Our speeches and decisions, the votes we take will serve no purpose at all, for Presidency itself has decreed that this and other debates are to be held at the same time as the meeting of the committee responsible, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, which is voting now, at this very moment."
"Therefore, the two Non-attached Members and the other three or four Members who are in the Chamber are missing the vote on terrorism and the European arrest warrant because of this decision which, I feel, ties in with the Council' s decision not to be present during this debate and is typical of the way the European Union legislates."
"Mr President, the extension of Europol' s mandate is not some new issue that has arisen after 11 September."
"It is, however, self-evident that, right now, there is a particularly great need for such an extension."
"Naturally, we need to exchange information with third countries' police forces in order to help them combat crime, a fact that was emphasised by an as good as unanimous Parliament when we voted on the report on combating computer-related crime."
"There are those who are anxious about Europol' s being given unduly large resources."
"They might like to reflect upon the consequences of Europol' s having 388 employees to cover a population larger than the United States' s, while the FBI has 27 000 employees."
"There is no comparison at all between the resources involved, nor between the activities concerned."
"Europol is not operational."
"When information is transferred, it is incredibly important that we should continue to protect data and, as far as possible, to maintain personal privacy."
"The human rights we have laid down both in the European Convention and in the European Union' s Charter of Fundamental Rights are a characteristically European feature of which we should be proud and which we should also be sure to maintain."
"We must nonetheless beware of creating a Big Brother society."
"Just as Mr Turco emphasised, it is therefore important that Parliament be there to exercise its democratic control."
"It is quite unreasonable that these issues should be excluded from the structures of the EU and that issues which are so very important to people should be discussed in a largely empty Chamber."
"The fact that crime statistics are being gathered is naturally welcome."
"There is something not quite right about the fact that the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction in Lisbon gathers a large quantity of statistics concerning drug addiction, while we have little in the way of statistics when it comes to the fight against crime."
"Europol naturally has an important role to fulfil in this area."
"When it comes to the issue of whether or not Eurojust should be mentioned in this context, it has emerged that many people interpret the wording in terms of a desire to upset the balance of power between the executive and the judiciary."
"It should not, of course, be interpreted in that way."
"I do not, however, want any misunderstandings to arise concerning this matter."
"To avoid misunderstandings, it would therefore be better to change the Eurojust wording."
"Finally, I want to thank Mr Turco for having dealt with the Swedish and Belgian initiative so well."
"Mr President, the two government initiatives on Europol that we are examining today, the first on the definition of areas of action, the second on the rules on the transmission of personal data, provide the European Parliament with the opportunity to raise a genuine question, which is how to organise democratic control over Europol."
"This is a very important question, since police and judicial cooperation and, in particular, the management of analysis files that are kept by Europol, are very closely related to civil liberties."
"Today, since Europol is an intergovernmental body, it is controlled by the national parliaments; first and foremost, by the governments at the Council of Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs or their representatives on Europol' s management board, and lastly by a supervisory body made up of leading, independent figures."
"The relevant parliamentary committee is proposing to completely change this system, even though it has only been in operation since 1999, and would like to entrust control of Europol solely to Community procedures, in other words, to the European Parliament."
"We do not think this proposal is suitable."
"We do not consider the European Parliament to be the appropriate institution to undertake the democratic monitoring of sovereign police operations in the Member States, which are carried out by the national services and have implications for the very territory of the Member States."
"It would be better to keep an open mind while Europol is just beginning to carry out its work and to give the national parliaments the chance to organise and refine their control."
"They are also aware of this need."
"For example, in September, the French Parliament imposed a ban on its parliament debating the draft agreements between Europol and Eastern European countries."
"It then lifted this ban when it had sufficient guarantees as to the security of the transmission of personal data."
"We believe that this is a very positive approach."
"It is evidence that there is effective control by the national parliaments."
"In order to exercise this control further, the French Senate has also set up an internal specialised working group responsible for investigating issues of police and judicial cooperation."
"This is the example we should be following, Mr President, and we should even, without doubt, go further by improving horizontal coordination of the control carried out by the national parliaments."
"They should work together in setting up an interparliamentary assembly to monitor Europol and police and judicial cooperation."
"Better still, the Intergovernmental Conference, which is due to meet in 2004 and which, in fact, must deal with the role of national parliaments within the European structure, should propose to develop this type of interparliamentary cooperation and turn this into a new pillar of the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission considers these three initiatives to be particularly important, especially now, at a time when cooperation not only between Member States but also between the European Union and third countries and international organisations is crucial if we want to combat organised crime and, in particular, terrorism, effectively."
"The initiatives we are discussing today are intended to speed up the timetable, to bring forward the time when the Member States will have a Community legal basis for establishing joint investigation teams which, if necessary, could include representatives of third countries or of international organisations, to extend Europol' s mandate to enable it to deal with a wider range of criminal activities, and also to enable Europol to transmit personal data to third countries and to other organisations effectively. This will undoubtedly be an important factor in ensuring that cooperation with these third countries and with these international organisations is reliable and functions effectively."
"The Commission welcomes the fact that the European Parliament supports the draft framework decision on joint investigation teams that Belgium, Spain, France and the United Kingdom have proposed."
"We hope that the time saved by allowing Member States to put together such teams will enhance the effectiveness of the fight against transnational crime."
"The Commission also welcomes the fact that Parliament has given a positive response to the proposal to extend Europol' s mandate and to allow the transmission of personal data to third countries and other organisations."
"These two initiatives will help to make Europol an organisation which is more effective in the fight against organised crime, a matter which is of increasing concern to the public of the Member States of the European Union."
"Mr Turco' s report raises the issue of the democratic control of Europol with regard to the initiatives in question."
"In June this year, I had the opportunity to discuss this issue at the interparliamentary conference organised by the Dutch government in The Hague, which was attended by representatives of practically all national parliaments of the Member States and which Mr Turco also attended."
"In light of the discussion that took place on that occasion with the representatives of the national parliaments, the Commission, as provided for in its working programme for this year, is now finalising its communication on the democratic control of Europol, in which it will put forward a number of ideas designed to improve this process."
"As you will be aware, this democratic control cannot and must not exclude the irreplaceable role of the national parliaments, specifically with regard to control of their national Europol antennas. Indeed, it must not only enable interparliamentary cooperation with national parliaments, but also provide the added value that comes from Parliament' s commitment to democratic control so as to ensure that, in this way, through close cooperation between the European Parliament and the national parliaments, we are able to develop an overall picture of how Europol is actually working without losing any elements of the detailed work produced by national parliaments on their own actions to exercise control over Europol."
"At the same time, I acknowledge the importance of coordination between Europol and Eurojust and of the role Eurojust should play in relation to the judicial supervision of Europol."
"I do feel, however, that it would be preferable to wait for the Council' s decision, which will determine the final form Eurojust is to take, before we move ahead with solutions on coordination between police and courts at European level."
"With regard to extending Europol's mandate, the Commission takes note of and shares the concerns expressed in the report about the decision-making structure under the Union's third pillar."
"This is indeed slow because priorities tend to change from one presidency to the next, and the role of Parliament itself is limited."
"We therefore welcome the fact that the European Parliament has emphasised the need for the situations of organised crime in each Member State to be reflected when priorities are established in the fight against organised crime at European level."
"Hence the importance of Member States providing Europol with sufficient, timely information so that it can produce an annual report on the situation of organised crime in the European Union of the required standard."
"With regard to the amendments proposed in Parliament' s report, the Commission might propose that the public version of this annual report be annexed to the report that Europol also submits annually to the European Parliament."
"Lastly, with regard to the initiative on the transmission of personal data, the Commission broadly supports the amendments Parliament has proposed."
"It shares the opinion that the safeguards for data protection provided today under Article 7 of the 1999 Council Act on data transmitted to third countries and to international organisations, also apply to the transmission of data arising from this Swedish initiative."
"Since, in this case, the Swedish initiative only changes Article 5(5) of the aforementioned 1999 Council Act, Article 7, which is the article relevant to this matter, will still apply in full."
"Hence my doubts as to whether there is a genuine need for the proposed amendment to Article 7 of the Council Act."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote on this item will take place tomorrow at noon."
"Extradition between Member States (1995 and 1996 Conventions - Schengen Acquis)"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0371/2001) by Mr Marinho, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on an Initiative of the Kingdom of Sweden with a view to the adoption of a Council Decision determining which provisions of the 1995 Convention on simplified extradition procedure between the Member States of the European Union and of the 1996 Convention relating to extradition between the Member States of the European Union constitute developments of the Schengen acquis in accordance with the Agreement concerning the Republic of Iceland's and the Kingdom of Norway's association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis."
"Mr President, Commissioner, curiously, two European States that have never been members of the European Union, Norway and Iceland, were the first to establish, on a regional basis, an area for the free movement of persons."
"Towards the end of 1957, through the Nordic Passport Union, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Norway and Iceland, five European States, opened their borders to people while another six sketched out a common market, giving priority to the movement of goods in a Customs Union."
"The two groups of States chose to take quite different routes: the first establishing EFTA, and the second aiming for a Europe that would be united in more than just economic terms."
"Fortunately, the project embodied by the Six, which are today Fifteen and will soon be almost double that, although the more ambitious and complex of the two, has proved to be more than just a facilitator of free trade or of border crossing."
"It has proved to be attractive to many of the founders of the Nordic institutions and, for that very reason, our report attempts to make sense of the contradictions and the chance events of history, by integrating Norway and Iceland into the Schengen area and, most importantly, in the case of the Swedish initiative, into the European Union' s area of freedom, security and justice."
"Thus, this Swedish initiative extends the Union' s area of free movement beyond the official geographical borders of Europe, with the corresponding consequences for the legal and judicial sphere, making Norway and Iceland countries in which the common rules on extradition contained in the Schengen acquis will apply."
"Who could have imagined, 45 years ago, that this would be possible?"
"Underpinning this historical development, or rather, this need, which implies new requirements and commitments, and thereby changes Europe and requires it to make progress, is the certainty that the Tampere programme, which involves moving from the intergovernmental method to the Community method, will lead to the communitisation of judicial cooperation, because this is what the governments of the Fifteen wanted, because the work of the Commission and of Commissioner Vitorino must not be betrayed by ongoing hesitancy on the grounds of sovereignty and, most importantly, because the situation today requires Europe to have a legal and criminal protection system that serves as the primary instrument for combating international and cross-border crime."
"The real difference, which should make us proud to be Europeans, does not lie in our military arsenal but in the quality of the new European laws that we in this House are helping, or will help to construct. These laws will have the power to reconcile deterrence and respect for freedoms without attacking the philosophical and cultural differences that shape the criminal law of any Member State."
"The European arrest warrant, based on the principle of mutual recognition of national court sentences, is, in the form proposed by Commissioner Vitorino, an example we should follow when considering the other aspects of Tampere, particularly the harmonisation of criminal law."
"For all of these reasons, I hope that this Swedish initiative, which we welcome as timely and necessary, rapidly becomes obsolete, having been superseded by effective Community law, specifically on the arrest warrant, eliminating the two Union conventions, which were, admittedly, well-intentioned, but of limited effect."
"The idea is that these will be replaced by the mutual recognition of court sentences and the simple transfer of persons guilty of committing crimes, a step, Commissioner, which will create a single European area for extradition."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will first thank the rapporteur, who has analysed this very technical report with great expertise and proposed a range of editorial amendments that we can all support."
"We, likewise, welcome and support the Swedish initiative, which is before us now, to further develop the Schengen acquis."
"Some parts of it have, however, already been overtaken by reality, as the breakneck speed of developments in European internal affairs and justice policy since the terrorist attacks on 11 September might well have made this report and this submission largely obsolete, at least as regards extradition policy."
"Thus, the Council of Ministers of Internal Affairs and of Justice, on 20 September, had already set in motion a simpler procedure for handing over criminals and for the mutual recognition of court judgments."
"We welcome the fact that there is broad European agreement on criminal law and criminal procedure as well."
"This will lead to better combating of crime on our continent and promote the Community legal area."
"This being so, I could save myself further great speeches on the Swedish initiative, as Mr Marinho has already made the main points."
"I would, though, like to enlarge on one point, namely that the provisions of the 1995 EU Agreement on simplified extradition procedures and the 1996 EU Agreement on extradition between Member States are, according to this proposal, to be extended to Iceland and Norway as a further development of the Schengen acquis."
"So far, so good."
"Yet, out of Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg and England, none have, to date, ratified one of these agreements."
"This is especially scandalous in view of the candidate states having undertaken to accept the Schengen acquis."
"The Member States must at last become aware of their need to set an example, specifically as regards the transposition and ratification of EU acts."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Marinho on his excellent work on this report and say that we are all aware of how sensitive and how incontrovertibly important issues such as asylum policy, measures to combat crime, the improvement of external border controls and the fight against terrorism are for the Member States."
"Nevertheless, I would say that we also all understand now that common problems require common solutions, that to resolve them effectively and coherently, apart from the national dimension, the necessary European dimension must also be in place."
"The main objectives of police and judicial cooperation on criminal matters in the European Union are the fight against transnational organised crime and the approximation of legal and statutory provisions."
"Nevertheless, in the field of judicial cooperation, Schengen has concentrated its efforts on ensuring that requests for extradition are rapidly dealt with by means of the Schengen Information System (SIS)."
"The Swedish initiative that we are considering today does not contain, as Mr Marinho has already stated, major substantive provisions, specifically in the field of extradition, and seeks mainly to clarify the relationship between the various positions on extradition at European Union level and involve Iceland and Norway in the implementation of these provisions."
"It is crucial that we make the area of justice and security in Europe a reality."
"The events of 11 September clearly demonstrate the need to conduct the fight against terrorism not only by military means, but also with judicial instruments."
"It is also worth pointing out that the European Union' s strategy for the beginning of the new millennium, the prevention and control of organised crime, already envisaged the possibility of a single legal area for extradition being created at European level."
"The events of 11 September only reinforced the urgency and the need for such a decision."
"This is why the Justice and Home Affairs Council took the decision, on 20 September, as part of its objective of combating terrorism, to replace the extradition process within the Union with a simple process of handing over the perpetrators of such crimes, which will render obsolete all laws on extradition currently in force, as has already been stated, and will involve the removal and replacement of the two conventions on extradition through the mutual recognition of court sentences and through simply handing over the perpetrator of the crime, thereby creating the single European area for extradition, the need for which we also wish to highlight."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission' s job has been greatly simplified in this debate, because it needs only to fully agree with the speech by Mr Marinho, whom I should like to congratulate on his excellent report."
"I simply wish to add that, in the view of the Commission, this initiative by Sweden is important and useful because it clarifies that the laws on extradition contained in the 1995 and 1996 conventions can be integrated into the Schengen acquis, an idea that has important consequences, particularly in light of the decisions that Mr Coelho has just mentioned and which were adopted by the Council of Justice and Home Affairs on 20 September."
"Completely replacing the rules on extradition within the European Union with the mechanism of the European search and arrest warrant will have an effect on the Schengen acquis and must also be reflected in the workings of the Schengen Convention."
"Furthermore, for this very reason, because our aim is to replace the 1995 and 1996 conventions, the issue must also be raised of extending the European search and arrest warrant to cover Norway and Iceland once the mandate is adopted by the Council, which I hope will happen on 6 and 7 December."
"This debate is, therefore, not pointless; it is one step forwards, one step on the path that we hope will lead to approval by the Council of Justice and Home Affairs of the European search and arrest warrant, in order to consolidate the area of freedom, security and justice in the field of protecting fundamental rights and of combating transnational organised crime, especially terrorism."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at noon."
"Electronic communications (processing of personal data and protection of privacy)"
"The next item is the debate on the second report (A5-0374/2001) by Mr Cappato, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector."
"Here we are again, Mr President, and the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs is still voting on terrorism. Never mind."
"Second attempt: privacy in the electronic communications sector."
"I seem to remember that, last time, this House failed in its attempt to adopt a majority position because the two proposals made on the issue of unsolicited commercial e-mails - the proposal for compulsory European opt-in and the proposal allowing Member States the freedom to choose whether to opt in or opt out - as well as a joint proposal presented to the Members, too late in my view, cancelled each other out."
"The three proposals, therefore, cancelled each other out."
"Now, however, I feel that Parliament is, at last, ready to take a decision on this point, since the position of the Parliamentary Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights leaving the Member States the freedom to choose and the position of the Commission, compulsory European opt-in, have both been tempered, so to speak, and have become more reconciled in that the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights has taken into consideration the concerns relating to voice mail, in particular, and, on the other hand, the position advocating the introduction opting in, making an initial binding choice, at European level has taken into consideration the need to communicate with existing clients of a particular company or business."
"I hope that the Members and the groups, in particular, will be able to decide between these two alternatives without getting confused at the last minute."
"Parliament will have the opportunity to choose between these two alternatives."
"In my opinion, and I would like to make this quite clear, there is not enough information or evidence showing that the countries operating the opt-in system are better equipped to fight spamming."
"Internet spamming is illegal in any case, because it is already illegal to collect addresses without authorisation, it is already illegal to use them without authorisation, it is already illegal to send messages without clearly specifying the sender and it is already illegal to send messages without making it possible for the recipients to delete their details easily from the lists."
"On the other hand, making opting in compulsory is not without risks either, in terms, for example, of freedom of communication."
"It is no accident that the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights has been cautious on this matter."
"There are, in fact, groups of non-governmental organisations which have expressed their concern at the possibility, for example, of Internet campaigns being used to raise funds."
"I feel that this debate, this legislation, has now already been made obsolete by technology and practical facts."
"It appears that consumers now already have the facility to choose, themselves, individually, between an opt-in or opt-out system, without having to contact the sender of the message before deleting their details from the lists but simply placing the address of the sender in question on a black list so that they no longer have to receive messages from that sender."
"However, in view of the fact that six years have passed since the adoption of the General Data Protection Directive and many of the Member States have still not ratified it, that four years have passed since the adoption of the directive to be amended by this proposal for a directive and that many of the Member States have not even applied the ' 97 directive, it is reasonable to predict, given these time frames, that this legislation will also take who knows, maybe three, four or five years to enter into force."
"If, in three, four or five years' time, consumers and users really feel the need to be protected against unsolicited commercial e-mails, the market and technology will make the systems already available today even more simple."
"It would be a shame, however, if, after displaying this great, understandable concern about the nuisance caused by unsolicited commercial e-mails, we prepared, on the other hand, to give national police authorities full access to our personal data whenever they want it."
"This is not purely a problem of this directive: it is a more general political problem."
"I fear that this is the direction in which we are heading and that the citizens' greatest privacy concerns are not caused by the prospect of receiving a few more or less unsolicited commercial e-mails."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have already voted once on this report."
"Now, at second reading stage, all we have to do is find a solution to the opt-in/opt-out problem."
"I will therefore be speaking only about that."
"Looking at the various proposals currently before Parliament reveals, in my opinion, that they are different kinds of opt-out proposals."
"Only the Commission's document would mean a real opting-in."
"This means, then, that only the Commission's proposal would guarantee that citizens would themselves be able to say that they wanted 'spamming' , that is to say, to receive electronic advertising, or that they wanted to have the option of consistently refusing it."
"All other options, that is, the various proposed opt-outs, do not, in my judgment, guarantee this."
"So I cannot be greatly satisfied with what is offered here as a compromise, and I believe that, to live up to the title of this proposal, a text with some bearing on data protection would have to be passed, in which case you have no option but to take the Commission's line, support this proposal, and reject the other proposals that have been submitted to Parliament."
"Nevertheless, I am in fundamental agreement with much of this report and find many of the points addressed in it sensible."
"But that was voted on at the last session."
"Now, it is just about the opting out and opting in."
"I think that, if we are talking in terms of data protection, we have to support the Commission's proposal."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow we will be voting on the Cappato report for the second time."
"Our positions have moved closer, without, however, becoming identical."
"So the rapporteur has taken misgivings on the left of this House into account, in that the consumer's consent will in future be required for the sending of SMS advertising."
"The Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has accepted by a substantial majority the so-called soft opt-out compromise supported by the rapporteur."
"This proposal alone defends the interests of consumers without doing away with European jobs on a massive scale."
"Why?"
"If Parliament were to generally prohibit business-to-customer advertising from the outset, as Mrs Paciotti's proposal would have it, businesses would simply send their advertising material into the European Union from the USA or other third States."
"The European consumer would have gained nothing, absolutely nothing, and the only effect would be to weaken the European e-business market."
"We therefore want to let those states that at present have an opt-out system retain it, keep an eye on developments and come to a new decision after two years."
"At the same time, the Cappato proposal takes three steps to protect the consumer."
"First, the consumer can put his name on what is termed a 'Robinson list' , so that advertising material may not generally be sent to him."
"Secondly, the consumer can, simply and without charge, indicate his wish not to receive e-mail advertising from specific companies."
"Thirdly, e-mail advertising will be easily recognisable as such in the inbox and will be able to be deleted simply and without cost."
"This last option is already available from providers such as AOL - I am sure Mr van Velzen is about to point that out - but this does not put AOL in a monopolistic position."
"Such an assertion is complete nonsense, as anyone can already download from the Internet a spam recognition program of this sort, no matter what Internet Service Provider he has a contract with for everything else."
"By the way, AOL was itself opposed to such a regulation."
"So I would ask you to support Mr Cappato's proposed compromise by a significant majority."
"Mr President, the return of this file to committee has certainly made the positions clearer, but I feel it has not improved the result: it fact it has, to some extent, had quite the opposite effect."
"Indeed, last time it voted, the European Parliament had the wisdom to accept the Commission' s proposal at least on the point relating to electronic directories, thereby ensuring that each of us is free to choose whether to be included in a public directory."
"Thus, the decision, which I consider to be a mistake and damaging not just in terms of freedom but of the very development of electronic commerce as well, to allow the sending of unwanted messages while leaving recipients the option to complain and request not to be sent any more, appeared to be less harmful too."
"By refusing the proposal for opting into public directories for everybody, without even making an exception for mobile phones, we are all placing ourselves at the mercy of all kinds of annoying petitioners and solicitors."
"We do not even have the protection that once existed in the days when there were only fixed telephones and printed directories."
"In those days, we could protect ourselves effectively by becoming ex-directory or changing our telephone numbers."
"Nowadays, when every public directory ends up on the Internet, we have no way of protecting ourselves."
"We can ask for our phone number or e-mail address to be deleted but it is no use!"
"By now, it is in the hands of users and parties who cannot be traced."
"Therefore, deciding to amend Article 12 of the directive would really appear not to benefit us in terms of freedom and, quite frankly, I fail to understand how we can give freedom of advertising precedence over individual freedoms."
"As far as unsolicited messages, as mentioned in Article 13 of the directive, are concerned, giving the Member States the choice takes away the usefulness of the directive itself in view of the need for harmonisation."
"Quite frankly, I cannot believe that all this will benefit electronic commerce."
"In fact, I feel that, as well as people such as our rapporteur, who is expert at using electronic tools, there are also still many, many citizens like myself who have little aptitude for such tools and are therefore concerned."
"To be honest, I can promise you that I will not be sending requests to any businesses and I will not open any messages for fear that what currently happens to me will continue, even though I am protected in my country, namely that my provider, no less, which has of necessity to know my address, constantly sends me unwanted communications and so, alas, does an airline which I once made the mistake of emailing."
"I therefore feel that, until I am protected - I am speaking on my own behalf but there are also many other people, older people like myself or people who have less expertise than many young people - I will do without electronic commerce, because it is not something in which I have confidence."
"The idea of being in a directory which is accessible throughout the entire Internet, of receiving messages and then requesting that they be deleted, of having to open them first, of having to try and understand these tools, does not inspire me with confidence."
"It may be that as electronic commerce develops, it will provide greater protection, but it does need to develop first."
"We must start by allowing electronic commerce to develop, but in order to do so we need to have confidence in it, and this proposal does not inspire that confidence."
"Mr President, it is not often that I completely agree with my colleague in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, Mr von Boetticher, but this time I agree with him that we need a national choice regime to allow opt-out on e-mails and I am speaking against the socialist amendments."
"There is one great myth that has gripped the Left and that is that spam is the same as unsolicited e-mail."
"I am afraid to say, Commissioner, that the Commission is at the root of this confusion."
"In your original proposal you said that spam equals unsolicited e-mails."
"It is not true."
"I am afraid the spammers who are already breaking the law are going to carry on breaking the law."
"Mrs Paciotti, you will continue to get spam!"
"I support the opt-out on two grounds."
"The first is that opt-in will unjustifiably harm both business and charities."
"Big American firms can afford TV advertising, press, billboard and so on. We are going to damage small- and medium-sized European firms for whom commercial e-mail provides a legitimate way into e-commerce."
"It is going to put them at a disadvantage."
"It is going to put charities at a disadvantage and studies show that people do not mind receiving them."
"They will not opt out even if they could."
"But of course it is human nature not to opt in to get them."
"There is also a misunderstanding about the civil liberties implications."
"Under opt-out, it is very easy to show that you have opted out and reputable senders have no interest in ignoring your request because they will just irritate you."
"Opt-in is superficially pro-consumer, but you would have to prove that you never opted in, which is actually more difficult."
"Finally, under an opt-in regime, people might opt to receive mailings from organisations that could be embarrassing for them, such as gay organisations when they did not wish to come out, or they could be open to malicious abuse."
"If they opted in to get mailings from subversive political movements they could find themselves attracting unwarranted surveillance from the police, for instance."
"The Left has got it wrong and for once Mr von Boetticher is right."
"Mr President, although in my view, national legislation is preferable to European legislation in most cases, this is different in this report."
"In the case of direct marketing by e-mail, this is clearly a matter with cross-border implications."
"I do not call for a complete ban on direct marketing by e-mail, but it is of the utmost importance for consumers to be given the choice beforehand whether they want to deal with this kind of direct marketing and for them to grant their approval or not, as the case may be."
"After all, that saves them a great deal of time, money and bother."
"Rapporteur Cappato suggests leaving the choice of opting in or out to the Member States."
"However, that would produce an incoherent European policy."
"A Member State that has chosen in favour of opting in will experience many difficulties in countering unwanted e-mails, if Member States that have chosen in favour of opting out do permit them."
"If European policy is divided and fragmented, the chances of establishing international agreements concerning unwanted e-mails are as good as non-existent."
"The problem is that businesses can easily side-step European rules from countries outside the European Union."
"This should not stop us from drafting legislation at European level."
"It is preferable to look for practical solutions to these problems and to work on international agreements."
"In that way, you and I will not be faced with e-mails from businesses which we do not need at all."
"Mr President, allow me to say straight away that although I represent a minority position, I am very proud of it."
"I have the 'Automatiseringsgids' of a famous Dutch newspaper, in front of me."
"On behalf of all my fellow MEPs who want to learn from technology neutrality, it might be useful to read out a few quotes from it."
"NTT DoCoMo earmarks USD 8.2 million to control unsolicited e-mails on mobile phones."
"The e-mail addresses of NTT DoCoMo mobile phones are based on the phones' telephone numbers."
"That enables all kinds of advertising agencies and dating agencies to advertise their services by sending messages to randomly generated numbers."
"The article also states that in Japan, the receiver of the text message contributes towards the cost of sending it."
"This might be food for thought for all those people who claim that the proposal of Amendment No 35 by Mr Cappato is technology-neutral."
"It clearly is not, for as soon as one is faced with UMTS, the difference between e-mail and SMS fades into the background, with all the consequences that this entails."
"That is why it is much preferable to talk about electronic communications, as is done in Amendment No 44."
"That is, in fact, the final step which rapporteur Cappato should have taken in order to put an excellent proposal before us."
"Let us be very aware that citizens are not all computer-illiterate."
"Despite this, they are saddled with most problems."
"If we were to adopt the proposal of Amendment No 35 by Mr Cappato to change e-mail services of this kind, the entire computer system would need to be changed."
"Indeed, we would then need to change over from the POP 3 system, which nearly everyone in Europe has, to the e-map system which is offered by only one American provider."
"However, if that were the case, the Commissioner would immediately receive a complaint about the lack of competition in Europe."
"That is another reason why I believe it should not be done."
"I therefore propose approving the Cappato report but also improving on it further by voting in favour of Amendment No 44 instead of Amendment No 35."
"Mr President, unusually for me I can stand here and say that virtually everything has been said."
"I agree with Mr von Boetticher and Mr Cappato and especially with Baroness Ludford."
"We are all members of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs; we have adopted a position and we have not rushed into it just because we have been bullied and lobbied on the Internet and via the fax machines that are in all our offices."
"We have to be very careful about legislating on the hoof."
"I have to say to the Commission that what it is proposing is wrong and hurried."
"In 2003 we will have a very good opportunity, in the e-commerce directive, to gather the information and the wisdom obtained from those Member States which have chosen either to opt in or to opt out."
"We must only propose and adopt legislation on the basis of good counsel and good experience."
"We must never underestimate the civil liberties implications to which Baroness Ludford has rightly alerted this House."
"At this time, when we perhaps are being a little over-assertive with some of the legislation we are bringing forward, I do not want anyone to have to confirm why they have opted to receive, for instance, Ammunition Weekly or why they have chosen to get some information from Amnesty International."
"The Internet has freed people from dictatorships and oppressors, and yet here we are introducing a kind of censorship by the back door."
"It is wrong and ill-informed."
"The Commissioner may shake his head and smile, but does he want to have to explain to a government agency or some other agency why he has chosen to opt in?"
"That is not freedom: that is being answerable for using a service that is intended to free you."
"On the issue of the right of privacy: we all have the right of privacy, but that right cannot be imposed on individuals."
"Individuals choose the right of privacy and then legislation backs it up."
"On the matter of unsolicited commercial e-mail: not all UCE is spam."
"Here again the Commission has played right into the hands of those who want to drive jobs out of the EU and who pretend that, just because the EU is imposing a ban on sending UCEs within its territory, such a ban will be respected by people in Japan, the Philippines, the USA or anywhere else."
"Finally, on spamming, I myself have been spammed."
"My name has been put on various lists and the spam comes in."
"That has been done by individuals who have opted me in to the lists held by the spammers."
"I have a very good option: I have a filter, I have a delete button."
"We must encourage people to use the technology and stop being their nannies."
"Please support the Cappato report, as amended."
"Mr President, tonight British Members from three different political parties and other colleagues are going to be in agreement, which is a rare occurrence."
"I am not a member of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, but I particularly want to commend Mr Cappato and colleagues here tonight for their courageous stand in amending the Commission's original proposal."
"I was sorry that we did not uphold all of Mr Cappato's report last time."
"This compromise has all the hallmarks of a compromise."
"In other words it is not terribly satisfactory but at least it is better than the original proposal from the Commission, and the amendment by the Socialist Group which I hope will not be supported tomorrow."
"We have to consider this essentially a transitional piece of work."
"I think everyone here tonight is working on legislation in the electronic age."
"I have worked on the e-commerce directive, the copyright directive and we are working on the electronic communications bills."
"What is quite clear is the immense pace and change of technology and the reconstruction of markets that is going on all the time."
"As a number of colleagues have said tonight, the world of electronic communications is offering immense benefits to the citizens, whether it is in their own personal access to charities or political parties or in the marketplace."
"What some colleagues want to do, is to shut that down."
"Clearly we cannot do that because it operates on a global level."
"That is where the spam is coming from."
"So we have promised something to our citizens we cannot deliver."
"Clearly we have to work towards a global solution that will be driven by technology."
"We want a global format that will allow people to tag their e-mail messages by sender and by subject."
"We can have the technology to give people complete control."
"If we adopt this proposal and pass this amendment, we will be walking away from the opportunity to create the right environment so that people can really benefit from the immense power of the new communications world."
"The Commission has already expressed its position on the amendments that were adopted on 6 September."
"I am tempted to go back to that debate, but I want to be brief and concentrate on the essential question about unsolicited e-mail."
"I would just like to point out that the Commission cannot support Amendments Nos 16, 25 and 34 that were rejected by Parliament on 6 September and are now resubmitted to the vote."
"The Commission can support the new Amendment No 43 on itemised bills."
"I will now focus on what has turned out to be the single most important topic in the debate on the proposed directive, namely unsolicited e-mail."
"This House has been discussing the question of opting in or opting out for several years now and the result of the vote on 6 September showed how difficult it still is to find a compromise solution that is acceptable to a broad majority."
"However we cannot hesitate for much longer, we need to decide."
"We have not hurried this decision."
"There has been huge public international debate with industry, with scientists, with lawyers."
"I have myself participated in intensive debates in the United States and in Europe on this issue."
"I strongly disagree that asking a person whether they wish to opt in before you can bill them is a restriction on civil liberties."
"That is completely illogical."
"We can disagree on the details, but if people are asked to pay, they should have a choice beforehand, not afterwards."
"We should no longer be thinking mainly about messages arriving at a PC on our desk."
"We should be thinking about the future."
"Technology is changing rapidly."
"The wireless Internet will be different from the Internet available only on desktops."
"The positive point about the proposal made by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms in Amendment No 33 is that it recognises that unsolicited commercial messages to mobile phones are a real problem which can only be addressed by a harmonised opt-in approach."
"I fully agree."
"However, the flaw in that proposal is that it is based on the assumption that a mobile terminal can only receive SMS messages."
"Unfortunately that is no longer true."
"You can already receive e-mail messages on mobile devices which are connected to the Internet."
"If you want to test that I can give you good examples."
"And with convergence it is very clear that SMS will certainly merge with other electronic messaging systems."
"The sender cannot know whether a message will be received on a mobile or fixed terminal because of the convergence."
"That is a technological fact."
"Banning unsolicited commercial SMS messages while allowing unsolicited electronic messages based on other technologies is therefore not a workable solution."
"Another problem I have with Amendment No 35 is the technologically biased approach in paragraph 4. This paragraph apparently tries to address the problem of cost for users but the solution proposed is not a good one."
"European ISPs tell us that the technology of viewing the subject line before downloading a message is not compatible with the majority of systems used in Europe today."
"It would require substantial investment; it would be costly for the industry to introduce this feature and this does not seem justified when it is only a halfway solution."
"In short, apart from not being compatible with the single market, Amendment No 35 does not meet the need for technology-neutral and future-proof legislation."
"Amendment No 44, on the other hand represents a technology-neutral compromise solution and has the merit of being a fully harmonised EU approach to unsolicited commercial e-mail."
"In paragraph 2 of this amendment a rather substantial exemption from the opt-in principle is made for e-mail addresses obtained within existing customer relationships."
"Here an opt-out approach would continue to be allowed, although this will mean an important concession as compared with the original Commission proposal."
"The exception can be justified because in the context of an existing customer relationship, companies have a lot to lose and are more likely to use marketing instruments with consideration."
"We should look at the future challenges. It is interesting to see what is happening in Japan today, where the wireless Internet has already taken off successfully."
"Nevertheless, the operator is facing a serious problem."
"It estimates that 85% of the 950 million messages sent daily to mobile devices are unsolicited commercial messages to mobile numbers chosen at random."
"This is causing a huge problem for network capacity, especially since most of these messages are addressed incorrectly and cannot be delivered."
"Moreover, it greatly annoys users who have to work their way through great quantities of unwanted commercial messages."
"The cost of purging the system of junk mail is estimated to be more than USD 8.2 million."
"So if we want to create a positive environment for the development of electronic commerce and third generation mobile services, now is the time to make sure that the uptake of wireless Internet services is not hampered by huge amounts of junk mail which the consumer is paying for against his will."
"Valuable capacity within networks and in battery-dependent mobile terminals must be available for communications, messages and services that users really want to receive."
"Amendment No 44 is most likely to achieve that purpose."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"European films"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0351/2001) by Mr Vander Taelen, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on achieving better circulation of European films in the internal market and the candidate countries."
"Mr President, I rise to speak in place of Ruth Hieronymi, who actually should have been speaking, but is unfortunately unwell."
"I am very glad to be able to do so, and congratulate the rapporteur."
"It is not that often that we have somebody speaking here who is as knowledgeable about his subject as is Mr Vander Taelen, who is a film-maker himself."
"So, well done, my dear Mr Vander Taelen."
"I think your report really does provide much needed impetus."
"As you said, the market share of European films in the cinemas of the European Union is at an historic low point of only 22.5%."
"The dominance of the American film industry is also reflected in the grossly excessive trade deficit of EUR 6.8 billion."
"The situation in the acceding countries is even more dramatic."
"There is another problem, apart from the clear dominance of films from the USA, which we must not draw a veil over."
"We often talk in this House of our desire to promote European films, but many are thinking only of their own national film industry and not of their neighbour's, whose films, European films, are not seen in neighbouring regions often enough."
"The Commission and the Council as well, must, as a matter of urgency, at last produce a plan to make the European film industry competitive."
"This is also a sector in which there is money to be made, as the Americans show us."
"Perhaps the powers-that-be will eventually wake up and do more here."
"The central deficits are in the distribution and marketing of our films and, of course, the industry is chronically undercapitalised."
"I am therefore very glad that we, Parliament, Commission and Council together, have, in the Media-Plus programme above all, got to grips with the twin areas of marketing and distribution and are endeavouring to give help."
"I am, of course, also glad that, at the Commissioner's suggestion, the European Investment Bank is also willing to do something about this by making risk capital available for the realisation of audiovisual projects."
"I believe, then, that we have given a lot of things a push in this area, but can do still more."
"I also find it a good thing that we are achieving tax breaks at the level of the Member States, and that we can do something to enable filmmakers from one country to get resources and help from another."
"That, then, is possible."
"I think this could also be used in the framework of the i2i initiative to promote investment in the infrastructure of independent cinemas, as we propose in this report."
"I believe that the extension of cinemas in economically weaker regions in the framework of the European Structural Fund can be helpful."
"There is a lot more that I could say."
"I am not entirely in agreement with item 7, in which the call is made for television broadcasters to be obliged to reserve a certain proportion of transmission time for foreign films."
"That, of course, meets with great resistance from the broadcasters."
"We will discuss that when examining the 'Television without Frontiers' directive and will perhaps find a way through."
"Again, congratulations!"
"Mr President, I have to admit that I envy Mr Vander Taelen; not only does his report contain very meaningful conclusions, thanks to his remarkable knowledge of the film industry, but he also has tremendous vision and has tabled very specific proposals as to what we should do, what policy we should apply in connection with European films."
"I think that this is an exemplary report in which the economy and culture are perceived in a highly coherent manner, to the benefit of both."
"The committee naturally agreed that European films are an educational and cultural vehicle and have a huge impact on the social and aesthetic values of the European public."
"I see it as a noble industry which has nourished generations of cinema goers and to which we have no hesitation in entrusting our children so that they can learn about the past and acquire a penetrating and analytical perception of the society in which we live and intuition about what will happen in the future."
"We love European films; we each of us in our own countries love the national films which have marked out our lives, but we all agree that American films are stealing the show."
"Consequently, we need to bring about a reversal, to ensure that European films take the place they deserve, and this will only happen if we implement a series of measures, as proposed in the report, all of which, I think, are essential if we really want European films to live up to our expectations in the next decade."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me first of all to thank Mr Vander Taelen for his sterling report."
"I fully subscribe to his view that it is sheer madness to think that we produce excellent films in Europe, while only 22% of those end up in cinemas, not to mention the percentage of non-national films that are being shown in the Member States, despite the fact that for people of all ages, film is the ideal medium to get to know each other' s culture."
"Why is it that European film attracts such a small audience, while the cinema-viewing public is on the increase?"
"It seems appropriate to me to commission the European Audiovisual Observatory to carry out an in-depth study into the motives of the film public and its film choices."
"Based on this, it would then be possible to use a programme such as Media Plus to support the distribution of the European film in a more focused and effective manner."
"In addition, the other media play an important role in the promotion of European film, of course."
"Radio and television may devote attention to it, but television in particular could do so in a more structured way by means of a fixed amount, or quota, in other words, of transmission time."
"An alternative example might be specific European channels which specialise in one particular field, for example, a pan-European children' s channel which broadcasts high-quality European children' s programmes and children' s films."
"Unfortunately, I am not of the same mind as Mr Vander Taelen when he states that it should be compulsory for TV channels to invest a proportion of their turnover in the film industry."
"As a Liberal, and also on behalf of my group, that is excessive intervention from the powers that be."
"As has been stated before, it seems to me that the European Investment Bank has a role to play in this."
"One of the areas in which investments must be made is e-cinema."
"Among other things, it will enable producers to make different language versions of their films in a more straight-forward manner, which will certainly benefit children' s films, for example."
"After all, although we insist on a sound command of languages here in this House, the supply of adapted language versions would be another excellent way for the citizens of a Member State to get to know the culture of their European fellow citizens."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say that the report by Mr Vander Taelen has come just when it is needed."
"It reminds me of when we arrived in Parliament two and a half years ago."
"I realised that, in the space of two and a half years, by the autumn of 2001, we have gained the commitment of the European Investment Bank, the balance proposed by the Commission for state aid, the recognition of state aid, and now the report by Mr Vander Taelen is telling us that we must circulate films."
"That is what I mean when I say it has come just when it is needed."
"It has come just at the right moment to give great support to the audiovisual industry and to the cinema tradition, which we must highlight and which I see as a new development."
"I would like us to get to grips with this, because we speak a great deal about cultural diversity, but tell me, please, what is cultural diversity if you do not circulate works?"
"If cultural diversity means to strengthen each specific characteristic within another specific characteristic, we will not gain anything in terms of diversity, in the way that we want to here in Europe."
"It is therefore essential and necessary to circulate films."
"In order to illustrate how important this is, I would first of all like to thank Mr Vander Taelen, and also to express my regret that one of his amendments, and not everyone agrees on this, since it was not reviewed by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, that one of his amendments, proposing that coercive measures be used to ensure the circulation of films, was not adopted."
"We therefore reached an agreement on undertaking a feasibility study into this circulation."
"That is all very well, it sounds good."
"I regret that we did not choose a better way."
"And I would like to stress two other aspects of this report."
"Firstly, in today' s Europe, we like to say that we have European works."
"That is wonderful."
"We have criteria to define European works, in terms of production, but we now know that it is film heritage which will also define and which defines European works."
"I therefore welcome the fact that the rapporteur has highlighted the issue of building up our heritage."
"We know that the Commission hopes to give us a European Cinematic Heritage Foundation."
"We also know that the Council of Europe recently stressed the importance of building up our heritage."
"We know very well that this cannot merely be achieved by conserving European films, but, as several of my fellow Members have already said, this comes from providing education on the diversity of European works and on what European works represent for future generations."
"I therefore attach great importance to the issue of heritage."
"To sum up, I would like to stress one important point, that of new technologies."
"New technologies are instruments for the circulation of many things, such as information, knowledge, and cinema."
"New technologies have their own linguistic facilities which could be of valuable help in circulating European films."
"I shall therefore stress the opportunities that this report could provide in this area."
"I have emphasised this issue in my report on the Sixth Framework Programme that we will be voting on in a few days."
"However, I believe that new technologies, research into new technologies and digitalisation are all important."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent work."
"This document gives a clear picture of the difficulties European cinema has been striving painfully to overcome for many years now."
"I would like to focus briefly on two of the many points contained in the motion for a resolution which caught my attention."
"Firstly, I fully support the call for the funds made available to the film-making industry to be increased. In effect, considering that the cinema has become an important part of our cultural heritage - cinemas have been more popular than bookshops for many years now in Europe - and given the high potential for employment in this sector, there is no doubt that greater Community financial aid would facilitate its development."
"And this is precisely one of the problematic areas."
"Without incentives and investment, there is no growth or impetus, and there is no quality either."
"Europe has been overrun with film productions which are foreign to our cultural identity and often of dubious quality for too long now."
"That is not to question the existence of the opportunity or rather the need for cinema to encourage awareness of diversities, of course, but I do feel that Europe needs to protect and encourage its own film heritage."
"If, in addition, we consider the competition which came from television during the 1970s, it is not hard to see why hundreds, thousands of cinemas have been closed for so long."
"Secondly, I fully support item 18, which refers explicitly to the restoration and protection of the European film heritage."
"We do indeed need to encourage public institutions, local authorities and cultural associations to search for old and short films and to restore film material, thus ensuring that they are preserved and are available to the public."
"There are very few film libraries in Europe which are worthy of that name and genuinely properly equipped and efficient."
"They often suffer from miserly public contributions from the governments of the Member States."
"Well then, the European Union cannot remain insensitive to this additional urgent need if we genuinely want to preserve the past heritage and guarantee the future of cinema."
"Mr President, I, too, would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this report."
"He sums up very clearly to what an extent the success of a product, film in this instance, is dependent on the promotion of sales through marketing and advertising."
"When American production companies set aside 30% of their budgets for marketing, it is not to be wondered at that European products lose in direct competition for customers, when they themselves use only 3 to 6% of their budgets for this purpose."
"It follows that European film producers must do more to market their products."
"We, as taxpayers, are also entitled to demand that they do so."
"One could envisage state support for follow-up projects being made dependent on the filmmakers' efforts at reaching their public."
"More subsidies cannot be the solution on their own."
"Too much money was spent in the past on films that never reached their public."
"Austria spends over EUR 30 million per annum on promoting films."
"Taking the number of cinema-goers into account, every ticket to see a film is subsidised to the tune of EUR 1 000."
"State promotion of film cannot have this as its objective."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to start by thanking not only the rapporteur for this initiative, as all of you have done, but also the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, which has backed his initiative so strongly."
"As you may know, the latest Europacinema conference began here in Strasbourg last weekend, and it is continuing through today and tomorrow."
"The final panel discussion will be taking place in our rooms tomorrow."
"There have been many discussions and many problems to resolve, such as: What is the problem, why is there no internal European market?"
"In discussing many specific problems, whether to do with nation-states or the subsidy issue, we came up against the same point over and over again, that the distribution system does not work."
"We have a European internal market, but it is not accepted that this product, film, can really circulate."
"It is at this hurdle that we fall."
"Now as always, there is a national logic to film promotion, which also applies to a film's success: if it was not a box-office success at home, it will not be an international one either."
"I have to agree with Mr Sichrovsky that an increase in subsidies would not help, but an increased subsidy from the country we both come from would help the market a bit."
"It would be wrong to demand that producers should take greater risks."
"There are no independent producers."
"First, we must promote this market economically, we must engage in business development, so that this market can emerge at all."
"Here, too, one of the demands the Culture Committee makes over and over again in many contexts would seem to be appropriate here."
"We must endeavour to make business development, whether it originates from large or small enterprises, tax-deductible."
"We will support this report not only for reasons of ideology, but also out of wholehearted conviction."
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank Mr Vander Taelen for the excellent work he has done and for his constructive approach to this report."
"Today, we find ourselves faced with a terrible paradox."
"Europe produces more films than the United States, and these are often of a very high quality, but the market share of European films has never been this low before, it stands at 22%, whereas films from the United States take 73.7% of the European market."
"Furthermore, European films secure only 26% of their box office takings from sources outside the country where they were produced."
"These are just some observations."
"This is a good report because it does not limit itself to providing an analysis of how things stand."
"It tackles the very reasons why the European film industry is weak, namely, its capacity for development and distribution."
"In order to render the European film industry more competitive, the rapporteur makes very specific proposals which, in my view, are excellent."
"Of course, and I agree with him, we must urgently adopt an ambitious multiannual plan to improve the competitiveness of the European film industry and to strengthen the transnational distribution structures for European films."
"We must develop research into digital film distribution and projection techniques; we must promote the creation of a European Heritage Foundation and perform a feasibility study of 'interconnecting' support funds of Member States so as to increase the sources of financing."
"Of course, when revising the 'Television Without Frontiers' Directive, we must ensure that we include a requirement for television broadcasters to invest a certain amount in the European film industry, and the obligation to promote and broadcast European films."
"This should also be an opportunity for Member States, which do not yet benefit from them, to consider the appropriate fiscal incentives."
"I therefore hope that the Commission, as well as the Council, understand the challenges we are faced with, and that they take appropriate action."
"Today, we are debating something that is not only a major challenge in terms of the economy, but also something that is an integral part of the European Union, in other words, culture, creation and identity."
"That is why this is so urgent."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like the House to know how pleased I am that the Committee which I have the honour of chairing has unanimously, and rightly so, adopted the detailed, comprehensive report of the rapporteur, Mr Vander Taelen."
"Without going back over aspects which have already been debated, I would point out here that the rapporteur has provided comprehensive proof, as I said before, that both a cultural problem and an organisational problem exist. The problems are related."
"I feel that the measure tabled by the committee and the decision the House makes tomorrow are so important as to warrant due reflection from the Commissioner and, indeed, a number of proposals and initiatives as well."
"As we have said before and will continue to say, there needs to be a substantial cultural element in the integration of Europe, and films play a major, fundamental role in both informing people about cultural diversities and providing authenticity, allowing the message of cinema to be disseminated in all the States."
"There is a need for more than just organisation."
"That is important and, in my opinion, the report certainly raises basic issues which will lead us to greater organisation and investment than in the past."
"What Mrs Sanders-ten Holte said just now is important."
"If European film production increases, the number of distribution channels will have to increase too."
"That is why the problems are related, and it is therefore our task, our responsibility, the responsibility of Parliament, especially, and of the Commission, in particular, and the Council, to achieve this."
"There is nothing we can do to change the current structure of the industry."
"When we debate television without frontiers, then we will be able to establish rights and clear guidelines; we will be able to require television companies to distribute, promote and commission European films, but it is imperative that, in cultural terms, we realise that we must make it quite clear that all the European countries must be able to benefit from films."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my colleague, Viviane Reding, was unable to join us for this debate because she is in Brussels at the Council meeting of sports ministers, but she asked me to pass on her thanks to Mr Vander Taelen for his excellent report."
"This initiative shows that the European Parliament is fully aware of the strategic importance, both economic and cultural, of the European film industry, but also of what hampers the circulation of films and other audiovisual works in the internal market and candidate countries, as several Members have pointed out."
"The European Commission, which fully supports the report' s objectives, welcomes its adoption."
"The Commission is also pleased that our two institutions share the same viewpoint regarding the need to pursue an ambitious European policy in order to make the European audiovisual industry more competitive."
"Several recent initiatives by the Commission in this area are proof of this common approach."
"As you are more than aware, the recent Commission communication on certain legal aspects related to cinematographic and other audiovisual works that my colleague, Viviane Reding, presented to the Council on 5 November, tackles the issues of the circulation of E-cinema, the tax regime applied to the industry, the protection of European audiovisual heritage, the classification of works and other problems affecting the circulation of films and other audiovisual works."
"The implementation of the measures set out in this communication, combined with the application of the MEDIA Plus programme (2001-2005) and the joint initiative undertaken by the Commission and the European Investment Bank, i2i Audiovisual, should help to significantly improve the situation of European films."
"If I may, Mr President, I would like to come back to some points of the motion for a resolution which has been submitted to you."
"With regard to the measures that are currently being undertaken, the second point of the motion for a resolution calls on the Commission to pursue a consistent Community policy on the film industry, particularly as regards the application of its competition policy."
"The above-mentioned communication provides the film industry with increased legal certainty by specifying, as part of a constructive and positive approach, the criteria used by the Commission when assessing national support schemes for the film sector under the Treaty' s rules on State funding."
"To date, all the national schemes reviewed on this basis have been accepted by the Commission."
"Item 5 of the motion for a resolution calls on the Commission, in implementing MEDIA Plus, to draw attention to the Europa Cinemas network of cinemas, and item 6 calls on the Commission to support the 'Shooting Stars' initiative of the organisation European Film Promotion."
"These projects are undeniably of value and have received Community support for several years as part of the MEDIA programme."
"However, it is important to point out that the actions under the MEDIA programme are subject to calls for proposals and to the principle of fair competition and project selection according to a transparent procedure."
"Item 7 of the motion for a resolution calls on the Commission, when revising the directive, to investigate the desirability and feasibility of imposing new quotas on broadcasters."
"The Commission has already launched, pursuant to Article 25(a) of the directive, an independent study to assess the impact of measures for promoting the production and distribution of European television programmes."
"This study will also assess, more specifically, the effectiveness of quotas laid down under the directive, compared to other support measures."
"Furthermore, at the beginning of 2002, the Commission will undertake a public consultation on this subject."
"It will urge all the parties concerned to submit written comments."
"The results of the various studies and of the public consultation will provide a significant contribution to the communication on the review of the directive and any proposals for amendments, which the Commission plans to submit to the Council and to the European Parliament towards the end of 2002."
"Item 33 of the motion for a resolution calls on the Commission to consider introducing specific European regulations in order to stimulate the development of the film industry in the candidate countries."
"This central concern is taken into account as part of the external action of the European audiovisual policy under the heading of enlargement."
"Candidate countries are therefore obliged to respect the 'acquis communautaire' where the audiovisual sector is concerned."
"As you know, this mainly concerns the 'Television Without Frontiers' Directive."
"In addition, they will be able to take part in the MEDIA programme as soon as they have reached a high degree of compatibility with the 'acquis communautaire' ."
"Furthermore, nine candidate countries were asked to take part in the MEDIA Plus programme."
"The aim is for these countries to participate from the beginning of 2002."
"Item 26 of the motion for a resolution calls on the Commission to perform a feasibility study of the possibility of 'interconnecting' the existing automatic support funds of the Member States and regions."
"It must be reiterated that an assessment was already carried out in 1998 in Birmingham, by the 'Club des Producteurs Européens' ."
"The working group associated with the Commission came to the following conclusion: the proposed mechanism would, in practice, exclude many Member States who have no automatic support system for production."
"As a result, the automatic support funds of the smaller countries would be drained by the more commercially successful countries, in other words, the main producing countries."
"Item 27 of the motion for a resolution calls on the Committee to perform a feasibility study of the possibility of setting up a European Promotion Fund."
"Council Decision No 2000/821/EC establishing the MEDIA Plus programme already, in its 'Promotion' section, lays down support for promotional activities in favour of European creation, in other words, approximately 8% of the budget."
"Lastly, the Commission welcomes the amendment, which was tabled in plenary by the rapporteur, to set up an implementing agency."
"The Commission will inform the rapporteur and Parliament about its proposal on this issue."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, these are the Commission' s comments on the report by Mr Vander Taelen, who I would again like to thank."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Protection of animals during transport"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0347/2001) by Mr Maat, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the Commission report on the experience acquired by Member States since the implementation of Council Directive 95/29/EC amending Directive 91/628/EEC concerning the protection of animals during transport."
"Mr President, I should also like to welcome Commissioner Byrne, who could play a significant role in this field."
"A great deal needs to be said about the implementation of Directive 95/29/EC and animal transport."
"The lack of adequate supervision, carriers who are slapdash at times and abuse during the export of animals for slaughter outside the EU give rise to much commotion."
"In addition, the unlimited transport of animals for slaughter by the EU has made a compelling contribution to the spread of animal diseases, including foot-and-mouth and swine fever."
"It is striking that the effects of this are more or less entirely shouldered by the animal farmers."
"Abuse during transport and the spreading of animal diseases directly impact on the image, and often the income, of animal farmers, while they are not to blame for these causes."
"Consequently, anyone who wants to adopt a pro-active stance in the fight against animal diseases such as foot-and-mouth and swine fever, anyone who is concerned about the difficult position European animal farmers are already in, or anyone who cares about animal welfare, will not put up with a culture of tolerance and chaotic rules for animal transport."
"The fact that Parliament has decided to present an initiative proposal to tighten these directives now sends a strong political signal to the Council and the Commission."
"After all, next month, the Council will be holding a conference on the European vaccination policy, and in this report, an initial proposal is made for effective prevention of infectious diseases."
"Additionally, the Commission will soon table proposals to tighten the rules for animal transport."
"This report also reflects Parliament' s great displeasure at the implementation of existing legislation by the Member States and the Commission' s lack of opportunity to notify Member States."
"This report mainly aims to identify the key conditions which sound legislation on animal transport must meet."
"First of all, there is supervision."
"The supervision of animal transport in the European Union must be tailored to European needs by taking the following measures. First of all, 15 EU inspectors should be appointed with the task of submitting annual reports to the Council, the Commission, but also the European Parliament, as well as the parliaments of the Member States."
"Secondly, adequate regulations must be put in place for sanctions, both financial and in terms of licences."
"The third point concerns the introduction of an adequate European licensing scheme for carriers of animals."
"I should like to make the following observations with regard to transport times. We propose to limit the duration of the transport of animals for slaughter and productive livestock to four hours, or 250 km, with a possible extension to eight hours, provided that the carrier is licensed and the animals can lie down and have a supply of fresh water."
"As for animals intended for breeding and sporting purposes, we suggest a transport duration of two 24-hour legs by specialist carriers, provided that the animals have a supply of fresh water and feed."
"With regard to possible exceptions, I should like to draw your attention to two problems."
"The Commission may grant exemption for areas with few or no slaughterhouses by increasing the said distances and durations by up to 50%."
"For small islands, but also for Ireland, and I wish to make a point of highlighting Ireland, transport by ship is subject to a separate arrangement."
"Furthermore, the said regions are disproportionately hit by tightened European legislation on food safety, and I would therefore suggest earmarking structural funds for those regions to invest in small, semi-mobile slaughterhouses."
"The export refunds for the export of live animals for slaughter should be stopped as soon as possible, but that is only possible if an international discussion is held about the transport of animals for slaughter and by adding this item to the agenda."
"With regard to the amendments, I should like to comment as follows. Together with the Liberal Group and the Socialist Group, I have tabled three amendments to enhance the report' s practical implementability."
"These concern Amendments Nos 4, 5 and 6, which deal, among other things, with temperature, but also a number of other practical points."
"I should like to express thanks to Mr Heinz Kindermann and Mr Neil Busk for their very constructive cooperation."
"As far as I am concerned, the report could also have been referred to as the Maat-Busk-Kindermann report."
"I assume that the Liberal Group will withdraw Amendment No 3 as it is identical to the joint amendment tabled by the PPE-DE, the PSE and the ELDR."
"The policy of tolerance and the feel-good factor surrounding the transport of animals must be brought to a halt."
"In the EU, literally millions of animals have been killed and destroyed in the last four years as a result of an explosive spreading of animal diseases including foot-and-mouth and swine fever."
"Abuse during animal transport and the shocking images of this are an indictment of European culture of which caring about animals and the countryside form an essential part."
"The sad truth is that in every single case, it is the animal farmer who ends up footing the bill at a time when meat prices are unacceptably low and consumer prices remain at an all-time high."
"Commission and Council, it is time for action, time to choose in favour of the quality of our animals and our countryside."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Environment Committee, I welcome Mr Maat's excellent report."
"It does not go as far as the Environment Committee would have wished, particularly in relation to the duration of travel - the Environment Committee would have preferred four hours - however, if eight hours is complied with, it will be a really welcome advance in animal welfare."
"This is the first realistic report on animal welfare, Mr Maat has done an excellent job and I congratulate him."
"My group supports this report."
"Although the report does not go far enough in relation to the eight hours, paragraph 1 is extremely important."
"The maximum journey time of eight hours for slaughter and for further fattening should be welcomed because animals were being transported long distances over long periods in completely unacceptable conditions."
"Another important paragraph is paragraph 20, which calls for an end to the payment of export refunds on the export of live animals to third countries for slaughter."
"This is long overdue."
"The vast majority of European taxpayers are against the idea of their taxes being used to fund something that they fundamentally disagree with."
"The onus is on the Commission to ensure that Member States comply with the rules."
"The Commission must take very strong action against any Member States which do not comply."
"They must be taken to court and fined."
"In relation to the reduced need for long transport, it is extremely important to promote local abattoirs and also the trade in meat."
"It makes much more economic sense to have a trade in meat than a trade in live animals, because jobs are then created within the EU."
"The same applies to Ireland: it could make a lot more exporting meat than live animals."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to start by expressing my thanks to Mr Maat."
"I think he has approached this subject in a very realistic way, many years of discussions on animal transport mean that, in my view, an emotional approach is no more use to us."
"Nobody, when talking about animal transport, means the kitten in the hand luggage on an aircraft, and nobody mentions the little dog on a lead on the Intercity train and certainly not the racehorse in its specialised horsebox on the motorway."
"No, in the Maat report we are discussing the well-being of animals on their way to be slaughtered."
"Now, I have been in this House for a very long time, and so it is to the Commissioner that I am speaking when I say this: On paper, or so it seems to me, we have produced variations on this theme for years, and we have been constantly demanding more."
"All the same, we are still repeatedly shocked by the often intolerable situations revealed in individual cases by the checks, which are far too few and far between."
"Better transport conditions are wanted not only, indeed, by campaigners against cruelty to animals, but also by producers and consumers."
"In reports and amendments, we demand expert staff, purpose-built vehicles with adequate space for the animals to lie down in, ventilation, supplies of food and water and, for animals for slaughter, journey times limited to a maximum of eight hours."
"The proposal to end the payment of export refunds for live animals is one which I find quite crucial and also particularly deserving of support."
"There are objections to this, amounting in the final analysis to this being an interference with the market."
"Even Jewish ritual slaughter is brought into the argument."
"I could smile a little at that, for even that is now possible in the EU."
"It would be better to transport the meat afterwards."
"Commissioner, I find that a person's weak spot is very often his or her wallet or purse."
"More inspection, more controls, high penalties and loss of the licence where offences are found to have been committed, these would bring about more effective improvements for us all."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report of the Committee on the Transport of Animals, which is under discussion this evening, has borne out what is repeatedly seen on television: the brutal way that animals are treated, the disregard of limits on journey times, the overloading of vehicles and many other breaches of current regulations on the transport of animals, none of which has been an infrequent occurrence."
"This situation is no longer tolerable, and the European public is right to demand speedy measures to remedy it."
"I must, though, say quite clearly that European regulations on the transport of animals, when correctly enforced, already guarantee a high degree of protection to animals."
"As the Committee highlights in its report, the fundamental problem is that the regulations currently in force are applied only very inadequately in most of the Member States."
"Quite apart from the difficulty of transposing the directive into national law, this is attributable above all to Member States' defective control procedures and the far too weak sanctions imposed when breaches are discovered."
"Criticism arising out of these problems should therefore be directed mainly at the Member States."
"In my opinion, the Community control policy needs a thorough re-think here, as comparable problems exist in other areas of veterinary control."
"I would like, though, to enlarge on two further points."
"The abolition of export refunds for animals for slaughter, contained in this resolution, was decided on by Parliament in the course of the 2002 Budget procedure and has long been demanded by Social Democrats."
"In the past, Parliament has already given financially preferential treatment to meat as opposed to livestock for slaughter in paying export refunds, in order to remove the economic incentive from the export of live animals."
"At present, then, only about one-half in export refund is paid for livestock in comparison with meat."
"Even that, though, is not yet enough, and export refunds for animals for slaughter should be reduced to zero."
"The other point I would like to make is that the proposal for a resolution calls for a maximum transport time of 8 hours for animals intended for slaughter, and that, too, is an old demand from the Social Democrats."
"There is to be no general maximum journey time, and prime consideration was given to the situation of remote regions and islands."
"Here, too, there will be limited exceptions to the rules on maximum journey time, which we greatly welcome."
"In conclusion, I would like, on behalf of the Social Democrat Group, to thank Mr Maat for the constructive work we have done together, and I believe it will continue in future."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I want to begin by thanking Mr Maat for his excellent cooperation in connection with this report."
"Partly in conjunction with Mr Kindermann, we have prepared quite a few amendments, and this has, in my view, turned out to be an excellent report."
"I should also like to thank the Commission which, without hiding anything, has clearly described how the Member States have implemented or, more to the point, failed at all to implement, the many decisions taken in 1991 and 1995."
"It is really frightening to see how European ministers sit and take joint decisions about something as important as animal welfare and the transport of animals under satisfactory conditions."
"They then travel home and totally forget what they have been involved in deciding, that is to say they do not transpose any of these decisions into national legislation."
"We could have well done without the huge number of hideous television pictures we have seen of animals suffering in a wide range of appalling situations."
"Lorries have been opened, to reveal dead animals inside, with other animals trampling upon them."
"That situation is simply unacceptable, and it must be brought to an end now."
"It is therefore time to put a stop to our traditional practices of many years in the EU whereby animals are transported from north to south and from east to west."
"There is no good reason for doing this."
"Animals suffer as a result, and the call must now go out for animals to be slaughtered at the nearest abattoir."
"Obviously, we are also obliged to transport animals for breeding purposes from areas which excel in producing such animals to areas which have a need for new animals of this kind."
"I therefore look forward to the Commission' s now tabling proposals for common regulations governing the transport of animals, and I repeat: these must not be minimum regulations, but common regulations governing the transport of animals."
"Mr President, I welcome this report and would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work."
"However, I would first of all like to highlight my concern that the current debate has consistently failed to acknowledge the failure of many Member States to implement existing Community legislation in this area."
"The latest Commission report, together with numerous mission reports, has highlighted that there is a serious disregard of animal welfare in some countries."
"The Commission must show a much greater willingness to initiate infringement proceedings against Member States which fail to enforce this directive properly."
"With respect to journey times, I hope the Commission will follow the recommendations of their scientific advisory committees and propose workable limits that allow businesses to function effectively, whilst maintaining a high standard of animal welfare."
"I will be supporting the 8-hour or 500-kilometre limit, and strongly support the view that the climate conditions of each Member State should also be taken into consideration."
"However, in areas where these journey times are unrealistic, a temporary dispensation to the maximum 8-hour travelling time should be granted where there are no slaughterhouses within a radius of 500 kilometres."
"I am thinking particularly, in the UK, of the islands of Western Scotland, and of other parts of the European Union that are affected adversely in that regard."
"Although putting a limit on journey times is an important step forward, the treatment of animals en route, vehicle ventilation, overcrowding, and the definition of space and temperature requirements during transport etc. are equally important issues."
"The recent foot-and-mouth crisis provided evidence enough that the unnecessary long-distance transport of animals was a factor in the quick spread of that disease."
"I look forward to the Commission's policy plan scheduled for 1 January 2003 aimed at the regionalisation of meat production chains, so as to limit the long-distance transport of live animals in future."
"Mr President, the report on the protection of animals during transport has evoked great public interest."
"Various associations, but above all individual citizens, have watched attentively to see what steps, if any, Parliament will take to prohibit intolerable conditions in the transport of animals."
"The report's concern is with the use of legislation to prevent animals in transit from being endangered or brought to a cruel demise."
"Nothing, though, must be left to chance, but there must rather be firm negotiations when the report is elaborated."
"Among the European rural model's special features, the expectations of society are a decisive element."
"The BSE crisis and the consequences of the destruction of animals due to the foot-and-mouth epidemic have put a definite question mark against what had so far been achieved."
"An estimated 250 million farm animals a year are transported across the EU."
"The people involved have for years vigorously disputed how necessary or pointless this is."
"This basic regulation itself contains numerous practical and legal provisions on the transport of animals."
"It is clear that national authorities do not act in the same way everywhere, which shows how weak the animal protection clause really is."
"There is a lack of seriousness, transparency and honesty in this area."
"If, for example, hares living wild in Poland are caught with nets and transported into the EU in containers that are torment to them, just so that people can shoot them for sport as a leisure pursuit, that has nothing to do with sport and even less with the protection of animals."
"I would be happy if the Commissioner were able to say that it does not."
"At this particular stage of negotiations on the enlargement of Europe, this incident bodes ill for well-regulated agronomy as the basis for protecting Europe's environment and species."
"The report before us opts, in this sense, for cooperation rather than confrontation between agriculture and animal protection."
"Mr President, animal transport has been put in a bad light by the many infringements which carriers have committed."
"These infringements are an indication that, in addition to transport rules, additional attention must be devoted to supervising compliance with these rules."
"In the past year, we have had to face yet another disastrous outcome of animal transport, namely the spread of animal diseases."
"One now notorious incident of the transport of calves across different Member States cost the lives of 265 000 animals."
"One of the conclusions we are drawing from the foot-and-mouth crisis is that agriculture must focus on the regionalisation of production and that the transport of live animals must come to an end."
"With this in mind, I give my wholehearted support to the report by Mr Maat."
"However, it is beyond me why in his amendments, he wishes to scrap the maximum and minimum temperature requirements inside the means of transport on the strength of the futile argument that everything is fine as long as the truck has mechanical ventilation."
"Animal protection groupings will certainly find it difficult to accept this argument."
"My amendments have the same objective as those by Mr Maat, except that mine still include the temperature requirements."
"I support the call to end the payment of export refunds in respect of live animals for slaughter."
"The evasion of European transport and slaughter rules by having animals slaughtered outside the Union under conditions which would be banned in Europe does injustice to the European farmers."
"The Commission would like to encourage farmers to produce quality products."
"Animal welfare forms an essential part of this quality which extends from farm to fork."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is a report on a Commission report on the implementation of the directive concerning the protection of animals during transport."
"Commissioner, once more in this Parliament we are giving in to the temptation to tell the Commission exactly what it should be presenting us with, in great detail, in the next proposals for a directive they submit to us, to the extent that we are practically doing their job for them."
"The rapporteur, Mr Maat, has done a great piece of work."
"I trust that the Commission and the Council will take this into account."
"Animals must be transported in conditions that are reasonably good; legislation should dictate standards to ensure that this is the case, and the authorities should verify compliance with these standards."
"Having said this, I would like to share two thoughts with you: firstly, that conditions should be the same for both long- and short-distance transportation."
"We should not demonise the long-distance transportation of animals, because that would lead to distorted competition in the internal market."
"And secondly, transportation conditions should also be the same for all animals that are transported, in cases where animals are being taken to the abattoir as in cases where animals are transported to be reared close to, or far away from, their place of birth, or in order to take part in a competition."
"These issues are not raised in the report, and I, Commissioner, would personally like to see them included in the next Commission proposals."
"On the other hand, I would like to applaud and thank the rapporteur, who put forward an amendment on behalf of my group to delete the references made to temperatures, for it makes no sense to talk about temperatures without also referring to the corresponding relative humidity."
"Additionally, from Lapland to the Canary Islands, Europe is a very large continent with a very diverse climate, population density and socio-economic conditions."
"Finally, I would like to draw your attention to the importance of transportation in the propagation of epizootic diseases."
"This is never related to the length of the journey, but we should be absolutely rigid with regard to standards and compliance with them."
"For example, the classical swine fever we had in Spain in 1997 was caused by piglets travelling from Holland."
"This can and should be avoided."
"Mr President, Mr Maat' s report is excellent and summarises the legitimate and powerful criticism that has to be directed, in the first place, against the Council of Ministers and the Member States."
"It is disgraceful that those of us in a civilised and cultivated part of the world, calling itself Europe, should treat animals in the way we do."
"Moreover, no one can convince me that it is economically necessary."
"Presumably, it is economic madness."
"I want first of all to deal with Paragraph 14."
"Anyone who drives when drunk loses his driving licence immediately."
"How can a driver arrive with a load including dead animals and yet retain both his driving licence and his licence to transport animals?"
"That is absurd!"
"Paragraph 20 is about ending the payment of export refunds in respect of live animals."
"That is a first small step able, in actual fact, to be taken by the EU."
"Mr President, Mr Maat's report is an important tool for thinking globally and acting more locally in agricultural and environmental policy."
"Your report, Mr Maat, deserves our full support, as it does not make any compromises to the detriment of animal welfare and again emphatically brings to the light of day deficiencies which have long been well known."
"There are particular expectations of the report since the vote in plenary which cut the budget for the export refund regulation."
"The agreement with which this met naturally gives grounds for hope that the Maat report will be adopted as a whole, especially as it has made past misdemeanours in animal transport policy particularly apparent."
"There are a number of points I would like to make, but time is too short."
"Let me perhaps just say in conclusion that checks and supervision must be improved, and the amounts levied in fines must be harmonised and raised to a level that will act as a deterrent for transport businesses."
"The same should apply to sanctions imposed on Member States."
"We are all acquainted with the problems, the European public is right to be sharply critical of the European institutions and of the fifteen governments."
"This report is to be highly valued also from the point of view of enlargement."
"Ladies and gentlemen of the Council and of the Commission, it is high time that action were taken."
"Mr President, it is probably indisputable that Europe-wide public opinion is demanding an immediate end to the animal cruelty associated with the transportation of live animals."
"The EU has the means to reduce these problems, but lacks the political will to do so."
"There exist directives whose purpose is to improve the conditions of animals during the time of transportation."
"There is, however, no control over the implementation of these."
"Mr Maat's report recognises this situation; it states that the directives issued on transportation are being violated."
"It sees problems which arise from the different driving and resting times which apply to the drivers and to the animals being transported."
"It pays particular attention to the export of live animals to countries outside the EU, which, of course, always involves the longest journey."
"It reminds us that such transportations are a cause of the explosive spread of infectious animal diseases."
"The most radical demand is that the Commission is being required to end payments of export aid with regard to animals being transported for slaughter, as from the start of next year."
"The Commission must respond to these requirements (which will form the opinion of Parliament) in such a way that the ethical/moral demands of the civilised world regarding respect for life will, in the EU, also be met in the case of animals destined for slaughter."
"Mr President, Ireland is committed to working with all Member States and international bodies to achieve higher standards in animal welfare."
"Due to our peripheral location and our island status, as Mr Maat has recognised - for which I thank him - we have no realistic alternative to exporting our live cattle by boat, and we need to find export markets for nine out of the ten animals produced on our farms."
"While I fully support the general principle of slaughtering animals as close as possible to the point of production, the reality is that many of the export markets available to us demand live animals rather than the processed products and for the foreseeable future the proper functioning of our market will require a balance between the dead meat and the live meat trade."
"Regulation 615/98 links all payments of export refunds to compliance with strict animal welfare standards during transport, including full clinical examination of every animal."
"We must police and enforce this fully."
"The live export incident involving Germany and the Lebanon this summer resulted from the inexperience of the German authorities, as they are infrequent exporters of live animals and had no prior veterinary agreement with the Lebanese."
"Hard cases make bad law."
"I do not agree with the German agricultural minister's view that export refunds on live cattle can now no longer be justified."
"If Europe does not fulfil the requirements of third countries, they will get their supplies from far further afield, with little or no controls and regulation from an animal welfare point of view since there are still no internationally agreed standards on transport."
"We have to have the highest possible standards not just in the interest of the animals but also of the producers, who will get a far better price for healthy unstressed animals."
"It is true that we must continue to review our standards of protection of animals during transport and each Member State must be willing to police and enforce the law."
"However, with over a million tonnes of surplus beef in the EU, export refunds will be required for some time to come and I will not be supporting any proposal to remove them."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it goes without saying that cruelty to animals must be stopped."
"This already forms the specific ethical basis of European agricultural production."
"The Commission must have adequate powers to intervene in the activities of Member States; penalties must be sufficiently severe; and executive measures to correct these matters definitely need to be intensified."
"I would like to thank Mr Maat, the rapporteur, for taking the exceptions into consideration."
"There exist such things as sparsely populated areas, islands, and long distances, and these areas too must be able to function; in this report they have been taken into consideration in a balanced and even-handed way."
"Animal welfare forms part of a greater whole."
"The regionalisation of production chains has been the topic of the day and a theme for the future, and it is against this specific background that the aid for transportation of animals for slaughter must be ended."
"This will further regionalisation, and the implementation and development of regional chains."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again, we are handling the subject of 'Protection of animals during transport' ."
"This is a long-running issue, and I unreservedly support the report Mr Maat has presented."
"We all know that there are already several directives on this in the European Union, and legislation to transpose it in the Member States."
"We are all in favour of comprehensive animal protection and opposed to methods of transport which inflict needless suffering, particularly on animals destined for slaughter."
"Were all these positive laws to be transposed and followed up everywhere, this debate would not be necessary."
"That is, however, not the case."
"Pictures of unacceptable transport conditions provide repeated evidence of this."
"We should, though, not lose sight of the fact that there are a few good things to report on this area."
"There are some examples of the transportation of animals which already meet the requirements of animal protection."
"The idea of slaughter in the immediate vicinity of the place of origin is also widely being put into practice."
"Slaughter as close to the farm as possible is something I greatly support."
"Modern methods of preservation make the export of meat even to distant areas thoroughly feasible."
"We are right to demand feeding and watering breaks during the transportation of animals."
"We will also have to give future consideration to how to minimise stress to the animals when being unloaded or reloaded before and after these breaks."
"We could certainly aim to have the vehicles transporting animals to slaughter equipped in such a way that the animals could remain on board the vehicle during short breaks and be provided for there."
"Transport, space, the way in which the vehicles are driven, ventilated and heated, loading and unloading procedures have, if they are made suitable, the greatest effect on improving the protection of animals."
"This report makes its contribution to that and I ask for it to be supported across this House."
"Mr President, during animal transport, animals are merely considered commodities and not living creatures with an intrinsic value."
"The Member States should hang their heads in shame for the fact that the supervision of compliance with legislation is so deficient."
"I therefore welcome the proposals to step up the supervisory procedures considerably and to tighten the sanctions."
"Furthermore, a general time and distance limit should be imposed and far stricter requirements should be prescribed for all trucks."
"Improved facilities should not be an alibi for extending driving times under the guise that it is acceptable for transport in 'business class' to take longer."
"The use of 'business class' is quite ludicrous considering the sixth-rate treatment animals still receive before they are killed."
"Live animals should only have to endure very short spells of transport."
"Eight hours is indeed an improvement, but four hours should, in fact, be the absolute maximum."
"We must move towards regionalisation of the production chain with small, clean slaughterhouses."
"The recent foot-and-mouth crisis has illustrated once again that the stopping and collection places entail irresponsible animal-health risks, and these must therefore be abolished."
"Reforms need to be carried out promptly with a view to enlargement."
"Across Europe, animals should no longer simply be viewed as objects which are financially lucrative instead of as part of creation."
"Mr Maat, many thanks for the sound report."
"Mr President, it is a rare occurrence but, this time, I am forced to speak on behalf of my nation."
"In fact, the entire Italian beef industry is extremely concerned by the proposal, and not just because of the maximum limits it imposes on travelling time."
"Of even more concern to us is the fact that the proposal stipulates that animals for further fattening, which is a completely natural stage of the livestock rearing process, should be subject to the more restrictive measures laid down for animals for slaughter instead of the less restrictive measures laid down for breeding animals, even though the further fattening stage is a natural continuation of the livestock rearing process lasting a few months."
"We fully understand the report' s objective, which is to replace the transportation of live animals with that of dead meat as far as possible."
"However, our situation is quite out of the ordinary, involving 120 thousand farms and a flourishing processing industry with business activities ranging from slaughter to packing, which would be greatly compromised by such a measure."
"Here are some statistics, Mr President, Commissioner: France has a cattle stock of over 20 million head and an annual slaughter rate of 5 million head;"
"Clearly, this consolidated production cycle, which is vital for the economy of our country' s livestock sector, would be completely disrupted by the introduction of a maximum journey time or distance limit."
"Moreover, there are no scientific grounds for such a limit and it would serve purely exploitative purposes and have consequences which, as I said, would be extremely difficult for the sector as a whole to bear."
"It can be seen from this that the sole motive behind any proposal to place an absolute limit on travelling time is actually other countries' desire to strip Italy of a substantial part of its slaughter trade and to take the place of our producers in supplying beef and veal to the Italian market."
"This is not the kind of Europe we want!"
"Mr President, I am pleased to outline to you the Commission's position on Mr Maat' s excellent report."
"The subject matter of this report is animal welfare and animal transport in particular."
"We all know that this is a very sensitive issue."
"I made clear when I presented the original Commission proposal that the views of the Council and Parliament would help shape the proposals which I intend to present early next year."
"The report under discussion here today shares most of the objectives of the Commission."
"However, there is one key building block missing in the construction of the Commission' s final proposals and that is the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare, which is expected shortly."
"This opinion will provide the Commission with the necessary scientific advice on key issues such as travelling times and loading densities."
"On such issues, our actions must be guided by good scientific advice on animal transport conditions."
"Let me nonetheless indicate some general impressions on some of the key issues raised in your report."
"First of all on travelling time, I was very glad to note that some of the more extreme suggestions, such as a four-hour limit on animal transport, have not been supported in Mr Maat' s report."
"The consistent advice to the Commission is that the stress and risk to animals in transport arises primarily from three factors: travelling time, loading and unloading of animals and the conditions in which they are transported - ventilation, humidity, density and so on."
"The Commission has already presented proposals for improvements in these areas or will be presenting them shortly."
"However there is too much emphasis in some quarters on travelling time."
"I consider that a reduction to four hours is simplistic and takes no account of the wider interests involved."
"We cannot ignore the interests of the farmers and the meat and livestock industry."
"Such a reduction would be viewed as an attack on their livelihoods rather than a genuine contribution to animal welfare."
"If we wish to retain their support for improved animal welfare then we must also respect their interests."
"I wish to work with them rather than against them and hope that you share this view."
"I would now like to turn to the issue of resources."
"Your report calls for the number of inspectors in the Food and Veterinary Office engaged on animal welfare to be increased to fourteen, compared with the current figure of four."
"The reality is that such an increase could only be achieved at the expense of other priorities, including BSE, foot-and-mouth disease, meat hygiene, residue levels and food safety generally, where the Commission is already over-stretched."
"I have consistently refused to make promises on which I cannot deliver."
"It would be dishonest to do so, both to this House and to the European public."
"You stress the lack of enforcement of the current legislation in Member States."
"I fully agree."
"Member States must make the effort and provide the resources to ensure better implementation."
"It is a point which I have made repeatedly to the Member States in the Agriculture Council."
"Judging from the correspondence I receive from Members of Parliament, the best way to achieve better enforcement is through legal proceedings against the Member States."
"However it should be pointed out that sometimes it is more effective to work with Member States than against them, so proceedings should be the last resort."
"They are, after all, responsible for the on-the-ground implementation of Community legislation."
"But let me be clear: where efforts to find solutions through dialogue do not succeed, the Commission will initiate infringement proceedings against the Member States concerned."
"In fact, proceedings are under way against several Member States and are under consideration for several more."
"Finally, in this respect, I would call on the House to assist the Commission' s efforts in encouraging Member States to take animal welfare more seriously."
"In particular I would call on Members to remind your political colleagues in your own Member States of the need to put more efforts and resources into ensuring that the Community provisions on animal welfare are complied with."
"Mr Maat, ladies and gentlemen, I will be returning to you shortly with the Commission' s formal proposals."
"This will provide you with the opportunity to shape the hard legislation on animal welfare."
"I can assure you that Mr Maat' s report will be a major influence on this legislation."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 9.40 p.m.)"
"Decision on urgent procedure"
"The next item is the vote on requests for urgent procedure pursuant to Rule 112."
"Proposal for a Council regulation aiming to promote the conversion of vessels and fishermen that were, up to 1999, dependent on the fishing agreement with Maroc [COM(2001) 384 - C5-0407/2001 - 2001/0163 (CNS)]"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, last night the Committee on Fisheries approved the report by our colleague, Mrs Miguélez Ramos, on the restructuring of the Community fisheries sector affected by the non-renewal of the fisheries agreement with Morocco."
"I would like to say to the House that this report is restricted to regulating the technical aspects relating to the social measures aimed at the many people affected; it is a very sensitive issue from a social, and therefore political, point of view, in the Member States affected by this restructuring."
"Therefore, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am in a position to ask the House to vote in favour of this request for an urgent procedure presented by the Council, so that this proposal can be debated in Council by the Fisheries Ministers at their meeting called for the 27 November."
"Mr President, the Committee on Budgets is sympathetic to the needs of our friends in the Committee on Fisheries."
"However, a conciliation meeting will be taking place on 21 November and it is not yet agreed between the different institutions how the agreement will be finalised, or indeed in what category it will be finalised."
"In the light of a decision by the Budgets Council last week, there is a great deal of confusion on our side as to how we are going to deal with this."
"I would ask that we do not treat this as urgent and that it be held over until after the conciliation meeting of 21 November."
"Mr President, I wish to support Mr Wynn."
"I am glad to see that the Committee on Budgets is taking a responsible approach to this issue because the idea of pushing it through as urgent procedure without debate is unacceptable."
"We have to be very careful about how we use European taxpayers' money and we need to look to the future."
"A number of years ago in this Parliament it was already being said that Morocco would not agree to another agreement with the EU."
"We knew that then and we should have prepared for it."
"This situation is not unique, it is going to happen again."
"At the moment we are discussing a major agreement with Mauritania."
"The day will come when Mauritania will say to the EU that it no longer wants such an agreement."
"What are we going to do then?"
"We really need to address this issue, firstly, in relation to how we arrange our common fisheries policy and, secondly, in relation to how we use public money."
"The way this has been rushed through is unacceptable."
"This is not a matter for urgent procedure because we have known for many years that this problem was coming."
"We need to be extremely careful about how we use European taxpayers' money."
"I understand the problems the fishing community has, but we need to be more responsible."
"Mr President, I would simply like to say that the Committee on Budgets has taken no decision in this field."
"There are plenty of Members, particularly from my group, in the Committee on Budgets who believe that the urgent procedure is perfectly appropriate."
"We understand the reasons that the Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries has been able to give."
"We believe that, in this case, a legal basis is necessary and, in any event, from the budgetary point of view, if it is necessary to amend that basis as a result of the negotiation with the Council on the 21 November, it could be done without any problem."
"I therefore do not believe that this Parliament' s position would be damaged by accepting the urgent procedure today and voting on the Miguélez Ramos report, which, furthermore, relates much more to the technical issues in the Commission' s proposal with regard to the restructuring of the fleet than to actual budgetary motivations, which will be the subject of another report."
"Mr President, I oppose urgency on a matter of principle, not on a matter of substance."
"I am sure we all support a global health fund and President Prodi guaranteed EUR 120 million at the G8 meeting in July."
"However, I and many others are extremely disappointed that the Commission has taken until November to come forward with any effective suggestions and now it is asking for urgency, effectively denying the Council and Parliament any time to debate or amend this proposal."
"It looks as if we are just going to hand over a cheque and that will be the end of it."
"The Commission is also suggesting the funding should be found by taking EUR 60 million from a fishing agreement and EUR 60 million from the EDF."
"In its resolution in this House on 25 October this House emphasised that contributions should be new and additional funding, and this is not so."
"At the moment it looks as if it is a one-off payment."
"I would like to hear the Commission guarantee that a legal base will be found for the sustainable funding of the global health fund after 2000 and submitted as quickly as possible."
"I would like an assurance that it will be new money and that Parliament and the Council will be kept fully informed and involved, so that we play a legislative part in this process."
"We, as parliamentarians, cannot be treated in this way."
"Mr President, there is no point in talking about old money or new money when there is no money!"
"If we do not get agreement on this matter this year with urgent procedure, there will be no money next year for the Global Health Fund."
"I know there are problems about getting EUR 60 million from the EDF but, quite frankly, that is another argument."
"If we want EUR 60 million from the general budget, we have to agree to using urgent procedure on this or there will be no money for the Global Health Fund."
"This financing issue is indeed directly linked with the subject we were discussing just now."
"EUR 50 million will be made available from appropriations that were previously earmarked for fishing agreements."
"It is quite evident that this is additional money that was not available beforehand for other external actions."
"A further EUR 10 million will be made available from two budget lines with which there have also been implementation difficulties up to now, that is to say the budget lines for Latin America and for Asia."
"The money will be implemented here in a concrete way, and there are promising signs that the extra EUR 60 million can be provided from the EDF."
"I believe that it really would be a good sign if the European Union could make an early decision on implementing these financial appropriations."
"As you know, the donors to the global health fund have promised over USD 1.8 billion, but so far those are just promises."
"The European Union would be the first to make a concrete decision on financing."
"I therefore ask you to vote for this request for urgent procedure."
"We need a legal basis for making a transfer to the global health fund."
"This House will naturally be kept informed at all stages."
"We will, of course, come back to this several times during the overall budget process."
"But if the legal basis could be rapidly decided upon now, and it would be a good legal basis that would enable us to make the transfer, then we would not need to explore any other avenues, because the budget situation would be very clear."
"So I ask you to vote for the request for urgent procedure."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, I would like to say that we are against recourse to the urgent procedure, for fundamental and for procedural reasons."
"The facts are as follows: the Commission has proposed a contribution of EUR 60 million to the Global Fund to fight AIDS/HIV, tuberculosis and malaria."
"We are not against this proposal, but we do not believe that this can be a single contribution, made just once, if this objective is to be fulfilled."
"We are arguing for a solid and sustained contribution, not just for one year."
"This is why we do not agree with the urgent procedure; we intend to present amendments, which is our right in accordance with the codecision procedure applicable in this field."
"The Commission, in asking for the urgent procedure, is doing so in a way which is unacceptable to Parliament, since it deprives us of this essential and irrevocable right."
"The Commission announced its contribution to this fund in July; it told us about it some months ago and it announced it publicly in Genoa more than three months ago; and now it wants Parliament to express its opinion on this important issue in just one week."
"Presentation of the Court of Auditors' annual report - 2000"
"The next item is the presentation of the Court of Auditors' annual report for the year 2000."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Members of the European Court of Auditors, I would like to thank you for inviting me to present the 24th Annual Report of the Court for the 2000 financial year."
"As in previous years, this presentation marks the start of the discharge procedure."
"The report follows the format used for the past three years, with chapters covering revenue and each of the expenditure areas under the headings of the financial perspectives."
"There is an additional chapter this year which marks the development of the Union, which deals with pre-accession aid for which a separate financial perspective heading exists from 2000 onwards."
"You will also - as usual - find a chapter dedicated to the Statement of Assurance and, attached to the report, you will find the Court' s observations on the implementation of the sixth, seventh and eight European Development Funds."
"The different chapters of the Annual Report address four main concerns."
"First, there is an analysis of the budgetary implementation and of the budgetary management practices for each specific financial perspective heading."
"Then, you will find the follow-up of observations of the Court in previous Annual and Special Reports."
"Thirdly, the specific appraisal in the context of the Statement of Assurance with information per financial perspective heading."
"Finally, a new element this year is that the principal findings and recommendations in the Special Reports adopted by the Court since the last discharge are summarised in the chapters according to the wishes of this Parliament."
"This means that the Annual Report this year contains all the principal findings and recommendations concerning the implementation of the general budget and the European Development Funds that the Court has published since the last discharge."
"You will also find, for the first time - not in the copy of annual report that you have in your hands today, but in the Official Journal version that will come when the official version has been printed, something that Parliament has asked for many years - the text of the Court in one column and the answers of the Commission on the same page so as to make the report, at least in this respect, more user-friendly."
"Concerning the budget management for 2000, one particular feature of budget implementation was the emergence of a very large surplus of revenue over expenditure, amounting to EUR 11.6 billion, equivalent to more than 14 % of final payment expenditure."
"The main factors which led to this situation were a higher revenue yield than budgeted and - perhaps even more important - lower payments on Structural Measures, in particular those for the 2000-2006 programming period."
"The Court recommends that the Commission examine how it can better use the supplementary and amending budget procedure to avoid excessive budget surpluses, in order to avoid distorted revenue positions for the following year caused by the carrying over of surpluses."
"The Court, responding to the wishes of the discharge authority, has continued to follow up the observations in previous Annual and Special Reports."
"The main purpose of this is to review what action has been taken, principally by the Commission, in response to the observations of the Court, the recommendations of the Council and the resolutions of the European Parliament."
"In all of the subjects examined, some action has been taken."
"The extent and effectiveness of this action, however, vary considerably."
"In general, the Commission, in particular where it agreed with the earlier observations and propositions, has adopted measures designed to respond to them and to improve the situation."
"In some cases corrective action has been slow, in others, staff and financial resources allocated have been insufficient to achieve the desired level of improvement."
"Effecting improvements in the management and control of complex programmes involving many organisations at different levels is difficult and takes time."
"Structural rigidities have often to be overcome, and in the areas of shared or decentralised management, which account for more than 80 % of the general budget, the Commission requires action from others, such as Member States."
"Notwithstanding that achieving change can be difficult, the Commission should ensure that it takes all the measures within its power to implement the recommendations of the Court and of this Parliament."
"In early 2001, as part of its follow-up work, the Court reviewed progress in the replacement of the former anti-fraud unit (UCLAF) with the European Anti-fraud Office (OLAF)."
"The new arrangements for OLAF provide a more appropriate administrative framework, with greater independence for the Office than its predecessor."
"The Court continues to work closely with OLAF."
"It has established formal procedures to ensure that the relations between the two organisations are efficient and effective."
"It has also established a constructive dialogue with the committee established to supervise the work of OLAF, under the chairmanship of Prof. Delmas-Marty."
"The Court has recently prepared an opinion, soon to be published, on a proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and the Council on the protection of the Community's financial interests."
"This directive is an important step forward in the fight against fraud."
"I would like to thank the chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mrs Theato, on behalf of the Court of Auditors for her impressive work and dedication over the years to make this important directive possible."
"With regard to the Statement of Assurance, the Court is of the opinion that the revised accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 2000 reflect reliably the Community' s revenue and expenditure for the year and the financial situation at the end of the year."
"As far as the legality and regularity of underlying transactions are concerned, the audit of the principal management and control systems applicable to Agriculture and Structural Measures revealed weaknesses in the functioning of control procedures aiming to secure the legality and regularity of the transactions."
"The audit of operational expenditure revealed an unacceptable incidence of error affecting the amount of the payments or the reality or the eligibility of the underlying transactions."
"In view of the results of its audit work taken together, the Court is of the opinion that the transactions underlying the financial statements are, taken as a whole, legal and regular in respect of revenue, commitments and administrative expenditure but declines to provide this assurance in respect of payments in operational expenditure."
"Since the last Annual Report the Court has adopted eighteen Special Reports to be taken into account in the discharge procedure, containing the results of audits which focus on a wide range of specific areas in which the Community' s financial management can be improved."
"The results of the Court' s audits indicate significant positive findings."
"In the agricultural area the reformed clearance of accounts system and the Integrated Administrative and Control System have contributed to improved management of large amounts of European Union funds."
"The Commission' s strategy for dealing with BSE is basically sound."
"With regard to Structural Measures, the URBAN Community Initiative has helped the implementation of many urban development projects and has enabled local authorities to access Union funds."
"In the external actions area, the work of the agency charged with the reconstruction of Kosovo, was found to be both efficient and economical."
"The TACIS cross-border co-operation programme is an instrument which has the potential to play a useful role in addressing issues relating to the new eastern border following the next accession."
"However, it was also found that major objectives have either not been achieved, or only limited progress had been made."
"Further, it was frequently found that there was either insufficient or no evaluation by the Commission of the achievement of the objectives."
"The Commission' s reform programme is increasing the focus on results and performance measurement, within a resource allocation framework reflecting predetermined priorities and defined objectives."
"The Court' s findings on recent programmes show that the Commission still faces major challenges in this area."
"One of the most important issues in the discussion that we had last year here in Parliament, when I presented the Annual Report for 1999, concerned the situation in the Member States."
"The results are striking."
"The Court has concentrated a large share of its resources on the audit of control systems in Member States as a follow up to this debate."
"Persistent weaknesses were found in Member States' checking of community operations concerning programmes where management is shared between the Commission and the Member States."
"This was the case for the Integrated Administrative and Control System (IACS)."
"It was also the case for export refunds, and concerning the control regulation for Structural Measures."
"Improving the control arrangements in the Member States is central to ensuring the correct use of Union funds."
"It is also important if the Court is to place some reliance for its own audit purposes on the checks carried out by the various audit and supervisory services in the Commission, and in the Member States."
"I will come back to this specific problem at the end of my speech."
"The recast of the Financial Regulation, which is an important element of the Commission reform programme, maybe the first step that was taken, now seeks to clarify and strengthen the provisions relating to methods of implementation of the budget, advance payments, procurement, presentation of the accounts, and the offices."
"The introduction of new provisions intended to contribute to the establishment of a coherent legal framework in the field of budgetary execution, based on the primacy of the Financial Regulation, is another important improvement within the recast."
"However, as you will see from our Annual Report, some important matters of principle stated in the Court' s opinion on the proposed changes have not been followed, which may lead to serious complexity in financial management."
"Regarding enlargement, this year' s Annual Report has a new chapter dealing with pre-accession aid for which a separate financial perspective heading exists from 2000 onwards."
"In accordance with Parliament recommendations in its 1999 discharge resolution, the Court has been improving and intensifying the co-operation with the Supreme Audit Institutions of the candidate countries during the past few years."
"Furthermore, in liaison with the Supreme Audit Institutions the Court has been intensifying the exchange of information at different levels of national administrations."
"The setting-up of national systems of internal control and the external audit of EU funds made available to the candidate countries require closer co-operation between the institutions even before accession."
"Enlargement will bring about changes in the way the Council, the Commission and the Court of Justice will work."
"This is also true for the Court of Auditors and for Parliament."
"Today, no one questions the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty to make the Court of Auditors one of the five independent institutions of the Union."
"The Nice Treaty will mean substantial organisational changes in the near future, also for the European Court of Auditors, where the Court will have the possibility of establishing an organisational structure in chambers with a more effective decision making, even if we will then consist of 25 Member States."
"The Court is actively preparing itself for this challenging reform."
"The Court is developing its relations with the Commission' s new Internal Audit Service, with discussions covering a number of areas where we can work together."
"The Court is giving high priority to assessing how it will be able to use the work of the Internal Audit Service and the audit capabilities in the Directorates General."
"One very promising sign of progress in this field was the conference, under the challenging heading of ""Verstehen"" held at the initiative of the Internal Auditor, Mr Muis, on Thursday and Friday which Mrs Schreyer and Mrs Theato attended."
"I should like to say, as the President of the Court of Auditors, that this initiative might mean an extremely fruitful, concrete and promising step forward in the idea of a single audit system concerning European funds."
"The Treaty states clearly that the European Court of Auditors assists the European Parliament and the Council in exercising their powers of control over the implementation of the budget."
"Ladies and Gentleman, I am soon to retire as President and Member of the European Court of Auditors."
"During my seven years in the Court I have been privileged to contribute to the Court's growing importance, and to the continuous efforts it makes, in collaborating with Parliament and meeting its needs in optimising the assistance it provides."
"The Court is addressing the need in its statement of assurance methodology for more information on the nature and causes of the problems affecting the management of Community funds by broadening the range of evidence in support of its conclusions."
"The recent reforms in the area of financial management and internal audit will enable the Court to make greater use of the Commission' s work, not least for its work on the Statement of Assurance."
"The Court intends to continue to develop specific appraisals for each major area of Community activity as a complement to its Statement of Assurance."
"The specific appraisals are now envisaged in the Nice Treaty and are an important tool to help the discharge authority to make appropriate recommendations with a view to improving management."
"One of the major tasks of the enlarged European Union will be the collaboration between European and National Supreme Audit Institutions."
"This has long been a key preoccupation of this Parliament."
"But, as we all know, this co-operation has advanced slowly and Parliament has repeatedly urged the Court to improve the situation."
"After having followed progress for a number of years I have arrived at the conclusion that a good result in this respect requires initiatives at a higher level than purely technical co-operation between the Supreme Audit Institutions of the Member States and the European Court of Auditors."
"I would like to quote a Member of this Parliament, Mr Jacques Santer who pointed out, when he was President of the Commission, the importance of collaboration between the national parliaments and the European Parliament. It would also be a key factor in the field of Financial Control."
"The Supreme Audit Institutions act independently and have a strong collaboration with their respective national parliaments. So, collaboration between national parliaments and the European Parliament could have a major influence on national audit bodies and the European Court of Auditors, in particular in the matter of financial control."
"The way of intergovernmental collaboration in this field is not the most practical route to take since the Supreme Audit Institutions of the Member States are, with the exception of my own country, independent of governments, as they are controlling them."
"But maybe the solution can be found in increased cooperation between this Parliament and the national parliaments of the Member States."
"Let me finally add one little word."
"As parliamentarians in the European Parliament, as Commissioners in the European Commission, also as Auditors in the European Court of Auditors, we have a double role."
"We have to fulfil our tasks according to the Treaty; to fulfil them as Commissioners, as Parliamentarians and as Members of the Court of Auditors."
"But we also have another role in common."
"That is always to defend the idea of Europe."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Mr Karlsson, ladies, gentlemen, and members of the Court of Auditors, this report from the Court of Auditors on the 2000 budget year gives the Commission both encouragement and support; it is particularly supportive of the Commissioner for the Budget."
"Let me thank the Court of Auditors, you, Mr Karlsson and the Court's members and staff for the 2000 Report and give especial additional thanks for the special reports, whose very practical recommendations make them very valuable to the Commission in its work."
"I would most especially like to express my satisfaction with the Court's practical observations, and with the Court's support for two measures which are of particular concern to me."
"One, in the area of foreign policy, has to do with the reconstruction of Kosovo."
"The Court of Auditors has examined the accounting procedures and the profitability of the agency charged with the reconstruction of Kosovo and has come to a highly favourable conclusion, reporting that the agency has succeeded in achieving most of the high targets set for it, and that its administration and budget management were highly efficient economically."
"I had strongly urged that the 2000 Budget should make available sufficient funds for the reconstruction of Kosovo."
"Parliament and, in particular, Mr Bourlanges, whom I would like to mention particularly in his capacity as principal rapporteur on the 2000 Budget, were also very much behind the idea that sufficient funds should be allocated for this purpose."
"The good work that was done meant that funds for the agency charged with the reconstruction of Kosovo could even be increased in the course of the 2000 budget year."
"I am sure that Mr Bourlanges will feel, as I do, that it is quite simply very heartening when measures that one has been especially committed to get such a good report from the Court of Auditors."
"It goes without saying that this sends an important message to the taxpayers, that money is being invested well in Kosovo, and in an economically efficient way."
"I emphasise this for the additional reason that there is a very intense debate going on in the media about the common foreign and security policy, with people asking: where is the European Union? where is the Commission?"
"Here we have a quite tangible example of a common foreign policy measure and a tangible demonstration of what a good result can be achieved if we all pull together."
"The second point about which I would like to speak personally, and on which I wish to express my thanks for the Court's support, is the Financial Regulation."
"The recast of the Financial Regulation is a highly comprehensive undertaking, on which the Court of Auditors gave its opinion in quick order and was of great help to the Commission, not only with the adoption of a formal position, but also with the many meetings on technical and administrative matters."
"That may perhaps sound a bit arid, but the fact is that the Financial Regulation lays down Budget procedures in exact terms, stipulating who plays what role, who possesses which supervisory powers and whether, for example, there can be rapid redeployments in the Budget, and where they can be made, in order to take account of changes during the budget year."
"I am very grateful to the Court of Auditors for making clear how important it is that all financial arrangements in specified sectors conform to Budget principles, or principles of sound budgeting."
"I am very grateful to you in this Parliament for the amendments you have proposed even before the summer recess."
"I can say quite unequivocally and definitely that the recast proposal gained a great deal in terms of quality as a result."
"For its part, the Commission has now done its homework; so too, on this point, has the Court of Auditors; and so too, to a quite broad extent in this area, has Parliament; I therefore believe it is actually high time for Parliament to formally take up its position, so that then the Council, too, can get its homework over and done with in a similarly short time."
"Now I also want to consider some areas in which the Court made some highly critical comments."
"One case in point is the way in which the Monitoring Regulation for the Structural Funds has been implemented."
"It is the Member States who have primary responsibility for monitoring the legality of the use to which Structural Fund resources are put."
"It is, however, equally true that the Commission bears overall responsibility for the implementation of the Budget and thus for checking that monitoring regulations are clearly framed and enforceable and that the state of affairs does not come to pass in which more or less any Member State can come up with its own interpretation of the monitoring regulations and act accordingly."
"The complaint most frequently levelled at the Structural Funds by the Member States is that the monitoring procedures are so complicated."
"This sometimes reaches the point where the conclusion is to say: 'In future, we will have the Structural Funds only as a sort of lump sum transfer.'"
"The Commission, though, does not, of course, support this as the way forward, and I assume that Parliament does not support it either."
"For when funds go out of the European Budget, they do so in order to achieve definite objectives and not as a general settlement."
"It is, of course, true that, if we want things to be that way in future, we will have to work at simplifying the regulation in question."
"I join with the Court of Auditors in calling for a simpler scheme which, being more easily monitored, would lessen the likelihood of error."
"'Complicated procedure' was also the criticism the Court of Auditors laid at the door of the Sapard programme of agricultural aid for the acceding countries."
"This afternoon the Commission will be debating the progress reports on the enlargement process as a whole, of which financial control is a very important part, as is the assessment of what progress has been made in the acceding states and of what problems remain to be overcome."
"Sapard, though, presents us with the problem of the over EUR 1 billion allocated for 2000 and 2001, of which in fact only EUR 16 million have so far been paid out."
"I must accept the Court of Auditors' criticism of what is, of course, a very poor result."
"This will also have to be discussed in the Commission, for the complicated procedure must not result in the funds ceasing to be used at all."
"When dealing with precise controls in the acceding states, we must, then, find a balance, but not to the detriment of implementation."
"Turning to the massive EUR 11.6 billion surplus in the 2000 Budget, the Court of Auditors has explained that a surplus should not be entered in the accounts for the following year, but should, if at all possible in the current budget year, allow the Member States to make reduced payments, which means that the Budget would then be adjusted downwards in the course of the year."
"I work on the assumption that the Council and the Finance Ministers would surely give this a favourable reception, but that there has to be more careful consideration of what is the right way forward here."
"Of last year's Budget surplus, over EUR 3 billion was the result of increased income, which itself was a consequence of last year's growth figures in fact turning out better than had at first been assumed."
"It was, though, only in November that the official figures became available."
"Of the surplus, several hundred million euro represent real savings in agriculture as a result of favourable market developments."
"I see it as a very positive thing if we do not have to spend money, but whether that is actually the case will not be definitely known until the end of the year."
"Those who legislated for the Structural Funds had indeed already foreseen the possible difficulties in implementing the programme in its first year, and it is for that reason that the Interinstitutional Agreement provides for the option of transferring funds to subsequent years."
"Let me again make it clear that I do not see it in a negative light if, at the end of the year, or, as the Court has proposed, possibly during the current year, funds can be returned to the Member States due to the money not being required."
"I am probably agreeing with certain comments made in this Parliament when I say that the distinction has to be drawn between the money not being needed in order to achieve a given objective, and the money not having been able to be used because of faulty budget management or shortcomings in administration."
"That can be properly assessed only when we are no longer talking in the Budget procedure about how much money is being invested, but rather about what objectives we want to achieve."
"In this context, I take on board the Court of Auditors' remarks on evaluation and on how important it is in a good Budget procedure."
"The Court of Auditors has confirmed the regularity of the accounts, in other words, that the books are in good order, and also of the revenue side of the Budget."
"It has also certified the reliability of the commitments and of the administrative outgoings."
"It has, however, criticised the excessive incidence of errors in cash movements."
"Has the Commission, then, made too few changes in 2000 in order to improve financial management?"
"Let me, on this point, refer to the Court of Auditors' statement that, in 2000, many steps towards reform had only just started to be taken, and that they will only gradually meet with success."
"I cannot, at this juncture, list all the steps we have taken since then, but I will all the same highlight a few of them."
"One example is in the personnel field."
"Additions have been made to the total personnel complement for financial management, among other things by redeployment within the Commission to reinforce the financial units in the various Directorates-General, and Parliament has made additional posts available for 2001."
"The selection procedure for these is at present in progress, and it will result in 250 candidates being put on a list to strengthen the financial and personnel management sectors."
"I would like, in addition, to mention the steps we are taking in training and development."
"The Commission's reforms as a whole have meant that there is definitely a greater need for training."
"A total of 2 800 officials have already been trained in financial management by the Budget Directorate-General and another 1 700 will take part in courses of this sort in the next few months."
"The technical assistance offices have also come in for a lot of criticism from us in the past."
"There are 126 of them, and 93 will have had their contracts with us cancelled by the end of 2001."
"I see this as an important point; it is something that has been achieved through pressure exerted by Parliament, and we will, for example, be continuing with decentralisation in the field of foreign affairs, in order to make greater use of local knowledge in implementing budget decisions."
"This afternoon the Commission will be taking decisions about further new management systems and about the networking of national agencies."
"A few weeks ago, we adopted a comprehensive package to improve personnel policy."
"In the summer, I presented the report on the steps the Commission had either taken, or proposed to the legislature, to combat fraud, ranging from regulations on money laundering via customs measures through to the proposal for a European public prosecutor for financial offences."
"There is much to do, but much has already been achieved."
"The Commission is not only active in well over 100 States."
"It also gives aid following natural catastrophes and gives humanitarian aid in crisis areas and war zones. It is active in many traditional fields, for example in aspects of agriculture, but it also makes funds available for many innovative projects suggested by Parliament."
"This may sometimes involve large amounts totalling millions, but sometimes, too, relatively small sums of money."
"We link up researchers and the results of their investigations, share in the financing of high-speed railway lines and of student exchange schemes."
"This represents a truly broad spectrum of areas of expenditure, and there is nothing rigid about it."
"The programmes change, the tasks change and the world changes, so we are all constantly being faced with new challenges, and all the European Union's institutions have to be open to them."
"We want to create good European policies, which means learning from mistakes in order to make good measures even better."
"The reports of the Court of Auditors are a fundamental support to us in doing this."
"So I thank the Court, those of its members who are leaving, those who are continuing to be members of it, and most especially its President."
"Mr Karlsson, your presidency has seen the further development of the method for the statement of assurance, and the compilation of a very large number of special reports containing very definite and valuable recommendations."
"The understanding of financial management has improved under your presidency and so, I believe, has the institutions' understanding of each other."
"For that you have my most especial thanks."
"chair of the Committee on Budgetary Control. (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Karlsson, today you are presenting your annual report as President of the Court of Auditors, together with those Members of the Court still in office."
"This is the last time you will present the report, as you are leaving office, as are a number of other Members of the Court. I would like to take this opportunity to thank you and the retiring Members of the Court both personally and on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control for the years of excellent and effective cooperation and mutual trust under your presidency, and also under the previous presidency of Professor Friedmann, who is also retiring."
"There have occasionally been differences of opinion, but I believe that we have always managed to cooperate well, and we have, above all, performed a control function that has ultimately benefited the taxpayer."
"So once again, many thanks."
"The Annual Report of the Court before us today also demonstrates that we have made some further progress."
"I only want to highlight a couple of points."
"The most striking point is the large surplus of own resources: EUR 11.6 million or over 14% of the budget has not been spent."
"The finance ministers are, of course, delighted, as this means that they will have to pay less to the EU next year, but we in the Committee on Budgetary Control are concerned to know which of the objectives that we have set ourselves have not been achieved."
"I believe that the Commission would be well advised - and I understand from the press that there will be surpluses again this year - to get to work on supplementary and rectifying budgets so that the money available is really spent on achieving objectives."
"The complex and cumbersome nature of the legal framework and the extent of the controls therefore involved are also a matter of concern both for the Parliament and for the Court of Auditors, and, as Commissioner Schreyer has just said, for the Commission too."
"We need to work to simplify things as a matter of urgency, so that the public can also obtain funding, rather than say, 'It is so complicated. I do not want any money from the European Union' ."
"Controls need to be proportionate but also to be effective, to lead to positive outcomes and to have a preventive effect."
"My last point is the positive statement of assurance, the SOA."
"Anyone looking for concrete figures or percentages in relation to payments will be disappointed."
"Once again, the Court has not mentioned any concrete figures."
"This House had actually pressed for that."
"The Court now wants to bring forward a refined method of producing this positive statement of assurance."
"We are more than happy to cooperate on this, but we also have to look and analyse where errors are due to the Member States and where they are the Commission's responsibility."
"The Commission is ultimately responsible, and it must accept this responsibility."
"I would like to thank you once again, Mr Karlsson, for your excellent cooperation, and I would like to wish all the retiring Members and you personally all the best for the future."
"Mr President, I would also like to pass on my best regards to Mr Karlsson, thank him for his presentation and all the work he has done over the past few years."
"I hope he will pass on our thanks to his other colleagues who are also leaving."
"We must remember that this report is the first report which assesses the first full year of the Prodi Commission - a Commission which, let us remind ourselves, was appointed with the specific remit of radical overhaul and reform of the European Union."
"The question we will be asking in our discharge procedure this year is: ""Is the Commission delivering on that promise?""."
"Let us be clear."
"If it is not, then the credibility of both the Prodi Commission and of this Parliament is on the line."
"It is much too early to assess the success or failure of the Prodi Commission and of Commission reform."
"The only question we can ask at this point is whether we are headed in the right direction."
"Mr Karlsson, I noted your words last night."
"There are a number of hopeful signs in this report."
"So, where the Commission has specific responsibility, we do seem to be seeing some positive developments."
"As you say, the strategy on BSE is basically sound."
"The work of the Agency charged with the reconstruction of Kosovo was efficient and economical."
"The reform programme is heading in the right direction."
"You have approved the recasting of the financial regulation and the Commission's proposals on financial incentives for top grade officials, although I note that you have some concerns about the Commission's accounting mechanisms."
"Perhaps Mrs Schreyer could comment on that."
"We are not going to let the Commission off the hook."
"There is a large area where the Commission has joint responsibility with the Member States, particularly in the agricultural sector and the structural funds."
"The primary responsibility must lie with the Member States."
"They are responsible for 85% of the budget."
"Here we see some serious structural weaknesses."
"In the structural funds, we see problems in the application of regulations at every level."
"The CAP accounts for over 40% of the budget and where Member States are responsible there is no improvement."
"Heads of stock continue be overstated."
"We know that Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and the Netherlands have not signed the Convention on the Protection of Financial Interests."
"We are disappointed, Mr Karlsson, that you did not mention them by name in the report."
"Again the Court has failed to give a statement of assurance to the Commission."
"As I said last night, this is a complicated and ever-changing procedure and I do not believe the Commission will ever get a statement of assurance."
"So the main message, as far as I can see, is that the Commission should keep going."
"It is on the right track."
"Member States must stop hiding behind the Commission and assume their proper responsibility of protecting EU taxpayers' money."
"I too should like to express my appreciation for all the Members of the Court of Auditors who are departing."
"It is noticeable again that this year, as the Court of Auditors has already expressed in rather vague terms, there is no Statement of Assurance."
"The question arises as to how long this situation can continue like this."
"2001 is the first year for which the current Commission shoulders all responsibility."
"In my opinion, there should come a day when a positive Statement of Assurance can be made."
"I should like to suggest that the Commission sets the year 2000 as a target date."
"For each year, an action plan should be drafted in which the Commission outlines its objectives."
"We must ensure that the necessary arrangements are then in place for certain Directorates-General, with a margin of error of, say, less than 1%."
"As far as the Member States are concerned, we all know that that is where the money is spent."
"In my view, the system we are currently using for the agricultural funds is workable: if a Member State spends certain amounts inappropriately, the Commission will need to introduce capping."
"I should like to see the Commission make proposals for extending this system to include other sectors of the budget, notably the Structural Funds."
"Honourable Members of the Court of Auditors, Mr Karlsson, Mrs Schreyer, on behalf of my group, I should naturally like to echo the words of thanks which my fellow MEPs have already expressed."
"I have started to wade through this tome."
"I have to admit that this 24th Annual Report seems superior and that more names are included than before."
"In other words, this Annual Report is simply a better read, it has to be said."
"It also becomes clear that you are sending out a message, namely an urgent request for simplifying legislation."
"Indeed, if legislation were simplified, fewer mistakes would be made, fewer irregularities would occur and this would probably result in less fraud."
"When I read what was happening with the own resources and when I saw the results of the database, which gives an overview of all cases of fraud and irregularities established since 1996, amounting to EUR 1.5 billion, I appreciated the significance of what we are doing."
"On the basis of the Court of Auditors report, the OLAF reports, the work carried out by the rapporteurs and also our own studies, we will need to explain to the European taxpayers how their money is being spent."
"I am delighted with the fact that the Annual Report devotes much attention to the role of the Member States."
"Indeed, they do not sufficiently inspect the Community programmes which they manage in conjunction with the Commission."
"Neither do they fight fraud satisfactorily when they collect their revenue."
"The VAT carrousels are a prime example of this."
"Finally, as Mrs Morgan has already stated, the Member States fail to implement legislation adequately."
"In this connection, I should once again like to haul my own country over the coals."
"In the Blak report, Belgium was attacked for not yet having ratified the 1995 agreement."
"I have exchanged correspondence in this respect with the President of the Belgian Parliament, and four months ago, I was promised that this agreement would be ratified during the Belgian Presidency."
"That has not been done to date."
"That is an outright scandal, and I am grateful to the Court of Auditors for once again giving us the necessary ammunition today to ensure that the Belgian government and the Belgian Parliament carry out their tasks at long last."
"It is a disgrace which we must continue to denounce in public."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although money is not everything, the way money is handled shows if a policy is successful or not."
"Those were the words of a former President of the Court of Auditors, Bernhard Friedmann, and if we take those words as a yardstick for this year's report, then we really have to ask just how successful the Union's policies are in practice."
"The report before us summarises what we already know from many other reports: there is still a need for reform in financial management and the way funds are implemented."
"There are dramatic shortcomings in many areas, which suggests that financial errors are endemic."
"The Commission's tendency to blame irregularities and deficits the Court discovers chiefly on the Member States is unacceptable."
"Of course the Member States cannot shake off their own responsibilities, if there are irregularities or fraud in the Member States, the Commission must act accordingly."
"The recovery rate, that is the reimbursement of funds that have been lost, is not satisfactory."
"It is not acceptable if Member States underperform in the fight against fraud because of lax controls and are then slow to get funds reimbursed as well."
"Politically speaking, the Commission has final responsibility for the EU budget and it is accordingly also responsible for efficient implementation of funds and checks."
"One of the things mentioned in the Commission's responses on last year's report is that new systems are being introduced which primarily aim to make it easier to check the efficiency of VAT collection in the individual Member States."
"Given that significant shortcomings have also been identified in this area, we also have to ask how effective these control mechanisms are."
"I would like to thank the Court of Auditors for its successful investigative work and I call on the Commission to take further structural reform actions so that mismanagement and financial errors become a thing of the past."
"Mr President, what can I say in two minutes?"
"Well, first of all and very simply, I shall say goodbye and thank you to President Karlsson."
"I shall say goodbye, now that you are leaving us, after giving many years of loyal service, and thank you for the excellent cooperation that you developed with this House and for the quality of this report, which now seems like an impressive aircraft carrier, surrounded by a squadron of special reports."
"I shall make three brief comments, as I have very little time."
"First of all, I believe that you are right to emphasise that the major problem with the 2000 budget is the massive under-implementation of a number of funds."
"Admittedly, Mrs Schreyer is right to say that there are sometimes good reasons for this under-implementation, but generally the budgetary authority feels a sense of frustration and is aware that there are problems related to this under-implementation."
"I shall give four examples. The first is the overly complex regulations, the difficulties in managing the project cycle, the poor interaction in execution and control between the Commission and the Member States, and, lastly, the often pernickety control which has the effect of taking away responsibility."
"These are the areas we will be focusing on in the discharge."
"I have one comment to make on the DAS."
"I am pleased to see that the Court of Auditors is keeping a good distance and we must do the same thing with the error rate."
"The overall error rate is merely the scientifically dubious aggregation of spot checks, which, whilst interesting, are random."
"I do not want everything to hinge on the error rate, which will determine everything."
"The Court of Auditors is reassessing this issue."
"Parliament must monitor and support this."
"My third and final comment relates to the management of surpluses."
"In my view, it is a shame that surpluses are systematically reimbursed to Member States."
"In fact, economically speaking, this management strategy has a pro-cyclical effect, which is absurd."
"We support growth when it is strong, and then, since there is a lack of money, we penalise growth when it is weak."
"We should consider other forms of multi-annual regulation from a statutory point of view."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Court of Auditors, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to focus, in this debate, on the Court of Auditors' special report on export refunds."
"This is yet another important contribution to our understanding of the vital need to promote a thorough reform of the CAP in areas such as the funding of exports of agricultural products."
"Until today, I had never read, in one publication, such a devastating set of facts on the misuse of public funds by the European institutions, some of which are worth highlighting. EUR 80 million from the Community budget were used to fund supplies to Iraq, in breach of the embargo imposed by the United Nations."
"Little or none of this money has to date been recovered. According to statements made by the Russian customs authorities themselves in August 2000, almost 80% of Community subsidies for exports to that country, currently being examined by OLAF, have proved to be fraudulent."
"It should be remembered that Russia is the main destination for subsidised European exports."
"The Community has set up free import agreements with candidate countries, but is still subsidising the export of dairy products to these countries."
"As a result, we have the classic roundabout scenario already seen in Estonia, in which the Community subsidised butter exports, which were then imported free from customs duties."
"The number of supposedly pure-bred cattle whose export the Community has already funded would be enough to give some importer countries, with Mediterranean or desert climates, huge reserves of pure-bred European cattle."
"The system of control and monitoring bodies, designed to ensure the veracity of export statements has proved to be a complete fiasco."
"The Commission assured us, even in the context of the last budgetary discharge and on the Fléchard procedure, that exports to Russia in particular, were now being properly monitored."
"This report by the Court of Auditors categorically disproves the Commission' s words."
"Mr President, this is the first time that we have received a report that pertains to a period for which the Prodi Commission is entirely responsible."
"Can we draw clear conclusions from it?"
"No, not really."
"That is why my group hopes that the discharge procedure will eventually give us the answer to the following questions: which countries cause most problems, which areas of policy are most problematic and what can be done about this, where does the Commission carry out its tasks and where does it fail to do so, but also where have improvements been made and where has that not been the case?"
"We can already detect some improvement."
"That is partly thanks to the commitment by this European Parliament, but also the Court of Auditors, for which we are very grateful."
"However, this is still not enough."
"Moreover, it is still not possible to issue a general Statement of Assurance, and the budget surplus is currently at an all-time high."
"Progress has thus been made in small ways, but that is not enough to really gain the confidence of the people in Europe."
"In the final analysis, that is what we all need to work towards."
"Mr President, when I read the Never-Ending Story to my grandchild, Niklas, I think of the Court of Auditors' annual report."
"There are an incredible number of problems which crop up again and again, year after year. Lamentable control systems in the Member States, lost income from VAT, bureaucratic and complicated export refund arrangements, farmers who overstate how much land they have, misappropriation of structural funds, fraud involving research funds in the form of over-payment, and long-winded and bureaucratic procedures concerning the EU' s external aid."
"It is the same old story every single year."
"However, it is now the Member States that are the biggest culprits."
"It cannot be said often enough."
"The agricultural and structural funds are what cause us problems."
"There is a very tough approach this year to the management of the structural funds."
"I proposed last year in my discharge report that the Commission should impose fines upon those Member States which offend again and again, and I am extremely pleased that Mrs Schreyer and the Commission have promised to look constructively at this possibility."
"Denmark is also mentioned a couple of times in the annual report, and that is a couple of times too many."
"There are problems with farmers' overstating how much land they have, and pathetic control systems at quite a few custom houses."
"The Danish practice of collecting users' fees for the issue of export refunds has also been found to be illegal."
"It is thanks to the Court of Auditors that the Commission has finally realised what is unlawful about this practice."
"I am also pleased that we are working on the problems caused through the pile of work involving guarantee payments in Denmark, which are a disaster."
"In this area, too, the Commission has been a good and effective partner."
"I would also say to Mr Karlsson that I should never in my life have believed that a Dane would end up missing a Swede."
"That is, however, the case and, since I, myself, am also leaving Parliament after this parliamentary term, we must set up a club for former Scandinavian MEPs in which we can rhapsodise about the old days."
"I think that the children' s book, 'Karlsson-on-the-Roof' was written with you in mind."
"Thank you for your fruitful cooperation over seven years."
"Mr President, I have a couple of observations to make."
"First, we need to recognise that, once again, the Court of Auditors has been unable to give a positive statement of assurance in respect of Commission expenditure."
"I want to resist our gradually starting to regard the abnormal as being the norm."
"We can perhaps do that in this case, but certainly not outside this area."
"If this statement of assurance is procedurally weak, then I expect the Court of Auditors to make a statement to that effect."
"Otherwise we must note that there is a weakness in Commission expenditure that needs to be criticised politically speaking."
"My second point is that I am very grateful to you, Commissioner, for having highlighted the link between today's debate on progress reports in connection with enlargement and the report of the Court of Auditors."
"The Court of Auditors has told us that in respect of the new pre-accession instruments there was actually a zero expenditure policy in 2000."
"That means that in practice - and the Commission is talking about the first candidate countries acceding in 2004 - we have already wasted 20% of the time available in the financial area."
"And that means of course that we will have to work even harder in the coming years in order to implement the pre-accession instruments properly."
"My third point is a comment about OLAF."
"I was surprised, Mr Karlsson, that your report more or less suggested that by adding a reserve for setting up OLAF, Parliament had affected the independence of that body."
"We felt obliged to do this when the Commission - as you know - simply transferred all UCLAF's staff to OLAF, and apparently thought the job was done. And all the more so when we discovered from the OLAF Monitoring Committee for which you have such high regard that OLAF's independence genuinely was at risk."
"Now that we have been able to deal with the Commission, and I would specifically like to thank Mrs Schreyer for that, we have a new problem."
"This is an area where I believe the Commission should step in, Mrs Schreyer."
"The new Berlusconi government is now blocking one of the central posts in the new OLAF."
"I would be grateful if we could all pull together on this one."
"Mr President, the report of the Court of Auditors is always rather like the starting pistol for the discharge procedure, which we then hope to conclude in the April of the following year, although we do not always succeed."
"Now that we have been working off the inherited liabilities for several years, something that has consistently attracted media attention, it now seems to me that we are tackling more systemic problems where it is not so much spectacular individual cases that are at stake, but rather whether systems are flawed in some way."
"I would like to address once again three points that arose most often in the debate."
"The first one is the high level of unimplemented appropriations."
"In the course of the discharge procedure, we will have to ask ourselves whether this is attributable to the caution officials exercise before they will sign something off and spend money, or whether it is to do with overcomplicated rules."
"For example, given the many complaints I hear from my constituents and others about all the red tape you have to cope with in dealing with Brussels if you want to get support for something, I fear that I know the answer already."
"Although I am willing to accept it if this is clearly refuted, this is still an issue we need to sort out."
"The second point is the statement of assurance, which has just been mentioned, and Mr Bösch has pointed out the dilemma we face."
"We need to ask ourselves if there are more reliable instruments or if we are treating this statement of assurance in the same way that the Council does year after year, that is as a kind of weather report that is not binding in any way."
"My final point is this: we need to establish whether the Member States' handling of EU money has got worse or whether it is just being scrutinised more carefully now."
"If the latter is the case, that would represent some progress and the Commission could be given some credit for that."
"But it is the Commission's job to step up pressure on the Member States, and we will be glad to help out."
"Before giving the floor back to Mr Karlsson I should like to say to him on behalf of Parliament that we appreciate the fruitful cooperation we have had over the years of his presidency."
"We wish you all the very best for the future."
"Mr Blak has probably paid you the ultimate compliment by talking about a Dane missing a Swede."
"That is like a Scot saying we want England to win at football."
"That was a real compliment."
"Thank you for your cooperation."
"Mr President, on behalf of my outgoing colleagues and myself I would like to assure you that I have never regretted my resignation as much as at this moment."
"I wish I could resign every time we met in order to listen to this lovely music."
"So thank you very much for all the nice words."
"Not least, when I go home to Sweden I shall tell them of these kind words from Denmark."
"Thank you, Mr. Blak."
"I realise there is a heavy agenda, but I would like to take this opportunity to say a few words."
"I shall start with what Mr Kuhne has just said."
"It seems that a number of issues have been put behind us and there is a feeling - which I also had yesterday in a meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Control - that we are now able to address some major issues for the future."
"The first is one which underlies the budget surplus problem."
"It is not so much the revenue I am thinking of, as the under-utilisation and the under-implementation of funds, which, in turn, has a lot to do with our problems in achieving good management and fighting fraud - namely the over-complexity of Union funds and administration and regulations."
"I have had a long discussion on that with the discharge rapporteur, Mr Bourlanges, and I feel confident that this problem will be addressed now."
"My personal advice to Parliament is to do everything in its power, together with other institutions, to simplify things."
"On all the major issues, such as the pre-accession funds, structural funds and export refunds and on the market regulations in agriculture, we have built a mountain of complexity which, if I may for once step into the realm of political judgment, raises the major question of the European citizens' confidence in this Union."
"I would say that if I had to choose one of the tasks that Mr Kuhne mentioned as being the most important, it would be: simplify, for heaven's sake!"
"I wish you every success in that. I think that this Parliament, together with the Court of Auditors and the other institutions, will in the future manage to increase confidence among European citizens in our great project, which, of course, is the primary goal for all of our institutions."
"With that, I thank you once again, on behalf of myself and my colleagues, for your kind words and for this most stimulating and interesting exchange of views."
"That concludes this item."
"Money laundering"
"The next item is the report (A5-380/2001) by Klaus-Heiner Lehne, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council Directive amending Council Directive 91/308/EEC of 10 June 1991 on prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering (PE-CONS 3654/2001 - C5-0496/2001 - 1999/0152(COD))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this second directive on money laundering in Europe has a long history."
"You know that legislation on money laundering in the Member States of the European Union has its roots not so much in the will of the national legislatures but rather in the fact that back in 1991 the European Union brought in the first money-laundering directive, which acted as a catalyst for a string of national money-laundering laws being adopted."
"However, the 1991 directive only set a minimum standard."
"This minimum standard provided that drug-related offences should be included in the list of predicate offences, and with regard to professions that were obliged to take part in the fight against money laundering, only banks and providers of financial services were covered by compulsory provisions."
"This led to major differences in transposal in Europe."
"There were Member States that went well beyond this minimum standard, and other Member States that only implemented the minimum standard."
"Back in 1995, the European Parliament's then Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs organised a major hearing on this."
"The outcome of that hearing was that the differences in transposal were leading to major problems in combating money laundering in Europe, as cooperation between the Member States was not functioning adequately either."
"For us in this House, the result - and there were two reports on this, one in 1996 and the other in 1998 - was that we called on the Commission to bring forward a second directive in order to raise standards in Europe, and in particular to extend the list of predicate offences and the list of professions covered."
"At that time we suggested that the professions covered should include dealers in luxury items, casinos, auctioneers and also solicitors, notaries and other providers of legal advice."
"The Commission then brought forward its proposal in 1999, but we considered that at least as far as providers of legal advice were concerned, it was not sufficiently sensitive."
"As you know, since the Charter of Nice at least, citizens have the right to legal advice and representation, and this is also rooted in various national constitutions."
"This can only be effectively guaranteed if those citizens are also in a position to give their legal adviser any information safe in the knowledge that this will be kept confidential and that their legal adviser will not phone the public prosecutor the next day and pass on this information."
"That is why Parliament was concerned to preserve this right at first reading, while at the same time effectively combating money laundering in Europe."
"This then went into the conciliation procedure, and I believe that the compromise which emerged was a good one."
"The Council gave ground on the Member States being allowed, in accordance with their own legal traditions, to let legal advice continue to be covered by the obligation of professional secrecy."
"On the other hand, Parliament also gave some ground, by not demanding that this arrangement should be made compulsory, but that it should instead be at the discretion of national legislatures."
"Article 6(3) therefore gives all Member States the option, depending on their own national legal traditions, of providing for the obligation of professional secrecy to be observed in the area of legal advice."
"Exactly the same procedure was followed for other contentious points, and some excellent compromises were reached on those too."
"The subject of tipping off, in other words a ban on information given to one's legal adviser being passed on to others, has also been solved by means of a compromise under Article 6(3), that is to say by means of a discretionary arrangement."
"The issue of what should be done with information received in this way and which is in the hands of the public prosecutor's office has been left at the discretion of national legislatures."
"To put it simply, all the parties involved finally said that they were not 100% satisfied with this compromise, nor was it ideal, but they could live with it."
"That is exactly what a good compromise is about, and I would therefore like to recommend to this House that it should accept the proposal that has emerged from the Conciliation Committee, thus making a substantial contribution to strengthening the fight against money laundering in Europe."
"Against the background of the present situation, and the need to combat terrorism, this is an important factor."
"On the other hand, we have accordingly also managed to ensure that our citizens' fundamental rights have been preserved without any need to interfere with mature national legal traditions which in some cases are of a constitutional nature."
"All in all, a good compromise then, please vote for it."
"Mr President, I represent a minority."
"The new Recital 16 says that there is an obligation to report suspicions ""if the legal counsellor is taking part in money laundering activities, the legal advice is provided for money laundering purposes, or the lawyer knows that the client is seeking legal advice for money laundering purposes""."
"That is going too far."
"That is why I am voting against this."
"It would destroy the integrity of advice."
"It also has a second implication which has not up to now been the case under our existing legislation: in all three cases the legal counsellor or lawyer would be committing a criminal offence."
"He would therefore also have to denounce himself."
"That is totally unheard of anywhere in the world."
"I am fairly sure that even in the Stone Age there was no law saying that."
"For some inexplicable reason, the Commission has felt moved for the first time ever in law to adopt a legal provision whereby one must denounce oneself."
"I certainly cannot vote for that."
"Lessing comes to mind, who said that if enlightenment is only a small light glimmering in the darkness, there is at least still some hope in the world."
"You have made the same mistake as with the OLAF legislation, which in the end has even penetrated into Members' offices."
"You will be stopped there."
"This could not stand up to constitutional scrutiny."
"When we were debating the OLAF legislation, I said that the European Union as a whole had had a rush of regulatory blood to the head."
"We seem to have a similar phenomenon again here."
"I also regard it as a matter for great regret that the legal profession has shown so little backbone on this issue."
"Mr President, one of the biggest gaps in the anti-money laundering regime has been that it only applied to financial institutions."
"As successive international reports have made clear, lawyers and other professionals become vulnerable to exploitation as unwitting accomplices in the washing of dirty money from criminals and terrorists as banks tighten up, which, I am glad to say, they are at last having to do."
"I regard the outcome of the conciliation on this directive as satisfactory if it is interpreted in a common sense way."
"That means that lawyers, accountants and tax advisers must, outside a strict definition of legal privilege, report transactions that are suspicious, in other words, that they have reason to believe their client is involved in money laundering."
"This is the only feasible interpretation."
"There has been a huge amount of hype on this directive aimed at protecting lawyers' vested interests and not, I am afraid to say, individual rights."
"This has delayed the finalisation of the directive for an unnecessary six months."
"Parliament has not exactly covered itself with glory."
"I hope all Member States will declare that they have no intention of invoking the option to exempt lawyers from the ban on tipping off clients that the authorities have been alerted."
"We need to make sure that our legal and financial systems are not exploited, rather than concentrating on the position of the lawyers themselves and their own self-interest."
"Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on succeeding in achieving a sensible joint proposal on the more important points of this report in codecision."
"However, the Radical Members of the Bonino List will not be able to vote for this report because it has two shortcomings: the first concerns the joint text itself which gives the Member States' the right to use information obtained through proceedings combating money laundering for other types of investigations as well."
"This point introduces the danger that, in actual fact, the investigating authorities might use investigations into money laundering to obtain special powers as a way to get round the rules, so to speak, a way to get round the normal protection rights governing information obtained during proceedings on other issues."
"The second point on which we have reservations is more general: it is the recommendation that the fight against money laundering should be seen as the priority."
"In our opinion, if we are to win the battle, if we are to strike at the profits of criminal organisations, our most urgent priority should be to legalise drugs."
"This text was adopted on the wave of events following the attacks of 11 September."
"We must not forget that Afghanistan, which we are currently attacking with military force, is responsible for 80% of the world' s opium production."
"Well then, maybe a policy of legalising drugs would be a more effective way of reducing the power of the drug barons than pursuing their capital throughout the world."
"Mr President, the thorny problem in the text before us is, of course, the balance between the legally recognised obligation of professional secrecy, on the one hand, and, on the other, the duty to pass information which assists the fight against money laundering to the appropriate authorities."
"The money-laundering directive imposes a string of obligations on credit and financial institutions, with the result that money launderers have simply switched to other sectors, hence the need to extend the scope of the directive to other professions."
"Whilst we of course welcome more stringent measures, they should not lead to a watering down of the obligation of professional secrecy for various professions, and above all for lawyers, notaries and tax consultants."
"Mr Rothley is right in saying that the text before us is chipping away at the principle of nemo tenetur se ipsum accusare, no one is bound to incriminate himself."
"However, that is the very compromise that we think is workable, and we believe that the need to balance professional secrecy on the one hand and the need to bring criminals to book on the other has been solved in an acceptable way, and we shall therefore be voting in favour of this."
"Mr President, I wish to congratulate and thank the rapporteur."
"Because of your commitment, we have been able to see off the attack the Council and Commission were making on the fundamental rights and rights to defence of Europe's citizens."
"It is not acceptable for defence counsel, solicitors, tax consultants and notaries simply to be turned into part of the public prosecution service."
"It is also evident that the battle to maintain rights to defence is not over yet."
"The directive still has to be transposed into national legislation, and we must continue to argue that it should not be subject to an excessively narrow interpretation at national level, thus restricting citizens' fundamental rights and rights to defence."
"However, I can also assure you that I will be making representations to the appropriate Austrian authorities to make sure that precisely this does not happen."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Commission, I welcome very much the agreement which has been reached by Parliament and the Council."
"Delegations in the conciliation procedure on the proposal for a second money laundering directive have given their support to this compromise proposal, and the Commission is duly appreciative."
"I should like in particular to thank the rapporteur, Mr Lehne, and also vice-president Provan for co-chairing the conciliation meeting, for their determined efforts to reach an agreement which, as I have said, is very much welcomed by the Commission."
"The Commission proposal to update and extend the 1991 anti-money-laundering directive - which Parliament called for as early as 1995, as was mentioned quite rightly this morning - has raised difficult and sensitive issues of which the Commission is fully aware."
"Not least, the involvement of the professions in the anti-money-laundering defences has attracted the attention of many people interested in this subject and, in particular, Members of this Parliament."
"The Commission believes that the joint text agreed in the conciliation procedure constitutes a good compromise, taking account of the legitimate concerns of both Parliament and the Council."
"The fight against money laundering is an essential aspect of the fight against serious and organised crime."
"Since the tragic events of 11 September, it has also become an integral part of the fight against the financing of terrorism."
"The proposal before us now, to strengthen the European Union's anti-money-laundering defences, has aroused great interest in the world outside the European Union, not least in the so-called financial action task force which is in the process of updating its 40 recommendations."
"So to sum up, I commend the joint text to Parliament and I look forward to the earliest possible adoption and implementation of this important new directive."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"Approximation of civil and commercial law"
"The next item is the report (A5-384/2001) by Mr Lehne, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the approximation of the civil and commercial law of the Member States [COM(2001) 398 - C5-0471/2001 - 2001/2187(COS)]."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this too is a very important report."
"What is it about?"
"It is about the fact that although the internal market in Europe is becoming ever more integrated, there are also various deficits, as we all know."
"The Commission, the Parliament and the Council have been trying for many years to achieve joint legislation, particularly in the field of consumer protection."
"In the communication on contract law which the Commission has brought forward, and which is also referred to in this report, the Commission covered in detail the position on the common body of law which already exists in the European Union, and also referred to all the directives already in existence in this field."
"However, if you take a closer look at these directives, you will see that they are not always necessarily consistent."
"It is quite conceivable for there to be a contract entered into between a purchaser and a vendor in which the purchaser may have to sign three different cancellation statements with different cancellation deadlines, because totally different deadlines are found in different directives, such as the distance-selling directive and other directives."
"It is pretty obvious that this does little for consumer protection and is sheer nonsense."
"That is why it is necessary for this common body of law to be consolidated and summarised to achieve a common result."
"There are many reasons why this situation has come about."
"It can be explained, in part, simply by the fact that within the European institutions totally different directorates-general, committees and Councils were responsible for individual aspects, and of course they always looked at things from their own isolated point of view, which then led to quite different end results."
"So up to now there has not been an integrated approach, an integrated view of the approximation of civil rights."
"I think it is a very good thing that following the decisions taken at the Tampere Council, the Commission now intends, just like this House, to adopt an integrated approach in future."
"This is a matter of urgent necessity, as the volume of cross-border trade is on the increase in Europe."
"There are two key factors which explain this."
"The first is, of course, the introduction of the euro next year."
"A second factor is the impact of modern technology, and I only have to mention electronic commerce."
"If, in the future, you order goods or other commodities via electronic commerce, you will have no idea, or, at least, you frequently will not have, of where the company you are dealing with is based."
"This is leading to an inevitable growth in cross-border trade."
"That is why I believe that it is also necessary for us to develop more common definitions of offences and a broader common body of Community law."
"The present electronic commerce directive, which we in this House supported, is not therefore, as we already know, an ideal solution."
"As the country of origin principle applies here, whereas in the case of consumer rights law the country of destination principle applies, this can lead in practice to situations such as a district court judge in Cologne having to apply Irish law in parallel with German law."
"I would not mind betting that this will lead to considerable problems when only trifling amounts are at stake and with bread-and-butter legal cases."
"This demonstrates that we need to develop a broader common body of law in future."
"My report now envisages, with the support of many expert groups who have been calling for this for a long time, that the Commission should continue its work by means of an action plan covering several years."
"At the end of that process, and this is my belief at least, the result should be a common body of law within the European Union, for cross-border transactions at least, which is as extensive as possible."
"With regard to transparency, I believe that this is necessary, not only for consumers, but also for businesspeople, and this also applies to legal certainty, legal practicality and the application of the law."
"I therefore wish to ask the House to give its approval to the proposal emanating from the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on this report regarding the approximation of the civil and commercial law of the Member States."
"This is, as it were, the starting pistol for the Commission's work."
"I know that the Council is currently considering this matter in parallel with ourselves, and that it is intended to deal with this subject at the Laeken Summit."
"I believe that everyone in Europe has recognised that this issue is of a very high priority, and that progress needs to be made with this work."
"In order to exert a little bit of pressure, I think that we should approve this action plan."
"Mr President, this is a rather peculiar cooperation procedure between Parliament and the Commission, at an initial phase of the Commission' s work."
"The communication presented to us by the Commission referred to a limited aspect of the harmonisation of private law, specifically contract law, and the report presented by Mr Lehne deals which a much wider scope, because it refers to the harmonisation of private law in general."
"We, in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, considered that contract law was probably too narrow a scope and that it would not be sufficient to produce harmonisation of private law in general, which is necessary, as Mr Lehne pointed out, above all within the framework of the introduction of the euro and of the generalisation of European contracts."
"The Commission' s communication is very broad, given the aspects it deals with and the questions it poses."
"We, in Parliament, clearly cannot work intensely and on time, as we would have liked, but we can make some observations."
"I will focus on one: the possibility that, in relation to harmonisation, more reference should be made to the regulation and less to the directive."
"Because we are seeing that every time a Community directive is adopted, it gives rise to fifteen different national legislations, which leads us to think that we are possibly not achieving the objective of harmonisation, but quite the opposite, because the Community directive paradoxically leads to discrepancies in the development of each national legislation."
"I know that this is a difficult issue, because there is still legislative zeal of a national nature, but it is one of the possibilities for development by means of Community legislation, instead of merely indirect harmonisation via a directive."
"I must stop here through lack of time, but not without congratulating the Commission on its initiative and the rapporteur on his report."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate our rapporteur on taking this important issue forward and also to congratulate the Commission on a very good consultation document on contract law."
"We have made a good start in what is a very politically sensitive area."
"Although we might see the practical arguments for moving forward because of the advent of the euro and because of e-commerce, we have to ensure that our citizens are also comfortable with this."
"Every time we talk about approximation of core civil law subjects, I see scare stories in the English press that English common law is about to be replaced by the Code Napoléon, complete with a small picture of Napoleon."
"Last week English contract law was supposed to be under threat."
"However misguided some of this comment might be, we have to respect the concerns and deal with them."
"The process outlined in this report will allow us to do so."
"The Commission has made some very pragmatic suggestions about contract law, which I hope the Council will act on."
"It was, after all, the Council that brought forward this idea of convergence in the Tampere agenda."
"We must insist that the area of freedom and justice referred to there is as much about civil law as about criminal law."
"The Tampere conclusions foresaw convergence in civil law."
"Convergence is a long process, not an abrupt event."
"It is not about imposing a European civil code."
"It is about channelling and guiding developments in Community law to give us a more coherent and less piecemeal approach, ultimately allowing more knowledge of the law and greater access to justice across Europe's internal market."
"In considering these matters, we would do much better to concentrate on what draws us together in Europe's common legal heritage."
"All our legal traditions owe something to the early modern fusion of feudal, Roman and canon law called ius commune."
"We now have the chance to guide and structure the modern reconvergence of our legal systems."
"We should welcome that opportunity."
"Mr President, there was a time when Europeans travelled all over the universities of Europe and studied what was still a common law based on the Roman law."
"Indeed, in my own country, Scotland, that lasted until the 17th century, during which 6000 members of the Faculty of Advocates of Scotland at various times studied in the universities of Utrecht and Leiden."
"That kind of interaction of lawyers is one of the things which contributed most to our civilisation and from which our legal civilisation has grown."
"So this is a very good project and the time-tabling suggested by Mr Lehne and the Commission is feasible and worthwhile."
"Nevertheless, as Mrs Wallis has said, legal traditions are valued objects."
"People concern themselves greatly about the coherence and integrity of a legal order."
"Therefore it must be with great sensitivity that we move forward in bringing back together again legal systems and legal traditions through the kinds of common definition that Mr Lehne is suggesting."
"With that in mind, I have one doubt and it involves a difference with what Mr Medina Ortega has just said."
"Clause 14 of the report suggests that a regulation is really the best way to take this forward."
"The difficulty relates to subsidiarity."
"If these things are to be done well, common definitions will have to be sensitively adapted and grafted into what are very deep and organic legal traditions."
"You cannot do that by thrusting a regulation down the throats of the legal community."
"We in the United Kingdom have two legal systems, rather distinct, and it is going to be absolutely vital for this development that both are adequately and properly represented in further discussions, as they have been on bodies like the Lando Commission in the past."
"Mr President, I would first like to strike a critical note, because although the rapporteur explained the need for haste to the committee and I also understand that, I believe that there should not be fast-track procedures of this kind, because they can lead to botch-ups."
"However, I would like to specifically exclude the rapporteur's report from that comment."
"I am totally in agreement with the content of the report, because approximation of Community law as it applies to SMEs is also absolutely necessary if we are to increase legal certainty for cross-border contracts, especially in view of the forthcoming enlargement of the Union."
"It would be irresponsible to create free trade areas without making provision for the necessary instruments to keep commercial trade on track."
"However, it is my belief, and this is something that Mr MacCormick just touched upon, that the mature traditions underpinning the legal systems of the Member States impose certain limitations on the approximation of civil and commercial law, and that a failure to respect those traditions would inevitably lead to the opposite of what we are trying to achieve."
"However, I believe that these problems have been adequately addressed and that it is also possible to achieve this objective, which we will therefore be supporting."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Lehne, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to know how many legal transactions have taken place in the European Union during the last 15 minutes, while we have been debating."
"Would it be a million, 10 million or even 100 million?"
"Whatever, I believe that it must be a large figure."
"We are in a world of what in German we call ""Massengeschäfte"" a term that is not perhaps particularly easy to translate into other languages - bread-and-butter transactions, perhaps."
"I am sure that only a fraction of these legal transactions will have been cross-border, and I am equally sure that these transactions, ranging from Lapland to Sicily, from Scotland to Bavaria, will have been conducted according to totally different traditions and customs."
"That is why we need to be clear that this is a very sensitive area and however ambitious we may be, we still need to proceed very carefully and prudently."
"Mrs Wallis has already referred to the reaction in the United Kingdom, for example."
"So I think it is reasonable for the Commission to propose in its Option II that we should initially work out some general legal principles."
"One expert very appositely said that the problem with legal convergence is not so much the rules as the exceptions."
"We have discovered precisely that through our own work, in the case of warranty periods on purchases, interest on arrears, money laundering and also the takeover directive."
"General principles can be agreed quickly, but in contrast it is very difficult to harmonise which groups should be given special treatment and who qualifies for special protection."
"That is why we also need to set reasonable priorities for our work."
"The cross-border aspects should be prioritised in the first place."
"We need to achieve compatibility between European legislation and national legislation, but national legislative provisions also need to be made compatible with each other."
"Courts need to cooperate more effectively and mutual legal assistance needs to be guaranteed."
"I believe that these are concrete, practical steps that we can implement from one day to the next, which would assist legal transactions between our citizens within the single market."
"I think that in considering these matters, we should also deal with the concept of working towards a European law as an option for parties entering into contracts."
"They could therefore choose either to opt for a legal system created in Europe or else continue to use national law."
"As I see it, this would be a kind of soft harmonisation, setting in train a process of convergence which, Mr MacCormick, would be better than regulations adopted as an abrupt event, as Mrs Wallis put it."
"Against this background I would also like to say that Mr Lehne's draft does not, of course, reiterate the demands that we made in 1989 and 1994."
"At that time we demanded that a European Civil Code should be drawn up, but as far as I can see, that proposal has not been incorporated in the texts adopted in committee nor in the amendments."
"We have adopted a good, reasonable and cautious approach here."
"I would like to thank both the rapporteur and all those who helped with the hearing for their assistance."
"Mr President, by and large I agree with the rapporteur, and in the limited time I have available I can only mention one or two rather unrelated points."
"What we need to start with at EU level is coherent and homogeneous legislation."
"That is very often not the case, because terms are used which have a different meaning in other legal texts."
"Scarcely any academic research has been done into this aspect of Community law."
"So the first thing we should do is to ensure coherence and homogeneity in our own legal texts, and I would urge you to set up an expert committee to do this."
"That is one point."
"The other point that I would like to address is how this relates to international civil law."
"It seems to me that Mr Lehne has rather neglected this aspect in his report."
"International civil law can make an important contribution to overcoming the difficulties involved in cross-border legal disputes, and as a rule, and I am choosing my words very carefully now, international civil law is certainly not inferior to Community law, certainly as far as legal culture and the quality of legal texts are concerned."
"So if, as in the case of the directive on electronic commerce, you take issue with international civil law, the situation becomes very difficult indeed."
"We therefore need to examine once more to what extent we can retain international civil law."
"My final point concerns national regulations."
"I think this is an area where we should not overreach ourselves."
"That will be very difficult."
"I believe that it would be best for us to have convincing law making in the European Union."
"Mr President, I welcome this opportunity to congratulate Parliament and especially the Committee on Legal Affairs and its rapporteur, Mr Lehne, on its timely report on the approximation of the civil and commercial laws of the Member States."
"Given the forthcoming European Council in December in Laeken, for which this report will be of relevance, I am particularly pleased that the European Parliament is discussing this report here today."
"The European Council will therefore have at its disposal not only the Commission's communication and the Council's report, but also the report by the European Parliament, which handles this important issue in the necessary depth."
"The Commission also very much welcomes the report as Parliament's response to the Commission's consultation process, launched by the communication on European contract law."
"It is absolutely essential that the Commission should get as much feedback and input as possible from the other EC institutions so that it can establish its future approach in the area of contract law."
"One fundamental question confronts the Commission, as well as Parliament and the Council as the two branches of the European legislature."
"Should we continue with the existing piecemeal approach of harmonising European contract law in a very sector-specific way, as has been done for the past 20 years, or should we adopt a new approach?"
"It is obvious that if the existing approach corresponds to the needs of the European Union then we should continue it."
"If, however, there are problems despite, or possibly even because of, the existing approach, then we should be brave enough to change it."
"It was in order to get a reply to this fundamental question that the Commission adopted its communication on European contract law."
"The choice of our future approach is highly important for the smooth functioning of the internal market and the participation of consumers, small- and medium-sized enterprises and all other economic operators, as well as for the uniform application of Community law."
"We have already received a large number of constructive comments and reactions which confirm that the Commission's initiative is of great interest to all stakeholders."
"Of course not all the reactions point in the same direction, but this is inevitable with such a complex subject where so many issues are raised and different options need to be considered."
"The reactions will be examined in depth by the Commission."
"Obviously the Commission will attach great importance to Parliament's response to our communication which, once you have adopted it, will be very carefully analysed."
"The Commission will decide what suggestions it will make in the light of the reports from Parliament and the Council, the possible reaction from the European Council and the responses to our consultation process."
"I understand that the Council may ask the Commission to report to the Community institutions and the public on the consultation process, together with any observations and recommendations if necessary in the form of a Green or White Paper, not later than 31 December 2002."
"The European Parliament's proposal for an action plan is particularly relevant in this context."
"The Commission has taken due note of the ambitious deadlines for specific steps to be taken."
"In conclusion, I would like to express the Commission's thanks for the careful analysis that has gone into this report."
"If there are problems for the internal market and the uniform application of Community law which need to be tackled, it is obvious that whatever line we take this will be a longer term project of considerable importance."
"So, this is certainly not the last time that we will debate questions of European contract law in this House."
"I submitted the Commission communication to the college, together with my colleagues Mr Vitorino, Mr Bolkestein and Mr Liikanen."
"At the last Council meeting on the internal market and consumer affairs, I emphasised my strong personal interest in this matter, not only because I am convinced of its value but also because of my own professional background as a practising barrister and as international commercial arbitrator."
"For those who have expressed concern about the survival of the common law system: that is the system that I have worked in myself for 27 years and I have some attachment to it."
"Perhaps with that background it will be able to make sure that these issues and sensitivities are taken fully into account."
"This is an ambitious project but it is a feasible project."
"When I worked on contracts where arbitration was needed or on dispute had to be resolved, the ""applicable law"" was - lex mercatoria."
"What is that?"
"Those who have to enter into contracts with a term like that will feel perfectly comfortable with something a bit more rigid and rigorous, which is what all of us in this House are aiming at."
"My colleagues and I are therefore looking forward to constructive dialogue with Parliament and the other EC institutions in the future."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Byrne."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Arbitrary arrests and the political situation in Laos"
"The next item is the Commission statement on arbitrary arrests and the political situation in Laos."
"Mr President, I am honoured to make this declaration on behalf of the Commission on the arrests in Laos PDR."
"The Commission welcomes the release of the five members of the Transnational Radical Party who had been arrested on 26 October in Vientiane, Laos PDR, after staging a peaceful demonstration."
"We are particularly happy to see Mr Dupuis back."
"Their release followed 14 days of detention, during which the Commission and EU Member States made frequent contacts with the Laotian authorities to ensure a rapid resolution of the situation."
"At a public trial on 9 November, the detainees were found guilty of violating Laotian law."
"They were given suspended sentences before being released and expelled from the country."
"In relation to this incident, the Commission notes that the human rights situation in Laos PDR, including the case of the Laotian students who organised a demonstration for freedom and democracy in Laos PDR in October 1999, continues to give cause for concern."
"The Commission, together with the diplomatic missions of the EU Member States, is following the human rights situation in the country closely and participating in all EU démarches to the government of Laos PDR on these issues."
"Included in these issues are deficiencies in the rule of law."
"There are still a number of flaws in the administration of justice, notably cases of arbitrary arrest, lengthy pre-trial detention and lack of guarantees of due process."
"Many of these problems are exacerbated by the poor training of people working in the judicial system and the Commission has therefore offered assistance to the government of Laos PDR, both in reforming the system and in developing its human resources."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the arbitrary arrest of a Member of the European Parliament and a number of his fellow campaigners in Vientiane has put a severe strain on relations between the European Union and Laos."
"In the intervening period both the institutions of the European Union and also the Member States concerned have done everything in their power to secure the release of those arrested."
"In this context I would like to thank both the Commission and also the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, under the leadership of Elmar Brok, and also all those colleagues who have become involved in this issue."
"Those arrested have now been released again."
"The Italian government was particularly helpful in that it sent a government representative to Vientiane."
"This action was ultimately successful."
"I would also specifically like to thank the Ambassador of the Lao People's Democratic Republic, who made himself available for discussions with us both here and in Brussels and who obviously also had a very positive influence on events."
"Laos has been a single-party state since 1975, that is to say that it is not a democracy as we understand it."
"Places where there is no democracy and no freedom of choice usually do not have any constitutional checks either, and Laos is no exception to this."
"Despite this, the European Union has a cooperation agreement with Laos, and in this framework the European Union is assisting not only the development of that country but is also helping to encourage democracy and constitutionality."
"The ASEAN delegation accepted only this year that this assistance was indeed useful."
"There are some very good projects in which the European Union is involved."
"I would like to make it clear at this point that regardless of the unacceptable behaviour of the powers that be in Laos, we stand by our cooperation agreement and our willingness to provide assistance."
"I also concede that our concept of democracy and constitutionality does not necessarily have to be accepted by every country on this planet."
"In fact we need to ask ourselves every now and again if the European Parliament is really in a position to wave its finger at every country in the world and lecture them about democracy and constitutionality."
"Nevertheless, we do have our principles and they have been infringed in this case."
"We also intend to make sure that they are respected in future."
"But we are willing to carry on helping Laos, whose people are amongst the poorest in the world, and to contribute to ensuring that this country has a chance of achieving a degree of prosperity."
"However, we also want democracy and constitutionality to occupy their rightful place in Laos."
"Mr President, we are now feeling relieved as our fellow Member, Olivier Dupuis, is fortunately back with us."
"We should, however, revisit the problems that we were discussing last week so that we are somewhat less hesitant, should we have the misfortune to be in this situation again in the future."
"First of all, we were facing some serious human rights issues."
"Can a country detain individuals, without any form of trial, particularly foreign nationals who publicly campaign for democracy and human rights and condemn the breaches committed by the host country?"
"Even if Laotian law permitted this type of ban on demonstrations, it goes without saying that the immediate arrest of peaceful demonstrators was completely disproportionate."
"Furthermore, it is natural for the European Union to be vigilant about whether or not a country like Laos observes the clause on human rights enshrined in the cooperation agreement that it signed."
"Secondly, we were facing an institutional challenge that directly concerned the European Parliament, since one of the detainees was an MEP."
"Of course, Mr Dupuis never asked for preferential treatment."
"The European Parliament cannot, however, remain indifferent to how one of its members is treated."
"The credibility and the honour of our institution, and even that of the European Union as a whole, depend on this."
"This must be clear to everyone so that if we ever have the misfortune to be in this situation again, everyone has a role: the Commission, the Council, the High Representative, the Member States, Parliament, particularly the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy will react quickly and know exactly what to do and how to do it."
"In fact, everyone did take the appropriate action, and we should welcome this."
"We now need to do everything we can in order to encourage Laos to move forward, which is the purpose of the resolution that we shall be voting on this week."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to welcome the Prince Regent and the members of the Laotian royal family, the leaders and those in charge of the Laotian human rights organisations, my friends, Massimo Lensi and Bruno Mellano, who were my companions-in-arms during the demonstration and over the following days in Laos."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would once again like to thank you and President Fontaine, and all of you who supported the purpose of our action, which was and still is to free the five student leaders who were arrested in 1999 and about whom we still have no news today."
"I think that the issue that we raised is, of course, much wider, it concerns democracy, and the globalisation of democracy."
"At the beginning of the 1990s, Laos launched a process to bring about democratic change that, during the first five years, took the form of a number of openings in the economic sector."
"Since 1995, however, we have witnessed an extremely serious drift, a transformation of the Communist regime into an utterly 'clepto-Communist' regime, or rather into a hybrid of clepto-Communism and narco-Communism."
"This is extremely serious."
"The people of Laos face this every day, and they are dying in their thousands at the hands of this regime."
"Tens of thousands of Laotians, starting with the royal family of Laos, have quite simply been murdered in dribs and drabs."
"The European Union, and also the Member States, must therefore understand the tragic nature of the situation in Laos."
"We should first of all understand that the Stalinists and the drug traffickers who are running this country are preventing the democrats, both inside and outside Laos, and also those in favour of reform within the regime, from promoting reforms."
"Instead of continuing to support politically correct projects, such as the promotion of women, the promotion of rural development, the protection of the environment, which, albeit worthwhile, do not tackle the root of the problem, the European Union should specifically attack the root of the problem which is democratic change, penal code reform, constitutional reform and guarantees of fundamental rights."
"And I do not believe that the Commission and the Member States are doing what they should be doing in this area."
"We must therefore change our policy, re-focus on law and on the promotion of law, and this is what we are attempting to do with the text of this resolution."
"Mr President, I welcome the release of Mr Dupuis and our other four Radical friends from prison, but, at the same time, I am extremely concerned for the other five political detainees who are still being detained under arbitrary arrest."
"We are concerned for their fate but what concerns us most is the fact that there has been no news of them at all for two years."
"I am appalled by the unnecessary delay with which this institution reacted to the violence suffered by Mr Dupuis and the other Radical activists."
"Lastly, Mr President, I would like to express my concern at a complex case of hypocrisy which Parliament and the European institutions have failed to address: on the one hand, they regularly, emotionally, bring up the issue of human rights, for the protection of human rights is a symbol of our political prowess and pride, yet, on the other, they are reluctant to apply the clause providing for the suspension of economic and commercial relations with those countries which systematically violate these rights, and not just in the case of Laos."
"We should not be asking Parliament to teach the world democracy: rather, we should be demanding the greatest possible consistency from our institutions."
"Thank you very much, Mr Fava."
"I have received a motion for resolution pursuant to Rule 37 (2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"Services of general interest in Europe"
"The next item is the report (A5-0361/2001) by Mr Langen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission communication 'Services of General Interest in Europe' [COM(2000) 580 - C5-0399/2001 - 2001/2157(COS)]."
"Mr President, general interest services are services of both an economic and non-economic nature which are geared towards the public interest and in whose provision both the public at large and the state have a special interest."
"In the various Member States of the European Union, this includes supplying the public with services in the fields of energy, water, waste disposal, transport, telecommunications, post, media, finance and insurance, a basic social, educational and training system, social services, external and internal security, a judiciary and a system of registration."
"You will see from this broad span of services how wide-ranging this subject is."
"Why are we concerned with this area?"
"Because some Member States, and, in particular, Germany, have questioned the power of the Commission to take decisions under Article 86 of the EC Treaty, and have also challenged the enactment of secondary Community law such as the transparency directive."
"I believe that there is no justification for the fears of the Länder and municipalities that competition law will greatly undermine their powers and destroy the existing network of mature, tried and tested general interest structures."
"Today we wish Parliament to adopt an opinion on the decisions to be taken by the Heads of State and Government in Laeken, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues very sincerely for their cooperation on this issue."
"We have been trying for over a year, by means of hearings and a great many debates, to identify a common line."
"The Commission's behaviour on this issue has been objective and I think I can say successful."
"I would therefore like to thank the Commission, which I see is still represented here."
"The Commission has comprehensively described the Community law framework."
"It has presented the principles of neutrality, freedom of definition and proportionality, which we support, and in response to the question of how more legal certainty is to be achieved, it has proposed the use of exempting regulations and case-by-case decisions."
"This is one of the questions that have to be resolved."
"Whereas a good many Members favour an amendment to Article 16, we have agreed to propose a framework directive on the basis of Article 95, the internal market article, which will allow all unresolved issues to be settled, and using the codecision procedure, this is not to be a Council regulation or a Commission instrument, but a directive under the codecision procedure, so that we will be able to fully participate in decision making on these marginal issues under competition law."
"There were two pivotal points in the debate: to what extent can we maintain structures that have developed along traditional lines or need to be opened up with regard to free markets and competition?"
"Secondly, to what extent is it permissible for the state to subsidise general interest services?"
"And if so, is there a difference between public and private companies?"
"What general interest services come under EU law?"
"Activities not included are all those of a non-economic nature and those that are purely national."
"What does this cover?"
"EU competition law assumes that companies are involved and in this case we have the controls on state aid under Articles 87 to 89."
"The internal market rules refer to economic activities, and in particular the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services."
"In addition, there are activities relating to sovereignty which the state has effectively reserved to itself, and there are institutions which do not fall into this category, which are neither companies nor state institutions, the ""independent charitable associations"" or not-for-profit organisations which the Commission refers to in its observations on Article 30, as do we."
"The EU's competition rules and the internal market rules are not applicable to purely internal national matters."
"This is particularly relevant to general interest services at regional and local level."
"If they are applicable, then there are exemption arrangements, such as the de minimis rule, such as aids for culture and such as the exempting regulations for small and medium-sized enterprises and other bodies."
"For this reason, the Commission has given us a head start by means of this framework, and one with which we basically agree, in cases where we want to establish legal certainty on issues that we have openly debated and in cases where we want to declare the free market, competition in the market, to be a fundamental principle."
"I would like to ask honourable Members to actively support the compromise that we worked out in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to heartily congratulate Mr Langen and will limit myself to just one aspect of a special public provision situation, that is, the cultural dimension in the audio-visual field, in other words public television and radio."
"I was in favour of the introduction of private-sector television from the very outset, as I still am, whilst being convinced, in the final analysis, that we must work on the assumption that a public-service broadcasting remit is necessary."
"Two particular aspects must be highlighted here: on the one hand the obligation to provide a service to all, that is, overall popular provision under appropriate conditions, and on the other the obligation to reflect the pluralistic nature of our society."
"The dual broadcasting system has proved itself."
"There would be no sense in constantly requiring the public broadcasters to justify every single programme."
"A balanced programme needs leeway."
"What is also certain is that we cannot allow taxes and licence fees to finance the creation of a public-service copy of the private-sector service providers."
"The public media need leeway, but also clarification of their role and standards for fulfilling it."
"It is in this respect that the communication from the Commission is particularly to be welcomed."
"It also needs to be made clear, however, that, in the case of services with social welfare in mind, the type of transmission - be it terrestrial or videostreaming - cannot be crucial."
"What matters are the objectives to be safeguarded, our democratic foundational principles, pluralism and free access to culture and to technological progress."
"We must of course guarantee the protection of the users, especially of the young."
"In terms of competition law, the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, must restrict itself to watching out for misuse."
"It must continue to respect and defend the competence of Member States as regards the content of programmes."
"Regulatory authority must then remain with the Member States, and it is therefore incumbent on them too to determine financial and organisational structures."
"I welcome the fact the Commission and the Council are endeavouring to come to an arrangement with the Member States about this."
"Mr President, Mr Philippe Herzog, who is the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee, is currently in Qatar as a member of the Parliamentary WTO Delegation and has, therefore, asked me to present the opinion of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on his behalf."
"This was adopted by the Committee almost unanimously, with only one member casting a blank vote."
"The draftsman does not share the Commission' s view that compliance with the rules governing competition and the internal market is fully compatible with safeguarding the supply of services of general interest."
"The problem arising is how to safeguard the supply of such services."
"The draftsman proposes the creation of a European joint responsibility framework to cover services of general interest."
"He considers that more open and more democratic regulation is a necessity, also in the conditions that will prevail following the potential enlargement of the EU."
"The draftsman wishes to make the tasks clearer and at the same time to strengthen the communities' and states' freedom of choice regarding the selection of a model for safeguarding these services and the type of administration to be set up for this purpose."
"While the current market philosophy and rules of competition encourage privatisation, the EU should retain the principle of diversity, or in other words, there should be a number of options to choose from."
"On the basis of these arguments the committee has adopted an opinion according to which the gradual process of freeing service industries must be implemented in parallel with retaining general services."
"The principle according to which it is up to the Member States, within their own territories, to retain their cultural habits and political views has also been adopted."
"The Member States should have the right to ensure that services of general interest are also provided to the less advantaged of their citizens."
"In paying particular attention to the problems presented by the financing and its safeguarding, the committee in its opinion shares the draftsman' s concern about the necessity to safeguard general services."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Langen, ladies and gentlemen, in a changing world in which global competition is growing and, indeed, becoming ever tougher, public services are among the essential cornerstones of the European social model."
"Citizens, and indeed enterprises, of today, work on the assumption that a broad spectrum of such services will be generally available, with high quality and at affordable prices."
"By 'services of general interest' is understood activities engaged in for the general good and therefore linked by the authorities with specific social welfare obligations and benefits."
"Such services make a significant contribution to improving citizens' quality of life and thus play a significant part in maintaining the social, human and geographical cohesion of the European Union."
"The subsidiarity principle clarifies responsibilities at regional and national level."
"The meaning of 'social welfare interest' is laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"It has therefore been important for me as President of the Austrian Welfare Service to clarify my position with respect to the major social institutions and health organisations, with the Red Cross, Caritas, the Welfare Service, the sports clubs, the fire brigades, the parishes and towns."
"It was also important for me to observe that the specifically rural areas are involved, that the candidate countries through which the EU is to be enlarged are involved and that the significance of 'non profit organisations' in the service of the public is clearly expressed."
"Today's report contributes to greater humanity in everyday life."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I think it is useful for Parliament to issue an opinion today on the report by Mr Langen, since the report is rather topical."
"I think it is useful for us to issue an opinion prior to the Laeken European Council, as we are expecting this Council to give a great impetus to the redrafting of the notorious framework directive, the principle of which the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is proposing that you adopt."
"Furthermore, as regards the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, day after day I see judgments being passed, which show just how far ahead case law is on this issue, in comparison to our legislation."
"In a judgment dated 25 October 2001, this case law again justified certain restrictions on competition where these are necessary for carrying out the task in question in order to achieve economic and social balance."
"So, when you consider the timeliness of this framework directive, you must also consider the organisation of services of general interest."
"And, from that point of view, this would mean knowing which authority is responsible for services of general interest."
"In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, we are calling for all levels of the European Union to be involved, whether at European or local level, both in defining the scope of services of general interest as well as in the ways that they are organised."
"Our concern relates to consistency between the general approach towards services of general interest and the sectoral approach."
"This is because there is no point defining the framework if there is a lack of cohesion between one sector and another."
"Our group will therefore oppose a number of paragraphs which fall within a sectoral approach that we will not support."
"I would lastly like to touch on the issue of funding."
"The Commission recently proposed a new text which deals with an exemption regime in the sector of services of general interest."
"We shall support this proposal which we believe must be supplemented by an approach that enables cross-funding, without which adjustments are not possible, and that threatens, over the long term, the functioning of general interest services."
"Mr President, it is, of course, vital to assess the phenomenon of services of general interest and the implications thereof for the European citizen."
"In our view, the basic objective in this connection should be to step up competition in favour of the citizen and to determine the pre-conditions on that basis."
"The concept of services of general interest should be a matter to be decided upon by the Member States, and subsidiarity should be a keyword in this connection."
"It is essential to accomplish the internal market in the way it was agreed in Lisbon."
"That is why, in the interest of the citizen, swift progress should be made with the ongoing liberalisation of postal services, transport, electricity and gas - and water as well, as far as I am concerned."
"Current liberalisation has contributed greatly to the competitiveness of European businesses and has also benefited the European citizen."
"Citizens should have a choice, particularly in the case of products which are so important in everyday life."
"Citizens must be regarded as consumers rather than objects."
"That is why services of general interest must be provided in a competitive manner everywhere."
"It is important for a sufficient number of market operators to enter the market, and that is why the same conditions of access must apply to public and private businesses alike."
"The citizen also benefits from clarity in the field of prices, bills and supplies."
"In addition, high quality must be delivered."
"This should, of course, go hand in hand with the correct and prompt handling of complaints."
"Efficiency, for example with a view to an improved guarantee of supply, should also be on the agenda."
"Furthermore, the market for other products, such as water, must be opened up so that the citizen can reap the benefits there too."
"With regard to the drafting of a framework directive, I would prefer to await the Commission position in Laeken."
"At the moment, we are actually opposed to a framework directive."
"We must carefully consider whether such a directive is in fact necessary, and we should only draft legislation if it is required."
"We should not make it more opaque than it already is."
"On a final note, I should like to thank the rapporteur, including for the consultation he has entered into with all of us."
"In all honesty, I thought his original proposal was the best and the Commission has since then made every effort to tone things down."
"Our voting behaviour will therefore be able to hit quite a critical note in that respect."
"Mr President, Commissioner, with regard to the decisions taken in recent years by the Council and the European Parliament on the opening up to competition of hitherto protected sectors, in other words, monopolies, it has become clear that we must have solid legal bases in order to guarantee and develop services of general interest that are economically accessible to everyone and which therefore give substance to the status of citizens of the European Union."
"In our view, the current economic situation and the numerous job losses that have been announced in recent weeks, coupled with the fact that, even during a period of strong growth, we have had an average unemployment rate of 8% in recent years, highlight the absolute need to develop services of general interest."
"This is why our group fully supports the voluntarist guidelines drawn up, in the main, by the European Confederation of Trade Unions and by the European Liaison Committee on services of general interest."
"Article 16 of the Treaty of Amsterdam was a major step forward for Europe."
"It is now deemed to be insufficient, and that is why we are supporting the draft framework directive and the amendments tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance."
"We expect the Laeken European Council, part of which will be dedicated to the European Union' s objectives, to clearly set forth this objective on services of general interest and the framework directive as well as a timetable."
"What is at stake is of crucial importance."
"As in the case of procedures for public procurement contracts, which the Zappala report tackled, and as in the case of a particular sector such as public transport, which the Meijer report dealt with, we are required to adopt a framework for the policy on European competition, to develop a policy on regulated competition, to enable national, regional or local public authorities, in line with the principle of subsidiarity, to determine the missions of general interest services, the management contract that is to be fulfilled by the operators and the funding of these missions."
"This is the purpose of Amendment Nos 52 and 55 that we have tabled."
"We also think that we must insist on carrying out a much more in-depth evaluation on the liberalisation of sectors, taking into consideration the interests of consumers and workers and the compatibility of market guidelines with the objectives of sustainable development - I am thinking of the water sector, for example - and not only from a technical point of view, but equally through dialogue with all the actors involved."
"This is the purpose of Amendment Nos 44 and 46."
"The fact that it was necessary to present the various amendments to the House once again obviously indicates that what I have just said about objectives, and above all, about the resources to be implemented, has not received unanimous support."
"Once again, in this field as in others, it is greater European integration that we need, whilst respecting the Community method and guaranteeing that public figures at all levels take the proper action to ensure the provision of general interest services."
"Mr President, faced with the process of liberalisation and deregulation currently underway in the European Union, moves for proposals to be put forward and action to be taken in the field of public services have built up."
"The contribution of these has led to the fact that Article 16 of the Treaty of Amsterdam recognises the essential role of services of general interest in ensuring social and territorial cohesion."
"The Commission' s proposals, however, contain the usual double language."
"On the one hand, there is reference to the interests of citizens, and therefore to the need for services of general interest, whilst on the other, several of the Commission' s directives accentuate liberalisation and deregulation of public services."
"The Langen report supports the spirit of the Commission' s communication of September 2000 on services of general interest in Europe."
"The Commission acknowledges that competition cannot meet all the requirements of citizens and that Member States have good reason to set up and implement services of general interest."
"At the same time, however, the Commission states that the progress of liberalisation is positive and relies on the content of the Lisbon meeting of the Council of Ministers to step up this process."
"The report has been improved by the debate and the amendments."
"It has made a real effort to adopt a balanced position between liberalisation and public services, it also stresses that services of general interest must ensure equal access, security of supply and continuity."
"It also proposes to assess the actual impact of liberalisation before embarking on any new phases, as my group suggested on many occasions."
"However, we still have a long way to go before we meet the required demands for services of general interest that are worthy of the name."
"The Langen report claims to relentlessly pursue liberalisation in sectors such as transport, electricity and gas and the postal services. Furthermore, it believes that it is necessary to privatise the water industry."
"I think that services of general interest, as their name suggests, must be subject to the rights and obligations that the general interest demands."
"In other words, this means providing transparency, continuity and equality."
"We need a new European model of services of general interest that meets citizens' aspirations, and we must stop approaching this issue solely from the point of view of competition, as advocated in the report."
"That is why I do not think it is wise, and I think it could even be dangerous, to envisage a framework directive where we stick to this approach."
"Yes, I believe that we need safeguards."
"I am in favour of a framework directive on services of general interest on the condition that it maintains the social benefits that these provide in terms of employment, security and sustainable regional development."
"This directive should also ensure the respect of service obligations in terms of quality, equality, access for all users, and also by maintaining reserved areas allowing price offsetting on a geographical basis and on social grounds."
"I also think that all levels of the European Union must be involved."
"Our position will be related to whether or not a number of amendments are accepted."
"Mr President, this report on services of general interest in Europe deals with a field of tension between two significant blocs."
"It is about the issue of a unitary competitive order in Europe, and about the self-government of communities or, in other words, about subsidiarity."
"The focus of all this must always be the citizen, the consumer, and what services he receives, under what conditions and, above all, of what quality."
"There are two points I find important in the communication from the Commission."
"It always speaks of an economic activity, with 'an economic activity' being very hard to define exactly."
"If we in this House discuss what an economic activity is, the thinking of a very large number of Members is shaped by their national origin."
"Is an economic activity to be affirmed when an enterprise works in a particular line of business for profit?"
"Let me mention only ambulance services."
"The second is the issue of checking for misuse."
"The question here is not whether the Commission can check on this, but in what detail it should, so that over-restrictive requirements do not result in a definition of general interest by the back door."
"What is important is that we should be given communal responsibility and that we use it to choose one or other type of competition by means of public tender."
"I would like, finally, to re-emphasise one thing that is mentioned in the report, but not in the communication from the Commission, namely the market in water."
"For us in Germany and Austria, water is an extraordinarily important area."
"I believe that as a matter of urgency we should reject the opening of the market in water, brought about by means of a decision on an individual case in the European Union - and the Commission has already requested an assessment on the subject."
"We reject this decisively."
"Examination of the sector-specific situation is in any case needed first."
"I can therefore only warn the Commission not to take these steps."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one of the consequences of the internal market is that many things that were regulated in a quite specific way in the Member States are now subject to new and different rules."
"Services of general interest are now an outstanding example of this, an example made more problematic by the additional factor that the objectives of services of general interest are similar in the Member States."
"The instruments, however, sometimes differ significantly as a consequence not only of different cultural developments, but also of the Member States' differing administrative structures."
"The drawing-up of shared rules is not exactly made easier by this."
"The Member States must, however, continue in future to be able to decide what services they will categorise as being of general interest."
"On the other hand, the rules must be as similar as possible in a common internal market."
"Competition law, as laid down in the Treaty, provides on its own insufficient legal certainty when it comes to framing them."
"On the other hand, the objective should not be to empty European competition law of its meaning."
"It must therefore be interpreted in a binding way for the purposes of services of public interest."
"We accordingly call for a framework directive to determine the Community principles on which services of general interest are to be founded."
"This directive should lay down rules for the Member States."
"Above all, though, it should provide legal security for those who provide services of general interest."
"Thirdly, it should limit the space available for the Commission to exercise its discretion."
"Its executive monopoly should not be infringed, but as far as its decisions in individual cases and its block exemption regulations are concerned, I would like to see it laid down what, for example, are 'economic activities' and what are not."
"What falls at this arbitrary threshold?"
"When is intra-Community trade affected?"
"Above all, the many sectoral directives and regulations on which we are working at present must give direction to the legislative work in various sectors done by those of us in the European Parliament..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, the report is called 'Services of General Interest' in order to improve ways of handing over public services to private interests, and it calls for us to pursue liberalisation with unflinching determination."
"Contrary to the misleading assertions made in the report, privatisation brings about poorer services and social discrimination that affects those on the lowest incomes. Activities are reduced or withdrawn in order to avoid making private profit, and these are still just as essential to the population."
"And there can be no other approach."
"The private companies that benefit from the erosion of public services are motivated by making maximum profits for their shareholders and not by the need to satisfy the general interest as best they can."
"The policy to hand over public services to private interests is a policy pursued by the European institutions and the national governments, and represents a major social step backwards."
"Education, health, public transport, postal services, telecommunications, water and energy supply, and refuse collection must remain public services which must not generate profits..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, the EU is trusting in liberalisation to ensure that services of general interest are sufficiently available."
"If that means increased and fairer competition in postal services, transport, water supply, social services and so on, this can only be agreed to."
"If, though, simple considerations of cost mean that the quality of service drops, with ever fewer service providers being available and ever fewer people being employed, this proposal merits political resistance."
"State monopolies must not be replaced by private monopolies."
"Mr Langen, the rapporteur, has taken on board my suggestion that tasks of general interest should be acknowledged to be common European values."
"They contribute to the European social model and to the sustainable development of the EU's regions."
"The aim is to guarantee high standards of quality and safety, range of provision and continuity in a healthy price/service ratio."
"As before, the Member States' offers for tender will independently determine which yardstick to apply as regards environmental friendliness, availability and social standards."
"It is for the good of all citizens if these services are unambiguously defined in the context of a European law on the placing of contracts."
"Exceptions from the internal market's competition and market regulations should include local, social and charitable services which do not work with their eye on profit and are committed to meeting the needs of the weak and those on the margins of society."
"Citizens and service users are to be comprehensively involved in the Member States' and the Commission's efforts to make this agreement reality."
"New regulations on services of general interest in the EU will only be accepted if transparency and involvement are ensured."
"As a member not only of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs but also of that on Employment and Social Affairs, I recommend that this House approve this report, which is excellent because it is balanced."
"Mr President, I am concerned about a number of aspects in the Langen report."
"Initially we have to address this question of services of general interest from the point of view of the rights of citizens, for the rights of consumers are a subset of those rights."
"Citizenship confers rights which entitle one to various essential needs such as water, which is essential to human life."
"Water cannot be treated within the European Union simply as a commodity to be bought and sold."
"Europe is committed to the idea of a distinct social model based on solidarity."
"It is therefore essential that we have a legal framework, a regulatory framework, within which the Commission and Member States can address the question of competition as it affects social services, public services, and services of general interest."
"It is part of a democratic agenda for the European Union to ensure that we are accountable, that the services we provide are accountable, and that we have a Europe which is developed as a socially inclusive Europe."
"The economy has to be an instrument to serve the people, not simply to serve the market."
"Rights of the consumer being defined on the basis of purchasing power is not an adequate way to develop a cohesive social Europe."
"It is a Europe where politics is denigrated because it is simply based on people's capacity to buy or not to buy."
"Mr President, it is a particular pleasure to welcome the Langen report and the excellent work of the rapporteur in presenting a measured and forward-looking approach to the future provision of a category of services essential to our economy and to the wellbeing of all European citizens."
"The Commission has played its part by presenting two communications on this subject and most recently a report to the Laeken European Council."
"Essentially we are all inspired by the same will to ensure that every citizen in Europe has access to high-quality services of general interest."
"The European Union has direct responsibilities with regard to those sectors for which internal market legislation has been introduced, essentially for network industries."
"In each case, specific provisions have been devoted to public service obligations."
"All this legislation has been adopted under codecision and is continuing to evolve."
"The package of proposals on energy adopted by the Commission this spring comprises greatly strengthened elements relating to public service obligations."
"Member States have a duty to specify and implement those obligations."
"Elsewhere, in sectors not covered by specific Community legislation, Member States and their constituted authorities have the main role to play, for instance in the organisation and provision of local and social services."
"Here the Commission limits itself to ensuring compatibility with competition and internal market rules in general."
"Those rules, as emphasised by the Langen report, are quite flexible."
"In particular they provide for adequate financing of services of general interests."
"The Commission has repeatedly been requested to provide greater legal security with regard to the general competition and internal market rules applicable to services of general interest."
"By explaining and developing its approach, it has attempted to put the fears expressed by operators and others involved to rest."
"The Commission proposes to continue to use examples, guidelines and communications, together with proposals for regulations on exemptions, to provide further clarification, as called for in the Langen report."
"In its report to Laeken, the Commission has undertaken to establish a Community framework for state aid granted for services of general economic interest."
"That framework could, in particular, specify the conditions for the authorisation of state aid schemes by the Commission, thus alleviating the notification obligation for individual aid."
"This may lead to the adoption of a regulation exempting certain categories of aid from the obligation of prior notification."
"On the issue of a proposed framework directive, the Commission is not opposed in principle and has already agreed to assess the value and feasibility of such an instrument."
"Our doubts concern mainly the articulation between such a directive and legislation at sectoral level."
"In the light of the European Parliament's resolution, the Commission will look at the subject again."
"Another major issue concerns evaluation."
"I repeat that the Commission has every interest in rigorous, complete and honest evaluation of the results of Community legislation."
"That is good practice; it is also good governance and it should not be neglected, either at Member State or at European level."
"We propose to improve on existing sectoral evaluations and we have agreed to present an annual horizontal report in the context of the Cardiff process."
"The Commission welcomes the European Parliament's proposal to organise a debate in the existing forums in order to ensure a pluralist assessment and the debate ought to take place before the preparation of the Cardiff report in order to take full account of its results and recommendations."
"In conclusion, I stress that services of general interest are an area of ongoing concern which will require new initiatives in future and further development of Community legislation."
"The Commission looks forward to involving the European Parliament as a partner in this process."
"Thank you Commissioner Bolkestein."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Vote"
"Thank you Mr Caveri."
"We will, of course, take your comment, which would appear well-founded, into consideration."
"Mr President, I too have had a mistake in the Spanish version brought to my attention by my Spanish colleagues, and I would like it to be corrected."
"The word in question is determinar in the second part of Article 6(3), which should by rights be replaced by the word evaluar, that apparently being the correct translation."
"I ask that this should be checked and, if necessary, corrected."

"In Paragraph 10 of the French version, it says 'Treaty infringement procedures against Member States' , which is a misinterpretation."

"In Paragraph 16 of the French version, it says 'calls on the Commission to examine ways of promoting small-scale, local culling' ."
"Mr President, in order to avoid more serious culling, I propose - this sounds like a film called 'Petits meurtres entre amis' - I propose therefore that we put 'small, local abattoirs' ."

"Mr President, I would like to refer again to the vote, in which, alas, we lost the chance to vote on item 62."
"I have again consulted the documents: item 62 is an addition to item 58, and we should in fact have voted on it by roll call."
"Both my points of order were, unfortunately, ignored by your two assistants."
"What is at issue here is that we make it simply and convincingly clear that the opening-up of competition in the water market cannot be achieved by means of general competition law."
"I therefore want to reiterate this."
"I stated in my opening statements that we reject this, and I ask that this be noted in the Minutes and that, if possible, Members' requests to speak should not be ignored in future."
"I was not told about your request, Mr Radwan."
"Mr President, you can ask your two comrades-in-arms."
"The official sitting your left looked in my direction but did not inform you."
"I cannot do anything about it either."
"The risk of manufacturing and circulating false euro notes and coins is a serious threat overshadowing the launch of the single currency, which will be present for several years following the physical changeover to notes and coins taking place on 1 January 2002."
"During this critical period, the confidence of our citizens is a vital factor."
"It appears, however, that the danger was under-estimated, and then it was too late to deal with it."
"The Commission only published its main communication on the subject on 22 July 1998, and it was in 1999 and 2000 that the first, but still incomplete, provisions were adopted on extending Europol' s mandate and the criminal penalties against counterfeiting of the euro."
"The draft decision that we are examining today adds to these measures by establishing a Community training and assistance programme by the key players involved in combating counterfeiting."
"Although there have been no major objections to the text itself, we can only stress, however, that it has arrived too late and that it contains some ambiguities, which arise from the design faults in the single currency."
"First of all, the text before us constantly wavers between providing 'training' , and 'assistance' , and does not dare to state too clearly that, 48 days before the physical changeover to using coins and notes, cooperation in this vital area has still not been finalised."
"Secondly, one of the objectives of the training and assistance programme is to protect the euro outside the euro zone, which is not actually an area of the Community competence."
"From this particular perspective, we can see how shaky the single currency system is, one that is shared between Community competences and other competences that remain national, and both sides are poor at organising coordination."
"But how could things be any different, as at Maastricht, the aim was to seduce the electorate into believing that the single currency was possible without having an absolute super State?"
"Lehne report (A5-0380/2001)"
"Mr President, I speak on behalf of the my group on the Lehne report."
"Since the Tampere summit EU governments have been working more closely with each other on justice and home affairs and since 11 September this has become even more apparent."
"Since we live in an internal market it is only right and proper that there should be some cooperation and coordination between the Member States."
"International crime involves very sophisticated structures, but such operations centre on funding of criminal activities."
"That is why it is important that we enact this legislation, to ensure money laundering does not take place within the EU financial systems."
"We must ensure that international criminals cannot use existing financial structures in Europe, or indeed elsewhere, to launder their unlawful gains."
"The implementation of this directive on prevention of the use of financial systems for the purpose of money laundering is an important element in the battle against international crime."
"I have always believed that EU legislation in this area should be broadened to include offences other than drug offences."
"This is exactly what has been achieved here through the agreement between the EU governments and the European Parliament."
"The directive extends the prohibition of money laundering to organised crime as well as drug offences."
"Member States will remain free to extend their national anti-money laundering legislation to other forms of criminal activity."
"As a result of the conciliation agreement, lawyers' professional secrecy will be safeguarded unless the lawyer knows that the legal advice sought is for money laundering purposes."
"In a wider context there is agreement at European level to implement the framework directive on permitting the freezing of criminal assets within the EU."
"The protocol relating to the convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters will also help EU governments when criminal proceedings take place in different Member States."
"I support closer cooperation and coordination on justice within the EU, although I would caution governments to look very carefully at any conditions attached to future initiatives."
"There must be proper procedures to safeguard civil liberties and rights and to maintain the presumption of innocence until proven guilty."
"Mr President, I voted for the Lehne report on combating money laundering."
"The French term used for money laundering is 'blanchiment des capitaux' , which literally means 'bleaching or washing capital' , that is, making something white which was not white before, cleaning something which is dirty, making an ugly thing beautiful."
"Well then, I thought: why can we too not manage to be as clever as criminals, who do succeed in making ugly things beautiful?"
"Why can we not manage to make ugly things beautiful too?"
"I refer, Mr President, not to myself, who some people might consider ugly, but to the pension laws throughout Europe."
"Will we manage to make those ugly laws - and there are a great many of them - beautiful?"
"The European Parliament and the Council have therefore reached agreement on a conciliation package that has the value of appearing to do something against money laundering related to drugs offences, whilst doing nothing at all."
"Who can tell the difference between the proceeds from organised crime and those from normal economic transactions?"
"Especially because the banking system itself does not want to make this distinction, as it believes that it is not the job of the banks to determine where the proceeds come from, only what the proceeds make."
"And it is public knowledge that laundering of the proceeds from crime is not only carried out in tax havens; laundering also, and more importantly, goes on in the largest banks in the financial world."
"If adopted, this resolution will certainly not prevent the proceeds from organised crime from passing through the financial system and from being invested in so-called normal activities, which are, in many cases, just as criminal as mafia money, if considered from a humane point of view."
"It is absolutely scandalous to create one' s wealth out of drug money."
"It is equally scandalous to make a fortune from manufacturing and trafficking weapons."
"And it is even more scandalous to allow pharmaceutical corporations and their shareholders to become rich from having a monopoly on trademarks of some medicines, when this monopoly increases the price of some essential medicines by ten times or more, condemning to death all those who do not have the means to pay these prices."
"This is all legal however."
"The European institutions may have the power to decide what constitutes a legal or illegal way to use the proceeds."
"They do not have the power to 'exonerate' the proceeds."
"The directive on the fight against money laundering is a step in the right direction and is a response, at least in part, to the aspirations of the citizens' movements and to the proposals made by the judges who are the most involved in this issue."
"The events of 11 September should, in fact, give us more reason to intensify the fight against money laundering."
"The Lehne report does the opposite, however."
"It welcomes a new paragraph, which is drafted in an absurd manner, since it states that 'Member States are not forced to impose the obligations, stipulated in the directive, on the professions concerned (members of the legal professions, independent or otherwise)' ."
"The sacrosanct professional secrecy is preserved, unless the legal advisor is himself involved in financial misdealing."
"It is not enough for him to have 'specific reasons for believing' that 'his client wishes to obtain legal advice for the purpose of money laundering' . It is only if the lawyer 'knows' that this is the situation that professional secrecy can be lifted."
"These delicate points clash horribly with recent, brutal decisions made by this very Parliament, which follows the example of the CIA and does not hesitate in wanting to make any individual demonstrating against financial crimes into a criminal."
"In spite of these shortcomings, we did not vote against the Lehne report."
"Maij-Weggen report (A5-0349/2001)"
"Mr President, I voted for this regulation on public access to European Parliament documents as well."
"I have to say that, last Sunday, a pensioner from Bergamo, Mrs Erminia Santinelli, a young, active lady of 60, said to me: 'What good regulations you adopt at the European Parliament!"
"That might mean, then, that I will at last be able to see the documents as well!'"
"'What documents?' I asked her."
"'The documents showing the way my pension is calculated,' she replied, 'for I still cannot understand how that figure was reached."
"At last I will find out how my pension has been calculated, from the documents given to me to read.'"
"'Next time round' I told her."
"'For the moment, we must be satisfied with reading the documents of the European Parliament.'"
"Mrs Maij-Weggen' s report on public access to Parliament documents is an advance we cannot but support."
"We have, then, all voted in favour of 'the lesser evil' whereby a small advance towards more openness is better than nothing."
"The problem is everything that is not included. The main problem is that the Commission and the Council do not supply Parliament with documents from the phase during which legislation is prepared."
"That is unfortunate in as much as it is this phase in which people have an interest in participating so as to be able to influence the content of the legislation."
"A second problem is the division of MEPs into first and second class Members according to whether or not they have access to confidential information."
"Moreover, it is completely insane and contrary to every parliamentary tradition that Parliament' s Committee on Budgetary Control, the ombudsman and the EU' s own Court of Auditors are never in a position to check all the documents concerning the Commission' s discharge of its office."
"We voted against the report on 'Public access to Parliament' s documents' because this is a misleading title and the report aims not so much to widen the possibilities of access as to regulate them and, in doing so, grants the European Parliament the right to restrict public access."
"On the one hand, we hypocritically acknowledge the right of the public to have access to documents, and, on the other, we admit that some of these documents are 'confidential' ."
"In actual fact, there is no reason why any document of the European Parliament or any other European institution, should be kept from the public."
"We are in favour of the complete publication of all documents, all agreements, all treaties, as well as the details of all the speeches that are currently hidden, all the dealings that are kept secret, all the lobbying activities that have led Parliament, the Council or the European Commission to take a decision or to issue a directive."
". (NL) In days gone by, the interest of the state was protected from the citizen by secrecy."
"These days, the impression is created that all government information is public in a democracy."
"Despite this, there are quite a few exceptions on the basis of military or economic interests, and the extent of public access differs from Member State to Member State in the EU."
"There are now two completely opposing views with regard to future public access to information in preparations for Community decision-making."
"The first opinion, expressed by the rapporteurs Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mr Cashman, is that we have made great progress this year which will lead to optimal public access by 2002, with which everyone should be happy. The second opinion, formulated by Messrs Martin and Bonde, and included in the amendments tabled by the Greens, is that the EP has, in fact, created unnecessary, self-imposed restrictions by striking deals with the Commission and the Council and that we have sadly not yet seen a majority in favour of total public access in this Parliament."
"People may view the proposal as a step forward, but the most striking thing about it is what it is not saying."
"Some of the documents of the Council and the Commission are still hidden from the public and Parliament."
"I support the amendments which aim to further enhance public access."
"Carnero González report (A5-0346/2001)"
"Mr President, I voted for the Carnero González report as well."
"It would appear right that the same procedure applied when electing the members of permanent committees should be followed when electing the members of joint interparliamentary committees."
"In any case, seeing as we are discussing how joint interparliamentary committees are elected, Mr President, I would stress the importance to the European Parliament of the joint committees including members of the parliaments of the candidate countries or including members of the countries with which we have close relations."
"I call upon the European Parliament to confer increasing power upon these committees, for in that way we will see the fruit of the existence of the European Union and the European Parliament."
"Cappato report (A-0374/2001)"
"Mr President, when, on 4 November, at the end of an important meeting I had held, in which I talked at length about Mr Cappato' s report - as you can see, Mr Cappato, like all the Members, is here in the Chamber to hear why I voted for his document, but I know that he usually watches me on the monitor in his office - I displayed his photograph, many young pensioners, instead of coming to ask for my autograph, which is what usually happens in large, important meetings held by important politicians, asked me to introduce them to Mr Cappato."
"'We want to meet him!"
"He is a very good looking, extremely clever young man, and we congratulate him on this report!"
"Does this mean, then, that, at last, no one will know how old we are?"
"This is the sort of privacy we want!'"
"'Of course,' I told them."
"This document will mean that no one will know how old a lady is."
". The British Labour Members of the Socialist Group have voted in favour of national choice as to whether Member States will ""opt-in"" or ""opt-out"" on the reception of unsolicited commercial e-mails (UCEs)."
"This was the compromise reached in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs."
"The revision of the e-commerce directive in 2003 will offer an opportunity to bring forward measures based on the experience of Member States which have opted in or opted out."
"It is essential that any new measures in the area of e-commerce are based on direct experience of all those involved within the industry including consumers."
"In the area of retention of traffic data, we believe that at second reading further amendments need to be considered."
"We are all agreed that a certain level of protection of private life and of personal data is one of the foundations of a functioning democracy."
"Modern means of communication and a recklessly expanding information society make this more important today than ever."
"A wrongly-conceived protection of personal data can, however, have unwanted side-effects."
"The Commission's text thus envisages a ban on advertising e-mails previously not expressly allowed by the consumer."
"This so-called 'opt-in' principle flatly contradicts the principle, found elsewhere in the directive on e-commerce, that advertising is permitted unless the consumer has explicitly expressed a desire not to receive it."
"This 'opt-out' of course costs nothing and requires no effort other than a simple click of the mouse, which is often sufficient for you to delete yourself from a database you do not want to be in."
"Moreover, the e-commerce directive provides for several transparency conditions, so that, for example, advertising e-mails are recognisable as such by their titles and the recipient knows the sender before he even opens them."
"An uninteresting e-mail can thus be deleted in seconds by the click of a mouse without the consumer having to waste further time, money or energy."
"The unrestricted sending of advertising e-mails is, moreover, a boon particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, which cannot afford to make use of expensive advertising campaigns on television or in other media."
"Cutting them off from this opportunity to introduce themselves to a wide public at reasonable cost would quite clearly mean giving an even greater competitive advantage to the big national and multinational enterprises."
"These considerations mean that I will be voting in favour of the text adopted in Committee on 'unwanted information'."
"As in the vote on this report on 6 September 2001, I now choose to oppose the position adopted by my political group when it comes to the rules for sending unsolicited advertising material out to consumers via e-mail."
"Generally speaking, e-mail advertisements involve inconvenience for the consumer, partly because it takes time to open and delete advertising communications."
"Moreover, it is the consumer who has to bear the costs of receiving and reading the advertisements The division proposed in the report between, on the one hand, e-mail advertisements and, on the other hand, advertisements via text messaging, fax and automatic calling I also consider to be artificial."
"Whichever of these methods is used, it causes just as much inconvenience for the consumer, and an opt-in solution is consequently to be preferred to all other methods since it constitutes the most effective protection against unsolicited advertisements."
"In view of how important it is for this report to be adopted by Parliament as soon as possible, the compromise that is on the table must, however, be viewed as an acceptable, if ultimately less desirable, alternative."
"In the final vote, I therefore choose to support the report, irrespective of what transpires with regard to the aforesaid issue."
"Turco report (A5-0370/2001)"
"Mr President, I voted for Mr Turco' s document because I am in favour of all situations in which there is cooperation and agreement between all the States of the European Union."
"I talked about Mr Turco' s document during my meeting on Sunday 4 November as well."
"At the end, a lot of pensioners came up to me and asked: 'Does this mean, then, that we might have a European bobby on the beat at last?"
"We welcome any improvement in police activities coming from the European Parliament because here, in our State, we only have policemen who impose fines or come and arrest us."
"It would be so nice to have friendly policemen!'"
"'This has not happened yet,' I replied, 'but I am sure that Mr Turco will take us another step closer in his next report and we might manage to achieve this too' ."
"- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have, today, voted in favour of this report."
"We agree that the EU and Europol should combat international crime and are therefore satisfied with the report as a whole."
"We are nonetheless alert to the fact that certain amendments call upon legal cooperation and police cooperation to fall within the Community' s competence and that this is incompatible with Denmark' s reservation, cf. the protocol concerning Denmark' s position."
"We do not support these amendments."
". (PT) On the pretext of fighting terrorism and the dangers inherent in deteriorating security, what we are seeing is the development and establishment of a huge, complex mechanism designed to limit freedoms, which could lead to the creation of a 'fortress Europe' in which this and other initiatives will be used as the reference point for the processing of personal data."
"In the case of Portugal, for example, the fact that Europol considers the territory of Portugal to be the main point of entry into Europe, combined with the extension of its mandate to fight terrorism and organised crime, would turn our country into an area in which this body would feel particularly free to persecute and monitor people, unconstrained by the national police, the Minister for Home Affairs or by any real democratic control over its actions by the Portuguese Parliament."
"These projects are intended to ensure cooperation between police forces, the information services and data filing systems, without any democratic control, under a restrictive and xenophobic immigration policy that infringes individual freedoms."
"As a matter of fact, if there is no democratic control over the Schengen Information System now, what would be the case with regard to the transmission of information to third countries and bodies, largely sponsored by Europol and the American agencies, on the pretext of fighting terrorism?"
"Europol' s mandate must not take precedence over national policies or the control of Ministers for Home Affairs."
"Its activities with regard to each country must be listed in internal security reports."
"Europol must be subject, in all cases, to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice and account for itself, in detailed reports, to the European Parliament."
"Any extension of Europol' s powers must, of course, be subject to prior debate by the European Parliament and by the national parliaments of the Member States."
". I strongly support this excellent report by Maurizio Turco which calls for the extension of Europol's mandate and the addition of other non-binding arrangements."
"If Europol's mandate is extended to cover serious forms of international crime, such as kidnapping, illegal immigrant smuggling and racism, this body will become an institution with real biting power and one which can be seen as working in the interests and for the safety of European citizens."
"Moreover, the Swedish proposal to allow the onward transmission by third countries of personal data received from Europol is particularly important."
"It is well known that crime in the twenty-first century is borderless, and as such the EU should not and cannot operate Europol in a vacuum."
"This is why it is essential that Europol works in conjunction with third party states since only then will its full effectiveness be realised."
"Kirkhope report (A-0369/2001)"
"Mr President, I voted for the Council' s framework decision on joint investigation teams."
"Forgive me, Mr President, for giving rein to my imagination, but while we were discussing European joint investigation teams, I imagined investigation teams which included women, dressed in the same uniform, a common uniform for policewomen."
"I then wondered when we will vote on the type of uniform these women from the joint investigation teams are going to wear and who will model them so that we can give our opinions?"
"And who will chair the panel which will have to watch the fashion show of policewomen' s uniforms?"
"Might it be you, Mr President?"
"Or Mrs Theorin, who is chairperson of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities."
"Anyway, joking aside, what I am trying to say is that I am in favour of joint investigation teams, of European policemen and women."
". I strongly support this excellent report by Timothy Kirkhope which calls for a framework decision on setting up joint investigation teams."
"This decision opens the way for the full implementation of the EU convention which calls for mutual assistance in criminal matters."
"Police cooperation at EU level is a relatively new and innovative idea."
"Without cooperation in these kinds of matters, individual Member States cannot hope to solve and combat the new kinds of crime that presently face all Member State police forces."
"In addition, the report calls for joint investigation teams which should be available not only to combat drugs trafficking and human beings, but also to ward off organised crime."
"Once joint investigations really take off and Member States come to fully realise their effectiveness, their remit could and should widen to include these kinds of issues."
"Finally, as the report indicates, there is a real and valid role for the European Parliament in matters pertaining to joint police initiatives."
"The call for some kind of review mechanism, whereby the Council accounts for and reports to the European Parliament on the effectiveness of joint initiatives, will make this process more open and transparent and therefore more legitimate."
"Marinho report (A-0371/2001)"
"Fatuzzo (PPE-DE)."
"(IT) Mr President, I voted for the Marinho report because it provides for the mutual recognition of court sentences and decisions on the implementation of the Schengen acquis."
"However, as a representative of the Pensioners' Party, I am not in favour of the mutual recognition of decisions."
"This is not something which furthers European integration: we need common rules in both civil and criminal law."
"If we do not achieve this but are content just to implement mutual recognition of decisions, we will be taking a step backwards in the practical integration of Europe."
"We will only have a Europe which is genuinely fully functional when we move on from the mutual recognition of decisions to common rules which are the same throughout the European Union."
"Then there will be no need to recognise the decisions of other States because the decisions of each Member State will be the decisions of all the States."
"Vander Taelen report (A5-0351/2001)"
"Mr President, as representative of the Pensioners' Party, whose members include a large number of pensioners and elderly people who, having a lot of free time, watch the films and other products of world film-making either directly in cinemas or sitting comfortably at home in front of the television - a huge number of films are broadcast on television - I support Mr Vander Taelen' s document, which, like the Commission, calls for more support for European film-making."
"I would stress, Mr President, the importance, as this document points out, of deciding to promote the circulation of European films, not just in Europe as it is today but also in the Europe of the future, in the enlarged Europe which includes the candidate countries. If we really want to create a greater European culture than the one we have today, which, I regret to say, leaves something to be desired, it is vital that we dedicate even more funds to the circulation of European films within Europe."
"The author of this report condemns the fact that the European film industry has been gradually stifled by the major Hollywood productions."
"We did not vote against this report as we support some of its proposals."
"However, we did not approve of the report either, because the root of the problem is that, as in many other industries, in art and literature for example, the film industry is, in the current economic hierarchy, simply a marketable product and that the film industry, as all other industries, has to obey the law of profitability."
"Contrary to what the text claims to be nationalist feelings, the problem is not that of the domination of American cinema, but that of the domination of the major corporations, over the cinema market in the United States - where independent film-makers have just as much difficulty in holding out against the production of large companies as European film-makers - and over the global market."
"The author of the report, a supporter, surely, of the market economy, is sensitive, however, to the irrational and harmful effect of the law of profitability in the film industry."
"But the law of profitability is not more rational where consumer products, such as food, clothing, medicines or even jobs are concerned - it is, undoubtedly, more harmful still."
"The Vander Taelen report announces the European Parliament's intention to promote the European film industry and reinforce it against the strength in the market of its American competition."
"This concern also meets with the approval of the Group of Socialist MEPs, who have therefore voted in favour of the report, although they have substantial reservations about the statements made under item 8."
"This is an attempt, detached from the debate just beginning on revision of the 'television without frontiers' directive, to force the amendment of one point in a particular direction, one highly dubious from the point of view of content and law."
"Cultural, and therefore broadcasting, sovereignty belongs to the Member States alone."
"Item 8 would in practice mean massive interference in the programming autonomy of both public-service and private-sector broadcasters."
"It would, over and above that, offend against the authority of national public-service broadcasting organisations enshrined in the Protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"The success, or lack of it, of European audio-visual productions is not determined by extending protectionist measures, but by the marketability and competitiveness of such productions."
"There is no doubt that a structural weakness is revealed by the fact that it is exceptional for European audio-visual works to cross the borders of their country of origin."
"Consideration should therefore be given to systems of incentives for the distribution of non-national European films."
"The restrictions described in Item 8 are, however, the wrong way to go about it."
"The European film industry has problems distributing its films on the scale that we should perhaps wish."
"The proposals put forward by the report do not however solve these problems."
"They are based on the erroneous belief that increased State and EU aid can make an industry competitive."
"They also show a lack of respect for free choice on the part of the consumer."
"There is also a desire to impose a further item of expenditure on the European Investment Bank, parallel to the Bank' s main responsibilities."
"If TV companies were to be forced to adjust their programming in the interests of European cinema, this would constitute an infringement of their freedom."
"It might also be asked whether it is reasonable for European schools to be required to support the film industry through their teaching."
"For these reasons, I have chosen to vote against the report."
"Maat report (A5-0347/2001)"
"Mr President, I would like to say that it was with conviction that I voted for this report, for I hope that it will enable us to respond adequately to the demands of the people, the producers and all the consumers too."
"I feel that we have erred in the past in that we have failed to implement and monitor the existing directive adequately."
"In my opinion, the transportation of animals is a major issue and that it is something which almost all of us feel to be important."
"It is no longer just an economic issue; it has taken on an ethical dimension."
"Therefore, I welcome the increase both in regionalisation and controls, and I hope that, in the future, the contributions for the export of live animals will be abolished."
"Mr President, how could I not vote for this document protecting animals, which, although certainly destined for a cruel fate, should at least be treated as beings that deserve our respect and our protection in matters of transportation, as Mr Ebner has just said."
"However, I would ask you, Mr President, when we are going to do something for the dogs in Bucharest."
"While we are on the subject of animals, Mr President, I cannot fail to take this opportunity to tell you about the stray dogs in the city of Bucharest. They have no owners and should be caught and sterilised, but, instead, they are the victims of indiscriminate hunting by the people of the city, who receive a reward for every dog they kill and whose body they take to the mayor as proof."
"As I see it, the real villain is the mayor of Bucharest, not the poor dogs killed in the city."
"I hope that we will soon do something to improve this situation as well."
"Mr Fatuzzo, don' t forget to tell us what the mayor of Bucharest says when he reads your explanation of vote."
". (NL) Animals are not products."
"They are living creatures whose well-being we must aim to protect."
"Given the many cases of abuse during the long-haul transport of animals for slaughter, this transport should be abolished."
"We have not got there yet, although the Commission measures are heading in the right direction, with the restriction on distance of 500 km and a maximum duration of 8 hours."
"This will also help reduce the risk of spreading animal diseases."
"That is why we have approved the report."
"To date, the Commission has actually promoted this long-haul transport with its subsidy policy."
"Similarly, the policy that has led to the disappearance of small slaughterhouses, including in remote areas, has had pernicious effects."
"This policy should therefore be reviewed as a matter of urgency."
"A great deal will depend on the policy of the Member States that have so far been very negligent, among other things by inadequately monitoring compliance with the animal welfare directives."
". (NL) Over the years, transport by road has become increasingly cheap, relatively speaking."
"That is why all kinds of goods are continuously being hauled back and forth to places where the raw materials or labour are cheap, or where the expected profits are the highest."
"It is even worse if living creatures are involved."
"For example, discarded work horses from Eastern Europe are transported en masse to Western Europe to be slaughtered there."
"During this transport, they incur fractures, they do not get any water or feed, and animal diseases are quickly spread across Europe."
"Since a political majority wishes to protect the interests of the traders and carriers involved, various petitions organised over the years have failed to improve the situation."
"Nearly a year ago, the European Commission responded to me that the solution is to improve the ventilation of animal trucks."
"I fear that this non-legislative advice based on experience gathered from applying existing directives will not really solve the problem either."
"However, the proposals by Mr Maat to limit transport for slaughter or fattening to eight hours or 500 km, to increase the penalties for infringements, to re-open the smaller, regional slaughterhouses that were closed down by EU legislation, and to abolish export subsidies for live animals for slaughter constitute a necessary step forward."
"The deficiencies of current agricultural policy are evident."
"The existing system only serves to promote the transport of animals."
"This trade is, at least in part, truly absurd."
"For example, Spain imports sheep for slaughter from the United Kingdom, while at the same time exporting sheep to be slaughtered in Greece."
"We must aim to abolish the promotion of the transport of live animals."
"It is indefensible in the long term that EU funds are used for this purpose."
"The only possibility of putting an end to the long-distance transport of livestock lies in the regionalisation of agriculture policy."
"The watchword must be: production in the market, for the market."
"This would also make it possible to effectively counteract the spread of diseases."
". I strongly support this excellent report by Mr Maat which reviews the 1995 directive designed to ensure protection for animals enduring long journeys."
"The report is balanced and fair in that it recognises the possible negative role initially played by EU legislation: this called for the closure of many small slaughterhouses in the first place and made animal transportation more necessary and prevalent."
"It also exposes the present lamentable situation whereby the provisions of the 1995 directive are often flouted and where some Member States fail to implement existing legislation."
"The call for increased protection of animals during transit is both necessary and worthwhile; as the report indicates, this should be legally enforceable whereby those countries who fail to comply with the rules will be charged a fine."
"This would act as a real and concrete disincentive for flouting the law."
"In addition to the call for increased and harder legislation in this domain, practical measures are suggested, such as promoting the opening of small-scale abattoirs."
"Lastly, this report calls for these tougher measures to be also applicable to third party countries."
"This is both a positive and substantive move since EU Member States import livestock from outside the EU's borders and it would be counter-productive to have these enhanced rules operating exclusively in the EU without any regard for the unfair practices that operate outside its borders."
"Langen report (A5-0361/2001)"
"The Commission' s communication of 20 September 2000 on services of general interest in Europe reviews its position in order to take into account recent developments in the case law of the Court of Justice, and also the will of Heads of State, expressed at various European Councils (at Amsterdam and Nice in particular) to show greater respect for the specific nature of the missions of public service."
"This new communication, however, pushes us into a difficult position."
"Apparently brimming with good intentions, the Commission is proposing to define the limits of public services and competition rules, to grant derogations for State aid to activities of general economic benefit, to put in place systems to evaluate the performance of public services and so on. In fact, the Commission is behaving as if the articles of the treaty on competition were universally applicable, and as if it was up to the Commission to say, out of kindness, the extent to which they will be applied."
"The Commission is giving itself the role of arbitrator."
"The treaty, however, does not give it any right to do this."
"Although the Treaty of Rome only mentioned public services in passing, this is because those who drafted the treaty thought it went without saying that public services did not fall under European competences."
"Even Article 16 of the TEC, introduced under the Treaty of Amsterdam, does not amend this position."
"We must, however, be very attentive to the Commission' s attempts to wield imperialist powers."
"We believe, in particular, that the memorandum issued by France on 27 July 2001, despite being full of good intentions, falls into this trap, by proposing to draft a framework directive to set objectives for services of general economic interest and also the freedoms and obligations of Member States with regard to these."
"This is another example of a European text that can be interpreted in many different ways and is subject to European arbitration."
"In reality, all we need is a new article in the treaty to confirm the evidence, in other words, the sovereign right of Member States to define and organise their public services independently, whether these are general services or services of economic interest."
"We were unable to support a report that places us in the position of observer."
"Too many amendments, which could give a sign that a change is underway in tendency and approach, as we expressed in Amendment No 59, were not adopted today."
"To leave public services to the mercy of the rules of competition is to seriously threaten the regional development and the social cohesion of our States."
"This represents a step backwards for users and is being taken with disregard for the principle of subsidiarity, which is, in fact, emphasised in all our texts."
"This new move is a lost opportunity for the European Parliament to show that it is listening to its citizens."
"As far as we are concerned, we will continue to fight so that the Laeken European Council becomes the opportunity to take a step forward for the good of citizens."
"At the Lisbon European Council in March 2000, European governments decided to 'increase the pace of liberalisation in sectors such as gas, electricity, postal services and transport' ."
"The Commission and the European Parliament, by means of the Langen report, are supporting this process of 'selling off' the methods we use to meet our citizens' basic social needs, and are thus strengthening the domination of markets over our societies."
"We all know, however, that in sectors that have already been liberalised, the expected gains in productivity have not been met; that the erosion of public services has caused standards of quality of service and of safety to fall; that, for employees, the 'gradual and controlled' opening up to market forces has led to staff cuts and greater job insecurity, and has caused inequalities in regional development."
"Is this the European model of society that the European Union desires?"
"We believe that we must urgently block the liberalisation process and re-appropriate public services by freeing them from the markets."
"Regarding the liberalisation of services of general interest, we are opposed to coordinating public services at European level, and even creating public Euro-services within the framework of common policies of general interest, through state-owned businesses, involving users and employees, over the long term, and making use of the most advanced techniques."
"We reject the Langen report for this specific reason."
". The ELDR Group voted against in the final vote on the Langen report, because its members are not convinced that a framework directive on services of general interest (SGI) is a good idea."
"At least we want to wait for the Commission's reflections on the desirability and feasibility of a framework directive on SGIs before we insist on such a proposal."
"Another reason for our vote against is the ambiguous wordings on the need to stick to the Lisbon agenda."
"We found that the text was too watered down (for example in the votes pertaining to par. 33)."
"Liberals also find that the report, through amendments both in committee and in plenary, had become too long, inconsistent and incoherent and that it therefore, unfortunately, no longer presented any added value to the debate on SGIs."
"Passenger transport by rail, road and inland waterway"
"The next item on the agenda is the Report (A5-0364/2001) by Mr Meijer on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council [COM(2000) 7 - C5-0326/2000 - 2000/0212(COD)] on action by Member States concerning public service requirements and the award of public service contracts in passenger transport by rail, road and inland waterway."
"Mr President, many private companies have withdrawn from public transport since it became permanently loss-making as a result of the large-scale distribution of the car."
"Public transport is necessary for access, the environment and for reducing the pressure on public space and cannot survive without extensive government funding."
"Like education and welfare provisions, public transport is more a core task of the government than it is part of the market."
"Unfortunately, this Regulation has been preceded for some years now by a rumour in a number of Member States that the EU is committed to privatisation and competition."
"When I was appointed rapporteur a year ago, I was put under pressure to have the report ready for first reading in the first half of 2001 during the Swedish Presidency of the Council."
"Had I succumbed to that pressure, it would have been impossible to have more than one hundred investigative interviews with organisations, including national associations of municipalities, trade unions and different types of transport companies."
"I gleaned very opposing interests and views from these conversations."
"Public transport is regulated very differently in each Member State and in each of its regions."
"Much community funding has gone into buying up old private companies that failed to offer adequate public transport, particularly in densely populated urban areas and for rail connections."
"This is in contrast to many small bus companies operating a few bus services in thinly populated areas that have now been bought by large, fast-growing bus companies operating in different States."
"If the European Commission is of the opinion that the award of contracts for transport areas to such companies should not be based on nepotism or judicial verdicts but rather, on objective standards and openness, then this Parliament shares this point of view, and so does the rapporteur."
"In this way, the Commission helps those areas where the municipal or regional governments would like to contract out their public transport apply useful rules so as to be able to choose between a few large companies, such Arriva, Vivendi or Deutsche Bahn."
"Unfortunately, the Commission proposal applies the same obligation to contract out to areas which, based on practical experience, prefer the sustainable existence of one of the country' s own public companies or the continuation of a long-term contract with a small, private company."
"Precisely this restriction of freedom of choice makes the Commission proposal extremely controversial."
"It particularly affects countries such as Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Germany and Austria."
"But also in the Netherlands, which led the way in privatisation and liberalisation, the disadvantages of a disorganised rail company and of delayed growth in public transport in densely populated areas are now emerging."
"The rule that applies to every government is that it is appreciated by the people if it helps solve problems and maligned if it creates unnecessary problems."
"European legislation can be useful if it makes a vital contribution to solving our joint and cross-border problems."
"Far-reaching, centralistic intervention in municipal and regional policy certainly forms no part of this."
"No one will be satisfied if such intervention soon appears to result in fewer public services, higher consumer prices, worse working conditions, fewer new tram lines, the termination of free urban transport, the supremacy of a monopoly and the erosion of democratic participation."
"The compulsory introduction of competition in this case does not mean the emergence of an ordinary market; instead it means promoting a battle for securing government subsidies for permanently loss-making businesses that want to take over government tasks."
"According to many experts, the introduction of an obligation to tender for passenger transport by rail, road and inland waterways goes beyond the powers of the European Union."
"On account of this obligation, the importance of providing public services and the well being of the user are being subordinated to attempts to cut down on labour costs."
"If this proposal for a regulation were to be accepted unamended, it would spell doom for small companies, including virtually all public companies."
"Although the municipal tram company or the local bus company can also take part in the tender, these companies will go under as soon as they lose the tender at some point in the future."
"Only large, cash-rich companies with many diverse transport areas can survive such a system in a sustainable manner."
"It is exactly this crucial aspect of the tender obligation pertaining to all public transport that attracts criticism."
"On 10 October, it appeared that the majority of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism had accepted the gist of what I had proposed or what Mr Piecyk and others had developed by way of alternatives on the back of my proposal."
"Tram, underground and short bus services remain outside the obligation, while employment and the environment are better protected."
"If the plenary follows the same line of thinking, we could save ourselves a great deal of upheaval and bother."
"Mr President, it is with particular pleasure that I contribute to the debate on a very important report dealing with the opening of the market to competition in key parts of our public sector."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs considered that the key elements of the proposals were sound, but differed in its opinion on a number of key issues."
"Firstly, some of the amendments proposed gave exemptions to what are known as integrated transport systems, yet we all know that transport, and particularly integrated transport, is a matter of organisation and not ownership."
"This would merely be protectionism by the back door."
"Secondly, there was concern that some of the proposals would allow for predatory bidding by exempted sectors for those parts of the transport industry which, in the case of my own country for example, are already liberalised."
"Thirdly, the de minimis provisions failed to meet realistic levels to allow competition to take place in the open market."
"Finally, there was concern that the level of public subsidy taken into account in drawing up contracts would not allow the continuation of socially needed routes nor provide adequate recognition of contribution towards fares, for example for the less fortunate, such as the elderly or disabled."
"The report which finally emerged goes some way to addressing these issues."
"However, I fear that some of the amendments included in the final report would also introduce extraneous non-commercial considerations into what should be a completely open and transparent competitive system within the EU."
"For example, the issues already mentioned relating to environment and social policy are not in themselves relevant to the contract tendering process but should be dealt with under separate legislation."
"That is why I draw your attention to these matters and why this report should be seen as merely the first step towards the liberalisation of the market in this sector and not as an end in itself."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"(FR) Mr President, I can say that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which has been asked for its opinion, widely supported the proposals put forward by the European Commission."
"In a series of amendments which were passed on to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, the Commission was careful to extend the length of contracts, for which operators apply in response to calls for tender."
"The Commission also tabled a number of amendments to increase the content of management contracts set out in the Commission regulation, particularly under the social chapter."
"Lastly, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs supports the idea that we must ensure that the objectives of sustainable transport are taken into consideration in the management contracts and this is duly taken into account by the competent authorities, particularly with regard to the integration and interoperability between bus transport, which is precisely the subject of our debate, and other types of transport."
"Nonetheless, the Committee regrets that this proposal for a regulation was presented before a discussion could be held. With regard to rail issues, the second railway package and also services of general interest, which we discussed this morning, it would clearly have been more logical to first adopt a framework directive on services of general interest before having to discuss the same services of general interest on a sector-by-sector, directive-by-directive basis."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Meijer, I would like to say in advance that I actually want to say a word of thanks to you, as I know with what commitment you have sought to introduce this subject and how many discussions you have had in order to produce some sort of proposal."
"I must, though, say on this point that I cannot go along with broad areas of your proposal."
"There is, in principle, nothing new about what we are discussing today."
"When, in the summer of 2000, the regulation at last emerged from the Commission, reached Parliament, and then the first discussions were held with trade unions and the representatives of local transport bodies and voluntary organisations, everything was clear: There was to be controlled competition."
"This had been the aim for years, and now we only had to deal with the questions of how long future contracts should run for and when the regulation was to enter into force, in other words, when would the first tenders actually be invited and the first contracts awarded?"
"There was the additional question of what exceptions there should be to the obligation to put contracts out to tender."
"All that had its part to play, as did the recurrently raised issue of social dumping, that is, the danger that tenders would lead to the employment of especially cheap labour."
"We came to a consensus."
"We wanted controlled competition without privatisation."
"The two are always confused with one another."
"Privatisation is not automatically connected with it."
"All that is involved is that local transport bodies no longer automatically come into the enjoyment of substantial subsidies from regional, national or local funds without having to compete for them, but contracts will now have to be put out to tender."
"We all know that local transport bodies, who know this themselves, basically offer their product at too high a price."
"The cause of this is to be found in the fact that it is in the public sector that trade unions have always been very successful in pay negotiations in recent decades."
"It is a truism, to give just one example, that the personnel costs of private bus companies are some 35-40% lower than in the public sector."
"Competition also opens up the possibility of us being in a position, in the future, to buy in transport services more cheaply, without a local authority being able to evade its responsibilities in the process."
"It is not the case that they are being privatised."
"There will continue to be a State office with responsibility for ensuring that public transport carries on."
"I can see the opportunity of using the resources saved by buying-in transport at more favourable rates to buy in more transport in the future, thereby making short-distance transport more attractive and achieving all that was said at the outset, namely making transport so attractive, that more people will use it in the future."
"Let me say that, following these lengthy preliminaries, I think there has almost been a catastrophe, because Mr Meijer was evidently unsure which way he should go, and proposed that, in future, the responsible bodies, whether the regional or local government, should be entitled to decide whether or not to invite tenders."
"I forecast that if this right to choose, which is to be introduced into the bill by means of Amendment No 61 and Article 7a, becomes reality, there will be no competition, because pressure from the transport companies, trade unions, and associations will be so great as to be irresistible, and contracts will continue to be awarded automatically."
"Though we can disagree about many details, I therefore beg you, ladies and gentlemen, to seriously reconsider your decision tomorrow and not to vote in favour of Amendment No 61, so that contracts will continue to have to be put out to tender, exceptions being made for rural areas where only small sums are involved, but let us march in the same direction."
"Mr President, you will not be surprised to learn that I see things in quite the opposite way to Mr Schmitt."
"What is true is that we need a European legal framework for public local transport, as there is legal uncertainty and the market has already been opened up."
"The question is, though, how closely to the citizens Europe's decisions must be taken on a given subject."
"Local public transport is, in my view, primarily the responsibility of local authorities and that is how it should stay."
"Towns and parishes should themselves decide whether they want to run their local public transport by their own enterprise, and then whether they are able to do so."
"It is also clear that those who say they are going to do it themselves must not be allowed to compete elsewhere."
"I wish to thank Mr Meijer, the rapporteur, for pursuing this basic idea with, if I may say so, a certain stubbornness, as this issue of community decision-making is an important point."
"My second point is that where there is competition in local public transport provision, it can lead to minimal wages and social dumping."
"My dear Mr Schmitt, a bus driver working on regular services does not earn a fortune - barely DM 200 above the social security rate in Germany."
"It is for that reason that social minima must be maintained when there is a change of operator."
"My third point is that local public transport is run in many Member States' rural areas by small and medium-sized enterprises."
"These must not be unnecessarily squeezed out of the market, quite the contrary."
"I believe they must also have a chance in the market when routes or networks are awarded directly."
"The situation prevails in any case, in many areas of Germany, that up to 90% of local public transport is to and from schools, and here too, the direct awarding of contracts must be given more of a chance."
"I think we can agree that the Commission's time limits for contracts and handing-over are both too short, and we strove together for their extension."
"As regards the other things, our opinions simply differ and, unlike Mr Schmitt, I believe that tomorrow will not see a catastrophe, but that we will be very close to the communities in deciding in their favour on public local transport."
"Mr President, I wish, first of all, to thank the rapporteur, Mr Meijer, for preparing the report; he has done a great deal of work on this complicated issue."
"The interests of passengers must be borne in mind in the development of public transport."
"It must be made into such an attractive alternative that more and more people will be happy to opt for public transportation."
"This is highlighted particularly in towns where it is necessary to find ways of solving environmental problems and the difficulties caused by traffic jams."
"Signing agreements when organising public transport services is the correct procedure in cases where such agreements enjoy public subsidy."
"With a combination of open and controlled competition it is possible to achieve a higher degree of efficacy and a better level of service."
"Competition is also really needed in this industry."
"There should be some room for flexibility in the application to enable Member States to retain any proven procedures that they have applied previously."
"In my own home country such successful solutions include the fixed route transport licensing system and the town and district ticket systems."
"This is corroborated by an amendment relating to Article 3, item c. The aim of this is to prevent the formation of local and regional monopolies and to enable competition as far as possible."
"Another objective is to safeguard public transport systems that function well in countries with sparse populations where distances are great."
"Arguments relating to transport safety and to minimising the number of accidents are also in favour of the public transport option."
"For these objectives to be achieved, legislative flexibility is called for."
"It should be possible to opt for solutions that are best suited to various conditions and to each operating environment."
"Such solutions should be practically oriented and they should be implemented in cooperation with local and regional operators."
"Mr President, the main problem with the Commission's proposal is that local public transport is subordinated to the objective of 'free competition' alone."
"Some in this House may well welcome this, but I consider it a fundamental error."
"It is the objectives of transport policy that local public transport must primarily serve."
"It is also a European issue, how can the local public transport service improve the mobility of all citizens, including those who, not being car-owners, have no alternative to it, schoolchildren, large families, pensioners, disabled people, people on limited incomes?"
"Ensuring sustainable basic mobility in accordance with town and country planning is therefore the prime objective for local public transport."
"Specific local situations mean that this can be achieved in a wide variety of ways."
"So, to this day, I cannot understand why the Commission chose to do this by means of a regulation without considering the possibilities afforded by a directive, as this is a typical case where the subsidiarity principle applies."
"I also wonder how it is that the Commission is also choosing the form of the regulation, at the same time as bringing out the White Paper on European governance."
"According to this White Paper, it wants to reinforce local autonomy, and here it is interfering."
"Hence the question as to how such a regulation can make real the principle of reinforced local autonomy in European governance?"
"Let me finally return to the offering of contracts for tender."
"Of course contracts must be put out to tender."
"But the process must highlight firstly transport policy, secondly environmental policy and thirdly social policy, which should lead to optimised mobility for our electorate."
"Mr President, my colleague Erik Meijer's report is of the greatest interest, as it touches on a core issue in services of general interest, that is, the guaranteeing of citizens' mobility within their immediate surroundings."
"This fundamental citizens' right was formerly predominantly guaranteed by local public services and their agents."
"As local public transport is mainly unprofitable, services are subsidised by the local authorities, which of course makes the local transport market interesting for private-sector service providers."
"The public local transport market in Germany alone is valued at some DM 30 billion."
"The creation of the internal market and the rise of international companies offering public transport services has led to a conflict between the previous practice of awarding transport concessions directly to local service providers on the one hand, and the international firms on the other."
"The Commission has therefore proposed to give competitive rules the edge over public interest and to create a new and binding obligation to put contracts out to tender."
"The rapporteur is, in my view quite right to question this procedure."
"He would give local authorities the right to decide for themselves how contracts are to be awarded."
"That is democracy; that is the subsidiarity principle."
"There must be no interference by the European Union in the conditions applied at local and regional level."
"I see this as a fundamental issue, as it is evidence of real subsidiarity."
"I appeal to my fellow Members of this House, although I know that there is little point in doing so, to support this position."
"We had many meetings and discussions with local, regional, national and international operating companies and interest groups, so of course highly detailed proposals were the result."
"Now, you do not have to agree with all these suggestions, but the basic line taken by the Meijer report corresponds to the demands of local public transport as seen by local authorities and operators, does not, contrary to what you said, Mr Schmitt, exclude the possibility of introducing competition, and safeguards local and regional transport services accessible to all and which citizens can afford."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my serious concern regarding the first reading of this report that we are to debate today, even in spite of the remarkable work that Mr Meijer has done. We also support most of the amendments that he has tabled."
"However, on the deceptive pretext of seeking to make financial compensation from Member States to service providers compatible with Community legislation and to award public service transport contracts that are already open to private service providers, the Commission is once again attempting to work well outside its area of competence."
"By encroaching on the Member States' methods of public management, the Commission is making a direct attack on local authorities' freedom of management, and it must be said that, in doing so, it is denouncing the direct rule method of management used in France, which has proved its worth for many years."
"This shows that the aim is not to achieve better service for the benefit of the user, but to actually create, using liberal dogma, the internal market."
"In other sectors, such as telecommunications, energy and the postal services, it is freedom of choice that is at stake and, therefore, the very concept of public service."
"In addition to the attack on the constitutional principle of freedom of administrative choice for local authorities, this is, more broadly speaking, an attack on the public sovereignty of Member States."
"Freedom of choice in public services and in its method of management, freedom of choice in terms of provider, partial freedom in sub-contracting, freedom to set prices and freedom of compensation are freedoms of Member States and their local authorities that have been withdrawn."
"Beyond the State, it is the citizen/user who will be slain on the altar of Community liberalism, because this proposal is a direct attack on local authority, which is the closest to the citizen and therefore is in the best position to manage the difficulties experienced by citizens on the ground."
"They already have the least power, in the less affluent areas which are even at risk of having no services at all."
"The social partners made no mistake, when they warned their MEPs at the vote in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism."
"This illustrates perfectly the danger that everyone has spotted, and we are not dealing with subsidiarity that has been reintroduced here and there, or the odd possibility of derogating from the procedure that has been put in place, which should be enough to stop us seeing the truth. The citizen will see through this."
"To sum up, I have reason to doubt this European project that, faced with ignorance and, at times, the distrust of our citizens, responds in a technocratic and dogmatic fashion by trying to wrestle power from the States and from local authorities, which efficiently manage the daily lives of citizens."
"We cannot accept these proposals and that is why we demand this report is rejected."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, we should begin by saying to those watching us, who have found their way here in greater numbers than we MEPs, that we do not differ as regards our objective."
"We all want the best possible local public transport at the lowest cost to taxpayers and passengers."
"That is our common objective."
"We now have to deal with the question of how best to go in that direction."
"If your proposal is propaganda from the left of this House for the right of communities and regions to exercise free choice, then I can only say that the past fourteen years have demonstrated that free choice is to the citizens' disadvantage."
"What, then, is the position?"
"In most towns and communities, services by the communities are being reduced and the subsidies are on the up and up."
"So the reality is that we cannot carry on with the present system if we want a good, efficient, public transport service at local and regional level."
"So we say we must put them out to tender, so that citizens get the best modern buses at the best price, with the best quality, and arriving as often as possible."
"That is the objective we have set."
"I can tell the gentleman from the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities that, secondly, there is the Community Treaty, the Treaty on the European Community, in which it is stated that everyone shall have the right to provide services."
"Freedom of services can be restricted only on the basis of a greater good."
"The free will of a village community is not sufficient to say that one should limit the freedom of services under Community law in village A or village B. You need carefully-controlled legislation to be able to limit the freedom of services by reason of a higher good."
"That is what we are doing."
"If, though, you give communities back their free choice, you are suspending the justification for limiting the freedom of services, so, no matter what we agree on, be it journey times or whatever else, we need a proper framework for a controlled competitive order, and the free choice you propose undermines that, as we need sensible Community regulations to limit the freedom of services."
"Mr President, I feel that it is perfectly legitimate for the European Union to equip itself with common rules whenever we introduce competition into local public services."
"I feel that it is infinitely less legitimate to seek to withdraw a method of management and to introduce competition within the field of transport and to use case law to extend this to all the other fields in the future, through a regulation which is not transposed by the national parliaments."
"I have several reasons for this view."
"The first is that the private sector has not always performed better and I urge my fellow Members to come and see what is happening in France, in the water industry, which has been largely opened up to the private sector."
"Cartels have sprung up, which are no longer controlled by the local authorities and which currently supply water at higher prices than the local authorities, which remain under direct management."
"On the other hand, we must not consider direct management to be a better method, but simply that the two methods of management must co-exist."
"Secondly, this goes against the principle of subsidiarity."
"If subsidiarity means anything at all, then it most certainly means the freedom of administrative choice of local authoridies and the constitutional provisions of most Member States, under which decentralisation now gives freedom of choice to the mayors, regional leaders and heads of local authorities."
"There is therefore a genuine political problem posed by this regulation."
"I do not think anyone can deny this."
"Lastly, we must also be very clear on this question."
"Whenever a mayor chooses direct management, he cannot turn to external markets."
"Who knows of a school bus service, in a rural area, managed by the local authority, that has to rely upon external markets?"
"This is not a problem that exists in reality."
"On the other hand, whenever public services are delegated or an exclusive choice is made by a business, which is, itself, competitive, this company can turn to the external markets."
"That is why I believe that we must impose the principle of reciprocity."
"In any case, however, we cannot give up direct rule as a method of management."
"Mr President, to get legal clarity on tendering rules in the EU, unfortunately the committee voted to delete most of the specific exemptions in favour of one very wide one, Amendment No 61."
"But it is open to legal and political challenge to simply cite democratic decision-making as a justification for exemption from EU legal rules for the internal market."
"I therefore commend the specific amendments from the ELDR Group - Amendments Nos 110 to 112."
"These would mean that authorities would be justified in not tendering metro and tram services if there were good reasons of cost, safety or risk of creating a permanent private monopoly rather than competition."
"Any claim for exemption would have to be justified to the European Commission."
"In addition, there are provisions for direct award of contracts in the absence of tenders or in emergencies."
"I appeal in particular to the left of this House."
"You take a big risk if you rely only on Amendments Nos 61 and 62."
"They may not survive the course and as an insurance policy we need specific provisions to protect large complex metro systems like London's from being split up for tendering or risking becoming a private monopoly."
"Mr President, European transport policy is not really a page of glory in the annals of the European Union."
"Too little, too late, not really consistent, those are only some of the features criticised as being characteristic of European Union policy to date and justifications for criticising it."
"The present Commission is investing a lot of commitment in attempting to counteract this."
"The proposal for a regulation on local public transport belongs to the legislative package with which some past errors are, admittedly belatedly, to be repaired."
"Some of the internal market philosophy is also to acquire significance in the transport sector."
"Controlled competition, not total liberalisation and certainly not privatisation at any cost, was said to be on the way."
"One unfortunately has to say 'was' as what the competent Parliamentary Committee has produced as a compromise signals a return to the old and unsatisfactory situation."
"In order that there may be no misunderstanding between us, let me say that there is consensus on all the points concerned with the quality of the transport offered to the consumer, consensus also on demands for high standards of safety, social provision and environmental protection."
"All that, though, can be, and is to be, required and put into effect by the conditions on the offering of contracts for tender."
"So we do not need the continuation of monopolies and quasi-monopolies."
"Finally, I will say something about subsidiarity."
"It is no help to local autonomy to declare local public transport to be a res extra commertium, whose watchword is that everyone is to do what they like in the way they like."
"It is, unfortunately, no help to the citizens either, for it is they who, at the end of the day, have to pay for all that twice over, as consumers and as taxpayers."
"So, then, controlled competition and high standards for local public transport as well."
"Mr President, I believe that public transport is incredibly important for Europeans in both towns and sparsely populated areas."
"In this vote, I am therefore going to support the basic ideas behind the committee' s proposal, which I believe points in the direction of better public transport."
"However, I oppose many of the simplistic statements made about tendering."
"Our experience from Sweden shows that tendering can be very good."
"Account can be taken of the environment and of social considerations, safety regulations can be established and a good relationship can be enjoyed with the social partners."
"As a prerequisite, politicians must have responsibility for the tendering and establish these criteria openly."
"That is possible, as is shown by experience from Sweden."
"We should be able to get rid of many of the simplistic statements about tendering."
"As I say, I am prepared to support the basic idea that regions and administrative districts should have freedom of choice."
"I also believe that it will, in practice, emerge that tendering can be used because it saves money that can be used for other purposes within the framework of public expenditure."
"Finally, I want to say that I do not believe that the rule of reciprocity referred to in the committee' s report should operate at European level."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have as yet been unable to find a simple solution to the problem of liberalising public transport."
"That does not mean to say that we should not continue with the liberalisation process."
"Quite the reverse, in fact."
"Nevertheless, this liberalisation process should not be forced."
"It must be carried out in stages."
"In principle, I am against exceptions to freedom of services, but it is clear, of course, that a very limited list of exceptions should be possible, particularly for less sizeable contracts."
"Finally, I should like to say that it should also be made clear that it certainly cannot be the intention to replace the government monopoly by a private monopoly."
"I therefore think that a compromise solution must be found, particularly in the interest of the user."
"Many thanks, Mr President."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President, the likely reason for the Commission's proposal being such a centre of attention is that we are dealing here with employment, especially with mobility, and with issues of safety, environmental protection and economic development as well, and the opinions which are still being vigorously discussed today were also the basis for almost 500 proposed amendments."
"I would like at this point to again make clear that, for us, it really is not about opening up local transport in such a way that it inevitably ends up in private hands."
"Nor is it about local transport remaining in public hands unconditionally, and that is the subtle distinction that we want to make clear now."
"National, regional and also local government are to be obliged to put local transport out to tender, a process to which conditions must be attached, conditions which we have clearly described in numerous proposed amendments."
"For us, it is about safety."
"It is also about certain exceptions, small markets in rural areas, for example."
"We, of course, view these exceptions with sympathy, as we do the special aspects associated with rail transport."
"As has just been said, though, our misgiving cannot be dispelled that many are more interested in the service provider than in the service itself, for the word 'voter' was just used rather than 'citizen', something that we find symptomatic of the whole discussion we have been having."
"We have brought in numerous amendments and can, I believe, say quite unambiguously that these amendments prevent social dumping and also guarantee social security, safety in general, and, I believe, can give local transport a better future."
"One final observation, with which I know the Commission has difficulty."
"Protected markets make it impossible, in our view, for businesses profiting from them to take part in tendering processes in other markets without, at least, some problematic aspects being created."
"As we see it, that is, and cannot be other than, unfair competition, which must be combated by all means available."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing my thanks to the Commission for showing that they have the courage to present, in the past year, a proposal for a regulation on the thorny topic of local public transport."
"For we are not going to get away from the fact, as we see at this very moment in the case of an airline, that even in local public transport, profitability is making an entrance."
"We cannot therefore have the situation in which - I am involved in local politics myself - year after year, questions about the losses sustained by local public transport are simply shrugged off without further ado and with the taxpayer being left to foot the bill, without the money actually being able to be invested in making local public transport more attractive."
"We have to ask ourselves: why was local public transport created?"
"It was not created in order to employ as many bus drivers as possible; on the contrary, it was created so that attractive facilities can be offered in rural and more densely populated areas to ensure the mobility of all."
"That is the task that is incumbent on local public transport."
"I think that Mr Grosch's point that we need a level playing field in a European single market is decisive."
"We cannot have the situation in which we introduce freedom of choice that makes it possible for certain districts, because they are under financial pressure or because they want to invest their taxpayers' money properly, to invite tenders, and then these are submitted by firms from protected monopolies."
"It is therefore so important that this Amendment be voted down tomorrow, so that there may be a level playing field."
"The Commission has laid down very tight deadlines for the duration of licences and for transitional regulations."
"I think we, as a committee, reached a fair compromise between the various interested parties."
"I would, in fact, like us to make a start on introducing time limits and licensing systems throughout Europe."
"Commissioner, we will be able to talk about this at future stages, in order to make it even more competition-friendly."
"However, let us take this first step together."
"This is for the good of the people of Europe."
"Mr President, as one of the previous speakers said, what we are all after is the best possible public transport at the lowest possible cost."
"As another speaker said, we need appropriate solutions for each particular environment."
"That is the main reason why the principle that local authorities can be free to decide how best to organise public transport within their own areas is such an important one."
"I would like to make a few comments about running metro systems in large urban areas such as London, where there is a real danger that if we do not allow local authorities to make those decisions, the contracting out will lead to the creation of a monopoly and we will not be any further forward in what we are trying to achieve with this report."
"The other thing that could happen in areas such as London and other large cities is that the system could be broken up, which could lead to quite severe chaos."
"So I would urge you all to support Amendment No 61."
"Mr President, I strongly support the principle that high quality and reasonably priced public transport should be available in all areas."
"However, this report is particularly important to my constituency, Wales, due to issues relating to concessionary travel."
"The Welsh National Assembly has introduced a scheme, which will come into force next spring, whereby local bus travel will be free for all pensioners in all areas of Wales."
"The scheme would offer free bus passes and free travel on local buses and would theoretically enable pensioners to travel throughout Wales if they wanted to without paying a penny."
"Whilst I appreciate the importance of ensuring that groups such as disabled people, schoolchildren and trainees are also eligible for reduced cost public transport, it would be ridiculous to undo the good work the National Assembly has done for pensioners in Wales by preventing pensioners enjoying concessionary travel under this regulation."
"I am pleased that the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has already voted to abolish the ceiling on concessionary fares that was proposed by the Commission, thereby protecting these pensioners in Wales."
"Thank you, Commissioner De Palacio."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Market access to port services"
"The next item on the agenda is the report (A5-0354/2001) by Mr Jarzembowski on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision [COM(2001) 35 - C5-0078/2001 - 2001/0047(COD)] on market access to port services."
"Mr President, the Commission proposal for a decision on market access to port services should be considered and appreciated as part of the comprehensive Commission communication on improved quality of services in ports."
"This communication was to draw conclusions from the positions of Parliament and of the Council on the Commission's 1997 Green Paper."
"When we consider the past weeks, we must observe that, whilst the European Parliament was in 1999 still able to agree by a large majority on a position on the Green Paper, the present Commission proposal, which is only intended to regulate market access to services in individual ports, has aroused a great deal of controversy in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, as attested by the result of the vote on the report - 26 in favour, 21 against and 11 abstentions."
"So I hope that today's debate and tomorrow's vote will produce a clear position from this House, something in which I intend to play my part."
"For if we cannot work out a clear position at first reading stage, the Council then has the last word."
"We do not want to trust the Council to that extent, but rather we want to pull our own weight."
"In Committee, the majority supported the Commission's desire to adopt only regulations on competition in individual ports and include in this all service providers."
"The report is, though, ambiguous on one point, that is, on whether pilot services should fall within the scope of the decision."
"On the one hand, Amendment No 14 in the Committee's report states that pilot services are not to be affected by the provisions, but the application to delete pilot services from the appendix to the opinion, which alone defines the opinion's scope, was not accepted."
"That being the case, we, as Parliament, must give a clear lead tomorrow."
"Among the other amendments in the Committee's report, I would like in particular to highlight the fundamental extension of the scope of the proposal to include port access, be it by sea routes or canals, likewise a more restrictive definition of self-handling and the abandonment of the requirement for at least two service providers per category of cargo handling, likewise the requirement we have incorporated into the opinion, that, when tenders are invited, the new service provider should compensate its predecessor for the investments."
"A minority in the Committee tried to highlight, above all, the Commission's failure to comply with Parliament's 1999 demand for conditions for fair competition between ports in the EU, and produce a proposal for a regulation to create them."
"The Commission has produced neither a transparency study nor guidelines for the monitoring of aid."
"A minority in the Committee therefore proposed the adoption of new regulations on transparency in financial relations between ports and State offices and also on permissible State aid measures for ports, the intention being to provide legal protection for ports and also to prevent excessive aid provision."
"For me personally, this is very much about our need to agree tomorrow on this transparency issue, for the issue of transparency and fair conditions for competition between ports is crucial to the ports' ability to function."
"All of us have repeatedly emphasised that ports play a central role in European transport policy, with 70% of foreign trade and 30% of trade within the Community passing through them."
"They are significant junctions, and they must work well."
"I believe that nobody need fear transparency, which leads to fair conditions for competition."
"That characteristic and criterion is, I believe, a good basis for a real increase in the efficiency of ports."
"In that spirit, I hope we will have a good discussion this afternoon and that this House will vote wisely tomorrow."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, all of us who have participated in the work of the committee know that this has been a difficult and controversial debate which has even, at times, caused tension in Parliament."
"I would like to make several things clear: firstly, this is a good proposed directive by the Commission."
"I repeat: I believe that it is a good proposal, and this has been reflected in the vote in committee."
"I believe that it is a positive regulation and is very important if the European Union is to have efficient maritime and port services."
"We must not forget that 80% of the European Union' s trade is carried out by sea."
"And this liberalisation proposed by the Commission will no doubt benefit short sea shipping."
"Furthermore, there is clearly a need for Community regulation of these services in accordance with the liberalising approach established at the Lisbon Council and which has already been applied in other sectors of services."
"The proposal we are dealing with today includes technical-nautical services (pilotage and mooring) and cargo-handling services."
"There are no reasons, on the grounds of safety, training or anything else, to justify their exclusion from the scope of the directive."
"We must clearly take account of the particular nature of ports and the fact that there are services whose provision begins or ends outside the physical area of the port."
"Another essential element of the system proposed by the Commission is the concept of self-handling, which is already laid down in Directive 96/67/EC on access to the groundhandling market at Community airports."
"I would like to briefly mention certain other elements of the port package."
"We are talking about public funding of ports and the need for great transparency in the financial relations between public authorities and ports and State aid."
"I agree with certain amendments which try to describe this aspect."
"But with regard to State aid, it seems clear that this directive is not the right place to discuss this issue."
"Lastly, I would like to thank the rapporteur, although we have disagreed on certain points, for the enormous amount of work he has done and the huge effort he has made to try to reconcile all the proposals."
"Mr President, ports, particularly seaports, are normally cosmopolitan systems and they are junctions in the TENs for traffic by ship and sea, which is in principle the most environmentally-friendly mode of transport."
"The openness of seaports, though, bears no relation whatever to the system by which they are financed."
"Far from it; I think opacity, very often intentional, is the right word to use for it."
"To put it in nautical language: when it comes to financing seaports, the bulkheads are closed."
"The present financial structures could be described as hazy and must be changed."
"I believe that tomorrow's vote must be about transparency in financial relationships and in State finance, for that is the first requirement for fair competition between seaports."
"Granted, that is not exactly easy."
"Ports are under private, State, joint State and private, and public control, but all of them are enterprises in competition with each other, and so we need fair conditions."
"Aid is unobjectionable, but it must be aid for all."
"The problem is, I think, that competition between ports has to be organised."
"In principle, it occurs within ports or should do so, if all the Community regulations are brought into play."
"Pilot services are another issue."
"We see them as a public duty, serving safety at sea and the safety of man and nature, and the Member States have essentially reasonable regulations on them."
"I believe it would be possible to extend them in view of the recurrent accidents off the German Baltic coast."
"One sometimes gets the impression that, when it comes to navigation, many ships use the Shell atlas and nothing else."
"So, safety at sea with pilot services must not fall victim to the alleged pressure on costs exerted by competition."
"I extend my warmest thanks to the rapporteur."
"I know that he has had a difficult job, but his shadow does not always have an easy time of it either."
"To start with, I agree with the previous speaker' s last sentence."
"I do not need to repeat that ports are important."
"In my view, the Commission proposal helps us to enhance the efficiency of ports."
"Like a few of my fellow MEPs, however, I have noticed one shortcoming: there are no proposals on state aid and transparency."
"It would be best, and I have tabled an amendment to that effect, if these new proposals were to come from the Commission and not from the text which we as Parliament are now drafting."
"Commissioner, I should like to ask you if you would be able to tell us more about possible plans in that direction during this debate."
"In any event, I hope that my fellow MEPs will support this amendment and that we will therefore ask the Commission to submit new proposals concerning those two points."
"For the rest, I back the Commission proposal."
"We must increase competition at ports."
"This must also include maritime access, not only for technical-nautical services, but also for the handling of cargo and passengers."
"We should therefore not dispose of the handling of cargo."
"I think that pilotage can also be retained in the directive."
"As you rightly stated, it forms a significant link in the life of most ports."
"However, if we prescribe a few requirements, impose a number of conditions in the social field, and give due consideration to economic aspects, the environment and public services, as is the case in the directive and in my amendment, we will have more guarantees than if we simply fall back on the Treaty."
"For I believe that that is the choice: either we include a special rule for ports in a directive, or we fall back on the Treaty and simply apply to pilotage the general rules of the Treaty which provide for the free movement of services."
"I think it would be preferable to adopt the Commission proposal in this respect."
"In any case, I am of the opinion that we as Parliament need to cooperate with the Commission constructively, possibly allow for a conciliation procedure with the Council, and ensure that we reinforce the operation of ports and competition in and among ports in a constructive manner to encourage the vital aspect of transport by water as much as possible."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Jarzembowski, thank you for all your work, but we have not reached our goal yet."
"Particularly since the Green Paper actually asked for something else on behalf of Parliament and its handling than what we have now received, namely a consideration of the competition among ports instead of in ports."
"Why?"
"If we look at the various coastlines in Europe, and I can think of a few, there are two, maybe six, seven or eight major ports located within a few hundred kilometres of each other, where competition is mainly generated from that small distance between the ports."
"Antwerp, Hamburg, Rotterdam, and so it goes on."
"The same happens in the Mediterranean in the south. However, this leads to distorted competition which does not really benefit us."
"So that is the first problem."
"It also leads to overcapacity and the funding of this overcapacity."
"That too is a thorn in our side, and we should like to see common guidelines in this respect."
"This, in turn, impacts on the environment, it results in an excessive use of space and generates all kinds of additional problems which we as Greens are also being faced with to a considerable extent. In terms of competition among ports, we would therefore actually like to propose more transparency and that a reasonable amount of thought be given to state aid."
"We would sooner call for coordination among ports, which we would like to add to the objectives of this study along with transparency, and not only the opening of competition in ports, which has been the subject of discussion thus far."
"If we turn our attention to competition within ports, as is formulated here, we would particularly like to see the pilotage scrapped for safety and environmental reasons."
"I believe that we can rely on majority backing for this."
"We also believe it would be wise to delete the handling of cargo, since it does not in any way benefit competition."
"Finally, following on from transparency, we call for autonomous research to be carried out. This research should be autonomous vis-à-vis, yet commissioned by, Parliament."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's proposal for a directive on market access to port services was not acceptable."
"The removal of constrictions on free movement of services within the Community does not in fact mean only liberalisation and privatisation, but also European harmonisation with due regard being given to Member States' rights to provide public services in defence of the common interest."
"It is noticeable that the rapporteur took account of data specific to ports and attempted to include in his report not only requirements for safety, environmental protection and social standards but also the economic needs of ports."
"The vote in Committee is evidence of the fact that opinion was not divided on group lines but that there were differences of outlook specific to different countries."
"Removal of pilot services, cargo handling and passenger services from the scope of the directive is something I can go along with, as is the retention of licences granted to previous service providers and the setting of minimum standards for new ones."
"The Commission's draft has also undergone radical amendment with regard to financial settlement for investments made and the transparency of the financial relationship between ports and State authorities."
"Briefly, Mr Jarzembowski's report changes the Commission's document in the right direction."
"As, though, I thoroughly share the view of many of my fellow Members, namely that port services should generally be left to the Member States, I intend to abstain in the vote."
"Mr President, this report has had a rather odd journey."
"Whereas initially, it was a very logical report which, in my view, contained a reasonably correct interpretation of the facts, we now have before us an incoherent document which spawns many comments."
"I shall confine myself to the key points."
"Firstly, the alleged state aid of Member States for their ports forms the root of the problem."
"If government funding for ports does not become transparent, other measures can hardly take effect."
"Closer examination of this funding should therefore be given the highest priority, followed by a clear, financial framework which distinguishes legal from illegal support."
"Secondly, the inclusion of cargo handling in the proposal prejudices the port authorities' sovereignty to pursue their own strategic policy."
"It is reported to lead to the breach of existing, long-term contracts, which will have far-reaching financial implications for the relevant services."
"Furthermore, the maintenance of existing contracts renders the present legislation superfluous."
"When these contracts lapse, it is likely that economic insights will have changed yet again."
"Thirdly, I am of the opinion that pilotage can also remain excluded from this legislation."
"I would draw your attention to an amendment which aims to secure surety from governments to render the use of technical-nautical services, in particular, mandatory."
"Without surety, considerable problems can arise in the smaller ports."
"That cannot be the intention, if I have understood everyone correctly."
"Let it be clear: without a number of essential changes, we will be unable to vote in favour of the present report."
"Mr President, Mr Vice-President, first I think we should all congratulate Mr Jarzembowski on his excellent work, the time he spent on it and, of course, his patience, because this is an exceptionally tricky issue."
"We should also congratulate Commissioner de Palacio on the substance of the proposal which she submitted to us and which is based on the liberalisation of port services, which she wishes to push on with."
"Not as an end in itself, but as a means of bringing about better, cheaper services and improving the competitiveness of the European economy."
"And, of course, when we speak of competitiveness and liberalisation and apply them to telecommunications, energy, the railways, we cannot leave out port services."
"This too is another brick in the wall of the single market."
"There can be no doubt that ports are a rule unto themselves, as is every sector."
"Obviously we need to look at the question of aid and how it can be reconciled with the rules of transparency."
"We need to look at the specific problem of pilotage, which several Members have already mentioned, and see how pilotage relates to safety."
"Consequently, we need to look at a whole host of other issues."
"But this should not lead us into ignoring the material facts and the material facts are that liberalising port services will have a beneficial effect on competitiveness and our objective of providing better, cheaper services to those who use them."
"So the message which we need to send out from this debate is clear: a dual message of liberalisation and transparency."
"Of course there are groups which will be affected by these proposals."
"Of course there are interests which do not like these proposals."
"But the greater good is the objective of competitiveness, and the growth and jobs which it creates."
"And I believe that the philosophy behind the proposal before us serves precisely this objective."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this is one of the rare occasions when politics must swallow its pride and take into account geographical requirements."
"Chairman Hatzidakis is right: we must have the courage to say 'no' to those pressure groups which sometimes attempt to prevent the Commission and the institutions from tackling areas affecting them which Europe has never clearly addressed."
"I therefore feel this proposal for a directive is appropriate in order to regulate and improve access to the port market and services."
"The calls for safety, the protection of workers, quality of service and, of course, respect for the environment, are appropriate and vital."
"I would like to make two points on this subject: we, like the Commission, believe that it is right and proper to include in the scope of this directive terminal cargo handling services, in particular, that is those services which represent over 90% of the volume of business of ports."
"In addition, we feel that, if an exception is to be laid down to the application of this directive on grounds of safety or environmental protection, it would thus make no sense to limit it just to pilots and exclude the other technical-nautical services."
"Lastly, we do not feel that this directive is the most appropriate instrument to address the issue of the public financing system."
"There are too many discrepancies between the systems of the 15 countries of the European Union and some extremely grey areas continue to remain."
"Consider - and we must be quite honest about this - how, in some of the major ports of northern Europe, there is proof of commitment to State financing in the fact that representatives of public authorities sit on the managing bodies of the individual ports."
"This must be made clear in the name of the transparency rightly advocated by Mr Jarzembowski."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we all agree that this proposal is very significant for port services insofar as it affects one of the most important transport infrastructures of the European maritime regions and because of the process of liberalisation of access to the market in these services."
"I would like to make several points:"
"Firstly, the philosophy of liberalisation must include making the process more flexible so that it does not lead to dangerous or inappropriate radicalism."
"Secondly, we must take account of the geographical reality of the seaports in the various regions of the European Union."
"Thirdly, the jobs of the port workers affected must be guaranteed, as well as their social protection."
"And on transposing this directive in the various Member States, the principle of subsidiarity must be taken into account."
"These are the reasons that have allowed me to support this directive with certain clarifications, and justify certain particular amendments, which are coherent amongst themselves, and which deal with the fact that certain regions of the Member States affected are of an insular or peripheral nature, where the port is paramount and, in many cases, quality services are already provided."
"Despite everything, I thank the rapporteur, Mr Jarzembowski."
"Mr President, the aim of the directive proposed by the Commission is indeed to open up all port services to competition."
"In my opinion, these proposals will address the living and working conditions of port staff but I do not feel that they will improve them."
"We are told that improvements are taking place, but, as is all too often the case, there has been no prior study of the effects of this liberalisation, in particular with regard to such important issues as safety, the environment and employment."
"Those affected have not been consulted, in particular, trade unions (we can always call them 'lobbies' if you prefer), even though they know the safety needs of people and the environment, and have unrivalled knowledge."
"Although the amendments made to Mr Jarzembowski' s report take into consideration certain problems that I have just raised, in my opinion they are far from adequate."
"They do nothing to temper the line taken by the text as a whole."
"Self-handling in the ports would therefore equate to allowing social dumping."
"Given the current practices of commercial fleets, this measure will lead to inadequate safety levels and the deterioration of environmental safety, employment and working conditions."
"I will support the amendments that seek to exclude dockers from the directive."
"These staff carry out an important economic task under difficult conditions, while still ensuring safety."
"Nautical services for piloting and mooring are universally recognised as services of general interest."
"They should, in my opinion, be considered as partners in their own right, with a view to sustainable development."
"Well then, the proposals of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, do take account of pilots but not of mooring service providers, which I personally regret."
"I believe that the European Union should work towards harmonisation at the top end of working and employment conditions for employees in this sector, which is the only way to genuinely guarantee economic and social effectiveness while respecting the environment."
"The proposals made to date will not, in my opinion, take us any further towards these essential objectives."
"Mr President, in my constituency lie the ports of Felixstowe and Harwich, the largest privately owned port complex in Europe and a model of commercial success."
"The owners tell me that this directive has been prepared without thorough consultation and that, if passed, it will be seriously damaging to the whole UK port industry."
"They say that it would force many ports to restructure, yet would do nothing to improve efficiency in a cargo handling market characterised by competition between ports, not within ports."
"Thus, if there are problems of restrictive practices in cargo handling and pilotage in some continental ports, they should be tackled by individual Member States."
"As is so often the case, one size does not fit all."
"I urge the Commission, even at this late stage, to rethink this damaging proposal."
"Competition is one thing."
"Destruction of a successful industry is quite another."
"I ask you to take this directive back and consult properly with those who are affected by it."
"Mr President, it is a real pity that the Commission completely ignored Parliament's position on the 1997 Green Paper which stated: ""No need for Community legislation on organisational structure and market access for port services""."
"That was our position then and I hope it is going to be our position tomorrow, but so far the Commissioner has failed to explain why she has ignored that."
"Secondly, so far the Commission has ignored the question of why there has been no regulatory impact assessment on this proposal."
"Whether you are for it or against it, it is extraordinary that such a proposal as this is not subject to the assessment that President Prodi assured the House would apply to all new Commission proposals."
"Why is Mr Prodi not honouring commitments given to this House?"
"Thirdly and finally, why is this proposal so over-prescriptive?"
"Why is it going to burden a successful industry with more red tape, with no justification whatsoever?"
"Why does it seek to regulate in minute detail every aspect of a port's operation?"
"Why, for example, does it call for cargo handling to be provided by at least two service providers for each type of cargo?"
"How can that make any sense when you are trying to organise the arrangements at ports?"
"Bearing all that in mind and unwelcome as the proposal is, it is even more extraordinary that it does not address the issue of state aids or transparency of accounts."
"The whole package is unbalanced and unworkable."
"I hope the House rejects it tomorrow."
"Mr President, I come from Sweden where we have quite a high degree of exposure to competition and privatisation of various services."
"The lesson to be drawn from our experience is that the crucial issue is not really market competition or privatisation, as such, but quality, greater efficiency and good, cleverly designed organisation."
"These are aspects to which the Commission has given insufficient consideration in its proposal."
"I want to express my thanks to Mr Jarzembowski who, as rapporteur, has come up with many criticisms of the Commission' s proposal."
"I should like to make a number of important exceptions, and I shall point out a couple of these."
"Quite a few speakers have referred to pilotage."
"I believe that pilotage is quite clearly a service for the benefit of everyone."
"Pilotage must not therefore be regarded in terms of the same economic criteria as ordinary production, but from a safety perspective."
"Taking responsibility oneself can have very serious consequences when it comes to loading and unloading."
"That especially applies in view of the fact that flags of convenience are a common phenomenon."
"I am in favour of transparency and public scrutiny where ports are concerned."
"I am in favour of self-financed ports."
"I want to see quality and efficiency brought about through ports' preparing their own development programmes instead of being subjected to extensive forms of control from Brussels."
"Such programmes must be carried out in cooperation with staff and clients at the ports."
"Mr President, over the next few years the present directive will determine the operation of our ports, which will play an ever more important role in trade traffic on account of ever increasing traffic flows among other things."
"Unlike in the past, modern port users are uncommitted: they choose their port on the basis of price and quality."
"There are important financial channels that run from authorities to port companies."
"A need for more insight into the investment flows has arisen."
"In addition, a level playing field is needed for all interested parties."
"This situation could be improved by setting up a number of basic rules."
"I should like to highlight a few aspects in this context."
"First of all, there is the scope of the directive."
"It does not simply cover the port itself, but mainly the port users."
"Deleting cargo handling from the directive will not benefit the quality of the service which ports offer their customers."
"Freight services, or cargo handling, should simply remain in the directive."
"Secondly, ship services, also referred to as pilotage and towage services."
"Amendments Nos 3, 14 and 51 aim to keep pilotage outside the scope of the directive, based on the outmoded notion that pilotage services are always public services."
"I will not support these amendments."
"In my country, pilotage services have not been a public service for a very long time, and that has worked out very well."
"A directive which regulates market access to port services therefore covers both ship and port services."
"Needless to say, we must move towards more transparency of the financial flows with regard to infrastructure, but I should like to leave the powers where they are, and will therefore vote in favour of Mr Sterckx' Amendment No 47 in which the Commission is still being requested to submit proposals in this field."
"What matters is that ports facilitate reshipment and receiving companies."
"Ports and their users deserve solid, well-thought-out legislation."
"I regret that the way in which this directive has been dealt with in Parliament has created unnecessary tension between northern, southern and western Europe."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it was very difficult to assess this text as its focus has shifted slightly."
"We were supposed to address the issue of competition in ports and we are now being presented with a text on competition between ports."
"I do not know what will happen tomorrow, but I am sure there will be some confusion."
"In passing, I regret that the mooring service providers' lot is not the same as the pilots' ."
"I do not see why we would maintain competition for mooring service providers while excluding pilots."
"These professions are fairly similar."
"With regard to competition between ports, I feel that transparency is a good thing, but I would warn you against going straight from that to decreeing competition between ports without closer analysis, for ports are first and foremost tools for regional development."
"They do not have the same nautical qualities."
"Moreover, if we were to increase competition, your entire sustainable mobility policy would fall through."
"I actually think that, in years to come, we will have to help the southern ports and the ports on the Atlantic coast take over from the over concentrated mass of North Sea ports."
"Otherwise, we will be going against both the Erika-Maritime Safety package and our desire to remove lorries from the major transit countries."
"In my opinion, the Commission will actually have to present us with specific proposals on State aid to ports focusing on regional development rather than just competition between products."
"Mr President, as other Members have already said, the full complexity and problematic nature of the work over which Mr Jarzembowski has presided, competently and doggedly, must be recognised, and we all hope that the final result will be positive in terms of providing the necessary safeguards for the different principles."
"We support the Commission' s proposal, particularly insofar as some of the amendments tabled by Parliament have helped to make opening up the port services market a viable possibility, and, although this does not in itself appear to be the most remarkable result, it is positive in terms of revamping services and of introducing elements of competition, provided, as some of the amendments advocate, that certain social clauses remain untouched, that certain requirements relating to environmental safety, professional standards and continuity of authorisations continue to be met."
"Parliament' s vote will make it possible to consolidate all this provided that, as far as the internal port services to be opened up to competition are concerned, there are no obscure exemption clauses which would render the scope of the directive meaningless."
"That applies to cargo handling and terminal services, and we feel that, in due respect not least for the principle of subsidiarity, certain services in which safety and professionalism are of paramount importance, such as pilotage, could be revitalised."
"Finally, subjects which do not fall within the scope of the directive must not be allowed to infiltrate it."
"The Commission will certainly have the opportunity to present a proposal on public financing for ports, and we look forward to it, but we must not now make the mistake of anticipating the proposal and bringing forward its introduction without a legal basis, creating unacceptable areas of discrimination between the port systems of the Member States, which differ too widely in this respect."
"Mr President, Mr Jarzembowski has undertaken a very difficult task, but he has carried out a major, carefully considered piece of work affecting crucial areas."
"Ports are clearly a very important factor when we discuss fulfilment of the Kyoto commitments in as much as they can ease the pressure on land transport and make things easier in a wide range of other areas."
"It is therefore essential from an environmental point of view to have some of the goods at present conveyed by land transported instead by sea."
"If this is to happen successfully, ports must be efficient, and we must therefore see liberalisation within those areas proposed by the Commission: loading and unloading, passenger services and whatever else has been mentioned, presumably with some exemptions in special regions."
"However, that too has, of course, been mentioned in the report."
"I hope that, in the light of the many views presented in this House, we shall now be able to agree upon a proposal so that together we are able to support the Commission' s overall goal for the benefit of the whole of the EU."
"Mr President, Commissioner, as you know, I come from a small port, but nonetheless one with European credentials as regards the trans-European networks."
"I will quite happily note in our logbook that it is not about seeing things in black and white when liberalising and creating free and fair competition, simply in order to adhere to a principle."
"The unedifying dispute about duty free is still in my mind."
"This discussion about ports is also about jobs, attractive business propositions and public profile, and I want to take part in it, we need to define transparency rules for the calculation of costs and the use of public funds by ports, in order to establish fair competition within ports and between them."
"Only transparency about the flow of public funds and services will make it possible to compare the services offered by the various seaports and in that way demonstrate which works more efficiently."
"Comparability of services creates competition, and transparency is, in consequence, indispensable if we want to have long-term liberalisation of the market in port services."
"I will say in addition that, at this time, we should not yet liberalise the pilot services."
"Pilots have, as at present organised, long maintained a high standard of quality and safety on sea routes."
"These extraordinarily high standards would be needlessly jeopardised by liberalisation at any cost."
"Every market structure contains components for which quality rather than competition must come first."
"Of course, the pilots will one day have to adopt a new approach - one day."
"Even they will not be able to resist the opening-up of the market forever, but as far as safety at sea is concerned, there are at present more pressing matters such as, for, example, the introduction of a 'black box' for ships."
"Immediately forcing pilots to be subject to competition would, under certain circumstances, lead to a price war that could compromise the safety of shipping lanes in the long term."
"Mr President, while the European economy is having a coughing fit we must decide whether to say a final good-bye to 'Eurosclerosis' and protectionism, whether to allow port monopolies to remain as they are or whether we should give free rein to the dynamics of economy."
"Sabena is a warning example of the kind of inefficiency that centrally managed industrial policies can produce in the worst possible case."
"Should we exclude cargo handling from the directive on ports, all that would be left of it would be an empty shell."
"This is why Amendment 52 is dangerous."
"Although I am in favour of the inclusion of all major ports, I can, nevertheless, give my support to Amendment 79 proposed by Mr Atkins."
"This amendment would restrict the directive to covering public ports only."
"My British colleagues could then accept the inclusion of cargo handling without any concern."
"We must not forget that British exporters benefit from reasonably priced port services in continental Europe."
"The numbers of port operators should not be restricted except for compelling reasons."
"Should economic efficiency be accepted as a criterion for restricting the numbers, this would leave a great deal of room for speculation as to when operations are efficient and when they are not."
"This is a reason why Amendments 6, 25 and 44 should not be seconded."
"On the other hand, Amendment 50 on the definition of the port system is not acceptable because, according to the amendment, a port in Greece and a port in Germany, for example, could be construed as forming a single port."
"I am sorry but this is an absurd idea."
"As regards pilotage, we, the members of the committee, concluded that strict national rules should apply."
"Therefore, safety aspects cannot be used as an excuse for a monopoly."
"Is it our intention then to prevent the development of EU ports by diluting the directive that has been awaited for so long?"
"Cargo handling and pilotage, based on national rules, should be included, absolutely. Also, the port system should be defined in a concise manner."
"My highly honourable colleague Jarzembowski' s ideas on this matter are, unfortunately, a long way away from the actual needs of port users."
"We cannot change Europe into a giant Hamburg."
"The committee has reached a good compromise and we should clearly stick to that."
"'Eurosclerosis' hits the poor hardest."
"Now we have a good opportunity to do a favour to European employment and sustainable development."
"Let us pilot Europe towards competitive ports."
"Mr President, as a former member of the Amsterdam City Council Port Committee and as a current inhabitant of Rotterdam, I know what is wrong with competition, expansion and labour relations in ports."
"The ports along the coast between Hamburg and Le Havre, spanning Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and France, largely service the same hinterland."
"They have traditionally competed with each other with low tariffs and large public investments to secure the highest possible cargo levels for their quays."
"This competition involves taxpayers' money, and there is unnecessary secrecy about the use of taxpayers' money."
"An orderly and scheduled distribution of tasks among those ports saves public funding and better provides the port workers with sustainable employment without the unnecessary peaks and troughs."
"That is why I support the remarkable agreement between a large contingent to the Left and rapporteur Jarzembowski, which reminds us of the position which this Parliament has adopted once before, namely the position that transparent competition among ports is far more useful than organising competition in the ports."
"Competing pilotage and towage services are at the expense of safety, working conditions and job security."
"That is why we need to avoid the wrong interventionist measures from the powers that be."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank Mr Jarzembowski for all the work he has done as rapporteur throughout this debate. It has clearly been difficult work, and we must all be aware of what is at stake here."
"I would therefore ask Parliament as a whole to try to give the rapporteur the greatest support possible, with certain slight modifications to what Mr Jarzembowski proposes, since, for once, I do not agree with some of his suggestions."
"I would like to remind you that 70% of trade with third countries depends on the efficiency of our ports."
"It is clear that sea ports play an essential role in relation to the European Union' s trade."
"But furthermore, if we want to deal with the future of transport within the European Union in a credible fashion, not trade between the European Union and third countries, where we will continue to depend largely on sea transport, but within the European Union, we must move on from words and declarations to actions, once and for all, and make short sea shipping a reality. This requires our ports to be as competitive, as efficient and as well-interconnected with adjacent territories as possible."
"As you know, to this end, a few months ago, ports were incorporated into the trans-European networks for the first time, precisely so that they may be fully integrated into the Union' s internal transport system and thereby play a crucial role in making that system sustainable and competitive."
"The Commission' s proposal is part of a package which deals with various issues of port policy: the transparency of flows of public funds destined for ports; criteria for what is State aid and what is not."
"It deals with aspects relating to competition between ports."
"The proposed directive which you must vote on deals with the issue of competition between service providers within ports, covering all the services that are normally provided to port users and are of commercial value."
"In a moment I will mention something which several of you have referred to; competition between ports."
"However, now we are going to talk about the proposed directive relating to competition within ports."
"The proposal is based on two pillars: one relating to content and the other to procedures."
"With regard to content, we propose bringing ourselves into line with the legislation passed by Parliament and the Council in similar areas, where rules have been established to open up the markets."
"I am talking about telecommunications, gas, electricity, but especially, in the transport sector, ground services at airports."
"Although the Treaty does not in principle allow restrictions to market access, the ports have their own specific characteristics such as possible space limitations and the fundamental importance of safety and environmental issues."
"Our proposal guarantees a fair balance between these needs."
"I am pleased to note that, in its vote, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism expressed its satisfaction with this approach."
"We must allow self-handling in ports where operators consider that they can obtain better performance from their own personnel and equipment and we must guarantee that, as in the case of all the other sectors, the number of service providers can only be restricted for justifiable reasons, such as space limitations, or the safety of sea traffic in this case."
"All competent service providers must have equal opportunities to operate in the ports of their choice."
"This brings me to the second pillar of our proposal: procedures."
"The procedural rules must be transparent, non-discriminatory, objective and proportionate."
"This is not always the case at the moment."
"I am convinced that what was possible for ground services at airports must also be possible for ports."
"And I believe that, although it is going to create certain problems, as is always the case when there is a change to a situation that has remained the same for a long time, perhaps even for centuries, it is certain that this change will be of benefit to the whole system, to the economy and to the quality of life of the citizens of the European Union in general."
"Of course, specific local characteristics must be taken into account, above all on issues relating to safety, the environment and social aspects."
"Our proposal will therefore allow for a high level of flexibility on a national, regional and, above all, local level, so that ports can manage their own affairs in an open and balanced fashion."
"Focussing now on the amendments, I would like to say that, having examined them in detail, the Commission can accept most of them."
"Many amendments improve our proposal substantially with regard to the clarification of the definitions of port services and self-handling and they include compensation rules which are not only implicit, but also explicit, as is the case with Amendments Nos 18, 20, 32 and, in part, Amendment No 46, which we fully accept."
"I would also like to mention Amendment No 15, which allows Member States to extend the scope of the directive to inland waterways close to ports."
"Furthermore, we accept part of Amendments Nos 25 and 44 which limit, for reasons of maritime safety, the number of service providers rather than that of just providers of technical-nautical services."
"It is a reasonable measure and it is in accordance with the Commission' s general interests in the field of maritime safety."
"We also agree with the idea that the time period finally approved in relation to the maximum periods of authorisation should facilitate normal repayment and performance of investments, and we therefore accept an extension of the time limit and also, possibly, compensation where total repayment has not taken place, as certain other amendments suggest."
"There are other amendments that, although they do not introduce changes, provide useful clarifications, particularly in relation to the continued application of the rules currently in force with regard to safety, the environment and social issues."
"All of these amendments can be accepted, though with modifications to their wording."
"However, there are issues that we cannot accept, for various different reasons, and you must understand this, ladies and gentlemen."
"In the case of certain amendments to the recitals of the directive, they do not really correspond to the legislative text itself, for example: Amendments Nos 2, 3 and 12."
"Neither can the Commission accept amendments that substantially change or reduce the scope of the directive."
"Having reached this point, please allow me to point out two problems which have been at the centre of the debates in Parliament' s Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism: should ground services be included in the scope of the directive?"
"The enormous majority of parties accept that this inclusion is necessary, and we could not accept any amendment, such as No 52, which leads to the exclusion of this sector."
"If we want modern, high-quality ports, that which is possible and necessary for ground services in airports must also be possible and necessary in ports."
"Furthermore, this position received majority support in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism."
"The same is true with the amendments aimed at excluding self-handling and the right of service providers to employ the personnel of their choice, such as Amendments Nos 69, 70, 71, 72 and 73, which are also rejected."
"The latter is already included in the legislation."
"However, if you read our proposal correctly, you will see that service providers cannot employ so-called 'pirate workers' . It is not possible."
"If these misunderstandings can be overcome by clarifying our text, the Commission is prepared to seek an appropriate wording."
"Another problem is the issue of pilotage."
"The question is once again whether pilotage can be included in the directive or not."
"Many people believe that certain safety considerations make it difficult to include this particular sector, but there are ways to ensure safety which are different from those which are currently applied."
"The same is true for other technical-nautical services, which is why the Commission cannot accept those amendments which exclude pilotage from the scope of the directive."
"In this regard also, Parliament' s relevant committee supported our proposal."
"Certain other amendments are also unacceptable for various reasons: specifically, economic considerations concerning the service provider should not be a criterion, as is mentioned in the second part of Amendment No 25."
"Service providers must accept commercial risks and public authorities must not carry out economic assessments."
"Having said this, our proposal leaves a door open: when exceptional circumstances arise relating to the volume of cargo, the number of service providers may be restricted."
"Furthermore, without going into detail, we cannot accept various amendments for technical reasons and the list is available to you."
"Lastly, I would like to refer to Amendment No 26."
"Our proposal indicates that normally, and I repeat, normally, at least two service providers will have to be authorised for each category of cargo."
"If we were to remove this article, we would have to apply the rule established in another paragraph, which would authorise the greatest possible number of service providers, a consequence which I do not believe was intended on presenting this amendment."
"Certain amendments express the desire to put more stress on competition between ports than the Commission' s package on ports does."
"Please allow me to deal with this issue by saying that I agree with the need to consider competition between ports as well, but I think that we need to find a more appropriate way of doing so."
"For example, the increase in transparency: Amendments Nos 9 and 48."
"The Commission accepts this principle and I am counting on your support so that we can jointly find the best way to apply this principle."
"Another example is the State aid mentioned in Amendment No 49."
"We all agree that this State aid should not exist, but we must first provide a clear definition of the dividing line between what is State aid and what is not."
"The Treaty lays down that the Commission and only the Commission applies the Treaty' s rules in the field of State aid."
"The current legislative process will focus on this issue and I hope that we can sit down together to find a viable solution, within the framework of the Treaty, which clarifies such a thorny issue."
"And if it is necessary to go further - and I have the impression from what you have said, and I share many of your concerns, that this is the case - I must say that I am prepared to go further than the provisions of the current proposal in the fields of State aid to ports and competition between ports."
"Lastly, a few words on Amendment No 79, which proposes excluding private ports, many of which do not apply access restrictions."
"During the legislative process, we will have to study ways of suitably dealing with this issue."
"Of course, this is only the beginning of the legislative process. During this long process, the Commission will be open to finding constructive solutions with the European Parliament which will allow us to be able to count upon the broadest possible support for this proposal, which is aimed at ensuring that a mature industry, an industry which has much to gain from the restructuring of the European transport industry, can meet the challenges before us and make a crucial contribution to our creating a sustainable transport system at the service of economic development, the creation of jobs, respect for the environment and the quality of life of our citizens."
"Enlargement"
"The next item is the Commission communication on enlargement."
"The President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, now has the floor."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, enlargement has been a top priority for this Commission from the very beginning of its mandate."
"From the point of view of Europe' s powers and responsibilities, its potential and goals, enlargement is the real acid test."
"It is also Europe' s historic duty."
"Enlargement - the unification of this continent - brings to a close a chapter in Europe' s history and lays the foundations for the future."
"Through this process, the Union is preparing to shoulder responsibilities as a continent and we therefore need to take a closer look at our resources, policies and goals, at global level."
"Our commitment and courage must match the commitment and courage which the candidate countries are showing as they prepare to join the Union."
"Since the beginning of my mandate as President of the Commission, nothing has made a deeper impression on me than my trips to the candidate countries, my meetings with their citizens and the representatives of their governments, or my contact with their parliaments, bravely working day and night on the arduous task of bringing their societies safely through the transition consisting mainly of preparations for enlargement."
"In recognition of their efforts, I would like to send them a message of thanks and good wishes from the European Parliament here in Strasbourg."
"There you are: these are countries which, barely ten years ago, were literally cut off from the Europe in which we live."
"Even before being formally admitted as new Member States, the candidate countries are starting to reap the benefits of their integration. In practice, they are already part of our area of stability and development, as is shown by the ever-increasing presence in the candidate countries of companies from the Member States."
"We have already seen extraordinary progress along the road to accession."
"The reports we are presenting to you today analyse as precisely as possible the countries' preparation efforts. Here, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to Commissioner Verheugen and his colleagues for their huge, unprecedented efforts, in terms of both quality and quantity, in instigating and experimenting with a truly remarkable methodology, and if we should prove to have failed at any time, it is because we really were stepping out in the dark."
"In short, our reports show that this historic moment really is possible and just around the corner, but only if we are able to keep up this sustained pace."
"Without going into the details of the reports, which Commissioner Verheugen will be describing in a few moments, I can tell you that progress has been made in virtually all the chapters making up the accession process."
"I think I can safely say that this remarkable progress has been greatly inspired by Nice, where, a year ago, we set out the practical stages and the 'roadmap' , as we termed it, for the final stage of this path to enlargement."
"One year from now, we will evaluate, together with Parliament, the ability of each of the candidate countries to assume the rights and responsibilities which are part and parcel of its integration into the Union."
"We realise that, when that time comes, we will have to have concluded, or, at least, very nearly concluded the negotiations with the countries which have met the criteria laid down."
"Once the conditions set by Parliament and the European Council have been complied with, and once the necessary ratification procedures are complete, these countries will be in a position to join the European Union before the June 2004 elections and thus elect representatives to this House for the next Parliamentary term."
"Therefore, next year will be decisive for the enlargement process and for the future of Europe."
"Negotiations will be tackling sensitive issues like agriculture, the Structural Funds and the budget and, in these negotiations, we will show the same determination to find constructive answers that we have shown in the past."
"From the beginning of the year onwards, the Commission will be putting forward proposals based on the current acquis and on the principles adopted at the Berlin European Council."
"Much will depend on the continued efforts of the candidate countries to adopt and implement the acquis."
"As the Commission stresses in its Regular Reports this year, the candidate countries will also need to develop the necessary administrative capacity to be able to apply the Union' s rules and policies properly."
"However, sustained efforts on behalf of the candidate countries are only one side of the coin."
"In order for enlargement to be a success, it will be important to strengthen the Community method and sustain the necessary cooperation between the Council, Parliament and the Commission."
"2002 will be a year of intense reviewing and monitoring and I know I can count on Parliament to scrutinise this work closely."
"I would also urge the Member States to continue to respect their existing commitments regarding enlargement, particularly those contained in Agenda 2000 and the Financial Perspective for up to 2006, as agreed by the Berlin European Council in 1999."
"We cannot make further reforms a pre-condition for enlargement, although the responsibilities which we are taking on with enlargement must prompt us to begin preparing, with considerable momentum and political vision, the new institutional process due to be launched at the Laeken European Council."
"Similarly, the current negotiations should not be linked to the issue of the Union' s finances after 2006, these are separate issues."
"Any attempt to relate them would mean changing the rules and would inevitably ultimately disrupt our carefully balanced negotiation process."
"The reports we are presenting to you also look at the implications of enlargement for the candidate countries' neighbours, that is other European countries, and for the Mediterranean."
"The terrorist attacks of 11 September against the US have completely changed the international situation. It is now less stable, less predictable and more frightening."
"Now, more than ever, the world needs a strong Europe which is sure of its values, which sows stability, predictability, security and prosperity around it, and which is, at last, a leading power on the international stage."
"With enlargement, Europe' s position as the world' s leading economy and trading power, with an internal market of 500 million consumers, will be confirmed."
"With this situation established, we will be in a position to extend the area of stability and prosperity which we so need beyond the Union and the candidate countries."
"If we are to achieve this, we will need a new 'neighbourhood policy' , and this is one of this Commission' s strategic goals."
"As I have long maintained, and as I confirmed yesterday at the College of Europe in Bruges, we need to move beyond and expand the range of instruments available to the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, the partnerships with Russia and Ukraine, and our stability efforts in the Balkans."
"The fundamental intention is to extend liberalisation of trade, the technical standards and the laws governing our internal market to all our neighbours."
"The form that the appropriate agreements should take - free-trade agreements or agreements modelled on the European Economic Area agreement - will have to be determined through negotiations, but the essential objective will be to consolidate mutual economic presence."
"Our central aim is to build a partnership with our neighbours that is as close as possible and which can become an anchor for stability and security."
"Basically, what we need to do is 'export' stability, and lay the foundations for balanced development in all areas bordering on the Union, drawing on the main strengths of European integration."
"This will make integration of our closest neighbours, the countries of the Western Balkans, easier when the time comes."
"In our efforts, we must not, of course, neglect the importance of the cultural dimension of our partnership."
"This is why we are working on a new initiative to encourage dialogue and mutual understanding between the northern and southern shores of the Mediterranean."
"I am grateful for Parliament' s past and present support and constructive attitude towards the enlargement process. I am counting on Parliament' s continued support during this sensitive, final phase of the negotiations."
"The work of the Members of this House will be crucial, not just in terms of ratification as such, but also, more generally, in terms of encouraging support for enlargement among Europe' s citizens."
"Opinion polls indicate that, in many parts of the Union, many citizens still need to be convinced of the overall benefits of enlargement."
"The Commission will, of course, continue and intensify its information strategy, but it is Parliament and its Members that can make the greatest, most effective contribution to building up the necessary democratic support for enlargement."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the continuous involvement of this House in the enlargement process remains crucial, and not least in terms of the debate on Europe' s future, a debate to which the candidate countries and future Member States are expected to make a substantial contribution."
"The report presented by the Commission today shows that the beginning of a new European era is just a few steps away."
"Let us take these steps together and continue and intensify our cooperation in the months to come, and thus lay the foundations for a larger, stronger, completely democratic Union."
"(Loud applause)"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I will add to what President Prodi has already said by informing you of a number of things."
"The Commission's essential political message for today is that the desire of Parliament and of the Council to achieve the first accessions before the 2004 European elections may well be ambitious, but it is realistic and feasible."
"Why is this so?"
"Firstly, because the candidate countries continue to meet the political criteria, with the exception of Turkey with which we cannot, for this reason, begin negotiations this year."
"Among the political criteria there are areas which still require our attention: good governance in the broadest sense of the word, international criminality, the functioning of the constitutional state - but I must repeat that the criteria have been met."
"The progress made in fulfilling the economic criteria means that ten of the candidate countries are functioning market economies and are also either now, or will be in the near future, in a position to cope with the competitive pressure in the internal market."
"These are all countries with which we have opened negotiations, with the exception of Bulgaria and Romania, where though, I must openly say, there has also been significant progress."
"Particularly in Romania's case, the Commission considers it important to note that, for the first time, there is real progress in terms of political, economic and social reform, something which will be shown clearly only in the next progress report."
"As regards the adoption of the acquis, this is reflected, above all, in the progress made in the negotiations, of which you are all well aware."
"So far, we have achieved all that was envisaged in the framework of the negotiating timetable, and therefore the negotiating timetable fixed at Nice will continue to be the keynote of our actions."
"What is actually new about this year's report is that we are now concentrating very intently on the last remaining, and very substantial, problem, namely how to ensure that the future Member countries, at the time of accession, will have the administrative capacity to meet all the obligations of a Member of the European Union."
"For the avoidance of doubt, let me say that as yet they do not."
"Not one of the candidate countries at present fully meets all three criteria."
"The Commission therefore proposes the realisation of a special action plan to improve the candidate countries' implementation capacity."
"We are therefore also making extensive additional resources available."
"We will inform Parliament and the Council of the outcome as early as the middle of next year."
"I do not want there to be any misapprehensions here."
"If the progress reports focus heavily on the shortfalls that we still have today, this is simply because we cannot repeat every year what has already been done, but the nearer we come to the objective of the negotiations, all the more clearly do we see the problems that still remain."
"In order to have the full picture, though, we must see the remaining problems against the background of the enormous progress that has been made over the past few years."
"Only then do we get things in the right perspective."
"We believe that it is possible to reduce the existing administrative and legal shortcomings in due time for the candidate countries to have adequate implementation capacity when they accede."
"To put it very plainly: the Commission will no doubt have to give final opinions next year, and by that point there must be no more deficits."
"Let me say in addition, that the accession negotiations with Cyprus are well advanced."
"It is our strategic goal to take in a united Cyprus as a new member."
"This requires constructive and substantial progress towards a lasting peace solution."
"I therefore reiterate my appeal to all concerned to make use of the 'window of opportunity' to achieve this goal."
"The pre-accession strategy for Turkey is showing the first positive results."
"The constitutional reform recently adopted by the Turkish Parliament is a step in the right direction, but further reforms are necessary, especially in regard to effective protection of human rights and the implementation of economic reforms."
"The Commission considers that it is now time to intensify the pre-accession strategy."
"A more detailed scrutiny of Turkish legislation and its approximation to the acquis will be in the forefront."
"We have, though, not yet progressed to the point where we can propose starting on Turkey's screening."
"Next year we will be embarking on the most politically sensitive stage of the accession negotiations."
"We will lay down a general framework for the negotiation of the financial chapter which ensures that it can be dealt with in a common framework, and we will be doing this very early in 2002, so that the Spanish Presidency will have the chance to keep to the timetable."
"We are confident that the enlargement negotiations can be successfully completely on the basis of the current acquis."
"In our proposal, we will strictly observe the expenditure limits of Agenda 2000."
"We will thus make no proposals going beyond them, nor will we make proposals binding the European Union beyond 2006, so that it is perfectly clear that the Commission's strategy involves no financial risks."
"Finally, let me add that negotiations are currently concerned with issues, the resolution of which will have direct impact on the living conditions of citizens in the accession countries."
"The decisions made now will influence either positively or negatively the acceptance of the accessions in the candidate countries."
"We must therefore make every effort to give the citizens in today's and tomorrow's Member States all the information about enlargement."
"No partner should be subjected to excessive demands in the accession process."
"It is therefore essential that negotiations be both flexible and result-oriented."
"The Commission will, then, on the basis of next year's progress reports, submit recommendations on the readiness for accession of those countries that are adequately prepared."
"It will make every effort to ensure that negotiations with these countries can be concluded successfully."
"It will also produce a revised pre-accession strategy for those countries which are unable or unwilling to conclude negotiations by the end of 2002."
"These countries must not be made to feel that they are being left behind."
"They therefore require special attention and special instruments, which we will be proposing in the 2002 Strategy Paper."
"Thank you, Commissioner Verheugen."
"I would remind the House that this debate consists of an exchange of short questions and answers."
"Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, I have, of course, some questions, but a few statements are in order."
"Let me say first, Mr President of the Commission, that we are glad to see you here."
"We were, though, somewhat astonished to see your name appear on the monitor during our bureau meeting."
"It took us by surprise, which may have been a mistake by our group."
"We do, of course, make mistakes, but in general, according to what I hear around the place, it was not known that the President of the Commission was going to be here this afternoon. We are glad that you are here, even though we would have liked prior notice."
"A second point, to which I would also like an answer, is that I was told this morning while the Group Chairmen were holding press conferences, that Mr Verheugen had also held a press conference."
"I would be very interested to know, Commissioner, whether it was on the subject to which you have just been speaking."
"If you can shed some light on that, then so much the better."
"Now for my questions."
"First, let me inform you that our group's leaders had a meeting in Hungary last week."
"There was grave concern in Hungary that the enlargement could, for them, be delayed if in another country, namely Poland, developments were not proceeding as quickly as might be wished."
"Of course, we all want Poland to be in the first round of enlargement, but a consequence of that must not be that, if a Member country is not yet ready, the others have to wait and we cannot keep to the 2004 deadline."
"Each country must be assessed on its own merits if enlargement is to be able to take place at all."
"I would be obliged if you could say something about this."
"I then have a very specific question."
"There was also disquiet in Hungary about the critical judgment passed on the 'status law' on Hungarians in other countries."
"This law was adopted by 95% of the Hungarian Parliament, and a commission of the European Council, the so-called Venice Commission, explicitly stated that this law was acceptable."
"One last question: How do you see the overcoming of the past with reference to some EU countries today?"
"I am thinking of the Benes decrees and of the acquisition of land in Poland, for example."
"Can you say something more about that?"
"Can we take as our starting point statements which, if these countries join the European Union, will make it possible for them to have a future with a clear record, which we of course very much want?"
"We want the 2004 deadline to be adhered to, so that these peoples can take part in the next European elections."
"Mr President, I would like to clarify the issue of Poland, at last, because the situation is incredible: in Poland they are saying that we favour the smaller States while the smaller States say we favour Poland."
"Well then, we need to make it clear once and for all that good progress is being made, and by 'good progress' we mean good progress for Poland as well."
"This country has made excellent progress, and so there is no need to put Poland in a different category from the others."
"I feel, or rather I must express my utmost satisfaction at the fact that, looking back at the rate of progress, it is apparent that Poland has displayed remarkable energy and ability in this race, on this journey towards enlargement, towards accession."
"I can therefore find no reason to differentiate between Poland and Hungary or between Hungary and Poland."
"Sir, neither the President of the Commission nor I myself have held any press conference."
"We abide fully by what we agreed."
"It is for that reason that the press conference is to take place at 6 p.m., after Parliament has been informed."
"I regularly talk to journalists, as you well know."
"There was, though, no press conference, and that is an important distinction."
"As far as the Hungarian law on status is concerned, we notified the Hungarian government of problems with this law from the point of view of the acquis communautaire even before the law was enacted."
"These problems were then taken into legislative account, so that we have no problems with Community law."
"My estimation of the Venice Commission differs from your own."
"The Venice Commission ruled that whether the Hungarian Status Law is contrary to international law or not is dependent on the way it is implemented."
"We have therefore had discussions for some time with the Hungarian government and with the governments of neighbouring countries in order to ensure that Hungary's neighbours are involved in finding a way of implementing it on which they can all agree."
"The Hungarian government is thankfully endeavouring to bring this about, and the Romanian and Slovak governments are also ready to play their part."
"The Benes decrees have not to date been the subject of negotiations, since property issues, as you well know, are not covered by Community law."
"As regards the acquisition of land, I expect something to happen very quickly in the relevant negotiations with Poland."
"During my visit to Warsaw last week, the Polish government announced that it would be taking a flexible approach to this issue."
"Mr Verheugen, no press conference has been held but the press already has your text."
"I think that is the cause of this confusion."
"Madam President, I would like to put three short questions."
"The first is to Mr Verheugen: You have announced that there will be additional resources or an additional programme for modernising and adapting administration."
"I would be interested to know whether these are financial resources deducted from other programmes for these countries on an anticipatory basis."
"Perhaps you could define that a bit more exactly."
"My second is this: Commissioner, the Court of Auditors' report that we discussed today criticises the Commission for the absence of definite criteria in its programmes to reinforce atomic power stations, that is, to increase the safety of their reactors."
"Are you prepared to consider the possibility that the Commission is not drawing up any criteria, that is to say, any general criteria, but only criteria for checking reactor safety improvement measures, carried out with the support of Commission resources?"
"My third question, concerning Cyprus and Turkey, has already been briefly alluded to."
"The Turkish Prime Minister has just made statements in what may be a new form, to the effect that, if it came to it, the northern part of Cyprus might be annexed."
"Does the Commission have a clear, official and unambiguous answer to this?"
"Madam President, I will answer the honourable gentleman's questions as follows. Firstly, resources for the additional measures to improve implementation are being taken from the Phare budget, so additional resources are not being drawn on, nor are resources being transferred."
"This is, rather, a change of priorities in Phare's programming, something of which, by the way, I informed Parliament some time ago."
"We had also said that we were ready to adjust priorities in view of the fallout from 11 September, if it were a question of meeting stricter conditions in internal and legal policy, police cooperation and the securing of our external frontiers."
"As you know, the Commission has no authority in matters of reactor safety."
"I do not know what the Court of Auditors is referring to in this instance; it may be to the work of the Council working party on nuclear energy issues, which, however, is not a Commission office."
"The Commission is in no way responsible and is not involved in any steps to improve nuclear safety in candidate countries."
"All the Commission does is to negotiate the required decommissioning of the reactors, regarded by the Member States as incapable of being retrofitted, with the relevant countries such as Lithuania, Bulgaria and Slovakia and then go on to implement such decommissioning."
"This has to a large degree been completed, as you know."
"We still await a final closure date for Ignalina II in Lithuania and an offer of finance for this, still outstanding, is expected in the near future."
"Apart from that, we in the Commission have nothing to do with the construction of further nuclear power stations in Central and Eastern European countries."
"I must say quite frankly that this is the first time I have heard of this criticism by the Court of Auditors."
"I would myself be very grateful, and I imagine the President would be too, if the Commission were to have responsibility for nuclear safety standards."
"I must, though, tell you that the Member States, and you as an Austrian Member will know how watchful the Member States are in the Melk process in which the Commission is mediating between Austria and the Czech Republic, determinedly refuse to let the Commission create conditions that would lead to the rise of European Community law on reactor safety standards."
"I am, though, quite happy to come back to this subject when I have been informed about this report by the Court of Auditors."
"As regards the Turkish Prime Minister's statement, what Mr Ecevit has said is nothing new to me; I have heard it in many conversations with him and read it in articles by him for over a year."
"Our response is quite clear."
"If, first condition, no political reunification of Cyprus is achieved; if, second presupposition, the Member States decide, and Parliament agrees, that Cyprus should be admitted in any case; and if, thirdly, Turkey were then to react in that way - all hypothetical questions at present - if, though, that were to happen, it would result in probably the worst crisis ever in relations between Turkey and the European Union."
"I do not at present see how we could quickly extricate ourselves from such a crisis."
"Madam President, I should like to return to the question of what used to be called the Madrid criterion, the question of implementation capacity."
"How will the institutions in general, in particular the Member States, judge, and by what criteria will they judge, whether the applicants have arrived at the happy state of having an implementation capacity?"
"I share and salute the headline goal, but I wonder what is its measurable content?"
"The problem is that in Parliament we have not had the opportunity yet to read all these contrary reports which have been adopted."
"But given the comments that the Commissioner has just made about Turkey, could he characterise - because we have not yet had the chance to study it - the political mood of the Turkey report?"
"I hope it is a report which gives sufficient and due recognition to serious attempts at change."
"There are serious deficiencies which remain, but engagement with Turkey in the light of the earlier comments is an even more profound necessity in the near future than it has been in the recent past."
"I am obliged to the honourable Member."
"The monitoring of progress in the capacity to implement is a standard procedure that we have developed over a considerable time."
"We simply observe what legislation was taken over, and whether adequate material and human resources were available to make this legislation a reality."
"It goes without saying that we also observe whether it actually works in practice."
"This monitoring is going on constantly."
"The information required for it comes to us from the most diverse sources, not only from our own, but also, for example, information is used which comes to us from Parliament."
"We have a system that puts us in a position to say at any time to any given country how far we have got with their capacity to implement."
"This procedure has been well established and has proved its worth."
"As regards Turkey, I can tell the honourable gentleman that the current picture presents varied aspects."
"There are positive things in it."
"One is no doubt that the Accession Partnership is now working in all its aspects."
"All its elements are present and are being kept to."
"In this respect, relations between us and Turkey were never before as close as they are now."
"Another positive element is no doubt the remarkable progress being made in constitutional reform and also in legislative matters, towards democratisation and respect for human rights."
"This is surely still dependent on the extent to which these constitutional changes and legislation are actually experienced in the country's day-to-day reality."
"There has been no progress in the economic sphere."
"So much is well known."
"There has been remarkable progress in conforming to the acquis."
"That is the good I have to report."
"On the negative side, I have to say that, as already stated, the human rights situation is still unsatisfactory."
"I must say that I had expected more from Turkey by way of cooperation in resolving the Cyprus issue."
"We have already discussed this in another context."
"I am also disappointed by Turkey's conduct as regards the issue of European security and defence policy."
"I do not find it appropriate for a country desirous of being a member of the European Union to hinder the European Union from making progress with a significant aspect of integration."
"This is, in my view, not the sort of behaviour that we should expect of a candidate country."
"Commissioner, there are agreements between some of the candidate countries, such as the customs union agreement between the Czech Republic and Slovakia, rather than the Visegrad agreement, which could render the situation rather more complex should only one of the two countries join the Union, for example, if the Czech Republic were to join but not Slovakia or vice versa."
"Now, as has rightly been said, all the countries have to respect all the necessary parameters and criteria."
"Should this situation arise, what line should we take?"
"Secondly, with regard to countries such as Croatia, countries which are not yet candidates, that is, although they have made considerable progress towards applying for and achieving the status of candidate countries, what is the current situation?"
"Lastly, we have touched on the issue of Cyprus, with regard to which you said that were we to be faced with a reaction such as that threatened by the Turkish Prime Minister, there would be a very serious crisis."
"My feeling is that, in this regard, we are proceeding almost without any safety net at all, for such a reaction would involve the annexing of part of the territory of the European Union."
"It may be that we should safeguard ourselves against such an eventuality and allow ourselves a moment' s reflection before coming up against this situation, which I feel is so very sensitive."
"Madam President, I would like to say, in response to the honourable gentleman's first question, that free trade agreements between candidate countries and third countries should of course cease before accession, but it goes without saying that they cannot continue to be valid after it."
"Free trade agreements between two candidate countries would in fact create problems if these countries were then to accede at different times."
"I must say, though, that the problem is a very limited one, as the countries you have mentioned are covered by the Europe Agreements, which already provide for quite wide-ranging liberalisation of trade in goods, and also of the traffic in services and other economic relations, so that a European solution can be found for this problem should it eventually arise."
"I do not, though, think it likely that it will."
"The question about Croatia is outside my remit; I would have to ask the President to say something about it."
"I would add, speaking of Cyprus, that I clearly stated that you were putting hypothetical questions."
"I do not as a rule like answering hypothetical questions, but you were entitled to an assessment of the situation."
"I did also say, though, that the Commission has not changed the clear line it has taken, that we must do everything, yes everything, to achieve a political solution to the conflict before accession negotiations are completed."
"I have repeatedly appealed to all parties and must again say clearly that it is in the particular interest of the Turkish Cypriot community that a political solution be found before the accessions take place, as nobody will profit as much as the Turkish Cypriot community from Cyprus' membership of the European Union."
"For that reason, any policy that bars access to the European Union to the Turkish Cypriot community in Cyprus is a policy which directly, clearly and unambiguously works against the interests of the people there."
"As you will remember, Mr Podestà, the very week after the political changeover and the establishment of a situation of recognised democracy in the country, I lost no time in going to Croatia to instigate relations of cooperation, which are currently progressing very well."
"In recent weeks, we have had an official meeting with the Croatian Prime Minister and we have continued along that path: we are genuinely encouraging Croatia in all its efforts to establish a closer relationship with the European Union."
"Clearly, the tragedy of war and its repercussions on the country' s economy are still very deeply felt and mean that things will take time, but we are actively doing everything we can to speed up the process."
"Madam President, I have three questions."
"I would first like to say that I find it a very good thing that the Commission is at last turning its mind to supporting the strengthening of administration."
"But my question is whether it is also going to look at the need for administration to really involve the citizens, so that things that go without saying, here in the European Union, are also put into practice there?"
"My second question concerns the action plan and finance."
"If you are allocating more resources from the Phare programme for the support of the institutions, does that then mean that resources are being removed from the other important area of social and economic cohesion, in other words that we are no longer supporting the halting of increasing social decay, which is a core problem in these countries, even though it is urgently necessary?"
"My last question concerns a point which the report does not mention at all. Does the Commission intend to encourage the Council to publish a European programme for the Roma people, something which is in my view urgently required?"
"In almost all countries at present, the Roma minority's human and democratic rights are being violated as much as they have been in the past."
"This can clearly not be resolved by these accession candidates on an individual basis; it is a European issue that must be dealt with by a European programme."
"Madam, it goes without saying that the degree of citizen participation that is normative in the European Union is also required of the candidate countries, and is a component factor both in the monitoring they receive and in the support they are given."
"Secondly, the resources about which Mr Swoboda has already asked are not taken from the country-specific programmes, but are multi-country programmes, which relate to all countries and which, if you want to put it that way, are kept in the central reserve."
"No one country therefore receives one single euro less from the projects which have been discussed up to now."
"The burden is not therefore borne by other projects."
"On the subject of a European Roma project: this has not yet in fact been included in the Commission's proposals."
"Discussion of the subject is already in progress in some of the candidate countries, which are saying that this is a European problem and must therefore be dealt with by a European Community programme."
"As far as I am aware, this approach is not shared by most of the Member countries."
"In any case, a specific European Roma programme would require significant material resources."
"I have to answer your question by saying that the Commission has not as yet made such a proposal, but is concentrating on helping the candidate countries with the implementation of their national strategies to integrate the Roma."
"Perhaps I should point out that we have very strict requirements on this point and demand of all the candidate countries with a Roma population that they present and implement a medium-term strategy towards the social integration of the Roma and the removal of social discrimination."
"As you know, we are giving these programmes very substantial support by means of pre-accession instruments."
"Madam President, Commissioner, you said that you had not held a press conference."
"That appears to be the case, but can you confirm that you held a press briefing this morning, while the groups' press conferences were going on?"
"Secondly, should this question be answered in the affirmative, I would very much like to ask the President of the Commission whether he thinks that press briefings of this sort are conducive to cooperation between Parliament and the Commission, when we should be the first to be informed."
"Madam President, I can tell the honourable gentleman that there was no briefing either; on the contrary, I have conversations with the press every day, background discussions with many different journalists."
"Such a conversation took place today, but it was not a briefing."
"It was a background discussion, which was not intended for publication."
"I think you will agree that it is a fairly subtle distinction, Mr Verheugen."
"Madam President, Mr Swoboda's question on reactor safety raised the question in my mind of whether the Commission can make it clear not only to its own bureaux, but also to the Member States and their governments, and certainly also to the European Parliament, that we cannot, in negotiations, demand more from the candidates for accession that we ourselves comply with as Member States of the European Union."
"I believe that this is not quite clear to all areas of all our institutions."
"Perhaps it should again be highlighted in the coming year."
"The second question I would like to put is this. In your report, you are very optimistic that ten countries will have the chance to sign the Accession Treaty at the end of next year."
"As you have expressed it, but I believe it needs to be expressed even more clearly: that is the assessment of today."
"This means that, if countries fall behind next year because of poor performance on the political front, the list could well comprise fewer than ten, so that great individual efforts will be necessary and today's judgment will offer no security."
"To this will, of course, be added the issues of implementation and of administrative capacity."
"Your paper points out that work will be being done on implementation even after the Treaty is signed."
"What certainty will there be, though, on the day the Treaty is signed, that administrative capacity will actually be in place when accession becomes effective?"
"Madam President, the honourable gentleman's first question can be answered only with great difficulty."
"I sometimes feel that at one point or another we are demanding of the candidate countries something that the Member States are not doing themselves."
"This, though, has to do with the criteria we have and our obligation to report very precisely on the extent to which they are complied with - or not, as the case may be."
"Today, I said to the Commission, and on the same subject, that we must always imagine what progress reports would look like if the same criteria were applied to the Member States."
"The Member States would never allow us to do any such thing, but so much of what we criticise in candidate countries or describe as incompatible with the Copenhagen criteria, could, perhaps, also be found in one Member State or another."
"So, at this point, I recommend modesty to our Member States."
"Nothing more can, of course, be demanded in the negotiations themselves than is required of the Member States."
"The negotiations are very precisely attuned to the acquis and to nothing else."
"They touch on nothing else."
"The problem you have described can therefore only arise when considering the question of whether candidate countries comply with the indeed very vaguely formulated political or economic accession criteria."
"My answer is that it may be that we are sometimes asking for more."
"As regards the other question of the ten countries, the Commission said today in fact, that we must prepare for the accession of all those which have complied with the conditions and completed negotiations by the end of 2002."
"This represents rejection of the idea of forming what might be termed political groups, and is, in the Commission's judgment, the correct interpretation of the Helsinki and Gothenburg Decisions."
"It was stated in Helsinki that all countries that had been invited to negotiate should have a chance to conclude, which can only mean that it was considered that their accessions could be simultaneous with those of the countries which had been negotiating since Luxembourg, and Gothenburg envisaged the first accessions taking place before 2004."
"It necessarily follows from this that we must prepare for the accession of up to ten countries, I will not say ten, but up to ten, because ten countries have set themselves the goal of completing negotiations by 2002."
"Whether it will actually come to that, I do not know."
"The Commission will produce its concluding opinion next year, and will do so in strict accordance with the principles and rules that it itself has proposed."
"As I said here in Parliament during the most recent discussion on enlargement, it is a subject on which we cannot let ourselves make political decisions as it were in the worst or narrowest sense of the word, that is, saying on the basis of purely political considerations that one country is coming in and another is not."
"Such a decision must much rather be founded on compliance with the criteria and on the outcome of the negotiations."
"The Commission's proposal will be couched in those terms."
"None of the ten countries that currently believe they will manage it can evade the possibility of us saying at the end of the day: this country is not ready."
"Let me say it clearly: none of them."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I have just been listening to what you have been saying about the enlargement of the EU."
"I have heard a lot about the shortcomings of Turkey, about constitutional changes, the democratisation process and human rights."
"My question is, what is there in the accession partnership document about the rights of the Kurds?"
"What is the situation with regard to the rights of 25 million people who have not been mentioned in this discussion?"
"I ask you, Commissioner, to tell us how the rights of the Kurds are affected and how you assess the political situation in Turkey as regards constitutional changes and the Kurdish question."
"Madam, I regret to have to tell you that the accession partnership with Turkey was not the subject of today's discussions."
"Today we in fact discussed and adopted twelve accession partnerships, but not the accession partnership with Turkey, and that because it entered into force only in the early part of this year, and updating it after only a few months would make no sense."
"We will therefore be proposing the updating of the accession partnership with Turkey only next year and will produce the assessment you have asked for in that context."
"Madam President, I actually have one question for Commissioner Verheugen."
"Not so long ago, he announced, with our blessing, the launch of a large information campaign both within the European Union and in the candidate countries, highlighting the advantages of the EU' s enlargement."
"How does he explain in that light and in the context of the activities carried out, that the support for enlargement, both in the EU and in the candidate countries, is declining despite this effort?"
"What does the Commission intend to do about this?"
"Sir, for a start I cannot see that support for enlargement is decreasing either in candidate countries or in Member States."
"The figures with which I am acquainted indicate the precise opposite."
"Quite apart from that, public opinion on the subject is, if I may say so, extraordinarily fickle."
"It evidently very much depends on who is asking, what is being asked, and when."
"In this way, you can obtain quite different results in the same country at the same time."
"I know all the surveys that are being done, and my analysis is that we must not work on the assumption that we are dealing with dwindling support."
"Secondly, as regards communications strategy, the European Parliament, and you as a Member of it will be aware of this, has considered it right, for reasons it has made known to us, to make the funds available relatively late in the day, only, in fact, in the course of this year."
"The truth is that all the measures could be put in motion only after the summer recess."
"You cannot expect that I should be able to supply you with some sort of report on the results of a campaign that started only eight weeks ago."
"I must make it clear that this is outside the Commission's remit."
"The Commission made its proposal on the implementation of a communication strategy in April 2000, therefore only a few months after we took office."
"That it took so long for this strategy to become reality in the European institutions is in this instance regrettable."
"I do not believe, though, that it is too late, because only now that the results of negotiations are becoming evident is it right and necessary to fully apply this strategy."
"This strategy is in no way about indoctrinating people or, as you have suggested, convincing them of advantages, but about giving them an objective basis on which to form their own opinions and judgments."
"The Commission would indeed not be permitted to do more."
"That concludes this item of the agenda. I would like to thank Commissioner Verheugen and President Prodi."
"Madam President, on a point of order."
"This was advertised as a ""catch the eye of the President"" session, open to all Members of Parliament."
"In fact it has been nothing more than a private meeting of Parliament's Bureau."
"Group leaders have been invited to speak, Mr Poettering was invited to speak twice and the groups have been asked to put forward speakers."
"It has not been an open debate and I really do not know why the rest of us turn up if you are going to conduct business this way."
"This is not in the interests of Parliament."
"I must protest at the way in which you have conducted this matter."
"Mr Titley, I quite understand that Members whose names have not been called feel somewhat frustrated."
"Having said this, I would remind you that this was a question and answer session."
"It is true that some Members far exceeded their allotted speaking time."
"Should I have cut them off because of that?"
"You are well aware that that is not my way of doing things."
"I am sure you will also understand that I naturally had to give precedence to the rapporteurs, to those who have worked as rapporteurs on this subject."
"I would also point out, for your information, that a number of rapporteurs were unfortunately unable to take the floor, including three from the European People' s Party: Mrs Carlsson, Mrs Stenzel and Mr Van Orden, not to mention Mr Haarder and Mr Beazley."
"So you see, Mr Titley, how difficult this was to manage."
"I think that Parliament should make a decision, but it should be aware that if the question and answer session overruns, and I would gladly have extended it by a good half-hour, as I think the subject deserved it, the time devoted to questions to the Commission may have to be reduced."
"You can imagine the reaction of your fellow Members who, as you know, are extremely anxious that the time allocated to questions to the Commission be scrupulously observed."
"You know that, when this is not the case, those Members call us to task and they are quite right to do so."
"I have tried to act for the best."
"If I was wrong, I apologise."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"Following Mr Titley's observation, I would simply say that this is a most important question."
"I am sure those who were not able to speak were very pleased to hear the Commissioner's comments."
"I will submit my questions to him in writing."
"I should like to point out that four of our colleagues here today asked three questions."
"If the President, and indeed colleagues, would limit themselves to one question, by my mathematics nine further speakers might have been called."
"We take note of these comments, which are inevitable, furthermore, given the lack of time."
"Question Time (Commission)"
"The next item is Questions to the Commission (B5-0338/2001)."
"Part I"
"Question No 28 by (H-0857/01):"
"Subject: Afghanistan and drugs According to the latest annual report of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme, opium production in Afghanistan has fallen strikingly as a result of the Taliban's prohibition policy."
"The events of 11 September have also contributed to the disruption of farming, including the cultivation of opium."
"In the light of this situation and the desperate plight of the population, what practical initiatives can the Commission take, particularly through its participation in the UN anti-drug programme, to provide relief and aid to the communities affected, and to dissuade producers from reverting to opium growing or selling the stocks that they still have?"
"Mr President, the Commission shares the honourable Member' s desire to provide adequate support for the Afghan people, of whose difficult situation we are all well aware."
"The significant assistance which the Community had been giving to the Afghan population has increased recently."
"The Community finances actions in the following areas: emergency aid, aid to displaced persons, aid for food safety, human rights and landmines."
"The assistance is implemented speedily through a wide network of non-governmental organisations."
"In this way, we contribute to reducing the dependence on poppy cultivation of the people who receive this aid."
"The food safety programme is of particular importance, since it provides seeds, tools and all the necessary elements for alternative crops."
"Obviously, no donor has been able to offer assistance in the field of compliance with the law in order to combat drug trafficking in Afghanistan, owing to the government of that country."
"However, the Commission has supported programmes in this sector, in countries which play an essential role in the heroin trafficking routes towards the European Union, such as the States of Central Asia: Iran, Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Russia, the Ukraine, Moldavia, Belarus, Bulgaria and Rumania."
"It is still unknown whether, given the current changing situation, the significant reduction in poppy cultivation observed by the UNIDCP 2000/2001 will continue and, furthermore, according to the United Nations, the trafficking in refined heroin from Afghanistan does not appear to be diminishing."
"According to the estimates of this United Nations body, the stocks accumulated before the crisis would keep the European market supplied for the next three to four years."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for the information which you have given us."
"However, I should like to ask if the immediate intention is for the European Commission programme to deal with this problem, on its own or through UN programmes, within the framework of the reconstruction of Afghanistan and assistance to neighbouring countries."
"As you know, Commissioner, the European Commission is spending a great deal of money on public awareness campaigns and the European Drugs Monitoring Centre."
"If we want to be sincere and efficient, we need to take more direct and effective action at the root of the evil, such as in Afghanistan."
"I share the honourable Member' s concern but, as I have said, the reality is that the United Nations' Cooperation and Development Plan for Afghanistan has not been able to deal with ensuring compliance with the law, owing to the Taliban government which is still in Afghanistan."
"I hope that, once things have changed in Afghanistan, as we all wish, and a government is in place which fulfils the minimum requirements in terms of respect for human rights, combating drug trafficking and other similar issues, we will be able to deal with issues such as the real application and the real effectiveness of this aid, which, I insist, currently has to be channelled through non-governmental organisations such as the UNHCR or the Red Cross, which are the usual channels of aid in these cases."
"Because it is clear that the aid, which has been interrupted since 11 September for obvious reasons, is going to be renewed as soon as possible."
"And I hope that on this occasion it is not restricted solely to funding and supported activity in the rural field, in the alternative crop sector, but that it also allows us to cooperate and maintain greater supervision of the real effectiveness of the authorities in their fight against this type of crop."
"Question No 29 by (H-0849/01):"
"Subject: Threat to nuclear facilities in the aftermath of 11 September Will the Commission establish the appropriate institutional instruments to prepare, within six months, a thorough analysis of a range of options for reducing the threat posed by deliberately crashing aircraft and other acts of malice at nuclear facilities, including the prospective benefits of transferring spent fuel to dry storage facilities that are robust against acts of malice, and suspending reprocessing until stocks of liquid high-level radioactive waste have been vitrified or otherwise used as part of an immobilisation programme for surplus plutonium?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the physical and operative security of nuclear installations falls within national competence, provided that compliance with the provisions of the Euratom Treaty is guaranteed."
"Each State of the Union is carrying out its own analysis of the situation in the light of the terrorist attacks of 11 September and, in this regard, they will adopt the necessary additional measures to increase the physical protection of nuclear installations and the materials which are used or stored in them."
"We hope that all the existing options are analysed in detail."
"For obvious security reasons, many of the details relating to these additional measures cannot be made public."
"On the other hand, it is clear that the best way to reduce the threat posed to nuclear installations, or any other installation, by the possibility of terrorists deliberately crashing an aircraft into them, is to make it impossible, or extremely improbable, that they may hijack a large commercial aircraft in the first place."
"In this regard, the Commission would like to remind you of the measures it proposed on 10 October for the adoption and application of common European Union rules in the field of civil aviation security, and which was first presented at the last Council of Transport Ministers."
"These measures are intended to deal with this point."
"Commissioner, I find that answer extraordinarily complacent."
"We all know that nuclear power plants were not designed to withstand collisions with large aircraft, particularly jumbo jets."
"You say that it is not that easy to hi-jack an airplane."
"Only yesterday there was another terrible accident in New York."
"I hope it was an accident and not an act of terror: at this point in time it is not entirely clear."
"Let us all pray that it was merely an accident and not something that was designed to kill all the people on board."
"I am sure we all sympathise with the families."
"This is a very serious matter."
"All I am asking is, will the Commission prepare an analysis?"
"Surely you can say ""yes"" to that and not just pass it off as the responsibility of the Member States."
"You have powers under Articles 34 and 35 of the Euratom Treaty."
"According to a recent European Parliament study you are not exercising your powers under those articles."
"Could you please comment on that aspect of my question."
"Have you looked at that study?"
"Have you looked at your powers, and can you at least prepare some kind of an analysis?"
"I am not asking you to disclose the discussions you are having with the Member States."
"Clearly, that may be inappropriate."
"But can you not do something?"
"Mr President, the first thing the Commission must do is act within the limits of the Treaties."
"I would like to say that nuclear power stations are not designed to endure the impact of a large commercial aircraft."
"It is true that not all the nuclear power stations in the European Union are the same; those which have a second layer of protection and, specifically, the most recent ones built in Germany, perhaps have a greater capacity for resistance and better security in the face of this type of situation than others."
"However, I would insist that security, in both its forms - security against terrorist attacks, external agents or sabotage and security against possible accidents - is a national responsibility."
"Having said all this, the honourable Member is right and we are concerned about these issues, especially in view of enlargement and the achievement of security levels in the nuclear power stations in the countries which are going to join the European Union in the future."
"We are studying how far we can go within the Euratom Treaty, in order to incorporate and seek equivalent levels of security within the nuclear installations in the current Member States, but, I would insist, within the margins laid down in the Treaties."
"Like you, I believe it is necessary to guarantee the greatest possible level of security."
"Finally, we must not only talk about nuclear power stations."
"The great petro-chemical plants, the great chemical industries, the great dams, are other installations which are at considerable risk and unfortunately may cause significant disasters in the case of a certain type of attack or sabotage."
"Various countries are working on this, not just those of the European Union."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the safety of nuclear installations is a problem for the whole of Europe and primarily an environmental issue."
"Safety is, in the final analysis, a European added value."
"Could you consider encouraging the preparation of a Green Paper on the safety of reactors or nuclear installations, so that in future a relatively objective assessment of the subject may be guaranteed?"
"Mr President, according to the Euratom Treaty, security is the national competence of each Member State."
"However, at the moment the WENRA, where all the regulators of the different Member States of the European Union meet, is working to find equivalent security standards which, in my opinion (which is shared by the services, although it is not an official position of the Commission, and I am therefore speaking personally), are necessary and beneficial for all: for the States which have chosen the non-nuclear option, but also for everyone else, since I believe, like you, that if there is an accident in a nuclear power station, the repercussions will transcend administrative borders and the problem is pan-European or even global."
"We must therefore support the Vienna Commission, which depends on the United Nations."
"These equivalent security standards should therefore be established, with a degree of obligation which is similar to that demanded in the Community, which would offer greater safeguards for the whole world."
"Our analyses are based on the situation and, if it is necessary to propose a modification to the Treaty, we would have to consider doing so."
"I have a supplementary question to Mrs Ahern's question."
"Is the recent decision giving the go-ahead to the MOX plant at Sellafield not unacceptable?"
"Is this not a violation of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea?"
"We have been raising the Sellafield issue here for many years."
"I would like to ask what your position is with regard to the UN conventions?"
"Do you believe in upholding them?"
"Do you consider that the authorities responsible for Sellafield have a duty to consult Ireland in this decision?"
"Do you consider that even at this stage a full European-backed environmental impact assessment should be carried out?"
"Mr Fitzsimons, I feel obliged to tell you that you have taken it upon yourself to bring forward Question No 62."
"I frankly do not believe that this obeys the Rules of Procedure."
"We had said goodbye to the Vice-President for today."
"Thank you for your attention."
"Question No 30 by (H-0839/01):"
"Subject: Serious unwanted side effects following the consumption of energy drinks in the European Union In several Member States of the European Union (including Ireland and Sweden) a number of serious cases have been recorded in which the consumption of energy drinks such as Red Bull has led to unwanted side effects and, in a number of cases, proved fatal."
"These drinks, when consumed in combination with alcohol or coffee or after vigorous physical exercise, cause complications chiefly manifested in the central nervous system."
"Moreover, such beverages are freely available in places such as schools, gymnasiums and discotheques."
"What steps will be taken following the deliberations of the 84th meeting of the Standing Committee on Food at which the Member State representatives expressed deep concern?"
"Is it acceptable to treat as a normal beverage a product whose consumption is restricted in respect of so many sectors of the population (including children, pregnant women, mothers who are breast feeding, the elderly and those suffering from high blood pressure) and which is subject to general restrictions to the effect that it should not be mixed with alcohol or coffee or taken after intense physical exercise?"
"What procedures are followed for the approval of such products?"
"Does the Commission not consider that the above factors are sufficient to justify withdrawal of this product from the market as a precautionary measure until it has been proven that it is not harmful to health?"
"Part II"
"Energy drinks were discussed at the 84th meeting of the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs on 19 September 2001."
"As noted, two Member States have reported deaths in their countries associated with the consumption of those products."
"In neither case, however, was there any evidence that the consumption of energy drinks was the cause of death."
"Both Member States have commissioned their own research, investigating the available data on the effect of these drinks on health."
"Recently another Member State produced a list of incidents linked to the consumption of such products, but without any substantiating evidence."
"None of the Member States concerned took any steps to restrict or prohibit energy drinks in their own territory."
"The Standing Committee noted a need for further information on the potential effects on health of ingredients in the products and the Scientific Committee for Food is examining data submitted by a manufacturer of such products regarding the safety of one of the products in question."
"According to information, further studies are nearing completion."
"At the above mentioned meeting of the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs, the Commission repeated its request to Member States to submit information on the safety of products on their markets."
"The Commission understands the concerns that have been expressed and it therefore intends to work with Member States to look at the issue in depth and identify the appropriate course of action to ensure a high level of protection for consumers."
"So-called energy drinks are not covered by any specific legislation and are not subject to an approval procedure at Community level."
"In the absence of Community legislation, Member States may apply national rules without prejudice, of course, to the provisions of the Treaty."
"Overall, Member States should ensure that products placed on their markets are safe."
"Thank you for your reply, Commissioner."
"However, you must allow me to couple my thanks with my disappointment at the tenet of your reply."
"Commissioner, as you know full well, we are talking about a public health issue here and I should like to remind you that, in cases such as these, we do not need proof, we just need an indication, especially when we are talking about the public health of young people, and it is young people who are consuming these energy drinks."
"To give you a specific example, in Greece there have been five cases in which people presented symptoms which related directly to the three active ingredients in these drinks."
"I should like to ask you to repeat, because this has happened in the past and Community legislation subsequently prohibited Greece from banning this substance, if these drinks could in fact be banned at national level, because the committee responsible in my country has objected to my initiative on the basis of the principles of internal trade."
"It is the responsibility of Member States to initiate action if they have evidence of harm due to the consumption of a particular foodstuff."
"The Commission can take temporary safeguard measures if it becomes aware of a serious risk from a product to the health and safety of consumers."
"Once the Commission is informed of action by a Member State, then the need for action on a Community-wide basis can be assessed."
"However, the Commission is not aware of action being initiated by any Member State."
"In fact the two Member States that have reported deaths associated with consumption of energy drinks have stated that there is no evidence of the association and they have instigated their own investigations into the effect of such products on health."
"The Commission has sought the cooperation of Member States in looking at this issue in depth and identifying the appropriate course of action."
"I should like to thank Mrs Malliori for raising this issue and add to what she has said."
"May I ask the Commissioner specifically about how these energy drinks are marketed in combination with alcoholic products."
"For example, a growing trend, certainly in Scotland, has been the combination of the product Red Bull with vodka, which is exceedingly dangerous."
"This is of great concern to me, since Scotland has one of the highest rates of under-age drinking, that is to say drinking by 15 year olds and under, in the European Union."
"Could the Commissioner tell me whether the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs discussed the combination of energy drinks with alcoholic products and, if so, what research did it propose and what information did it think was needed?"
"I understand the concerns of the honourable Member."
"I also have three children."
"I know what is being consumed, mostly by young boys, so I understand her concern."
"The Scientific Committee is also concerned."
"It has noted that the possible interaction of the constituents of energy drinks has not been well studied, and considers that the possible interactions between caffeine, taurine and alcohol in humans may warrant investigation, particularly under conditions of exercise and consequent dehydration through sweating."
"In the light of the advice from the Scientific Committee the Commission is holding discussions with Member States, with a view to ensuring that a draft Commission directive that includes specific labelling rules on caffeine in ready-to-eat foods is put into place."
"Questions to Commissioner Reding"
"Question No 31 by (H-0772/01):"
"Subject: Ban on advertising directed at children In my question H-0663/01to the Council, I asked whether the Belgian Presidency intended to make the rules protecting children from television advertising more stringent and to support the position of the Swedish Presidency for a full ban."
"The Council, however, replied that, in the absence of any proposal from the Commission, whether in the form of a specific proposal or of a point for inclusion in the revision of the 'Television without frontiers' directive scheduled for 2002, it was unable to consider the matter."
"Will the Commission say what stage has been reached in its deliberations on this subject?"
"Mr President, as you are aware, the 'Television without frontiers' directive lays down the legal framework for television broadcasting in the European Union."
"This directive contains provisions on the protection of minors, in particular Article 16, which lays down a number of rules with regard to advertising and minors."
"The Commission undertook to carry out a study on the impact of television advertising and teleshopping on minors; this study was conducted by an independent advisor and has been published on the Commission website."
"Moreover, the Commission will supplement its assessment of the chapter on advertising within the framework of its re-examination of the 2002 directive."
"As Mr Papayannakis is doubtless aware, the consultation of professionals with regard to the revision of this directive began in 2001."
"Their conclusions will be published at the beginning of 2002, after which the political discussion will commence."
"We have also begun three studies, one of which will specifically examine the development of new advertising techniques."
"If we intend to revise the directive, we should look to the future, and not restrict ourselves to analysing the past or the present."
"Therefore, as you can see, Mr President, the Commission is approaching this issue with a completely open mind, taking extensive advice, and only after listening, analysing and discussing the issue with Parliament, of course, as well as others, will the Commission submit any proposals with a view to revising the directive."
"My question was slightly more coercive, he said jokingly."
"I asked you to tell me what your current thinking is in the Commission."
"Whenever I ask the Council of Ministers, they tell me they are waiting to see what the Commission has to say."
"Someone needs to tell us exactly what stage we have reached so that we can prepare our response to your future plans."
"I would remind the Commissioner that the Swedish Presidency, and perhaps you can confirm this, was in favour of a complete ban on advertising directed at children."
"This provoked me, if you like, into tabling a supplementary question and it is on this that I should like you to comment, as the Commissioner at the present stage."
"Unfortunately, I cannot say any more for the moment about the state of progress."
"I am currently organising consultations with professionals, which will come to an end this year."
"I shall then consult the politicians, and at the end of this series of consultations I shall make specific proposals."
"I refuse to put the cart before the horse by making proposals first and only then taking advice. No."
"First of all, I want to take advice, listen, and then make proposals."
"I can tell you my own personal opinion: I have made it quite clear that I do not think a total ban on certain types of advertising would be effective unless the experience of other countries, in particular, shows that such a ban is indispensable for the achievement of an objective of legitimate general interest."
"I asked the Swedish Presidency very clearly not to attempt to adopt this approach, as I knew that, at this stage, I would have to say no."
"I have said no, I am taking advice, listening. I know that the Swedish government, which, for its own reasons, has banned advertising on its territory, is moving in that direction."
"I also know that the majority of Member States are not moving in that direction."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner whether she shares with me a concern that, in Sweden, because television advertising aimed at children is not allowed, there is a noticeable lack of programmes being produced specifically for children in Sweden."
"Can she assure me that, in the study which she talked about - and I am delighted that she said it was going to be an open-minded study - this aspect will be fully considered and that, as there will be an explosion of television channels and television choice in future, she will look thoroughly at the possible impact of advertising on the generation of funds to produce high-quality programmes for children?"
"Mr President, my work has always had a dual nature."
"My first task concerns the application of the decisions made by the 'Television without frontiers' directive."
"For example, Article 16 restricts advertising aimed at children, as minors must be protected."
"Obviously, we cannot do just anything in programmes intended for children."
"However, I would like Parliament to help me out a bit, for example with regard to this point. Can we make just any old film for children?"
"What sometimes shocks me just as much as certain adverts is the violence in films specifically intended for children."
"We are analysing all that in order to find, together, the most effective way of making progress in this matter."
"From the point of view of digital television, which will enable hundreds of programmes, including children' s programmes, to be broadcast, I would like us, in Europe, to have a high enough budget, sufficient investments to produce good children' s programmes."
"This is my second task: ensuring that, in future, we have enough children' s films suitable for that age, films that are positive and are both educational and imaginative."
"This question interests me very much and is quite appropriate in the middle of November, in the run-up to Christmas."
"Many parents would be very supportive of Mr Papayannakis' question."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner what comparisons have been made of the different advertising used in different countries at this time of year?"
"I would like to hear her opinion on the fact that, certainly in my own country, this advertising begins just after August, well before the immediate run-up to Christmas and can be very aggressive."
"What kind of measures can you suggest be put in place to protect minors from this aggressive advertising?"
"It should be pointed out that the regulations applicable to television are completely different from those concerning the other media."
"Television, therefore, is often subject to far more stringent regulations than those applicable to the other media, which are not always subject to specific rules concerning minors."
"Thus, if you go into a supermarket with a child, for example, the child is swamped by unchannelled, uncontrolled advertising that is very different from televised advertising, which is actually regulated."
"Many differences may be noted at Member State level as well, ranging from the age limits set, which differ significantly from one country to another, to the specific provisions governing certain sectors, such as financial activities and drinks advertising."
"This proves that the approach adopted by the directive is the most appropriate as it provides a flexible framework within which the Member States have legislated according to their respective culture and traditions."
"If Parliament considers that this framework should be changed, it will have the opportunity to say so loud and clear next year, as it will be given the opportunity to voice its opinion during the revision of the directive."
"Whatever the case, if we amend the current measures, the amendments must be made within the limits of this directive."
"Question No 32 by (H-0776/01):"
"Subject: World Anti-Doping Agency On 21 August 2001, the EU was represented by Commissioner Reding at the meeting held in Tallinn, to decide on the location of the headquarters of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)."
"Does the Commission think that it might have been possible to avoid what happened in Tallinn?"
"Was the choice of Montreal the result of the failure of the European candidates to present a united front?"
"In 1999 the Commission submitted its support plan to combat doping."
"Why not transform this plan into a full-blown programme and provide it with the appropriate funding?"
"As the honourable Member will be aware, the World Anti-Doping Agency decided, on 21 August 2001, to establish its future headquarters in Montreal."
"This is a perfectly worthy city, which also offers many advantages."
"It must be said that, amongst the candidate cities, there were also perfectly worthy European cities that also offered numerous advantages for hosting the headquarters of this agency."
"What happened was that the European countries did not show sufficient coordination and the fact that so many European cities were put forward certainly favoured the choice of Montreal."
"I wish to make it quite clear that the Belgian presidency cannot be held responsible for this failure."
"It did make considerable efforts to overcome the problems, unfortunately, however, without success."
"Europe put forward several candidates, whereas other countries put forward only one, and it was this approach that won the day over the plethora of European candidates."
"I must repeat the fact that this issue does not fall within the competence of the Community, but rather within that of the Member States."
"We must now apply to the future the lessons we have learned from the Tallinn meeting."
"The first lesson should be that of the European Union' s cohesion."
"Furthermore, yesterday, the Fifteen' s Ministers for Sport met in Brussels for an informal Council, and cohesion was one of the main items discussed there."
"The ministers agreed to join forces and adopt the same approach to combat the scourge that is doping, firstly at world level, in other words, to step up their action within the World Anti-Doping Agency and, secondly, at European level, where there are good grounds for putting a concerted anti-doping programme into action."
"There are good grounds because Europe is the most advanced continent in the fight against doping, the greatest number of world-class sporting events takes place here and because Europe has the greatest number of competitions between clubs of different sporting disciplines."
"Furthermore, we have the greatest number of accredited laboratories and we must continue to bring our knowledge to bear in the fight against doping at world level."
"Yesterday, I informed the ministers that a Community plan is being drafted and they gave me the green light to put this into action."
"I shall now begin consultations on the aspects to be included in this action plan and in 2002, we shall have the opportunity to discuss it properly."
"I should also like to say that, in order to improve this European cohesion, which must apply not only to the fifteen governments, but must also exist between governments and sports federations, at the beginning of the Spanish presidency, a meeting will be held between the fifteen Ministers for Sports and the European sports federations to decide on the best approach to adopt in order to combat doping."
"I would like to thank you, Commissioner, for your reply and your efforts with regard to the funding of the World Anti-Doping Agency."
"In recent days, the sports press in our country has reported that there were problems with the funding from the European Commission."
"I would like you to clarify whether these problems have been resolved after the meeting of Sports Ministers yesterday in Brussels and whether, if this is not the case, the Commission intends to channel this money towards other means of fighting doping or to stay with the World Anti-Doping Agency."
"Mr President, the World Anti-Doping Agency is currently 100% funded, for the duration of a transitional period, by the International Olympic Committee and it has been decided that following this transitional period, 50% of the funds will be provided by the international sports federations and 50% by the governments of the various countries involved."
"We have accepted this division."
"It appears that of the part falling to national governments, 47.5% will be covered by the European Union."
"This is a considerable proportion, but it is also proof of our sporting prowess on this continent."
"Having said that, I am sure you are fully aware, Mrs Zabell, that we have interinstitutional rules governing payments made from the budget."
"These interinstitutional rules force us to adhere to certain procedures, in order to ensure that taxpayers' money is used scrupulously."
"The rules of the World Anti-Doping Agency do not currently match the very strict rules that apply in the European Union."
"This is why Europe has asked the WADA to change its internal rules so that there is, first of all, a serious budget, a budget that is forecast over several years."
"Secondly, there would need to be an internal rule ensuring that the other continents cannot impose a budget on the European Union but instead that we have a right of veto, and a right to examine proposals."
"Thirdly, this 47.5% funding must also be matched by appropriate representation on the WADA' s board of management."
"Once these three conditions are met, they will enable us to launch the process of the Council and the European Parliament taking a decision on funding the WADA."
"For the moment, and until 3 December, when the World Anti-Doping Agency meets, the ball is in the Agency' s court."
"Once the Agency has met the basic conditions enabling us to set the budgetary process in motion, however, the Commission will submit a proposal and the ball will then be in the court of the Member States and Parliament to implement this decision."
"In the meantime, with regard to the year 2002 which is rapidly approaching, I would ask governments to shoulder their responsibilities."
"They stated very clearly yesterday, in Brussels, that they are willing to do so."
"It is therefore, up to the Council of Ministers to arrange these payments for 2002."
"We are running a little late."
"I would like to remind Members that the more supplementary questions there are, the fewer questions on the list will naturally be asked."
"I would like you to bear this in mind."
"Mrs Malliori has the floor for a supplementary question."
"As you perhaps know, doping substances are traded on the free market so quickly that often, when one substance is detected and banned, a new one has already appeared. The reasons for this are purely bureaucratic, for the simple reason that there are not enough laboratories."
"Does the Commission intend to help so that substances can be recognised and banned immediately, thereby reducing the time available for new substances to reach the free market?"
"The World Anti-doping Agency was created precisely to answer such questions."
"This is the body that has the task of drawing up the list of substances that should be banned and the body which governments and sporting bodies must then deal with."
"Another point is research."
"The Commissioner responsible, Philippe Busquin, and I have decided to open up European research and to put it at the service of the fight against doping, because we know that the inventors of new chemical formulae are often steps ahead of us."
"We will, therefore, be making Europe' s research capabilities available to this fight."
"Although we are right at the end of Mrs Reding' s time, we are going to ask the following question by Mr Collins."
"It is a very important question, but I would request, if possible, that only Mr Collins should ask questions."
"And, if there are supplementary questions, they should be very brief, since it is a very broad question and it could take a long time, which would prevent us from moving on to questions to other Commissioners."
"Question No 33 by (H-0805/01):"
"Subject: European Year of Languages The European Year of Languages 2001 is now coming to an end."
"The Commission has co-funded 185 projects aimed at promoting the European Year."
"Does the Commission consider that the objectives for the European Year are being met, and will it make a statement on how it considers the European Union can further develop the learning of languages in the EU, including the 60 plus European languages which are not official languages of the EU, and what measures it considers need to be introduced to help to further promote interest in and learning of languages among young people in the Member States?"
"As the honourable Member is well aware, the linguistic issue is one that is close to my heart, since I am a Luxembourger."
"It is, moreover, one of the reasons why I have been so committed to the European Year of Languages 2001."
"Something I did not realise at the beginning, when I launched this plan, was that there would be such enthusiasm, in all our Member States, about the linguistic phenomenon."
"All sorts of organisations have lobbied, local councils have discussed language education, in short, there has been huge enthusiasm in all our Member States and this enthusiasm has also made itself felt at government level."
"Some governments have adopted measures to give language learning greater priority in their curricula with effect from the 2001-2002 school year."
"I shall be attending the Education Council on 29 November, and on that occasion we will be discussing the best way to follow up the European Year of Languages, because it is not enough to have launched an action and for that action to have been received with great enthusiasm on the part of the public; this action also needs to be followed up."
"Let me reassure you that I shall be pursuing this course of action most conscientiously."
"In concert with the Ministers for Education, I shall be making the frameworks of the Socrates and Leonardo da Vinci programmes more open to language teaching than has been the case in the past, and then I shall be presenting a report on the very practical way we have been implementing on the ground, and that is not all, because the year is not yet over and many projects are still underway, the lessons we have learned from the public. In this sense, when I talk about lessons that we have learned from the public, I am thinking of the entire linguistic panoply that we have in Europe, not only the 11 official languages, but also the sixty-odd languages spoken by Europe' s citizens."
"Mr President, in deference to you and following the very comprehensive and satisfactory reply given to me by Commissioner Reding, I waive my right to a supplementary question."
"We are going to ask the two supplementary questions, but we must try to be very specific."
"May I frame a question which I hope the Commission will feel free to answer simply yes or no."
"Wittgenstein told us that to choose a language is to choose a form of life."
"I think, therefore, that if we lose languages we lose forms of life."
"Does the Commissioner agree with me that it would be a tragedy for Europe if it loses languages such as Scots Gaelic, and Lowland Scots through neglect and that the lesser-used languages deserve greater encouragement than they get now?"
"Very good, I believe that Mr MacCormick has received the reply he wanted."
"Many months ago, in the run up to the European Year of Languages, plenary unanimously adopted a report by Mr Graça Moura which proposed that ancient Greek and Latin, as the root languages of today's languages, should be taught in secondary schools throughout the European Union, so that contemporary languages could be taught properly and in greater depth."
"I should like to ask, first, if you passed this recommendation on to the governments of the fifteen Member States and if you have any information as to whether or not this matter is being pursued."
"The Commission has funded some 200 projects in the course of the Year of Languages."
"Some of these projects involved Greek and Latin."
"The Commission has never, therefore, sidelined these languages."
"It must, however, be pointed out, Mr President, that the Commission cannot set school curricula."
"This is in the sphere of subsidiarity and, therefore, falls within the remit of the Ministers for Education."
"This is why I conveyed to the Education Ministers all the discussions that took place in all the institutional frameworks, of which there were many, in order to tell them: 'Here you are, Europe' s citizens and their representatives want the linguistic element to become an important part of the education system' ."
"On the basis of all the reports available, at the end of November, the Ministers will have to decide and adopt a resolution, and then I shall ensure that this resolution is followed up with deeds, in other words that these ministers will make sure that their national or regional education systems, depending on the country, will provide the greatest possible range of languages, and from as early an age as possible."
"I cannot, however, force a minister to put a particular language on his or her agenda."
"I can only encourage him or her to do so."
"Let me assure you that I am quite convinced that multilingualism represents Europe' s future, because it reflects cultural diversity, which is our true wealth."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Reding."
"We now come to questions to Mr Liikanen, and I would invite him to take his place."
"We now have no choice but to strictly obey our time limits."
"Questions to Mr Liikanen"
"As they deal with the same subject, Questions No 34, 35 and 36 will be taken together."
"Question No 34 by (H-0786/01):"
"Subject: EU safety markings on instruments useable for torture I am concerned that EU Member States may be effectively allowing manufacturers of stun weapons (which are readily useable as instruments of torture) to use the European Commission CE 'safety' markings on their stun batons as a quality 'selling point'."
"Can the Commission please indicate its position on the following points:"
"What is the process by which European CE standard marks are awarded and which Commissioner is responsible?"
"Can the Commission estimate how many stun weapon manufacturers are using the CE markings on their products?"
"Will the Commission take action to prevent stun weapon manufacturers using CE markings to promote the sales of their products?"
"Question No 35 by (H-0790/01):"
"Subject: Electric-shock devices The recent Amnesty International Report, Stopping the Torture Trade (2001), found that electric-shock devices have been used to torture or ill-treat people in prisons, detention centres and police stations in no less than 76 countries around the world."
"The report also found that stun gun weapon manufacturers are advertising that these products have been 'awarded' the European CE standards mark."
"I am concerned that EU Member States are effectively allowing stun gun weapon manufacturers to use the European Commission CE 'safety' markings on their stun batons as a quality 'selling point'."
"Could the Commission clarify the process by which European CE standard marks are awarded, and explain to the European Parliament how many stun gun weapon manufacturers are using the CE marking on their products?"
"Could the Commission also take action to prevent stun gun weapon manufacturers using CE markings to promote sales of their products?"
"Question No 36 by (H-0801/01)."
"Subject: CE markings The Commission is aware that manufacturers and distributors of electro-shock devices (or 'stun guns' ) have been using CE markings to promote sales of their products, sometimes claiming that such marks constitute a 'guarantee' or an indication of product quality."
"What steps is the Commission taking to ensure that CE markings are not used as a promotional device, both in the EU Member States and in third countries?"
"In cases where a product is manufactured, distributed and sold by companies based in countries not in the EU, can the Commission say what authority may challenge the validity of the CE mark, and prevent a firm from claiming that the CE mark on its product is a guarantee or an indication of quality?"
"Mr President, we have just been discussing minor languages."
"That is the reason why I am now using the Finnish language."
"Regulations on the CE marking are contained in a Council resolution of 1990 on the various phases of the compliance assessment procedures to be employed when applying directives on technical harmonisation, and also in a Council directive issued in 1993."
"The latter stipulates that the CE marking should be incorporated in a number of directives on technical harmonisation that apply to specific industries."
"Conformity marking must be affixed to any product falling within the scope of a technical harmonisation directive providing for it."
"It signifies that the product complies with the legally binding requirements of the applicable technical harmonisation directive."
"The manufacturer is responsible for affixing the CE conformity marking, although the directives often require the intervention of a third party conformity assessment body."
"Member States are responsible for the designation of such bodies in accordance with the applicable provisions of the directives."
"A number of services in the Commission are responsible for technical harmonisation directives providing for the CE conformity marking, although most fall under the responsibility of the Enterprise Directorate-General."
"However, the Commission does not directly intervene in the evaluation of product conformity, nor in the award of the CE conformity marking."
"All the manufacturers of stun weapons falling within the scope of technical harmonisation directives providing for CE conformity marking must affix this marking to the relevant products."
"The Commission does not have information about the number of manufacturers involved."
"In an earlier reply to a written question in 1997, the Commission noted that a wide variety of equipment could potentially be used for purposes of torture."
"However it is not always possible to determine in advance what use such equipment will be put to."
"Therefore it is not feasible to apply different treatment under these directives to equipment that could potentially be used as an instrument of torture."
"Nevertheless, to take account of the concerns of Members of Parliament and many others who have written to me on the issue, the Commission, in particular the External Relations DG, is currently preparing a proposal for a Council regulation concerning trade in equipment which may be used for torture or for cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."
"The specific aim of this regulation is to lay down Community rules to prohibit the export, sale and transfer to third countries and the import and purchase from third countries of such equipment."
"This proposal should also deal, as appropriate, with electrical devices."
"The Commission will no doubt have realised, from the shared language of these three questions, that they originate outside this House, and indeed Amnesty International has been pressing us on this point."
"I need not underline the significance and weight that attaches to representations by Amnesty International."
"I am very grateful indeed to the Commissioner for his assurance in response to the third part of the question about the steps that are being taken to try to bring this matter under reasonable control."
"It is a kind of irony, is it not, that the original idea of the CE marking was to give assurances about safety."
"Well, if I am at the wrong end of a safe piece of torture equipment, it is not a good place to be."
"Can you give us any indication of a timetable for the progress you hope to make on this?"
"The inter-service consultation in the Commission is going on right now."
"Different services are expressing their opinions, so it is at an advanced stage of internal preparation today."
"Further to the comments of my colleague, Mr MacCormick, I too was very concerned."
"That is why I tabled the question."
"The Amnesty International Report, Stopping the Torture Trade (2001), found that electric-shock devices have been used to torture or ill-treat people in prisons, detention centres and police stations in no less than 76 countries around the world."
"The report also found that stun-gun weapon manufacturers are advertising these products with the 'awarded' CE standard."
"As Mr MacCormick has said, the CE mark was meant to be a sign of quality and safety, but in a torture weapon it is pretty perverse and sickening."
"I welcome the Commissioner's proposal and would welcome further clarification of the timetable."
"To push things a little bit forward: you have explained how the CE mark is awarded, but how are the recipients of the awards monitored and have any CE marks been withdrawn, to your knowledge?"
"I will make two comments."
"Firstly, according to the Amnesty International report referred to, stun guns are not used for torture or ill treatment by either the police or prison guards within the EU."
"It is in the export to third countries where problems may arise."
"As far as the CE marking is concerned, if it is incorrectly affixed and the competent authorities of the Member States know this, they can intervene with the manufacturer or his representative within the EU."
"So there are possibilities for national authorities to take action."
"It is our responsibility to monitor it properly."
"The third part of my question is slightly broader."
"I ask by what authority can the validity of a CE mark be challenged?"
"The Commissioner has said in his first answer that it was not the Commission that would make a ruling and in his second supplementary he said that it would be the competent national authority."
"Is there any system of mutual recognition of a ruling by one national authority, or would it be necessary to challenge the use of a CE mark on something like a stun gun separately in each of the 15 Member States?"
"Is there not some overall body that can say this is valid?"
"It seems to be a very long-winded process if it has to be challenged 15 separate times."
"The market surveillance authorities of Member States are responsible for this."
"We do not have any European body to do this."
"Questions can, of course, be raised and we can consider how the provision of information between the authorities could be improved and progress made."
"However, we must remember that it is only the producers that are involved and that there may not necessarily be producers in all countries."
"Question No 37 by (H-0800/01):"
"Subject: Proposed ban on hydrofluorocarbons Can the Commission confirm what steps it is taking with regard to the proposed ban on hydrofluorocarbons by the Danish government?"
"Denmark notified the Commission in March 2001 of a draft regulation intended to prohibit the import, sale and use of three greenhouse gases - HFC, PFC and SF6 - and products containing them as from 2006, except in the case of certain products and applications for which a different timetable was laid down."
"This notification, pursuant to Directive 98/34/EC, allows the Commission and other Member States to carry out a prior examination of a measure which might create obstacles to the free movement of goods in the internal market."
"Several Member States have reacted to the Danish proposal."
"The Commission for its part has sent the Danish authorities a letter whose effect was to postpone the possibility of adopting the proposal until 6 September 2001."
"Denmark must reply to the Commission and inform it of the action it intends to take on the proposal."
"The position expressed by the Commission can be summarised as follows. Firstly, the Commission recognises the legitimacy of the objective of the Danish proposal."
"The text is aimed at combating greenhouse warming and at contributing towards a 21% reduction of six industrial gases to which Denmark committed itself at the Environment Council in June 1998."
"The European Union, for its part, undertook under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce by 8% the emissions of the six industrial gases in question produced by all its Member States."
"In the light of information already provided by Denmark, however, the Commission considers that the proposal is disproportionate to the objective pursued and does not appear, therefore, to comply with the rules of the internal market."
"The Commission notes that there are technical measures for monitoring these emissions and that those measures create fewer distortions of intra-Community trade than a total prohibition."
"Moreover, the Commission is not convinced that safe alternative measures which are technically compatible with the systems currently used exist in all cases or will be in existence within deadlines laid down by the Danish proposal."
"If Denmark does not respond to the Commission's request the latter, as the guardian of the Treaties, may, whilst the proposal has been adopted, initiate infringement proceedings under Article 226 of the EC Treaty."
"First of all, I thank the Commissioner for a comprehensive and clear reply."
"Clearly the Commission has taken action with regard to this issue."
"It is of concern not only to myself but to a great deal of other people in the Union, particularly those in the airconditioning industry, who could see a potential change in their market happening far too rapidly for them to respond with technical measures on with any kind of appropriate economic steps."
"I hope the Commission will continue to press the Danish authorities to be quite clear about their intentions."
"I hope that the Commission will seek further contact with the Danish authorities over and above the letters they have already sent, to ensure that a reply is received quickly."
"The amount of uncertainty at the moment with regard to the intentions of the Danish Government is creating ripples across the single market and raising doubts that are not conducive to the progressive restructuring of the air-conditioning market - and the other markets in which these gases are used - so that they can be phased out over an appropriate and sensible period of time."
"I hope the Commission can assure us that action will be taken."
"We will act accordingly and keep the European Parliament informed."
"Question No 38 by (H-0821/01):"
"Subject: Swedish ban on cadmium in fertiliser At the end of this year the Swedish ban on cadmium in fertilisers will expire."
"The EU derogation will then run out and new arrangements cannot be prepared in time."
"On its accession in 1995, Sweden was entitled to retain stricter rules than those applying in the EU for various chemicals and dangerous substances for four years."
"The derogation for the Swedish restrictions on cadmium in fertiliser was extended by three years."
"This time is up at the end of this year, and no new arrangements will be ready."
"The purpose of the derogation for a limited period was that the EU would, in the mean time, tighten up its rules on dangerous substances."
"This has been done in some cases, but not in respect of cadmium in fertilisers."
"Pending common rules the stopgap solution must be to extend the derogation, which applies to Finland and Austria as well as Sweden."
"But not even that will be possible before the end of the year."
"The Commission proposal has yet to be submitted, and it then has to be adopted by the Council and Parliament."
"This will mean that there will be a period during which high cadmium content fertiliser could theoretically be sold in Sweden."
"Does the Commission consider that Sweden may continue to apply its own rules during this interim period?"
"On 14 September 2001 the Commission proposed the regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to fertilisers in which the derogation permitting Austria, Finland and Sweden to maintain national limits on the level of cadmium in fertilisers is extended up to 31 December 2004."
"This proposal is now in the hands of the Council and Parliament for the codecision procedure."
"The issue of cadmium in fertilisers has been under study by the Commission for a number of years, originally with the aim of introducing appropriate harmonising legislation before the derogation expires on 31 December 2001."
"However, due to the complexity of the scientific issues involved, and the delays in the risk assessments carried out by the Member States, it was not possible to propose the required legislation at an earlier stage."
"For this reason, the Commission decided to extend the derogation on cadmium in fertilisers for a further three years and it did so by including the appropriate provisions in a proposal for a regulation recasting the existing fertiliser directives."
"As the major part of the text of the proposed regulation is not new, it is hoped that this proposal will be adopted rapidly, possibly at first reading."
"The Commission is doing everything possible to facilitate rapid adoption of the regulation."
"But if it turns out that it is not possible to have the proposed regulation in place before the end of the year, the Member States concerned can ask for a derogation under Article 95(4) of the Treaty."
"I would thank the Commission very much for its exhaustive and constructive answer."
"I would also thank the Commission for its proposal to the effect that the derogation on cadmium in fertilisers should be extended."
"This derogation is very important to Sweden and also to other countries."
"I obtained the impression that the special derogation rule mentioned last in the answer means that we have a sort of guarantee against having to receive fertilisers containing cadmium for a possible interim period before the new extension comes into force."
"Is this view correct?"
"I am very familiar with this issue because it was already important in 1993 in the negotiations on enlargement with Finland, Sweden and Austria."
"If the Council and Parliament do not manage to adopt the proposed legislation in time, it is important for these three countries to request a derogation."
"I believe that all the Member States are likely to be prepared to approve this quickly."
"It is the Commission' s responsibility to check that EC legislation is implemented carefully."
"We have already produced a proposal."
"We do not intend to take measures to cover only a specific short period of difficulties."
"I believe we can find a good way of dealing with this issue."
"Thank you for all your replies, Mr Liikanen."
"In accordance with the Rules of Procedure, Questions Nos 39 and 40 will be replied to in writing."
"We now come to the last series of replies which will come from Mr Vitorino, on behalf of the Commission."
"Questions to Mr Vitorino"
"Question No 41 by (H-0782/01):"
"Subject: Landing of large numbers of illegal immigrants in the Canary Islands What measures does the Commission intend to put forward to guarantee the integrity of Community waters around the Canary Islands, given the recent reports that motherships are being used to land large numbers of illegal immigrants from Africa on the Canaries?"
"The events referred to by the honourable Member demonstrate how important it is for the European Union to develop policies on preventing and combating illegal immigration and in particular irregular arrivals by sea."
"Such policies need to be developed in partnership with the countries of origin and transit, and should also contain initiatives concerning the internal policies of the European Union."
"The Commission is in favour of addressing migration in a comprehensive manner which implies that European Union policies should not only address illegal migration but also include initiatives to serve the socio-economic interests of countries of origin and transit as well as legal migration."
"As regards the initiatives that need to be developed in partnership with the Mediterranean partners, it should be mentioned that illegal migration is one of the subjects currently being discussed within the framework of the Barcelona Process."
"Both sides agree that multilateral efforts are needed to address illegal immigration from North Africa to the European Union."
"The need to develop such a policy was underlined during the Euro-Mediterranean Conference of Ministers of Foreign Affairs held in Brussels on 5-6 November this year."
"This subject, including a number of concrete proposals on preventing and fighting illegal immigration, is also part of the draft regional programme on justice and home affairs."
"Partners hope to adopt this programme during the next Euro-Mediterranean Conference of Ministers of Foreign Affairs to be held on 22-23 April 2002 in Spain."
"Moreover, illegal immigration has been identified as one of the relevant themes for cooperation within the framework of the Association Agreement between the European Community and its Member States and Morocco."
"During the Association Council of 9 October this year Morocco underlined its determination to fight illegal migration and the networks of traffickers and called on the European Union for support in its efforts."
"The Moroccan authorities have presented concrete and ambitious proposals which aim to curb illegal migration, primarily by reinforcing the surveillance of Morocco's Atlantic and Mediterranean borders."
"The Commission is currently studying these proposals and hopes to be in a position to respond to the proposals fairly soon."
"The Commission has also decided to use the newly-created budget line, aimed at cooperation with third countries in the area of migration, to support financial projects to assist the Moroccan authorities responsible for border control and the fight against illegal immigration by providing training and technical assistance."
"Thank you, Mr Vitorino, for the information you have given me."
"The problem we have today is that every week approximately 100 illegal immigrants are reaching the islands of Lanzarote and Fuerteventura."
"The operation seems to consist of getting hold of a supply ship from somewhere and than putting the immigrants onto small boats which take them to the coast."
"Some make it, others drown, and the process goes on and on."
"The Commissioner' s response is that there is no Community action, but that it is hoped that the neighbouring countries will control immigration. But the fact is that this immigration is taking place."
"My supplementary question is as follows: a couple of weeks ago, the Mayor of the city of Las Palmas bought 200 one-way air tickets for illegal immigrants who were there and they flew to Madrid."
"The Mayor of Madrid, who is from the same party, was not very happy."
"Does the Commissioner believe that, if this immigration continues in this way, this would be the way to proceed, i.e. that the Canarian local authorities should pay for one-way tickets for illegal immigrants, because there is no more space on the islands, or do you believe that there is another possible solution, which would not make this air link for immigrants between the Canaries and the European continent necessary?"
"Mr President, I believe there has been positive development since our last dialogue here in Parliament on this issue."
"Firstly, the Barcelona process recognised the priority nature of the debate and dialogue on the joint strategy of the European Union and the Mediterranean countries for fighting illegal immigration, which is not an isolated issue, but which must be integrated into the overall negotiation of the socio-economic development of the Maghreb countries."
"Secondly, in the bilateral relations between the European Union and Morocco, the Moroccan authorities have sent us very specific proposals to strengthen the control of the Atlantic and Mediterranean borders."
"And I stress the Atlantic border because, as well as being an innovation in relations between the European Union and Morocco, it is particularly important for the specific situation of the Canary Islands."
"These are two positive points in the dialogue between the European Union and the countries of this region, and specifically, Morocco."
"The third point, which I believe is new, is that there is no European policy on returning illegal immigrants to countries of origin or transit."
"Therefore, the Commission intends to present Council and the European Parliament with a communication in the coming weeks on illegal immigration, which includes the issue of creating common standards for the policy on returning illegal immigrants."
"When we have this communication, the honourable Member will be able to see the Commission' s ideas and contributions to this debate on the creation of a European policy on returning illegal immigrants, which is currently the exclusive competence of national or regional governments, as in the case of the Government of the Autonomous Community of the Canary Islands."
"Question No 42 by (H-0792/01):"
"Subject: Inclusion of religion on new EU identity cards The recent terrorist attacks in the USA have given rise to intense debate over whether more detailed information about an individual's characteristics and origin should be included on identity cards in the Member States of the Union."
"The Greek press reports that this issue will be discussed early next December in Brussels at the meeting of the Ministers of Justice, Internal Affairs and Public Order of the 15 Member States of the EU."
"In the light of recent events, what is the Commission's view of including religion on the new identity cards to be introduced in the EU, as mentioned in the above reports?"
"Mr President, The European Commission has not submitted any proposal that seeks to have an individual' s religion included on his or her identity card."
"In no Member State is the religion of an identity card holder mentioned on the card."
"Lastly, the Republic of Greece has removed any mention of religion on identity cards and its initiative has been approved by the Greek Council of State, which considered that even the optional mention of religion on identity cards contravenes Article 13 of the Greek Constitution, which guarantees freedom of religion."
"The Commission' s position with regard to the indication of religion on national identity cards has not changed."
"We would ask the honourable Member to refer in particular to the answer the Commission gave to the oral question H-0456/00 by Mr Alavanos."
"Such a measure would not only breach an individual' s right to freedom of religion, but could also lead to discrimination, whether overt or covert, on the grounds of religion."
"Thank you Commissioner for your reply, but you did not answer my question as to whether the Ministers of Justice, Internal Affairs and Public Order of the fifteen are due to discuss the matter in their forthcoming meeting in Brussels."
"That was my question."
"My second comment is this: I absolutely agree on the sensitivity issue and, anyway, it is the common view in the European Parliament that the argument of religious identity should not be used as a factor which might cause problems if it is included; but I should like to ask if the European Union agrees that schools in the Member States of the European Union should do the same as the madrasses in Islamic countries and teach the view, and we see this on a daily basis, that Muslims should kill Christians and Jews and that this is a part of their religion."
"I should like to ask, given that it is prohibited to teach Fascist or Nazi ideas about the annihilation of the Jews, if we can accept, on the contrary, that they be taught by Muslim fundamentalists in the light of the specific circumstances which have arisen following the attack on 11 September."
"First of all, I have attempted to answer your question by saying that the Commission has not submitted any proposal on the matter."
"This type of issue could not, therefore, be discussed at a Justice and Home Affairs Council on the basis of a Commission proposal."
"As far as I am aware, nowhere on the agenda is a discussion scheduled on the issue that you raised at the meeting of Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs of the European Union."
"With regard to what I believe is your second question, the content of education provided by schools in Arab countries, if I have understood correctly, I must, of course, tell you that the Union has no competence at all to interfere in the content of school curricula of third countries."
"Furthermore, even in schools within the European Union, as you are well aware, Mr Marinos, this falls within the sphere of subsidiarity, which means that it is within the exclusive competence of each Member State government to define the content of school lessons, both in state schools and in private schools, within the European Union."
"Question No 43 by (H-0794/01):"
"Subject: Application of fundamentalist laws within the European Union With regard to a number of violations of women' s rights within the European Union justified by fundamentalism, is the Commission in favour of taking appropriate measures to prevent the implementation of laws incompatible with human rights?"
"Can the Commission accept that basic human rights are violated on the pretext of religious beliefs, cultural practices or customs?"
"What steps will it consider taking in the short and long term?"
"The breaches of women' s rights to which the honourable Member refers come in different forms and should be considered on an individual basis."
"Nevertheless, the Commission notes that, in accordance with Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, the Union is founded on the principles of freedom, democracy, and respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and the Rule of Law, principles shared by all Member States."
"As confirmed at the Fourth World Conference on Women, held in Beijing, in 1995, the promotion and protection of women' s rights are an integral part of universal human rights."
"In no circumstances can the Commission accept the abuse of an individual' s fundamental rights under the guise of religious beliefs, cultural practices or customs."
"This position is laid down by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (Articles 1, 4, 21, 23, 24) and by the other texts dealing with fundamental rights, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Articles 2 and 5 ) and the European Convention on Human Rights (Articles 2, 3 and 14)."
"Item 18 of the Vienna Declaration, adopted in June 1993 by the World Conference on Human Rights, lays down that all forms of violence towards women, including those resulting from cultural prejudice, must be eliminated."
"Regardless of national protection of fundamental rights and of women' s rights in particular, it should be noted that the Community has been working on a policy to promote equality between the sexes since 1975."
"Equal access to the labour market, to governing bodies and to social rights are equally important rights in this respect, as well as the right to protection from violence and sexual harassment."
"There is a raft of Community legislative measures, directives, and even case law from the Court of Justice, underpinned by a specific legal basis, Article 141 of the Treaty establishing the European Community."
"Incidentally, Article 3 of this Treaty imposes the obligation of integrating concerns about equality between the sexes into all Union policies."
"Thank you very much for your reply, Commissioner. It shows that the Commission has understood the problem."
"As a supplementary question, I would like to know whether, in accordance with your reply, you foresee, or support the idea, that women immigrants should be informed of their rights within the European Union."
"Could women immigrants be provided with services to defend their rights?"
"I would like to hear your opinion and whether you have any intentions in this respect."
"I am very happy to reply."
"I will begin by saying that all the initiatives presented by the Commission in the field of asylum and illegal immigration contain specific legal rules to deal with the very special situation of women immigrants or women seeking asylum or refuge in the countries of the European Union."
"We have ensured that in the questioning relating to the granting of asylum there are specific conditions for dealing with the situation of women."
"For example, women who have been victims of sexual abuse can ask for the official doing the questioning to be changed, so that it is a woman rather than a man, because that will perhaps make them more feel more comfortable when recounting the story their asylum application is based on."
"The honourable Member has raised a very important issue: informing immigrants of their rights."
"Unquestionably, one of the Commission' s concerns is that it should be possible to provide immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers with the fullest possible information about their rights."
"I believe that if the honourable Member examines the Commission' s specific proposals to the Council and the European Parliament, both with regard to immigration and to asylum, she will see that the idea of information about rights is present."
"It is the responsibility of the national authorities of the Member States, as well as the non-governmental organisations which we work with very closely in these areas, to provide complete and full information on the rights which immigrants seeking asylum in the European Union can benefit from."
"As the time allotted to questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 44 to 84 will be replied to in writing."
"That concludes Questions to the Commission."
"(The sitting was adjourned at 7.40 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"Security of energy supply"
"The next item on the agenda is the report by Mr Chichester (A5-0363/2001) on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on the Commission Green Paper 'Towards a European strategy for the security of energy supply' [COM(2000) 769 - C5-0145/2001 - 2001/2071(COS)]."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating the Commission on the Green Paper. It is an excellent analysis of our energy supply situation in Europe."
"I thank all my colleagues for the way in which they have contributed to my report to bring it to this stage this evening."
"There are three main points in the Green Paper."
"Firstly, the European Union will become increasingly dependent on external energy sources, reaching 70% by 2003."
"Secondly, the EU has very limited scope to influence energy supply conditions so that it is on the demand side that the EU can intervene, mostly through promoting energy saving in buildings and in the transport sector."
"Thirdly, in present circumstances the EU is not in a position to respond to the challenge of climate change and to meet its commitments, notably under the Kyoto Protocol."
"One thing above all else is staring us in the face: the massive dependence on oil and on imported oil in particular."
"For commonsense reasons of security of supply and protection of the environment, urgent steps should be taken to address this disproportionate dependence."
"We cannot alter the fact of where the oil comes from, but we can do a number of things on the demand side, particularly in the transport sector."
"Being dependent on imports is not necessarily a bad thing or economically inefficient, provided that the sources are diverse, no one supplier is dominant and we can produce sufficient goods and services to pay for them."
"The Commission is correct to focus on demand management measures as a first priority and it is to be hoped that the Member States will pursue this approach vigorously."
"However I do not accept the view that little or nothing can be done on the supply side."
"In four areas the EU and Member States can be masters of their own destiny and make a real difference, both to security of supply and to protection of the environment."
"Renewable energy sources are by definition indigenous supplies and we are correct to seek to increase their share of final consumption and electricity generation."
"However let us be realistic,."
"Even if the ambitious targets for RES are met, they cannot be expected to replace any of the other energy sources completely or become the sole supplier of all our energy needs."
"Nuclear energy is not popular in some quarters, but it supplies more electricity in Europe than any other energy source."
"It provides large volume, base load power and produces hardly any greenhouse gas emissions."
"It is a safe and secure European technology, operated under stringent standards of regulation."
"To deliberately deny ourselves this major source of electricity seems perverse in the absence of an alternative source of supply that can provide an equivalent volume."
"Coal is a source of energy in decline in Europe, because of cost and environmental concerns."
"Yet it is an important indigenous resource which could be given a new lease of life with new technology to make it more efficient and less pollutant."
"Furthermore, there is huge scope for gaining business in the rest of the world for European suppliers of equipment and systems, if the industry can seize the opportunity."
"The fourth area is research work for future technologies and energy systems."
"That is something Europe must do in order to safeguard future security of supply, employment and technology."
"It seems obvious but needs repeating."
"For all the above reasons, I also disagree with the view that the EU cannot meet its Kyoto commitments."
"What is needed is realism on the nuclear issue, determined effort on clean coal technology, much encouragement of RES and coordinated demand management measures, as well as a sustained effort to inform public opinion about the necessity to stop wasting energy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to congratulate the Commissioner and the rapporteur because the Green Paper on the security of energy supply is a wonderful document which is accompanied by a great report."
"This document represents the first great step in Europe' s energy strategy; it offers a global view of the situation and raises all the relevant issues in this sector without reservations or conditions."
"It states that our main problem is our supply, characterised by great external dependence, which will increase over the coming decades."
"We must not leave aside environmental issues, however, which are inseparable from energy use."
"In this respect, the directive adopted on renewable energy sources and the proposal on the promotion of biofuels are going to lead to great progress in terms of the diversification of the supply of clean energy, but they are not the solution in either the short or medium terms."
"We must not hinder any type of energy, above all if it does not produce CO2 emissions."
"The solutions, as the Commission points out very well, involve the diversification of supply sources, especially clean sources - those which do not produce greenhouse gases."
"We must insist on technological research into energy sources, energy saving and the liberalisation of the gas sectors, in order that we may create a genuine internal energy market."
"Furthermore, it would be good if the Treaties could include a chapter on energy."
"Mr President, I too wish to congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Chichester, on the remarkable work he has achieved in analysing the issue and making a proposal and to say that I fully subscribe to his realistic and pragmatic approach, which maintains a crucial balance between the various sources of energy in implementing a European policy for energy supply."
"This strategy is based on three complementary objectives, which I support: to reduce the European Union' s energy consumption by improving efficiency in certain sectors, particularly the construction and automobile industries; greater cooperation and investment for supplying countries, the diversification of energy resources with what I consider to be an essential objective: to reduce our dependency on oil."
"I am also very pleased that this report explains how these objectives are to be achieved, namely by liberalising the energy sector, and I should like to reiterate the need not to give in to populist rhetoric, especially where renewable energies and nuclear energy are concerned."
"We must remain realistic and understand that, without the contribution made by nuclear energy, the European Union will not be able to reach the objectives it has set for itself for reducing greenhouse gases."
"Compliance with the Kyoto criteria must be one of the European Union' s priority objectives."
"This is within our grasp if we demonstrate clear thinking in our choices and I also note that the options available in the field of taxation could prove to be powerful incentives, provided that they do not block the development of industry in the European Union."
"Several amendments by the group of the Greens are counter-productive."
"Instead of stimulating debate, they exclude from the outset various possibilities for energy choices and I feel they should be rejected so as to maintain the coherence of this report."
"I hope that we shall do so, following the recommendations of our rapporteur."
"Mr President, I like this report, and would like to congratulate the rapporteur on what he has said and, moreover, congratulate the Commission on its Green Paper, for, by it, the Commission is making us aware of our dependence on energy."
"I can recall no debate in the past twenty years which has pointed out our dependence on imported energy in the way this Green Paper has."
"Thank you again."
"I would like to make two observations on nuclear energy."
"Unlike many in my group, I take the view that it has a future."
"I believe that we should also express that in a positive way."
"Secondly, and this is perhaps even more important than the first point, I would like to observe that we have been given the task of developing a clean coal-fired power station."
"I say this also with reference to our obligations as a result of Kyoto."
"A clean coal-fired power station is not only of interest to Europe, but also to the world."
"For let us not forget, as the Commission repeatedly emphasised, that in the next one or two generations, our dependence on fossil energy, at any rate worldwide, will be up to 80% and it is all the more important to master combustion technologies."
"Mr President, I also wish to express my thanks to Mr Chichester, the rapporteur, for his significant work in preparing this matter."
"As has already been stated here on previous occasions, the EU has only limited possibilities to interfere with the terms and conditions of energy supply."
"Its chances of influencing the matter are restricted to the demand, and hence to the promotion of energy saving in the construction and transport industries."
"The most important things, therefore, are to ensure the diversity of energy sources and an even distribution of suppliers of energy."
"The availability of energy on a local level enhances the reliability of energy supplies, reduces dependence on imported energy and provides employment opportunities."
"In particular, research into and the use of renewable energy sources must be promoted."
"Responsibility for assuring the reliability of energy supplies is primarily a matter for national energy policies."
"In order to enhance the reliability of supplies, it is also necessary to enter into agreements with other countries."
"Also, energy projects that serve common European objectives are an excellent way of putting into specific terms the EU' s policies on the Northern Dimension."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my own position and that of the Greens have been discussed at length in other forums, and it is not possible, in two and a half minutes to present a detailed argument."
"I shall, therefore, limit myself to asking the Commissioner a few questions."
"First of all, it is important that this debate should be based on figures that are as precise as possible."
"Even at an early stage of the debate, it was clear that the various scenarios available to the Commission are not really 'bottom up' scenarios, for energy efficiency, for renewables, or for cogeneration."
"Furthermore, another problem is that, often, European scenarios do not correspond to the detailed scenarios drawn up by Member States."
"In this context, I should like to know whether the Commission has begun working on this type of scenario with a view to the Barcelona Summit."
"Secondly, energy efficiency is everyone' s birthright and everyone is insisting on this point."
"What is the Commission' s view today, in concrete terms, on the important actions to be taken in the field of energy efficiency?"
"Parliament has put forward a number of alternatives, both in its Energy Intelligent Europe initiative, and in the action plan."
"Nevertheless, since October, I have not seen the Commission making a genuine, sustained effort on this matter."
"Thirdly, and this is a fundamental point, at the beginning of your presentation of the Green Paper, you promised us a real democratic debate."
"Today, however, I see that the national round tables have not been entirely transparent and that, at European level, we are still waiting for an open and transparent debate to be held, something that you announced at the beginning as being a key element."
"This is why I am asking you today, Commissioner, when will the round tables take place in civil society, amongst experts at European level?"
"We have been hearing about them for the last six months, and we have yet to see one take place."
"I fail to see how the Commission can ensure that the Green Paper is followed up without organising these round tables."
"Mr President, we are all aware that the European Union is highly dependent on external energy sources and has very limited scope to influence energy supply conditions."
"That does not mean, however, that the European Union should not do more to promote the use of alternative energies and safer and cleaner energies."
"It must also play a leading role in ensuring that all the conditions of the Kyoto Protocol are implemented."
"The broader international community has not covered itself in glory in the efforts to ensure that the depletion of the ozone layer is stopped."
"This report refers to the fact that nuclear energy in Europe will be playing a less significant role, following the decisions by five Member States to phase out the use of nuclear energy in the future."
"It also states that no country in Europe is currently constructing new nuclear reactors."
"It would be greatly appreciated in Ireland if you would inform the British Government and BNFL of this fact."
"The British Government is currently planning the expansion, not a reduction, of nuclear activities at Sellafield."
"The MOX facility at Sellafield means more nuclear reprocessing, not less, and nobody in the British Government and BNFL can deny this."
"In Ireland we are sick and tired of BNFL breaching so-called high standards of regulation in their nuclear operations."
"We cannot easily forget that BNFL falsified documents in relation to nuclear reprocessing contracts with the Japanese Government."
"Where are the stringent standards of regulation, when you are dealing with a company that has falsified documents and has been shown time and time again to operate its affairs in this very slipshod manner?"
"I believe that BNFL is technically insolvent. Its liabilities for cleaning up after the closure of nuclear plants and the disposal of nuclear waste will be up to GBP 34 billion, while it has GBP 235m worth of shareholders' funds on its balance sheet."
"What is the economic justification for the continuation of the Sellafield nuclear plant, let alone the expansion of its nuclear operations in the future?"
"Are the British people fully aware of the extent of movements of nuclear materials by rail and sea in Britain?"
"In Ireland we are very concerned about the security arrangements at Sellafield in the light of the terrorist attacks in America on 11 September."
"What assurances can the British Government give the people of Ireland that maximum security operates in the region?"
"We know the type of devastation that would occur if a twin towers type attack were to take place at Sellafield."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the Green Paper on the security of energy supply is fundamentally to be welcomed."
"It deals with an acute problem, one directly linked with the world political situation, which is more extensively unpredictable than ever."
"Despite the very large number of good statements, I cannot share the rapporteur's view that nuclear energy is a practical alternative to energy imports."
"The reasons are well known."
"Only recently, a study was completed, commissioned by Parliament, which comes to the conclusion that the reprocessing plants at La Hague and Sellafield discharge as much radioactivity over seven years as was emitted in the Chernobyl nuclear accident."
"The problem of the ultimate disposal of radioactive waste has not been resolved."
"Nor does nuclear fusion offer a solution."
"It therefore makes more sense to invest in safe and renewable energy sources than in nuclear fusion, which can achieve results in 100 years at best."
"Mr President, if a good policy consists of producing complete and correct diagnoses and drawing up and implementing the corresponding solutions, there is no doubt that the Commissions' energy policy, promoted by Commissioner de Palacio, is an example of a good policy."
"Within this good policy, the Green Paper provides a detailed and consistent analysis of the situation."
"The Green Paper provides four fundamental messages: the message that there is excessive risk associated with dependence on external sources beyond a reasonable limit; the message that it will be impossible to comply with the Kyoto objectives if we remain bogged down in inertia and do not introduce corrective measures; the message that we have little room for manoeuvre in terms of supply policies and we must concentrate our efforts on demand policies; and the message that we need to provide our energy policy with a genuinely European dimension."
"There is no doubt that this good policy goes further than diagnosis, because the Commission demonstrates that analysis and action can be simultaneous; and in Parliament at the moment we have the directive on the energy efficiency of buildings, the directive on transport, the directive on the liberalisation of the gas and electricity market and the regulation on cross-border exchanges of electricity."
"For all these reasons, we must congratulate the Commissioner and I will not end without also expressly congratulating our rapporteur, Mr Chichester, on his well-considered report and his receptiveness to the work of his colleagues."
"Mr President, honourable colleagues, I praise the part of the report where this gas pipeline link with Russia has been incorporated in the Northern Dimension."
"Honourable Member of the Commission, I propose that the Commission take swift measures in order to get this northern gas to balance our energy situation."
"A great deal of attention in this presentation has been given to lignite."
"I should like to ask, therefore, why peat, although it renews itself by a millimetre every year, has been completely forgotten; but then, peat is a type of vegetation found in poorer areas, while lignite is found in wealthier ones!"
"Nevertheless, peat is an important fuel component in remote areas, and it is also a regional fuel."
"Forty per cent of all energy is spent in buildings, to heat them, to provide water, air-conditioning and lighting for them."
"Already, during the previous energy crisis, we in Finland had to make modifications to buildings and we have managed to achieve good results in severe conditions."
"We must greatly enhance energy efficiency in buildings because that is where there really is a great deal of room for improvement."
"We shall have to gradually get accustomed to twilight conditions, for example."
"It is great to live in semi-darkness and not always in the sunshine, in artificial light."
"Mr President, successive petrol crises and the political and social fragility of the main oil-producing countries demonstrate the importance for our economies of the concept of self-sufficiency in energy."
"Unless we show a solid political will to implement this self-sufficiency, our future lies in the direction of energy dependency."
"If we allow things to continue the way they are, in 25 years' time, the European Union' s dependency on external sources of energy will reach 70% rather than the 50% we have today."
"This realisation is what underlies the Green Paper."
"If we wish to remain masters of our destiny, we must give priority to action on two fronts."
"We must, on the one hand, encourage energy savings wherever possible. On the other hand, we must make good use of our advantages, our skills and our resources."
"With this in mind, and as the Green Paper and our rapporteur suggest, in a realistic rather than an ideological way, we should address the issue of developing nuclear energy."
"This would require acknowledging that this form of energy cannot be faulted in terms of creating greenhouse gases but also that intensive research efforts are absolutely crucial if we are to make waste end products completely harmless, even if they only exist in low volumes."
"Blaming reprocessing processes, as the WISE report, commissioned by the STOA and of highly dubious scientific merit, has done once again, will not help us find a solution."
"Instead of allowing their technological lead to stagnate, the European countries should capitalise on it, particularly by focusing their research on improving reprocessing and recycling techniques."
"The same research effort must be made in the field of biofuels, which have the merit of representing a major indigenous source of energy for us: these are non-polluting and offer promising outlets for our farming."
"I am sorry that the Green Paper has not given this matter sufficient prominence."
"Mr President, here we are, all worried about our dependence on imported fuels and energy, worried about the future of our economy and our jobs, and yet we have Mr Fitzsimons and Mr Kronberger bemoaning and belittling one of the main potential sources for meeting that problem, the nuclear energy solution."
"Not only does it meet our energy and economic requirements, but it also meets our environmental requirements under Kyoto."
"I would say - and Mr Chichester's excellent report bears this out - that unless we diversify our sources of supply of energy, especially by promoting indigenous supplies of energy, we will be in trouble with our economy and our jobs in the future."
"Nuclear energy must play a significant part in both those ambitions: diversification and indigenous supplies."
"There are other areas as well."
"Mr Chichester mentioned coal."
"We must promote clean technologies in coal."
"In my part of the world, in Scotland, we would like to see more emphasis on promoting the oil and gas industries and their potential for better recovery systems, for exploration in marginal areas, for developing marginal oil and gas fields, for replenishing the reserves, the reservoirs in the south part of the North Sea, with gas in the meantime to protect us for the long term, and particularly transmission systems."
"That applies not only to oil and gas but also to electricity."
"In all these areas there is great potential for research."
"That ties us into what we will discuss tomorrow in the Caudron report on the Sixth Framework Programme."
"In all these areas, diversification, indigenous supplies and research will help us to meet our objectives."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wished to speak in this evening' s debate for two reasons."
"First of all, I too wish to reiterate the importance of energy for Europe at a time when it is predicted that we will be 70% dependent on external energy sources in 2030 with clearly very little room for manoeuvre."
"Next I wish to stress that I entirely support the approach of Mr Chichester, who is proposing both a diversification of energy sources and the development of all current sources without exception."
"These proposals do, of course, make calls for liberalisation that I would probably have rejected had they appeared in isolation."
"They are presented today, however, in a very broad range of demands, some of which are extremely bold and that is why I am able to support the package put forward by Mr Chichester, whom I wish to compliment on his report."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to express much thanks to Mr Chichester."
"Very rarely have I seen reports on energy of this calibre."
"The Commission Green Paper was already first-rate, but with this supplement I believe we have many sound building blocks for the EU' s energy policy."
"The greatest concern, of course, is, as Mr Chichester rightly points out, our energy dependence and the question 'what can be done about it?'"
"In my view, therefore, the well-balanced package in the Chichester report offers an excellent helping hand."
"That means that one should not only consider natural oil and gas supplies, but also new forms of energy. That one should consider renewable energy sources, but that one should not immediately rule out nuclear energy."
"Certainly with regard to the way in which its use can be made safer."
"That is certainly feasible, and a great deal needs to be done yet."
"One cannot say that nuclear energy is no longer acceptable, for then one gets into the greatest difficulty in Europe."
"Something must also be done about those aspects which give rise to questions, of course, and on that score too, a great deal can be done, partly by finding intelligent solutions."
"It has been said time and again: if there is no energy chapter, then nothing can be done."
"Well, if I read Paragraph 21, which merely sums up all elements of the EU policy that can be achieved at the moment, that is an enormous agenda."
"On that score, our Commissioner has a great deal of work to do."
"Energy and geopolitical developments are closely related, particularly if we consider the developments after 11 September."
"I therefore hope that the energy charter will be ratified at the earliest opportunity and that we will further develop the Caspian Sea Basin, for in that way, we can also slightly reduce Europe' s dependence."
"I should like to finish off by congratulating both the Commissioner and our rapporteur on their sterling work."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Chichester, and congratulating him warmly on the quality of his work and his efforts to produce a truly remarkable report."
"I am aware of the scale of this challenge, given both the size and complexity of the issue itself and the number and diversity of the parties affected by it, inside and outside Parliament."
"When I speak of the security of energy supply, I am not just referring to the physical supply, but also to energy systems and services which are ecologically, socially and economically sustainable."
"In this respect, the security of energy supplies is essential to our development and security in the broadest sense, and recent events have demonstrated this even more clearly."
"In fact, the tragic events of 11 September have highlighted our dependency on imports and the security of our installations."
"The risk factor has multiplied overnight: the risk of premeditated damage to installations and infrastructures, the risk of volatility on the oil markets (with its prejudicial effect on the world economy) and the risk of interruption to our supply, both internal and external."
"All of this means that it is more important than ever to provide appropriate measures for responding in the event of emergency."
"It is encouraging to note from the responses to the Green Paper - more than 150 formal responses from different organisations of all types - the interest in issues relating to the security of energy supply throughout Europe and beyond."
"I am pleased that the Commission' s analysis has received general support and that there is a considerable degree of awareness of the risks and problems faced by Europe in terms of guaranteeing the security of the energy supply and the international nature of those risks and problems."
"This is reflected in the excellent report you have before you."
"Many respondents have accepted that it is no longer possible to view energy supply as being independent from economic and environmental objectives."
"Furthermore, a series of points in the report confirm that the European Parliament has clearly understood that there is a close link between these three objectives and the balance between them must be maintained."
"The responses also confirm that European public opinion shares the Commission' s desire to confront the problem of climate change."
"I am pleased to see that the European Parliament not only shares this concern, but that it has many ideas on the instruments which may help us to achieve this objective."
"We will carefully study these ideas when we prepare our response to the consultation on the Green Paper."
"I am not going to refer to it at the moment, but I would like to state very clearly, ladies and gentlemen, that the issue has given rise to debates in numerous national Parliaments, in some of which either I or high level officials from the Commission have participated, and in various universities, companies and non-governmental organisations, thanks, amongst other things, to the use of the Internet, which is a vehicle for openness within society, which, although not yet concluded, gives us an idea of the importance of this issue in all social fields of the European Union."
"I am especially pleased to highlight the insistence on energy efficiency."
"Like you, I believe that there are huge areas for possible improvements."
"Your ideas are clear, in relation to the supply, in the context of the general recognition that there should be diversification of energy sources and supply origins."
"As the report accepts, no individual source is completely lacking in drawbacks: they all have a cost and they all seem necessary."
"With regard to coal, we have no alternative but to maintain basically subsidised production, at least for a certain amount of time."
"In any event, the Commission' s proposed regulation confirms the importance we attach to own-production, but, above all, the importance of developing clean coal technology, which will allow us to use the only ample reserve of fossil fuel that the European Union has and promote the possibility of improving and reducing emissions internationally."
"In this way, furthermore, we will maintain cutting-edge technology which offers all sorts of possibilities for our industry."
"With regard to renewable energy sources, their importance will depend on the speed with which we can overcome a whole series of technical, social and economic obstacles."
"The renewable energies directive, in relation to electricity, offers a guide for the direction we should take."
"I know that we have been criticised for not making sufficient progress with this directive, but we are still trying to achieve our objective of doubling the percentage of renewable energy sources by the end of this decade."
"In this respect, ladies and gentlemen, I refer to the previous intervention by Mr Souchet, we approved a few days ago an important and ambitious proposal on biofuels, which I hope will be approved and supported both by the Council and by Parliament."
"With regard to nuclear energy, I am very satisfied with the frank and constructive exchange of views which the presentation of the Green Paper has made possible."
"Some Member States have announced a moratorium or the progressive dismantling of their capacity for nuclear generation."
"But one Member State has clearly stated its intention to go ahead with nuclear energy and to build a new reactor."
"In any event, the abandonment of nuclear energy by some Member States may make a significant hole in our energy capacity and speed up the use of forms of energy generation which emit more greenhouse gases and, therefore, create problems in terms of our Kyoto commitments."
"Although I have total respect for the decisions taken by the Member States, naturally, I believe that in these circumstances it is very difficult to confront the problem of climate change if we maintain a diversified energy base."
"I believe that it is advisable to keep all the options open while the research into the management and elimination of waste is intensified and that is essentially the greatest problem with nuclear energy, given the progress made in terms of the safety of nuclear plants."
"The debate on the Green Paper is still open."
"It is therefore premature to anticipate its final conclusions."
"However, the Commission is continuing, and will continue, to make proposals in the quest for new perspectives on energy supply."
"We are working with you and the Council on the internal market legislation relating to one of the pillars of our strategy, in terms of both gas and electricity."
"We must continue looking into the tax framework and pricing and, specifically, the guarantee of a mechanism for setting energy prices which reflects all the quantifiable external social and environmental costs."
"Also in this field, we will shortly present certain energy network interconnections which will further integrate the national markets and therefore strengthen the security of the whole market resulting from this integration."
"Furthermore, I hope soon to present a proposal on the combined generation of heat and electricity, which will allow us to make progress in the battle for efficiency."
"Somebody said earlier that we have done little."
"But I would remind you, ladies and gentlemen, of a proposal on buildings, which is very important (buildings represent 40% of energy consumption, and there are margins for savings of almost 20%), the proposal we will present to improve the current regulation on combined generation of heat and electricity, and a general proposal, a framework proposal, which will provide measures for all types of electrodomestic or electrical equipment within buildings."
"With regard to demand, the benefits of energy saving which have been raised are clear and, I insist, we have presented many serious, solid and important initiatives, and we are going to present those which I have just mentioned."
"With regard to transport and its effect on demand, the Commission makes a very detailed analysis in the White Paper, of which I have mentioned some important aspects when I spoke about the proposal on biofuels which was approved last week."
"The report also clearly recognises the international nature of the challenges relating to energy supply."
"The increase in our dependency, not only on oil, but also on gas, makes it essential that we study the broader geopolitical repercussions of the current market situation."
"The Commission intends to produce a report on this issue next year; of course, we would like to use the opportunities offered by the Sixth research and development framework programme and the successor to the energy framework programme as instruments for supporting our strategy."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the security of the energy supply is an inextricable element of a balanced social and economic development."
"The debate on the Green Paper has highlighted, as never before, the delicate interrelationship between energy needs, environmental objectives and balanced economic development."
"Many of the ideas presented in this report may be important elements in guaranteeing the security of our energy supply."
"As I have explained, some of them have already been implemented, but they are not yet a defined strategy."
"Europe needs to establish a stable long-term framework to guarantee the security of energy supply, which can deal with changes in international economic and environmental circumstances, and which creates a firm basis for the future role of Europe on the international stage."
"Bearing this in mind, I would like to use the European Council in Barcelona next spring as a launch pad for a European strategy on energy supply, and you can rest assured that, in drawing up this strategy, the ideas contained in this report will be taken into account."
"I hope to have further opportunities to debate this idea with you."
"I would like to congratulate Mr Chichester once again on his wonderful report and the work he has done."
"I also congratulate and thank Mrs Ayuso for her opinion on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and I thank everybody who has spoken on this report and this debate."
"I promise that we will continue working on it when the conclusions closing the general debate on the Green Paper produced by the Commission are finally presented."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"Mr Turmes, on a point of order."
"I asked the Commissioner two very specific questions and I am rather disappointed that she has not managed to give me an answer."
"One question concerned possible scenarios and the other concerned round tables."
"Sir, that may well be the case, but that is not a point of order."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Chemicals strategy"
"The next item on the agenda is the report (A5-0356/2001) by Mrs Schörling on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on the Commission White Paper on Strategy for a future Chemicals Policy [COM(2001) 88 - C5-0258/2001 - 2001/2118(COS)]."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report on the strategy for the future chemicals policy, which we are to discuss and adopt positions on in this debate, is extremely urgent and important because it will form the basis for a draft legislative text and for new framework legislation for the EU' s chemicals policy."
"Gratifyingly enough, the European Council decided, at the Gothenburg Summit in June, that a new chemicals policy would have to be introduced by 2004 at the latest and that this time limit would have to be respected."
"The Commission must therefore table its draft legislation in the course of 2002."
"The debate on deficiencies in the current chemicals policy has been going on for quite some time."
"Among the criticisms made is the fact that there has been a lack of information about the majority of the 100 000 existing chemicals, that the work has proceeded far too slowly and that the present policy has, in practice, failed to protect human health and the environment."
"The Commission' s survey of the legislation on existing substances shows that human beings and the environment are potentially exposed to a large number of chemical substances whose dangerous characteristics are not known."
"We know that the human body contains measurable quantities of 350 chemicals."
"We also know that the quantity of brominated flame retardants in breast milk has been increasing each year."
"Even if PCB and DDT are now surrounded by tough restrictions, it remains the case that high quantities of these chemicals are still found in the fatty tissue of human beings and animals throughout the world, even in the Polar regions where these chemicals have not been produced at all."
"New chemicals are added to the list, for example PFOS or perfluorooctane sulfonate, which does not bind in fatty tissue but, rather, in blood protein."
"These chemicals are found in a number of products, for example shampoo."
"Through the regulation adopted by the Council in order to overcome the deficiencies, detailed risk assessments should be carried out and recommendations made as to measures, etc. which might be taken. We now know that there are only 140 chemicals on the 'priority list' and that risk assessments have been completed in only eleven cases."
"Even worse is the fact that not a single measure has been decided upon in order to reduce the risks, in spite of its having been shown that such measures are needed for the majority of these substances."
"The Commission' s White Paper, produced by the Environment and Enterprise Directorates-General, is trying to create a high degree of health and environmental protection, at the same time as maintaining the competitiveness of the European chemicals industry."
"This is done, for example, by saying that chemicals policy must stimulate technical innovation and the development of safer chemicals."
"In common with the majority of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I believe that the strategy should be focused on the protection of the environment and of human health and that the point of departure for the Commission' s White Paper should be the debate in the Council and the growing unease about the fact that current chemicals policy cannot offer adequate protection of the environment and of human health."
"Naturally, the economic and social aspects must be accorded a fair degree of importance as parts of a strategy for sustainable development."
"If a majority of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy voted for a proposal that goes further than the Commission' s and shows how an effective, open and consumer-friendly control of chemicals should look in the future, that is completely in line with, and receives strong political support from, the European Council Summit in June when the conclusions drawn by the 15 Member States were significantly stricter and more far-reaching than the Commission' s proposal."
"There is therefore an express political will to adopt the policy for a new chemicals strategy proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, above all when it comes to the scope of the REACH system."
"As currently desired by the industry and the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats, only CMR 1 and 2 and POPs are to be included which, in that case, cannot be said to be much in the way of a strategy for the future."
"Even among industrial companies there is a desire to go further, for a competitive industry cannot be achieved through the unacceptable situation we have at present but only by producing safer chemicals and chemicals that protect human health and the environment."
"I therefore believe that we should stick to the compromise achieved between the various political groups and to the proposal backed by the majority."
", draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 11 October the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market adopted my opinion on the White Paper on Strategy for a future Chemicals Policy."
"Harmonisation of chemicals policy across the EU is especially important, but the following three aspects are no less significant."
"First, the practicability of the registration system. The amount of data to be collected means we must keep a sense of proportion in order that the system is not congested from the start."
"The principle of proportionality is also to be applied to the required definition of use, so that the manufacturer of a product must be able to restrict the definition to actually intended purposes."
"Secondly, a clear definition of the substitution principle."
"The definition of this principle varies from one Member State to another, if they have one at all."
"If it is to be laid down in Community law, it will have to be formulated in a consistent and unambiguous way."
"Thirdly, appropriate protection for test data."
"Insufficient account is taken of the need to guard commercial confidentiality."
"At the same time, the security data document should be under copyright in order to protect the applicant against misuse of the data obtained."
"Mrs Schörling's report is to that extent unbalanced."
"It takes too little account of the interests of medium-sized chemical businesses and of the industry as a whole, something that can lead to distortions in competition."
"I therefore recommend adoption of the amendments resulting from the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which contribute to a better balance of the interests of all interested parties."
", draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy. (DE) Mr President, the Commission's White Paper has the ambitious intention of comprehensively modernising EU law on materials and products."
"It is fundamentally right to unite, in legal terms, old and new materials and combine them with standardised registration and evaluation procedures for all materials over one tonne per annum in a strict time concept by 2012."
"This fundamental line taken by the White Paper strengthens sole responsibility for chemicals management in the industry and takes past experience with individual items of legislation as the basis for proposing a comprehensive reorientation."
"Parliament's Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has adopted this report by a large majority."
"The consequences of the White Paper's proposals for competitiveness, international trade, employment and medium-sized businesses had not previously been sufficiently examined, and further studies are still required."
"In addition, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy expressed the view that legislation should be made to apply not to the attributes of materials but only to actual, scientifically verifiable risks."
"Amounts are merely auxiliary quantities."
"What is crucial is the amount of risk involved."
"The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy therefore demands a two-stage screening process."
"We expressly reject the following suggestions made by the rapporteur of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy: that sensitising substances be included in the approval procedure; that approval be granted only for a limited period; that the registration requirement should apply to all amounts under one tonne; that the public be given unrestricted access to all data; that there should be extensive prohibitions on materials; that extensive data and evaluations to be submitted by the industry should be subject to additional examination by peer review; and a number of other points."
"A massive extension of the approval procedure would run quite counter to our common goal of reducing animal experiments."
"The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy therefore takes a rational line, as demanded by both trades unions and employers in the European chemical industry."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, chemical substances and products are a part of our daily life today."
"To a large extent, we could not manage in our society without them."
"For example, we use cleaning materials, cosmetics, plastics, medicines and much more besides, almost without thinking about it."
"It is though, equally self-evident that we must know what effects the use of these substances and products has on our health and our environment, and so we need a practical and flexible system to monitor and evaluate existing substances and those materials that may be created in the future."
"The Group of the European People's Party/European Democrats takes the view that the White Paper must do away with the inadequacy of European chemical policy and give first priority to protecting human beings and the environment, as well as to sustainable development, without thereby jeopardising the competitiveness of the chemical industry and of SME's in the global market."
"The chemical industry is the third largest processing industry in Europe, and, according to the Commission's figures, provides 4.7 million jobs in almost 40 000 firms, most of them small and medium-sized enterprises."
"With this report, we are deciding on their future."
"The Schörling report clearly focuses on the ecological dimension, and there are grounds for concern that the excessive demands, on the authorities as well, will paralyse the whole system and condemn it to failure from the outset."
"We in the Group of the European People's Party/European Democrats therefore cannot go along with the obligatory registration of materials of which less than one tonne is produced per annum; the extension of the approval procedure; the substitution and prohibition of substances only on the grounds of their characteristics; an additional peer review process; impracticable duties of notification and databases."
"It is our opinion that only a balanced system can ensure the production of high-value products within the European Union, the safeguarding of jobs in it, and the improved protection of people and the environment."
"Mr President, I welcome the Commission proposal on chemical policy."
"It is long overdue."
"For too long we have seen a gradual increase in allergenic reactions and even worse human health effects and at the same time a series of undesirable effects on the general environment."
"If we adopt this report, we will be taking a first step towards asking a very important question: whether the 30 000 chemicals in general use today and the 100 000 components that they are used to make are in any way responsible for the things we see happening to human health and the world around us."
"There is no doubt that we will have to make a very wide-ranging examination of the chemicals in use today and those that we might want to introduce into our environment in the future."
"We will have to start considering issues and areas that we have not previously considered."
"Socio-economic issues will be particularly important."
"The full effects of changing our chemicals policy and strategy will be wide-ranging across the whole of Europe."
"However, one would hope that, by taking a serious step forward tonight and starting to formulate a new structure for chemicals policy, we will arrive at a policy which is truly sustainable in the long term; which brings genuine and positive benefits to society as a whole; ends any negative impacts upon human health in the environment and stands as a shining example to other parts of the world as to how they should progress in future."
"So tonight we are taking a step not just towards a cleaner and better European environment and a stronger and more prosperous chemical industry in Europe but also towards a healthier and better future for the whole world."
"Mr President, I hope the Commissioner has caught up on her sleep after another succesful climate change conference."
"It all seemed very easy when the Commissioner first put the plan to us."
"She said that we use tens of thousands of chemicals in Europe."
"They are essential to our way of life but there is very little public information about them and the real fear is that some of them may be causing long-term damage to the environment and human health."
"So we must get the information, we must carry out the tests and, while keeping the good and maintaining a strong European chemicals industry, we must identify the bad and weed them out."
"But that was a few months ago."
"In the meantime all of us have learnt a great deal from the lobbyists about the difficulties of putting the policy into practice, as is well illustrated by the difficulty of identifying even the number of chemicals we are talking about."
"Sometimes we hear of 30 000, sometimes of 100 000 - quite a big difference."
"At least the chemical industry says it is in favour and supports the Commission's objectives, but it warns that the proposals are impractical, will increase bureaucracy and will be immensely costly."
"The testing regime, it says, will cause paralysis of the whole system, especially if we extend the requirements."
"Millions of animals will be killed painfully and perhaps unnecessarily in order to meet the testing requirements."
"All these concerns need to be taken into account."
"When the draft directive comes before us, I will be listening very carefully to industry's complaints."
"I recognise that in environmental matters we often hear industry crying wolf, but even so we must ensure that new requirements placed upon the companies are realistic and practical and that they enhance rather than damage a very important business."
"This is only a White Paper."
"In making recommendations, I support Mrs Schörling in asking the Commission to strengthen its environmental commitments, rather than relax them."
"But in reality we will probably end up following the Council of Ministers in passing the buck back to the Commission, asking you to find a way around the obstacle course and giving an absolute guarantee that we will criticise you, whatever proposals you come up with."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report is a milestone for environmental and consumer protection, areas in which chemical policy to date has completely failed."
"Hundreds of thousands of chemicals have been on the market for decades and we do not know in what quantities they are available and what risks they present."
"It is as if the precautionary principle was trodden underfoot; these chemicals were, without controls, tested on us and on the environment."
"Amounts totalling under 1 000 tonnes per annum are not even notifiable, regardless of the dangers involved."
"We have, then, for decades been playing Russian roulette with our health and with the environment."
"We must put an end to this frightening, indeed irresponsible, situation as soon as possible."
"If the industry does not put the data on the table within a specified period of time, these chemicals will no longer be allowed to be put on the market."
"I hope the majority in this House will not allow itself to be made the lackey of the chemical industry, for the aggressive advertising of the German chemical industry in accusatory mode has clearly shown it to be too helpless and incapable of presenting valid arguments at a political level."
"Complaints about shop closures, raised even by Members of this House, are a positive joke in view of the way the chemical industry, while increasing production in real terms by 25% over the past ten years, brought about a reduction of 14% in its workforce - without a chemical policy along the lines proposed by the White Paper, and we know all too well that the chemical industry only has the chance to offer long-term employment if it offers for sale products that do not harm the environment."
"Only then can the chemical industry's position be strengthened."
"We will fight for the new chemical policy as the central point of European policy on the environment."
"I believe this is about putting an end to decades of the 'ostrich with its head in the sand' policy and implementing a chemical policy which is effective and has a future, a policy which puts health interests and the precautionary principle in first place."
"Mr President, the EU' s chemicals policy requires a thorough renovation and a single, new and comprehensive set of regulations."
"Mrs Schörling' s report from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, which we are now discussing, provides an excellent point of departure for a new chemicals policy."
"With this report as a basis, the Commission should quickly be able to table proposals for a new directive."
"The strength of the report is that it really puts the environment and public health first, and that must be our main task."
"We also believe that industry has a lot to gain from strict regulations in as much as they encourage modern manufacturers, promote innovation and mean that old chemicals that have not been investigated are no longer promoted, as they are in fact at present."
"The following points in the report are especially important to our group. Firstly, the proposal as to which chemicals are to be included under the requirements for registration, evaluation and authorisation should be made more comprehensive, as proposed."
"Secondly, tough requirements should be made of chemicals, and of products containing chemicals, when these are imported."
"Thirdly, everything must be done to minimise the number of animal experiments."
"Fourthly, the substitution principle should be made a crucial component of chemicals policy."
"Great importance should be attached to this so that safer alternatives will always be sought."
"Fifthly, use of the most hazardous chemicals of all should be considerably restricted."
"Our group is pleased with the committee' s proposals."
"We nonetheless have some minor amendments we believe could further strengthen the report."
"We wish to emphasise the demand that it should be those departments of the Commission with responsibility for environmental protection that should approve new chemicals."
"It is also a question of further tightening up the requirements made of the most hazardous chemicals of all."
"In the committee, the rapporteur chose a very sound and open method of working which gave all the political groups the opportunity to compromise at an early stage, and I think that that is something positive."
"Mr President, it is high time the chemicals strategy were reviewed, for only 11 of the 140 substances on the priority list have been assessed to date."
"However, we should take care, in our enthusiasm, not to bite off more than we can chew."
"Of course, I too would welcome a complete overhaul, but in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, the Commission has already warned that if the chemical substances policy is overloaded, the ship will sink."
"That seems to me reason enough to remove some of the cargo from the ship."
"In concrete terms, I mean that the substances below one tonne should remain outside the scope of the new policy for the time being."
"Furthermore, the ship is reeling from side to side, swaying from a stringent policy on the one hand to the wish to take generous account of social and economic effects on the other."
"This half-heartedness can be avoided by prioritising the most harmful substances."
"In that way, the benefits for the environment and public health will be the greatest, and the social and economic effects on industry will automatically be contained."
"We therefore no longer need to pull the wool over the eyes of industry by positing that the new policy will improve innovation and businesses' competitive edge."
"Finally, I am of the opinion that the generally recognised criteria for harmfulness, namely dosage and use, need to be maintained."
"Mr President, the principles underlying the strategy for a future EU policy on chemical substances, namely to ensure a high level of protection for human health and the environment while ensuring the efficient functioning of the internal market and stimulating innovation and competitiveness in the chemical industry, receive my unqualified support."
"However, I am struggling with the White Paper and also with Mrs Schörling' s report, because I believe that the White Paper is not effective on a number of scores."
"Although Mrs Schörling has worked hard, she too is complicating matters."
"Let me therefore give a few examples of a system which, in my view, could function."
"I know that the Commissioner too has been informed by the Dutch government about where industry initially refused point blank to adopt the new system entitled SOMS. However, industry and the government are now very happy with this system."
"Allow me to give you a few examples and in doing so, expose a few weaknesses in the White Paper."
"First of all, the industry' s responsibility."
"Lip service is being paid to this, for the White Paper is limited to risk assessment data and to providing information to downstream users."
"Responsibility should really be placed with industry, and that means, therefore, that it must also be able to take risk-restricting measures off its own bat."
"The entire system proposed by you, including heavy-handed interference from the powers that be, has proven that it does not work."
"That is why a change is needed."
"Secondly, the reach system should be modified."
"In any case, a possibility for rapid screening must be introduced."
"Rapid screening can also be done on the basis of a harmfulness profile, for the tonnage is not a determining factor."
"My fellow MEPs and I have tried to include these provisions in amendments, and I hope that at least Amendments Nos 102 and 103 will be adopted accordingly."
"Mr President, Europe needs a new strategy for dealing with the issues surrounding chemicals."
"We are concerned here with the health of all of us, as well as with that of future generations."
"The Commission' s White Paper is a good point of departure for continued work on the strategy."
"Mrs Schörling' s report creates good conditions for bringing about necessary changes."
"It is exceptionally important that Parliament adopt the report in such a form that it have the same thrust given to it by the rapporteur."
"In the debate that took place while the report was coming to fruition, many objections expressed the fear that stricter regulations would put jobs and economic development at risk."
"That is an anxiety which must, of course, be taken entirely seriously but, at the same time, it is necessary to raise one' s sights and look beyond jobs and the economy."
"Economic growth and access to jobs can never be invoked to prevent necessary requirements concerning the use of chemicals, work on achieving sustainable development and a high level of protection of public health and of employees."
"What is the use of jobs and a sound economy if we poison our countryside and destroy what is essential for future generations?"
"We have only one earth and we must take care of it."
"We often say that we have the earth on loan from our children."
"If we are to be able to hand it over in good condition, it is high time that we modified our way of life."
"It is in a number of capacities that, as human beings, we are affected by the ways in which chemicals are used."
"We are affected as employees and as consumers, and we are affected by persistent and bioaccumulative substances which can give rise to hypersensitivity, hormone changes, cancer etc."
"The regulations which now have to be devised must, in the first place, be aimed at protecting individual people and not, as now, companies' interest in making profits."
"A society characterised by sustainable development also provides lasting employment, a sustainable living environment and people able to have faith in the future."
"In that way, a better world can be created."
"Mr President, Commissioner, there is no doubt that the European Union must, with the passing of time, equip itself with a new chemical policy."
"The one we have at present is unsatisfactory."
"There had been advance indications that there would be a vast array of tests, but the overall test result is unsatisfactory."
"The Commission's principled involvement is therefore to be welcomed even if we cannot support every aspect of its proposal."
"There is, though, something of which I must warn you."
"You, too, Commissioner, are on my mind today in particular."
"When you introduced yourself to us, you announced that the experience of your own country led you to want to establish a new policy on chemicals in Europe."
"My impression is that today, like Goethe's Faust, you have conjured up something you cannot control."
"What the rapporteur, Mrs Schörling, has presented is not a proposal about environmental policy."
"It is a classic export of pollution, as many enterprises that are already being marginalised by the European Union will move themselves very quickly even nearer to its boundary and indeed also outside the EU in order to save themselves these unimaginable impositions."
"This cannot be a modern environmental policy."
"Rather, we must take this branch of industry with us in integrating high but feasible standards."
"I believe that the aspects already mentioned - temporary approval, obligatory regulation under 1000 kilos, the principle of substitution and regulation of use as well - are an attempt at multiple protection, for every owner of a medium-sized business is being enslaved, because only industry can now meet the obligations which your proposal envisages."
"I believe that this proposal should be sent back to the Commission, but certainly not to the rapporteur, whom I otherwise greatly respect and who, on this occasion, has thoroughly disappointed me."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, particularly my colleagues in the Group of the European People's Party/European Democrats, let me beg you, as a matter of urgency: can we please turn it down a bit?"
"This is about a White Paper, and I believe we should not be trying to engage in muscle contests, which are in one way or another politically motivated, on the basis of this White Paper."
"At some future point we will be having the legislation, when we can do the real fine-tuning."
"It is a pity that some of the earlier speakers are no longer here; they will not hear what I have to say."
"But perhaps someone will be able to tell them."
"We have submitted amendments with the very same things in mind, which state that the duplication of work is to be avoided."
"Amendment No 97 is to remove peer review in order to simplify the procedure."
"We have already in committee brought in submissions on behalf of medium-sized businesses to the effect that there should be pilot projects, in which medium-sized businesses could deal with registration simply and effectively."
"We want simple administrative regulations and have provided for the employees, who will be directly affected - the employees and the members of the European works councils - to be involved in the decision-making process."
"These demands have been met, and I do not know why this all has to be played up and why the fate of the chemical industry has to be dependent on it."
"We are dealing here with a White Paper, in which nothing is finally decided."
"I cannot understand it."
"We have also included a subparagraph relating to substitution principle, which states that substitutes, too, have to be subjected to complete life cycle analysis before they can be used."
"So if we do not accept that and say, 'that is the way to do it' then I do not know what we are supposed to do next."
"And this one tonne: I simply cannot understand the argument that substances under one tonne are intrinsically less dangerous than substances over one tonne."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the enormous amount of work she has done, but I do not congratulate her on the content of the report."
"Mr Lange, I know we are talking about a White Paper, but this White Paper sketches a mere initial outline of our views, and when we in the PPE-DE express our opinions, we like our subsequent actions to be consistent with them."
"It is no good saying one thing now and then doing the opposite when the time comes to legislate."
"Let this be clear: this is a major sector of industry, the leading sector or one of the leading sectors in Europe."
"This sector employs millions of people and includes tens of thousands of small businesses."
"However, it is also a sector that is causing concern in society because there are 100 000 unknown chemicals being used, and it is therefore right that we should respond to this concern."
"That is why we consider the Commission' s proposal and the White Paper to be a good starting point, in that it gives us a procedure, a goal and targets to achieve."
"We welcome the industry' s willingness to bear the cost of this operation of sifting the good chemicals from the bad and providing information."
"However, what we do not support is the unnecessary expansion, the complicated procedures of expansion, the extension to too vast a range of substances, the use of scientific grounds which are too vague as the basis for forming opinions, which is what the Schörling report advocates."
"This, ladies and gentlemen, not only harms the chemical industry but also jeopardises the environmental objective we have set ourselves."
"As the Romans used to say, 'The best is the enemy of the good' ."
"Let us steer clear of such at times populist, at times fundamentalist attitudes, for our shared, common objective of protecting health and the environment in a sustainable economy against precisely an excess of, so to speak, overexhaustive initiatives, is in jeopardy."
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to welcome the White Paper."
"In reality, we are aware of the effects upon the environment and public health of only a very small proportion of the hundred thousand chemicals that exist."
"I think it is a serious problem for the EU' s environmental and public health policies that a combined strategy for chemicals policy was not implemented many years ago."
"Now, however, it has arrived as something I very much welcome."
"I should also like to thank Mrs Schörling for an outstanding report which tightens up the Commission' s proposal in some crucial ways, ways which, in my opinion, could well be adopted without changes."
"That is not, however, going to happen."
"The industry, and others, have also made their influence felt here in Parliament, and the result we shall adopt tomorrow will not be quite as good as it might have been."
"I should like to point out some of the substantial improvements contributed by Parliament. We are having a very great deal of emphasis placed upon the precautionary and substitution principles."
"This constitutes a reversal of the burden of proof."
"With what is also the Commission' s point of departure, we are now acquiring a stricter system - with, importantly in my view, some clear deadlines - for regulating, phasing out and authorising chemicals."
"It is also important that we should have an extended list of hazardous substances that are to be phased out."
"Finally, I should also like to highlight the issue of animal experiments."
"I think that, in this area, a very important contribution has been made, including by the Liberals, to getting the issue of restricting animal experiments onto the agenda. That is something I am very pleased to be able to support, including in the vote tomorrow."
"There are many substantial advances which ought to be included in the forthcoming legislation, and I shall therefore merely ask the Commissioner, finally, when the Commission' s proposal for joint legislation is to be tabled?"
"I understood it was to have been early next year, but it would be splendid if we could have a fairly clear date made known in this House today."
"Mr President, I too appreciate the work of the rapporteur and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on a genuinely advanced strategy."
"Parliament is thereby making a major contribution, applying the approach of sustainable development in all its inseparable dimensions, environmental, social and economic, to the chemical industry."
"In this report, protecting the environment and safeguarding human health go hand in hand and it is intended to maintain the competitiveness of the chemical industry through incentives to support innovation and facilitate the gradual replacement of the most hazardous substances."
"Other improvements can be included tomorrow if we adopt the amendments tabled by Mr Lange and other Members, benefiting smaller business, in particular."
"This is a prevention strategy, then, and not just a strategy of acting in retrospect, when the damage has already been done, but it is also a strict, rigorous strategy."
"That is why the reference to environmental responsibility must be accorded due importance. This is a principle which must also be recognised as important in those countries in which safeguarding health and safety in the workplace and protecting the environment are not always given due consideration."
"I refer to the recent decision which failed to condemn the Porto Marghera petrochemical plant and let the directors of Montedison Enimont get off scot-free, even though they were responsible for the death of 157 workers and the disastrous pollution of the Venice lagoon and the surrounding land, a decision against which the Italian government should appeal."
"Mr President, we need to be clear that chemicals can be good for you."
"You only have to look around this chamber at the carpets, chairs, desks, paint, steel and glass to see how much we depend on them."
"However they can also be bad for you."
"Some insecticides, flame retardants and even hair sprays can be a danger and we need to be wary of them."
"Chemicals can certainly present a risk if they are mishandled and they can need regulation."
"Sometimes they need to be phased out or banned."
"However, I fear this report goes too far too fast and so, in some respects, does the White Paper."
"I know it is only the White Paper stage, but we need to look carefully at some of the potential costs, said to be some EUR 8bn to European industry."
"A massive cost to animals has been referred to."
"The BUAV estimates 2 123 animals per high production volume chemical test."
"We are told that 12.8 million would be at risk if one were testing on 30 000 substances and the report goes up to 100 000."
"Of course not all those would need animal tests, but a substantial number would."
"One other example of how this report overreacts: paragraph 38 sweeps up all CMR category 3 substances and designates them of very high concern."
"Just take one example from one industry, the raw materials for flexible foam."
"The finished product is in no way a hazard and provides comfort and safety for consumers in products from furniture to car dashboards."
"That is an industry employing 360 000 people, 96% of them in small- and medium-sized firms."
"They could be at risk."
"The aims of the White Paper are right: we want to improve knowledge about chemicals and we want a safer world."
"We should prioritise areas for action."
"That means rigorous management of risk, without damaging unnecessarily the many small- and medium-sized firms that make up the chemical industry which has its risks but also brings jobs, benefits and safety for our citizens."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are apparently all in agreement, for I notice that even the PPE-DE believes that the current chemical policy is characterised by a lack of substance, too much bureaucracy, powerlessness to acquire knowledge about all substances and also the incapacity to take measures."
"That is why support for the White Paper is so important, but even more so, support for the improvements which are being proposed in the Schörling report."
"Pressure from the chemical industry has been enormous, particularly in the last few days."
"Apparently, it does not lack the necessary financial resources to set up big campaigns and to portray a large majority of this Parliament as a bunch of eco-fundamentalists."
"But I believe that the outcome of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy was balanced and that it therefore deserves every backing tomorrow."
"I should like to mention a few essential points."
"I am of the opinion that, in the long term, all substances will need to be registered, but that in the medium- and short-term, priorities will need to be set; the latter, however, not simply on the basis of production volumes."
"Smaller volumes too must also be granted sufficient attention, and the starting point should really be the intrinsic characteristics of a substance."
"As Mr Bernd Lange stated a moment ago, the substitution principle is essential."
"If a less dangerous substance is available and tested, what logical reasons do we then have not to use it, other than perhaps financial considerations?"
"A second essential element is that we must be able to ban substances of high concern, such as persistent and bioaccumulative substances and endocrine disrupters, unless they are essential from a social point of view and no alternatives are available."
"We should then be able to authorise them under strict licensing."
"Last but not least, maximum consumer information must be provided via clear labelling, but also via publicly accessible databases and information on the substances."
"Mr President, I too voted in favour of the Langen report in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and believe I was right to do so."
"On the other hand, I also understand how our colleagues in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy put a different emphasis on things."
"That, too, I consider understandable, for otherwise we would not need both committees and could do everything in one."
"I also take the view that it is only this tension between the various committees that makes it possible for something sensible to emerge at the end of the day."
"I will be quite frank in saying that I have a number of difficulties with the Schörling report."
"The main one is perhaps that I believe substances should be evaluated not only according to the danger they may present, but also according to their characteristics."
"In this sense, they are not simply capable of being substituted for each other, at least not all of them."
"There are substances that are dangerous, but which are useful in certain chemical processes."
"Secondly, I believe that whether or not a substance is dangerous has to be founded on scientific statements."
"It must be verifiable."
"I am always very dubious about suspicions of danger or risk."
"Being very subjective, these can be understood but not verified."
"The vast number of testers required leads me to ask where they all are."
"Safety does not increase in line with the amount of hyphenation or the number of regulations, but is increased by actual testing."
"So we will have to look into that."
"And one more little observation: which substances are actually necessary to society?"
"How does one ascertain something like that?"
"Who ascertains something like that?"
"I still need some clarification on that point, but I am happy to listen."
"I would, by the way, like to remind the President that, this evening, we are discussing over EUR 800 billion in turnover, 400 billion of it in energy and 400 billion in chemistry."
"That is a hell of a lot for two and a half hours."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank the European Parliament for the report on the Commission' s White Paper on a future chemicals policy."
"I really do hope that it will be adopted tomorrow."
"It is incredibly important that we should take this step towards a new, better and more effective chemicals policy."
"I want to say a special thank-you to Mrs Schörling, who has put a great deal of work into her role as rapporteur."
"I also want to thank all those who have taken part in the debate, because it has been an important discussion in which important points of view have emerged."
"The White Paper presents the Commission' s proposal for a new chemicals strategy."
"The modes of procedure presented in the White Paper are well balanced, and I believe they involve a step forwards in the direction of sustainable development."
"The debate in this House has perhaps shown that we have succeeded reasonably well in finding a balance between different views, even though there is scope for improvements."
"The background is as follows. Chemical production has increased almost explosively, from 1 million tonnes in 1930 to 400 million tonnes per year today."
"We wish to maintain a high level of protection for the environment and human health, but we also need to try to make use of the advantages presented by chemicals."
"We all know that there are chemicals in practically all the products we encounter every day."
"It would be unrealistic to believe that, with a wave of the hand, we could get rid of all chemicals or that there could be a chemical-free modern society."
"However, we must balance these requirements."
"Anyone who examined what is now the European Union' s 20 year-old system of supervision would see clearly that it is not effective enough by a long chalk."
"I would maintain that the system makes, for example, an artificial or arbitrary distinction between old and new chemicals."
"Chemicals have many extremely important advantages for society."
"Thanks to medicines and pharmaceutical products, it is possible to combat illnesses and suffering."
"It is probably the case that a majority of the products forming part of our modern life-style today are manufactured from plastic or contain chemicals of some kind. The chemicals industry is one of Europe' s largest manufacturing industries, employing 1.7 million people."
"Between three and four million jobs depend upon it."
"Ninety-six per cent of all companies are small and medium-sized, and they account for approximately 23 per cent of chemicals production."
"We are all of us exposed to chemicals on a daily basis."
"We have tried to look into whether this situation can be described in figures."
"Calculated, for example, in tonnes, each and every one of us probably comes into contact with several tonnes of chemicals in our daily life."
"That should also mean that we are exposed to several tens of thousands of chemicals."
"More and more reports are coming in concerning health problems, allergies and asthma assumed to be connected with chemicals."
"As has already been mentioned, research results show that the human body can contain at least 350 synthetic chemicals which, in the natural course of things, ought not to be there."
"There are persistent and bioaccumulative chemicals, and these are now to be found in placentas, foetuses and new-born children, to which they are transferred."
"These chemicals are the first things a child ingests."
"Chemicals are found in the depths of the sea and in the Arctic, where they have never once been used."
"Hormone-changing substances can affect our reproduction and our nervous systems."
"That is a fact."
"The procedures governing the present EU legislation have been rightly criticised for being too slow and unwieldy."
"Even though we have made some progress within the EU when it comes to evaluating the risks and restricting and controlling the use of hazardous chemicals, there is still an incredible amount to do."
"At present, it is the authorities who have to demonstrate that a chemical is unsafe."
"That obviously has to change."
"As in the case of all other products, responsibility for ensuring that products released onto the market are safe must lie with producers, manufacturers and users at later stages in the manufacturing chain. That, basically, is what EU legislation will amount to."
"Can you think of any other product about whose content we do not even have basic information or for which responsibility is entirely assumed by the authorities?"
"That is a basic error in the system."
"What we now have to do is find a suitable balance between, on the one hand, the chemicals' advantages and, on the other hand, the unacceptable risks they involve for human health and the environment."
"At the same time, we naturally want to ensure that the internal market is able to function and that the European chemicals industry, which is the world' s largest, can maintain its competitiveness."
"In order better to be able to assess the consequences of different ways of implementing the proposals in the White Paper, we have set up an inquiry which will look more closely into the costs."
"The Commission proposes that a 'REACH system' be set up to cover both existing substances, many of which have been on the market for at least 20 years but have never been properly tested, and new substances released onto the market after 1981."
"The industry must be given incentives to gather data and, if need be, test the substances, preferably without using animal experiments."
"We must help one another ensure that animal experiments are restricted."
"An integrated policy is needed in order to do this."
"None of us, I trust, would happily see full-scale experiments carried out on living human beings, animals or the countryside involving chemicals whose contents we do not know enough about."
"There is, in actual fact, no denying that that is what happens at present, because we do not know enough about the chemicals that are released."
"Pragmatic decisions are required in this area, together with a sensible application of the precautionary principle to chemicals policy."
"If there are reasons for suspecting that a substance has damaging effects on health or the environment and if our scientific and technical knowledge is not sufficient to provide a clear appreciation of the risks, we must take no chances and restrict or prohibit the use of the substance until such time as we know more."
"The absolute top priority is to fill the gaps in our knowledge of the risks involved in the 30 000 'existing substances' that are produced or imported in quantities greater than that of one tonne per manufacturer per year."
"The proposed new system includes a special arrangement for substances that give cause for special concern, or what are known as CMR substances."
"These are substances that are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction."
"They must be authorised before they are allowed to be used, and companies must show that they can be used safely on condition that risk management measures are taken."
"It should then be possible to authorise such safe use with reference to the cost and income analyses supplied by the companies."
"In this way, the burden of proof will be redistributed, and the risk assessment will be focused on those areas of use for which the companies have sought authorisation."
"In this way, approximately 1 500 substances, that is to say 5 per cent of all substances, will be covered by this authorisation procedure."
"The system will promote innovation, and that will lead to the most hazardous substances being replaced."
"I note that, in its draft report, Parliament proposes that several categories of substance be added to the authorisation procedure."
"I can appreciate its wanting to do that, but I believe that, as matters stand, it would be inappropriate to accord the system too much scope."
"We must be pragmatic to start with, so that we do not relapse into having an unmanageable system."
"If we overload the system, a large number of resources will be employed in managing a very small portion of all those substances that need to be investigated."
"We have limited resources, and we must establish priorities and decide how we are to use our resources in the most effective ways."
"Parliament' s draft report also says that the proposed EU system must cover chemicals produced in quantities of less than one tonne in the form of substances or preparations that occur in products."
"On the part of the Commission, I want most definitely to recommend a limit of one tonne so that it is possible to use the resources of the industry and of the authorities in the most effective way possible."
"If we want to get the proposal through, we must concentrate on what is most hazardous."
"There is no doubt a misunderstanding here."
"This limit does not apply to the most hazardous substances which, in each and every case, must go through the authorisation procedure."
"The very fact that the limit is set at one tonne does not mean that chemicals produced in smaller quantities escape monitoring."
"The industry is still obliged to carry out a risk assessment of the chemicals and to provide safety information to users in the form of marking and Safety Data Sheets."
"It is the responsibility of the Member States to ensure that these provisions are complied with."
"The industry must be able, upon request, to supply information to the authorities."
"The Commission has now set up a number of technical working parties with experts from the Member States, industry, non-governmental organisations and the Commission."
"The result of their deliberations is expected in February 2002, and it will constitute one of the most important contributions to the draft legislation on the part of the Commission."
"It is difficult to prophesy when the Commission will be able to table its proposals."
"If everything goes smoothly, I believe that we can aim for April or May 2002, but the objective is, no matter what, to submit the proposals to Parliament and the Council before the summer of 2002."
"Finally, I want to say a few words about the debate which I know is taking place and which is perhaps being conducted most eagerly in Germany and the United Kingdom."
"What matters is that the European chemicals industry should remain competitive, but we are doing nothing that is not also being done in the United States, Canada and Japan within the framework of the OECD."
"Roughly the same measures are also being taken by our competitor countries and in the world around us, where precisely the same problems are being experienced as in Europe."
"If the desire is for the European chemicals industry to hold its own, sustainable development must be worked for."
"It must be possible to guarantee that what is produced is safe for use in terms of human health and the environment and that it corresponds to the requirements of consumers."
"We have tabled a balanced proposal which takes account of the needs of industry but which also states that what is most important is to bring about a high level of protection for human health and the environment."
"I think the best answer that can be given is to say that there is no need to be anxious."
"This proposal will lead to innovation in the chemicals sphere."
"We can defend our European chemicals industry through the safe use of chemicals in the future."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Pricing policies for enhancing the sustainability of water resources"
"The next item on the agenda is the Report (A5-0341/2001) by Mrs Flemming on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on the Commission communication to the Council [COM(2000) 477 - C5-0634/2000 - 2000/2298(COS)], the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee on pricing policies for enhancing the sustainability of water resources."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are dealing here not with a legislative procedure, nor with a White or Green Paper, but exclusively with the implementation of Article 9 of the framework directive on water, which very precisely indicates how the costs of water services are to be covered."
"By 2010 at the latest, the Member States have to ensure that their policy on water charges offers appropriate incentives for users to use water resources efficiently, and that it takes into account the social, ecological and economic effects of covering the costs and the geographical and climatic conditions of the region in question."
"I have therefore attempted to make it clear in my report that the exploitability of our water resources must be maintained, for future generations as well, that we must keep to proven ways of keeping water pure and providing the population with clean drinking water, but that we may also look into new ways of doing this."
"In doing this, universal supply and drainage, high environmental standards, quality of provision and affordable prices must all be safeguarded."
"It should be possible to introduce business instruments and involve private enterprise, but also achieve proportionate optimisation of the operational structures involved in providing water supplies."
"I myself say an emphatic 'No' to the deregulation of water supply and drainage, but I say 'Yes' to every country being able to use its water in the way that the people want."
"I say 'Yes' to solidarity in water use within Europe, but this must not be invoked to force any Member State to make its water available to another Member State without charge."
"On the subject of the many amendments that have been proposed, I would just like to say briefly one thing: It is marvellous to repeat things that are important, and also to repeat them over and over again."
"It is also very difficult to speak against things that are right and important, especially if they have long been part of legislation and of a directive, such as the water framework directive."
"But the question arises of how suitable it is to proceed in this way."
"Since we are today only drawing up guidelines rather than legislating, I would say: so what?"
"One amendment really hurts me - the one which, as it were, condemns a certain Member State because of a project which really is purely an internal matter for that State and the environmental effects of which have not yet been assessed and in respect of which, as and when European Union funds are actually granted, the laws of the European Union will of course have to be abided by."
"If I may establish a disagreeable precedent, I would be very happy if this amendment were perhaps to be voted down."
"I found the Commission document very good."
"I also think it a good thing that Parliament, in contrast to the practice in many Member States, can also be heard on the subject of a law's implementing regulation."
"I would like to hope that the Commission and the Council will find their efforts supported by Parliament's opinion."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate both the committee responsible and Mrs Flemming for the work they have done."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development welcomes the communication from the Commission."
"A suitable pricing policy for irrigation water will play a fundamental role in encouraging more efficient and sustainable use of water in agriculture, its largest consumer, and will free up resources for other uses, thereby reducing environmental pressures."
"The analysis of the pricing of irrigation water is complex, due to the wide range of agricultural uses in the European Union and also regional differences in the need and availability of water for agricultural usage."
"Water is, essentially, the very backbone of the agricultural community in the Mediterranean regions."
"Without water, nothing grows, apart from the controversial almond trees."
"The pricing policy should be heterogeneous, taking into account the 'polluter pays' principle, as well as the social, environmental, economic, geographical and climatic variations in regions that no doubt will be the most affected by this pricing policy."
"The financial, environmental and resource costs of irrigation farming require differential treatment if gradual-recovery objectives are to be achieved."
"For this reason, the introduction of this policy should be progressive, transparent and must be adapted to local requirements."
"In this way, information to irrigation farmers and the adaptation and optimisation of infrastructures and irrigation techniques should be applied in parallel so that farmers can accept this policy."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in its current form the CAP does not help to achieve the objectives set out in the framework directive, which means we must seek coherence between these two policies in order to guarantee the protection of European agriculture' s functional model."
"Today, in Europe, water is a factor for cohesion between countries."
"The revision of Agenda 2000 on the development of agri-environmental measures should include the objectives of water policies."
"This will require the revision of certain types of aid, the application of eco-conditionality and the recognition of the right to adequate compensation for more vulnerable farmers, such as those who work on family holdings, with the aim of promoting the sustainable use of water and an integrated rural development."
"Mr President, the price of water is a factor that has an undeniable effect on its consumption. However, the subject should be broached with appropriate caution, so as not to give rise to counter-productive effects of an economic and environmental nature."
"The great disparity in the application of criteria in this area should be taken into account, as well as the barriers that can exist in Member States, both of a legal nature and with regard to acquired rights and customs, that can be difficult to amend, particularly in the short term."
"On this subject, it is interesting to note that there are certain crops that contribute to the survival of a habitat and fauna that, without these crops, would disappear."
"There are also industries today that, after using a certain quantity of water, return it to its source in the same or even in a better state than before they used it."
"In principle, it does not seem a good idea to place a burden on this type of activity."
"If time permitted, I could continue to give examples of economic activities, both agricultural and industrial, that, far from posing a threat to our water resources, are clearly beneficial to the environment."
"Lastly, Mr President, financial resources gained from water-pricing policies should be used to improve infrastructures, which would prevent water loss in transport, for example, and would ensure better and increased access to this resource."
"Paying for the amount of water we consume is, indeed, a key element, but only one of the many measures that should lead to a more rational use of this vital resource in all Member States."
"I believe, Mr President, that this important issue of water distribution can be relatively easily solved if we have the good will and solidarity of EU governments."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, water is a commodity to which every human being should have access, but it is also a scarce resource whose efficient use by all is becoming increasingly crucial."
"Pricing policy is one way, therefore, in addition to the other instruments included in the framework directive on water, in which we can move closer to this objective."
"It is important, therefore, that a price should be put on water and that this price reflects, as accurately as possible, its cost to the environment, the cost of supply and the cost of resources used."
"It is equally important that a water pricing policy should take account of the social function of water, and of the need to consider climatic, geographical and regional aspects when the terms of such a policy are fixed."
"It is possible, and, I would even say crucial, to make efficient and environmentally-aware water management compatible in all Member States with respect for the form of water resource management that each Member State feels is best suited to its needs."
"The European Parliament should, therefore, support all the methods proposed in the communication aimed at achieving a more efficient use of water, and acknowledge that an appropriate pricing system is an important instrument in achieving this."
"However, we should strongly reject any proposal for intervention in a Member State' s water resource management policy."
"Firstly, because this goes entirely beyond the remit of the communication, and secondly, because it goes against the spirit and the letter of the framework directive."
"We should not forget, when talking about costs and their recovery, about the terms in which this concept is fixed in the framework directive, in which establishing a pricing system that involves the maximum recovery of costs is advocated, leaving the criteria to each Member State, and with regard to the aspects that have already been mentioned - also in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, for the concrete fixing of prices in each case."
"When we talk about the integrated recovery of costs, therefore, this recovery should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of the framework directive, which is the only legislation in force on this matter in the European Union."
"Mr President, water is the Number One food."
"I therefore consider constant use of water and protection of water resources to be indispensable."
"One means by which this may be achieved is, as required by the water framework directive, a price for water that covers costs, comprising the environmental costs and the cost of infrastructure and of treatment."
"Incentives are necessary for water to be continuously used."
"Careful use of water is encouraged by having a basic price for basic services and increasing prices for use over and above that."
"The basic price must also take social aspects into account, for access to water must be possible for the less well off in society."
"One important area in which there is a need for action is that of agriculture."
"The reduction of water subsidies in agriculture and the careful use of water resources will only be achieved by promoting rural development and finding new sources of income for farmers."
"Water polluters must also be called to account, which means that the 'polluter pays' principle applies."
"Every water consumer in Europe should additionally receive a statement of how much water he has used and how the price he pays for his water is made up."
"I see it as an important question, how much of a market we permit and whether private commitment conflicts with public and regionally-organised water supply and careful use of water."
"I believe that cooperation between public and private undertakings using private know-how and capital is an option when it comes to making the best use of water resources from an ecological and economic point of view, without regional supply zones being given up."
"So here I am not talking about deregulation and competition at any price, but about ensuring efficient and environmentally friendly water supply."
"Mr President, Mrs Flemming's report builds on the existing water framework directive."
"My group is happy to support it."
"If water resources are to be used sustainably, the price of water to users must reflect both the costs of delivery and the costs of subsequent treatment."
"But when we vote tomorrow, a great deal of attention will be focused on just one aspect of the report, the Spanish hydrological scheme to build 120 dams and transfer vast quantities of water from one river basin to another."
"I am not sure that a report about general principles should single out any one Member State for criticism but, having listened over the past few weeks to both sides of the debate, my personal view is that this scheme seems to be the antithesis of the approach laid down in Mrs Flemming's report."
"The Commissioner has made very clear in the past her personal opposition to the use of EU structural funds to support projects which are damaging to the environment."
"So I hope she will watching closely when the Spanish Government comes to the Commission seeking billions of pounds in structural fund support for a project which seems to me to directly contravene the principles if not the letter of the water framework directive, one of the Commission's greatest achievements."
"I expect the Commission to make it absolutely clear that environmental impact studies must be independent and must consider the entire scheme, not just individual proposals."
"This Spanish scheme is set to become a test case of whether the Commission's commitments toward environmental sustainability are matched by a determination to stand up to pressure from vested interests and the governments of Member States."
"I hope that the Commissioner will do her best to make sure that her colleagues pass that test."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Mrs Fleming on her excellent report, which is better than the Lienemann report on the water framework directive."
"The Flemming report deals with water prices and, as Chris Davids has already stated, particularly relates to one very controversial issue, Paragraph 28, in which concern is expressed about the plan by the Aznar government to tap a vast quantity of the northern Spanish river, the Ebro, and to transport this water 1 000 km to southern Spain to cater partly for the tourist industry and partly for agriculture."
"This plan is detrimental to hundreds of nature reserves in Spain and will also adversely affect the natural habitat of the brown bear and Iberian wolf in the Pyrenees."
"This gigantic plan will cost EUR 22 billion and Spain wants Europe to contribute EUR 7 billion."
"Spain should learn that water is a precious commodity and that clean water comes at a price. That is why hotels and farmers use it sparingly."
"This is standard practice in northern Europe."
"It is also striking that the Portuguese government - Portugal is, after all, also on the Iberian Peninsula, does pursue a sound water price policy."
"Under pressure from the Aznar government, a new Amendment No 6 has been tabled by Messrs Flemming, Cox and Davis, precisely to delete reference to this Spanish plan."
"Does Pat Cox' application for presidency have anything to do with this by any chance?"
"How else can it be explained that the liberal group is now all of a sudden adopting a different position from that which it adopted in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"Fellow Members, I urge you to vote against Amendment No 6 to the Flemming report and to vote for the original paragraph."
"Mr President, as my fellow Members have stated, water is a limited natural resource that citizens have a fundamental right to access and use."
"We cannot, therefore, support the amendments that talk of water as being a commodity or those which talk about the private management of water."
"And we will be voting against these amendments."
"However, I do believe that the rational use of water is an absolute necessity, as stated in Mrs Flemming' s report, and also a moral responsibility for Europeans with regard to those populations that have an enormous water deficit."
"Article 9 of the framework directive which, as the Commissioner knows very well, required a great deal of time and discussion time to complete, provides for the recovery of costs."
"The same directive, however, and the report by Mrs Flemming, as other speakers have mentioned, state that different regional, social and climatological situations should be taken into account, which leads on to the need to adopt water-saving measures in order to prevent leaks from water production and distribution systems, and to ensure the maximum re-usage of purified water, as well as the improvement of irrigation techniques."
"In order to achieve this, the public, and those who work in the three sectors affected: domestic, agricultural and industrial, need to be informed."
"The quality and purity of water must also be improved."
"Commissioner, there is still a high level of nitrates in water and this should be addressed, as we have always said in the European Parliament."
"I would like to finish, Mr President, by saying that it is hardly surprising that, in the context in which we are speaking, there should be clear opposition to the Spanish National Hydrological Plan, approved, it is true, by a majority in the Spanish Parliament, for it is based principally on the use of reservoirs and the transfer of water in rivers such as the Ebro that could have a disastrous effect on an ecosystem that is unique in Europe."
"Furthermore, the planned reservoirs are located in Special Protection Areas."
"For this reason, it must be said, Commissioner, that, without wishing to condemn my own country in particular, we must pay more attention to how European funds are used."
"Mr President, water is not a commodity and the right to water remains a fundamental one."
"On the other hand, the Member States must set a number of objectives for themselves to ensure the proper management of water."
"In this context, a comparison between States could lead to the use of best practices."
"States must, however, maintain control over pricing and regulation."
"A community pricing system would create many problems."
"How can we reconcile the interests of the countries of the north with those of the south?"
"As for regulation, the local water committees, for example, the main consultative and administrative bodies in France, should not be undermined."
"Similarly, it makes sense for water policy to take account of specific geographical and regional characteristics."
"Water needs differ according to the type of agricultural production, soil quality and climate."
"Like the Commission, the rapporteur questions the application of the 'polluter-pays' principle to the agricultural sector."
"This pricing policy would lead to a substantial increase in price per cubic metre, an additional cost that would be added to the cost of animal welfare."
"Changing crop-growing techniques would put farmers in a risky and insecure situation."
"Regulating water in too dramatic a way would penalise farming, which has already made huge efforts towards making refunds."
"Farming is in crisis and will have to stretch itself even further to comply with the rules of the WTO, which is now meeting in Doha."
"Instead, preserving the multifunctional character of our farming, which contributes to land-use planning and to managing the environment, will enable us to achieve better water quality."
"Legislating now would be a mistake."
"Let us wait for the CAP reforms before we adopt a global approach to the issue of water, listening to and consulting all parties involved."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the communication from the Commission shows that they are giving thought to how to put into practice the requirements of the water framework directive, and Mrs Flemming's report makes valuable additional suggestions."
"Average household water consumption varies, per person per day, between 120 litres in Belgium and 213 litres in Italy."
"Germany, with DM 7.72 per cubic metre for the supply of drinking water and for wastewater drainage, is, with Denmark, far and away at the top of the world league, but, as regards consumption, is third from the bottom."
"Adequate high-quality water supply and appropriate drainage are part, of course, of services of general interest in the broadest sense, such as we have been discussing this morning."
"We must not, though, make the mistake of lumping deregulation and privatisation together."
"Privatisation can, in conjunction with other means, be perfectly adequate in achieving the objectives set by Article 9 of the water framework directive."
"I would, though, at this point, like - in the context of the discussion on the subject-matter for the new Inter-Governmental Conference - to give a clear reminder of the topic of the demarcation of competencies."
"We should not be making the sensitive area of water supply and drainage even more unstable while this issue has not been satisfactorily resolved."
"The various aspects of water and the price paid for it are among the most politically sensitive issues in some Member States, not only the southern ones, but also for Ireland and Austria, for example."
"I would wish to emphatically warn against mentioning or even attacking individual Member States."
"This applies all the more in view of the attempt, for example in item 28 for obvious reasons of party politics, to realise demands at a European level which would not be feasible in terms of domestic policy."
"Additionally in this case, the issues addressed are, then, only very marginally concerned, if at all, with the subject of the report."
"We would be creating a precedent with unforeseeable consequences, and I urge the adoption of Amendments Nos 3 and 6, for otherwise we would have to vote against an otherwise very good report."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the purpose of this report was to propose a text describing the effects of water pricing on consumption."
"Some Members, however, found the temptation to include proposals on the prospects for privatisation in this sector too strong to resist."
"To my mind, privatisation is often the first step towards liberalisation. Some of us in this House support the idea that water must not become a commodity like any other and must instead be given special consideration and above all remain the property of everyone, in present and future generations."
"Public authorities must remain in control of the distribution and treatment of water, even if we accept the idea of delegating services to private companies for set periods and under precisely defined conditions."
"Above all, if we wish to involve Europe' s citizens in these issues and to ensure that our policy does not simply result in higher bills, let us work on informing and communicating with the public on this crucial matter."
"We must win over as many people as possible to our concerns if we are to directly encourage individuals to reduce their water consumption."
"Mr President, the report works on the basic assumption that the easily-accessible fresh water reserves have been largely opened up, that long-term water use and savings can be achieved by using economic leverage, and that this would promote the responsible use of water."
"This requirement can only be met on a world-wide basis."
"I do not see implementation of the report's objectives on pricing as the high road that we should be taking."
"Affordable prices are often saddled with negative associations."
"The cost of clean water depends on the right investments, on technical skill and on better success than hitherto in allocating tasks in accordance with the 'polluter pays' principle."
"The Member States are free to come to their own decisions."
"It will be difficult to keep to the timetable."
"Mr President, as has been said, this debate is directly related to the debate we held before the entry into force of the European Parliament and Council Directive establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy."
"The report before us captures the spirit of the directive and applies it directly to the issue of the cost to be paid, by all users, although maybe not in equal amounts, for using water for economic purposes."
"However, the report also, rightly, and here I congratulate the rapporteur, stipulates that access to water at a proportionate or reduced cost, according to need, is a human right."
"Therefore, any pricing policy must be based, above all, on a realistic examination of the social and other conditions in which the commodity of water is to be used, but also on a user education campaign that raises awareness and particularly focuses on water saving measures."
"In order to provide a service which best responds to the different situations, it would be appropriate to incorporate the principle of subsidiarity so that each State makes its own decisions and each region sets its own levels and parameters."
"The general line taken by this report could be described as preventing wastage and assisting the less economically developed areas, and our thoughts therefore turn immediately to the matter of the agricultural world, which, as some of the Members have pointed out, must certainly not be too casually confused with the general issue."
"The basic principle is, in fact, that all the users should, in any case, contribute to paying for the commodity of water but in different proportions."
"However, priority scales also need to be established on the basis of first social and then economic requirements."
"The most direct comparison is with the CAP, which is intended to encourage and propose development measures which, as well as being suitable for the area concerned, are also compatible with the level of water resources available."
"Where there is no water available at all, Mr President, I feel that this needs to be taken into account, especially in the pricing policy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with the report' s assertion that water is not a commodity, but rather a heritage that must be protected, defended and treated as such, and that access to water is an inalienable human right."
"As socialists, we do not share the idea that water is an economic commodity, which excludes its social and cultural character, and we think that the protection and defence of water should not be guided by the rules of the market economy."
"With regard to the amendment on the Spanish National Hydrological Plan that, according to Mrs Flemming, we should withdraw, both my colleagues and myself, who presented it, are not going to withdraw it."
"We think that it is reasonable, that it criticises an EU country' s hydrological plan that is unsustainable from the economic, social and environmental points of view, and that it clearly contradicts the European Union' s Sustainable Development Strategy."
"For this reason, we are not going to withdraw the amendment."
"We hope that other Members will vote for it and we trust that this will be the case."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I want to thank the European Parliament for the resolution on the Commission communication on pricing policies for enhancing the sustainability of water resources."
"I want especially to thank Mrs Flemming who took on the task of rapporteur for this very sensitive issue."
"The communication must be seen in conjunction with the launch of the new water policy in Europe - the water framework directive, adopted last year."
"The aim of the communication is to establish guiding principles to support the implementation of the article on water pricing, that is to say Article 9 of the directive."
"The European Parliament' s draft opinion covers all the relevant issues affecting water pricing, from the covering of environmental costs to transparency and consumer participation."
"Moreover, emphasis is given to areas in which more research and analysis are required in order to ensure that future water pricing policy also embraces environmental, economic and social aspects."
"Part of this analysis will naturally be carried out in conjunction with the drawing up of management plans for river basin areas in accordance with the water framework directive."
"The views of the European Parliament will form the basis for future work at EU level aimed at implementing a more sustainable pricing policy."
"In this connection, allow me also to say something about what is happening in connection with the common strategy agreed by the Member States and the Commission to facilitate the implementation of the water framework directive."
"Working parties, including a working party on economic issues, have already been set up."
"These working parties are to develop implementation guidelines."
"The European Parliament will be kept informed about the future development of water pricing issues at EU level."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Packaging and packaging waste"
"The next item on the agenda is the Report (A5-0323/2001) by Mrs Corbey on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on implementation of Directive 94/62/EC [2000/2319(INI)] of 20 December 1994 of the European Parliament and the Council on packaging and packaging waste."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the waste mounting is still growing."
"Packaging only plays a minor, albeit visible, role in the environmental problem and is a source of irritation to many people."
"Packaging could be used as an example of a fresh approach to environmental problems."
"We must make sustainable development viable."
"We can adopt all the sound ideas from the sixth environmental action programme and apply these to the packaging policy."
"Fortunately, we are not starting from scratch."
"We have had a packaging directive since 1994, which we can use as a basis to work from."
"The packaging directive has a dual purpose: to reduce the harmful environmental impact of packaging to a minimum and to guarantee the functioning of the internal market."
"It is important for Parliament to consider how the directive operates in practice, for we must learn from experience."
"Compliance with legislation is important, but the effectiveness of the legislation is at least as important."
"In the field of compliance, there is good news and bad news."
"The good news is that nearly all Member States have implemented the directive well."
"Most objectives have been fulfilled, and Greece recently became the last Member State to inform the Commission of its measures and the results it had achieved."
"The Member States all did it their own way: Germany by means of the green dot system, the Netherlands by means of the voluntary agreements, etc."
"However, there is also bad news, and I should like to mention four points."
"Firstly, the volume of packaging waste is still on the increase."
"Prevention of excessive packaging was an express objective, although it is not further specified in the directive."
"Only in four countries has the volume of packaging materials diminished."
"We clearly need to be more ambitious in this respect."
"Secondly, the proportion of plastic in waste is growing."
"The directive prescribes a very modest target for plastic: at least 15% must be recycled."
"But even this minimum target has only been achieved by four countries, namely Germany, Austria, Belgium and Sweden."
"More than 50% of all products are wrapped in plastic."
"As it is difficult to recycle plastic, something must be done about this."
"Thirdly, reliable and comparable data is lacking."
"The Member States all have their own way of collating data and it is unclear, for example, whether plastic waste that is exported is also included in the figures."
"Political decisions must be based on sound data, and the directive must be adapted accordingly."
"To finish off, I should like to mention one major point: it is, in fact, unclear what the environmental effect is of all the collection, sorting, recycling and re-use."
"We think it is positive, and that is probably the case, but a sound assessment of environmental effects is required in order to continue to motivate consumers to separate their waste."
"Furthermore, the effect on the internal market, this directive' s second pillar, is equally vague."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is clearly time for a change."
"We need better reporting, better definitions and in addition to this, I would suggest a threefold approach."
"First of all, we must devote more attention to recycling."
"The targets must be raised considerably and we must encourage the use of recycled materials."
"Special attention must be given to plastic."
"To date, plastic has had no positive residual value."
"In order to make the collecting and sorting of plastic profitable nevertheless, a levy is required, and I would ask the Commission once again to quickly present the revised proposal now."
"Secondly, I would ask the Commission to promote re-use."
"For that purpose, situations must be identified where re-use is useful from an environmental point of view."
"That is connected with transport distances and the materials."
"Thirdly, we must accord prevention a far more prominent role."
"For that purpose, I suggest making the manufacturers responsible."
"On the basis of a lifecycle analysis, manufacturers must demonstrate that they have chosen the best possible packaging for their product from an environmental point of view."
"The question is, of course, how this can be measured."
"The emission of CO2, the use of natural ancillary resources, harmful substances and residual waste must definitely form part of the equation."
"By adopting this approach, environmental costs can be charged on as part of the product, and that is the direction in which we need to be heading."
"We must define clearer environmental parameters within which the market can go about its business and manufacturers can make choices."
"Manufacturer responsibility must be further detailed and the Commission must now take the stakeholders dialogue seriously."
"The interested parties from each sector, not only from industry but also consumers and representatives of environmental organisations, must be invited."
"This can lead to a refreshing approach which can be incorporated in clear guiding principles."
"In addition to the three above-mentioned points, fellow MEPs have added a number of useful suggestions: clear responsibility not only for products but also for retailers; paying attention to the role of local councils and of consumers; and paying attention to planning and transport packaging."
"I welcome these suggestions with open arms."
"The long-overdue revision of the packaging directive is an opportunity to demonstrate that the internal market can be reconciled with the environment, and we must not let this opportunity slip."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by acknowledging the great work done by Mrs Corbey in drawing up this report."
"It is clear that in this particular case we are dealing with a directive whose implementation has been very complicated in the majority of Member States, given that the fine-tuning of the mechanisms needed to meet the objectives of the directive is in itself a very complicated issue."
"It is one thing to issue a piece of legislation, because everything holds up on paper, and a completely different thing to put it into practice."
"I thank the rapporteur for the commitments we have been able to make and I regret that we could not agree on certain points, which are by no means trivial ones."
"Firstly I would like to make it patently clear that this should have been a report on the implementation of the directive on packaging, but it has turned into a report that is trying to tell the Commission the direction it should be taking with regard to the revision of the directive in question."
"It is a clear example of the temptation that we frequently give into in this Parliament, which is to forget that it is the Commission that holds the legislative initiative."
"We in the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats propose the following: Firstly, that the objectives for the prevention and reduction of packaging waste should not be binding, nor should they be classified by material, in order that competitiveness is maintained between them."
"For we should not forget that the legal basis of this directive is the environment and also the internal market."
"We think, however, that these objectives should be linked to the quantity of the product that is packaged and put on the market."
"Secondly: the responsibility for the prevention and removal of packaging and packaging waste must be shared between producers, packaging companies, retailers and consumers, and not only the producer, as the draft report proposes."
"Thirdly: Life Cycle Analysis is a very useful method from an environmental point of view, that should be taken into account, but it cannot be proposed as the standard norm to ensure that the requirements of Annex II are being met."
"These standard norms should be issued by the European Committee for Standardisation and this body, in turn, should continue working in this direction."
"Fourthly, we are against introducing any other new standard apart from the so-called 'green dot' , already in use in most countries."
"Lastly, we propose that the recitals alluding to the situation in specific Member States in 1998 with regard to compliance with the objectives of the directive be removed, for at this time the directive was in the process of being transposed, and the data, and I quote directly from recital B, ""are not meaningful for the purpose of assessing the real degree to which the directive's objectives have been met"" ."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mrs Corbey for addressing these issues and writing this own-initiative report."
"We really need to discuss packaging."
"I nonetheless think - and I say this following 30 years' experience of environmental issues and environmental debate - that, as usual, we have an incredible talent for running after problems and battening upon them."
"To discuss packaging solely from the perspective of waste, as we are doing now and have always done, is completely wrong."
"I address the Commissioner with responsibility for environmental issues directly and appeal to her to allow us to discuss the whole chain."
"We have to discuss logistics, transport and the packaging that eventually becomes waste."
"Above all, the amount of consumer packaging must and can be reduced."
"You and I come from the same country, and we know that experiments led to a 30 per cent reduction in the quantity of material in consumer packaging over approximately three years."
"It is possible."
"I might perhaps be allowed to appeal for the forthcoming White Paper on Integrated Product Policy to address the whole of the logistical chain, something which did not feature in the Green Paper."
"That would be a merciful answer to our prayers."
"Mr President, my group very much supports the report by Mrs Corbey and the compromise amendments, which improve the text."
"We also have some amendments of our own which we would urge Members of Parliament to support, particularly as the directive makes it more difficult for Member States with more progressive policies to go ahead in a more environmentally friendly way."
"There should be nothing to prevent Member States from making progress."
"I received a briefing from my own Department of the Environment in Ireland today, bemoaning the fact that it was going to be very difficult for Ireland."
"That is only because Ireland has done nothing about the waste problem or about packaging."
"In two other amendments we look to the Commission to present a proposal which takes proper account of the role of packaging throughout the logistics chain."
"It should also be putting forward proposals on prevention and reduction. That is where the problem really lies."
"We need to reduce and prevent the amount of packaging first of all, not look at what we are going to do with it afterwards, particularly the amount that goes into landfill."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Corbey, thank you for the work you have put in on this report."
"I would very much like to start by asking you, Commissioner, why you have brought before Parliament a report on the implementation of the packaging directive when the revision of the Packaging Regulations is already before us."
"I would very much like to know if there is a strategy for this, whether you need more time for a new debate on strategy and whether you are in the process of moving over from a product policy to a materials policy."
"As I now observe, that is a vain labour of love, as you are now applying yourself to other things."
"You are right, Mrs Corbey, to say that packaging waste is increasing, and so it is entirely right and proper for us to concern ourselves with these Packaging Regulations and with those to be enacted in the future."
"I simply think that we must first discuss what has actually been done by the Member States."
"Were the old Packaging Regulations from the Nineties right, or did we make mistakes?"
"Did we rightly see how things would turn out today?"
"Is there not a multitude of loopholes?"
"As you mentioned, databases are largely lacking."
"Has transposition into national law really taken place punctually and in the way we intend, and is the hierarchy envisaged by the Packaging Regulations actually as flexible as we need it to be in the future?"
"I do not believe so."
"Yet we must, now that the Commission has imposed on us this report on implementation, concentrate on these important matters."
"It is unfortunately not our present task to consider what quotas have to be set for landfill dumping, recycling, and so on."
"Let me make clear that I regret that."
"There are a lot of other points I would like to make. Having lost the first minutes, though, I shall admit defeat and carry on debating in the next round."
"Can you please briefly repeat the question you have just put?"
"Commissioner, I would like to know why you are presenting us with a report on the implementation of the Packaging Regulations, because we all know well enough that the revised Packaging Regulations have already arrived."
"My question is whether this is to do with a new strategy."
"Is it the case that you want in future to leave product policy behind and turn your attention to the torrents of refuse?"
"Mr President, these oversight reports by Parliament are very important because we need not only to examine new legislation but to look back to see what has happened to the legislation we have adopted. Mrs Corbey is quite right to name names."
"The Member States were supposed to bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with the packaging directive before 30 June 1996."
"That did not happen."
"Two things should flow from the findings Mrs Corbey has put before us."
"Firstly, we must ask whether the original directive, as Mr Florenz has said, was defective or whether ministers were not honest with themselves about what they could achieve when they adopted it."
"The answer is probably a combination of the two."
"Secondly, we should ask why the Commission did not act more quickly than it has to investigate why the directive was struggling to gain universal compliance."
"I regret that Mrs Corbey did not focus on these questions."
"Individual countries have had very different experiences as each has put a recovery system in place."
"My own evidence from the United Kingdom is that our system has been too bureaucratic. One businessman in Cornwall complained to me that he had to employ a graduate specifically to keep a track of his firm's obligations under the directive."
"What lessons are there from our experience which could underpin the revision of the directive, or at least a revision of the way that Member States are applying it?"
"The Commission is wrong if it proposes higher targets for recycling."
"This is the easy way out, but the wrong way."
"Such targets cannot take account of the considerable variations and circumstances between Member States, so we will end up with an even bigger range of results than we have now, creating trade barriers and distorting competition."
"If we are to get EU environmental law that really makes a difference, we must, within much broader targets, allow Member States to adopt solutions best suited to their respective local environments and economies."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, allow me to accord due recognition to Mrs Corbey as rapporteur."
"I would thank her for her work on this own-initiative report including a resolution on implementation of Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste."
"The report addresses relevant issues and will be of great importance when the Commission goes on to prepare the revision of the directive."
"We have also noted that the European Parliament would like to carry out a more extensive review of the issues affecting packaging waste."
"I think this is necessary, but things must be done in the right order."
"We have now committed ourselves to tabling before long a proposal for revision of the existing proposal and for new targets."
"This, moreover, is something we are going to do."
"I anticipate the Commission' s being able, before the end of the year, to take a decision on the promised revision of the Directive on Packaging and Packaging Waste."
"After that, we must look to the longer term considerations addressed by Mrs Paulsen and Mrs Jackson."
"We must therefore adopt several different approaches to this work."
"The first revolves around an Integrated Product Policy."
"I want to state in no uncertain terms that we have specifically emphasised life cycle analysis and this way of looking at the issues."
"Certainly, further efforts are required and further proposals and ideas about how to proceed, but the life cycle analysis contains the whole mode of thinking and way of approaching this issue."
"It is important that we continue to work with an Integrated Product Policy."
"The second revolves around the thematic strategies we have promised under the Sixth Environmental Action Programme."
"In the course of next year, there will be two such strategies which will be of great importance to our attitude towards these issues: recycling and use of resources."
"In connection with these strategies, there will be the opportunity to review the whole of our policy in terms of looking at each individual waste stream."
"Are we to continue to do this, and how are we to look at this issue in broad outline?"
"It is important for us to take this major initiative, but we must do it in the right way and at the right time."
"In my judgment, we must handle the problems via Integrated Product Policy and via the thematic strategies."
"Before the end of the year, the promised revision of the specific targets for packaging and packaging waste will take place."
"It is perfectly correct to point out that we need to review the whole of this issue in order to obtain a policy which will last for many years into the future and which will mean that we do not need to go chasing frantically after problems."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Insurance mediation"
"The next item on the agenda is the Report (A5-0359/2001) by Mr Berenguer Fuster on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive [COM(2000) 511 - C5-0484/2000 - 2000/0213(COD)] on insurance mediation."
"Mr President, even at this unreasonably late hour, I am honoured to submit for your consideration the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on insurance mediation."
"In my opinion it is a good proposal, on which the Commission should be congratulated. Above all, it is a proposal that manages to find a balance between the various interests concerned."
"In the area that it is intended to regulate, these interests include those of intermediaries, of insurance companies, and also, and this must not be forgotten, the interests of consumers, although these usually put less pressure on Members than the aforementioned interested parties."
"All of these interests should be taken into account, and when I say that this proposal is a balanced one, I am referring to the fact that there is a balance between all of the various interests concerned."
"Not to mention that the amendments tabled by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs must aim to uphold this balance that the Commission has scrupulously maintained."
"There are also other interests which are, in my opinion, less worthy of consideration."
"I am talking about sectors whose main aim is to uphold the status they currently enjoy in their respective countries, which will be impossible to sustain when we attempt to produce a harmonisation standard."
"If the aim of each country, or of each sector in each country, is that the forthcoming directive should not in any way affect the status quo, the only possible solution will, therefore, be not to have a harmonisation standard, or if it is required in an area such as this, that there should be no internal market in the specific sector in question."
"This aspiration can disguise an attempt for the harmonisation standard to respond exclusively to the current model in a specific country; or, put in more favourable terms, to suggest that Member States should not apply important parts of the directive."
"Ladies and gentlemen, do you not think that these exceptions could render the harmonisation standard meaningless?"
"Do you not realise that taking this route will cause problems for the internal market?"
"The proposal for a directive included certain exceptions, and it is true that the report enlarges on some of these, but I think that these exceptions are within the bounds of what is reasonable."
"The idea that those who sell insurance on behalf of travel agencies or veterinary surgeons have to be registered intermediaries should be excluded, for this falls within what is reasonable."
"Even now, I firmly believe that the further extension of exceptions could end up in nullifying the effect of the directive or, to put it differently, could end up by limiting, to a certain extent, the creation of an internal market in insurance mediation."
"I still insist, and please forgive me for doing so in this way, that the resultant report includes several special features that certain countries have to ease the adoption of the directive."
"For example, amendments relating to the tied agent that were designed to find a solution to ease the adaptation of legislation in those countries in which there is currently no regulation in this field."
"There are, evidently, other formulas, and one of these was the one set out in the Commission proposal, and another that consists of my personal viewpoint stated in my original report."
"However, neither the original formula nor my original proposal would be completely satisfactory to a good number of my fellow Members, who hold different positions, which is why compromise amendments had to be tabled that, I think, should resolve the problem reasonably clearly."
"I would like you to be aware, ladies and gentlemen, that the result that is being submitted for your consideration is the outcome of a compromise between different points of view that, when seen as a whole, are acceptable."
"It is only for this reason and out of respect for this compromise that the Group of the Party of European Socialists has decided not to table any more amendments, with the exception of three that are simply of a technical nature, that aim to correct inconsistencies in the text."
"Clear proof of this fact is the refusal to table any amendments such as those tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, that were subsequently defeated at committee stage and with which I personally agreed, because these are not only in line with the main points of my original proposal, but they also seek to provide better consumer protection, something with which I will always agree."
"Mr President, I feel that, as Mr Berenguer Fuster said, the Commission proposal fills a large gap in the internal insurance market which has been created by the huge development in insurance and reinsurance transactions recently, particularly relating to the insurance of specific interests, and here I refer to the major industrial and commercial risks, while the market for private individuals and other smaller risks has been left rather to its own devices, resulting in a sort of free-for-all."
"We know how sensitive insurance mediation is, and our directive concerns precisely the mediation aspect."
"That is why we found the Commission' s proposal both balanced and interesting, although possibly a little overcomplicated, which is why we have endeavoured to streamline it with a series of amendments - I am, of course speaking on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which has drafted its opinion - to make the sector which does not focus primarily on insurance rather more mobile and marketable."
"There are, in fact, many entities, such as travel and tour agencies, whose main activity is not insurance but which do sell risk and life insurance as part of their business. Such transactions clearly lie outside and are not bound by the usual conventions of professionalism and honour, by the extremely stringent and far-reaching requirements, that is, which guarantee precisely that good faith and reliability and credibility that should be high priority in insurance."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are four points I would like to address."
"The first is that the insurance business is based on trust."
"Trust has a dual basis: trust in the product on the one hand, and on the other, trust in the other party's sales personnel and in their way of doing business."
"It needs, then, to be said today that the absolute majority of all sales personnel and brokers do their work in a proper way; otherwise the insurance business would not be flourishing and justifying the trust placed in it by its customers."
"Secondly, I would like to thank all those who have worked on this report."
"Thirdly, many States' laws on insurance and banking already impose strict duties of consultation and information, which are binding also on brokers."
"Insurers and credit institutions are subject to supervision and obligatory registration and to clear regulations on policy."
"Quite independently of that, I share the directive's desire to guarantee the creation of a high professional standard for insurance brokers, to establish a single register for cross-frontier operations and to secure a high level of protection for insurance enterprises."
"Over and above what has already been said, Mr Radwan and I have tabled three amendments - Nos 57, 58, and 59 - in which we intend, firstly, to have it left to the Member States to decide whether to exempt insurance brokers dealing in commercial risks from the requirements of the directive; secondly, to have the intermediary activity end with the conclusion of the contract, as is customary; and thirdly, to make a clearer distinction between those who work as insurance brokers as their main occupation and those for whom this activity is incidental to another."
"Mr President, the PPE-DE Group broadly welcomes this long-overdue overhaul of the original 1977 directive as part of the single market in financial services, which utilises the financial passport or single licence concept."
"This involves minimal harmonisation, the setting of professional standards and consumer safeguards as well as mutual recognition between Member States, to enable brokers to enjoy freedom of establishment throughout the Union with rules to ensure prudential care for the good conduct of their business."
"I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Berenguer Fuster, on his largely cooperative cross-party approach in committee, appropriate to a technical report which provides quality assurance to the consumer."
"It is worth noting that approximately 95% of European consumers use the services of insurance brokers and will be affected by this directive, along with 100 000 insurance practitioners in the Union."
"The vast majority of areas of political difference were resolved in a series of compromise amendments, as well as those requirements due to the peculiar structure of the German industry."
"I was delighted at the adoption of a large number of my own amendments, ranging from exemptions for the travel industry, to recognition of the role of the computer and the Internet and the future role of e-commerce for insurance, as well as safeguards for a three-yearly review of eligibility for registration, and protection for businesses located offshore outside the EU."
"I hope this report will not increase the burden to intermediaries, in terms of cost or difficulty, or of conducting normal business practices, but will open up a competitive and transparent market throughout the 15 Union Member States, which ultimately, by providing volume and economy of scale, will provide real savings which will be handed down to the citizens of the Union."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking Parliament for the efforts to complete its first reading of the proposal for a directive on insurance mediation."
"I would like to thank in particular the rapporteur, Mr Berenguer, and also Mr Ferri, for the quality of their work which has resulted in the recommendation submitted to this plenary."
"The proposal for a directive on insurance mediation, scheduled in the action plan for financial services, is a key text to achieve a true internal market in insurance, in particular as regards retail markets."
"Insurance intermediaries play a fundamental role in the sale of insurance in the Community and their importance would increase with the emergence of more complex and sophisticated insurance products."
"Although the internal market in insurance has been completed as regards insurance undertakings, especially concerning the prudential rules, insurance intermediaries continue to be confronted with several obstacles which prevent them from taking full advantage of the freedoms of the Treaty."
"The proper functioning of the internal market is therefore hindered."
"I am particularly pleased that Parliament agrees with the essential objectives of the Commission's proposals."
"It seeks to ensure that insurance intermediaries possess a high level of professional competence and that an intermediary, duly registered in his home Member State, may conduct his activities throughout the internal market."
"The proposal also aims to guarantee the protection of customers by setting appropriate information requirements."
"I now turn to the amendments submitted to the plenary session."
"The Commission can accept the following amendments: Nos 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 17, 28, 30, 37 and the second part of No 58."
"It can also accept either partially or in their spirit the following amendments: 3, 7, 11, 21, 23, 24, 26, 27, 29, 32, 44 and 51."
"Amendment Nos 15 and 16 may also be accepted in part."
"The Commission is not, however, in a position to accept the other amendments tabled for the following reasons. Amendment Nos 2, 10, 13, 14, 46, 47, 49, 52 and 57 aim to exclude from the scope of the proposal some activities such as those of travel agencies, veterinarians and persons acting on an occasional basis, and therefore these amendments cannot be accepted."
"These exclusions would affect the sale of insurance products involving important risks and are therefore rejected."
"The same reasons explain the non-acceptance of Amendment Nos 12 and 50."
"The Commission considers that the term ""insurance intermediary"" is defined in an appropriate manner."
"The scope of the directive is well balanced."
"Amendment Nos 15 and 16 are therefore not necessary since the definition covers all intermediation activities, including those carried out by electronic means."
"The same applies to Amendment Nos 19 and 25 which relate to sub-agents and also to Amendment Nos 20 and 58."
"As regards the issue of ""bancassurance"", all forms of ""bancassurance"" activities should fall within the scope of the proposal."
"It is an increasingly important way of distributing insurance."
"Amendment Nos 18 and 22 propose a definition of ""bancassurance"" activities which only takes account of one of the possible forms that ""bancassurance"" may take."
"They are therefore rejected."
"There are amendments relating to registration and professional requirements of insurance intermediaries."
"Amendment Nos 31 and 56 would imply less strict rules to cover professional negligence of insurance intermediaries."
"They would jeopardise the objective of ensuring an appropriate level of professional liability cover for insurance intermediaries in the internal market."
"Amendment No 33, 34 and 54 would affect the overall coherence of the proposal which is based on the principle of home country control."
"Amendment No 35 and 36 concern complaint schemes and out-of-court redress mechanisms of the proposal."
"Amendment No 35 is already implicit in the text of the proposal and is not necessary."
"Amendment No 36 does not seem appropriate in the context of a directive since it contains a specific reference to a Commission recommendation which is not legally binding on the Member States."
"Thirdly there are amendments referring to information requirements."
"A key element of the Commission proposal is to ensure a high level of protection of consumers through the provision of appropriate information and advice."
"Amendment Nos 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 55, 60 and 61 would compromise considerably this objective."
"Finally, Amendment Nos 6, 45 and 48 which provide that non-registered persons excluded from the scope of the directive should comply with information requirements, would be extremely difficult for the Member States to implement in practice."
"I am sorry to have talked so long about these amendments, but Parliament has a right to know what the Commission thinks."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"I have always had the childish ambition to have us finish at midnight."
"Tonight we have missed it by only ten seconds."
"(The sitting was closed at midnight.)"
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, I have two observations with regard to the Minutes."
"The first is the least important: on the first point, with regard to the votes on request for urgent procedure, the first point voted on was on the fisheries agreement with Morocco."
"I was here and voted in favour, but this has not been recorded in the Minutes. I was here, and I spoke immediately afterwards."
"I would now like to refer to the second point."
"With regard to the Global Fund to fight HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, yesterday morning a deadline for tabling amendments was set for 10.00 a.m. this morning, in order that the debate may be held tonight, probably at the last minute."
"The political groups were working yesterday in order to be able to table amendments, and today I see in the Minutes that the item has been added to the agenda of Wednesday 28 November and that the deadline for tabling amendments has been set for Thursday 22 November."
"I would like to point out, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, that we cannot work upon the text submitted by the Commission, that we were working on yesterday."
"There is only one version available in one language, and, in addition to this, in this language there are different versions of the same text with various discrepancies between them."
"Lastly, to give just one example, and I shall finish on this note, Mr President, it states that the Commission is proposing a single contribution of 120 million, yet it does not state whether these are euros, dollars, condoms or DDT."
"I think that the Commission should provide a text that is correct, tell us which of the texts is the final version, and make this available in all of the official languages."
"We will make sure your vote is recorded."
"Regarding the question of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, the documents are not ready, as you correctly say."
"That was the reason why it was put back to 28 November."
"That will also give the committee some more time to deliberate on the matter and make sure that the text is correct."
"That was the basis for the reasoning and you are quite right to raise it."
"Mr President, as someone who has consistently called in this House for an early report from the presidency on the progress of our own staff reforms, can I be the first to welcome the fact that we received a letter from the President yesterday on this subject."
"It was an undated letter but I assume it was issued yesterday."
"However, I should like to register again my concern that we still need more information."
"Mrs Fontaine says in her letter: ""I believe the time has come to provide all Members with the fullest possible details""."
"I am afraid this is not the ""fullest possible details"", since half of it is a letter to Mr Prodi."
"I should like you to ask the Bureau and the presidency to give us in this House, as soon as possible, a comparison of the proposed personnel reforms in this parliamentary institution with the reforms proposed in the Commission."
"And bearing in mind that on 28 October the Commission adopted their new personnel strategy, can we please have an early debate in this House with Mr Kinnock about his reforms and with the presidency about their reforms, so that Members can be properly informed."
"We must have a chance to debate this and to understand why the presidency of this House is proposing in one instance radically different changes to those proposed for the Commission."
"I, along with many other colleagues, am concerned about that different approach."
"Mr Harbour, your point is well made and well understood by the Bureau."
"The House is sovereign at the end of the day."
"I will certainly pass on your message in the strongest possible terms to the presidency, so that the matter can be resolved."
"I am sure everybody is aware that there is an ongoing discussion within the Commission itself at the present time."
"Until the overall situation is clarified Parliament cannot come to any firm conclusions itself."
"I do not have the letter in front of me, but in it the President has pointed out that the Conference of Presidents and the Bureau were fairly unanimous in the point of view they have adopted."
"Parliament is sovereign, as I have said, and the matter will be open for further discussion."
"There is no doubt about that."
"(The Minutes of the previous sitting were approved)"
"European Research Area (Multiannual Framework Programme 2002-2006)"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following two reports:"
"(A5-0376/2001) by Gérard Caudron, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the multiannual framework programme 2002-2006 of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities aimed at contributing towards the creation of the European Research Area [COM(2001) 94 - C5-0087/2001 - 2001/0053(COD)];"
"(A5-0355/2001) by Gérard Caudron, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council decision concerning the multiannual framework programme 2002-2006 of the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM) for research and training activities aimed at contributing towards the creation of the European Research Area [COM(2001) 94 - C5-0171/2001 - 2001/0054(CNS)]."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, before I begin my speech as general rapporteur for the Sixth Framework Programme on Research, I must first express my heartfelt gratitude to all those who have helped me in this difficult task. As you know, this is an important programme."
"It has a provisional budget of EUR 17.5 billion, including Euratom. I would like to thank the Swedish and Belgian Presidencies, the European Commission, Commissioner Busquin, Mr Westendorp, the Secretariat of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, the ITER Committee, the administrators of the different groups, my assistant Gaëlle Le Bouler, the shadow rapporteurs of the ITER Committee, the draftsmen of the opinion, the shadow draftsmen of the committees consulted and the group coordinators."
"I think that I am now in a position to declare that together we have completed a truly remarkable task. I am sure you will all agree with me on this."
"You will express your view when we vote. I am sure that the result will not be the same as the outcomes of the votes on the Fourth, and especially the Fifth Framework Programme on Research and Development."
"I believe that the results of our work can largely be attributed to two guiding principles. Firstly, in my capacity as rapporteur I have always wanted to be the representative and spokesman for a broad majority in Parliament."
"In addition, Commissioner Busquin was, from the start, willing to support the framework and the overall budget of the project."
"In addition to this support, we have received many proposals for adjustment."
"These have resulted from our wide-ranging consultation with the European research sector, European politicians and all the organisations and citizens with an interest in the European research sector."
"I can personally list more than 250 meetings, talks and discussions on this project and this report since the beginning of 2001."
"Furthermore, I have tried to ensure transparency during work on this project. I have published all available information and views on the subject in real time on my website."
"In recent months, this website has been visited more than 3 000 times per month, excluding the summer holiday period."
"Clearly, all of us, myself included, have agreed to set up a genuine European Research Area and all the necessary structures, including the Joint Research Centre, on the basis of the Framework Programme on Research and Development."
"We have agreed too that we need to act upon the idea of European added value, as proposed by the European Commission."
"But, at the same time, we have all declared that we should take into consideration another aspect of added value: the added value of giving research a European dimension."
"This supplements the accounting added value of the European Commission."
"As I have already said, we should not allow there to be any perception or feelings of exclusion, and we should back researchers who believe that their work needs to be carried out at a European level."
"All this translates into two new, secondary priorities. Firstly, there is the fight against major diseases."
"This goes hand-in-hand with research on the human genome, with its anticipated results for health. Secondly, we need to consider terrestrial and maritime transport."
"The objectives here are to improve links between different means of transport, and to improve flexibility, security, efficiency, and coherence. In this regard, the quality and improvement of the environment are important considerations."
"So far as the functioning of the framework programme is concerned, there are proposals to ensure that there is a smooth transfer between the old instruments of the Fourth and Fifth Framework Programmes and the Commission' s three new instruments. In addition, there is the fourth 'stairway of excellence' instrument."
"Further, all this translates into a compromise on the specific programmes involved."
"The proposal is for a single programme with eight sub-programmes. This will increase coherence while providing sufficient scope for participation and adequate control."
"There are also specific measures to improve professional life and mobility for researchers, while taking account of the requirement to strengthen the role of micro-enterprises and small and medium-sized businesses."
"As regards the Euratom section, the majority of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy also agreed on the principles and the structure of the Commission' s text, especially regarding the need to ensure security of energy supply, risk reduction, and the processing of nuclear waste."
"Lastly, the majority of the Committee on Industry agreed on the importance of research on nuclear fusion. They also agreed on the need to construct an experimental reactor soon, and for it to be located in Europe if possible."
"This is necessary so that we may have some chance of meeting our energy requirements in fifty years' time."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament will today establish a firm and sound position after our first reading."
"I am delighted that progress has not been hindered by what occurred on Monday evening. The situation where the adoption of my reports would have been dependent on the conclusions of the Temporary Committee on Human Genetics has been avoided."
"By midday I hope that we will also reach agreement on ethical rules and on stem cell research on supernumerary embryos."
"The vote today could also benefit the debate and votes to be held on the Fiori report during the November sitting in Brussels."
"In this, we must be guided by common sense and tolerance and respect the views of others."
"The result of the votes held by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on 16 and 22 October has already been noted by the 'Research' Council of 30 October, judging by its final communiqué. A new 'Research' Council will publish its common position next December."
"I hope it will then be possible, through the codecision procedure, we will be able to reach a common decision by favouring informal discussions. I would not like to place a bet on our not needing to resort to conciliation."
"We might or we might not."
"However, I would like to reiterate this point: the sooner we finish our work in 2002, the sooner partners working in the research sector will be able to prepare and so ensure the best possible transition to the Fifth Framework Programme."
"Also, the sooner we finish our work, the sooner we will be able to develop international partnerships with candidate countries and associated countries, and pursue all our other international ventures."
"I would like to finish where I began, by thanking all those involved in this splendid project. I call on the Commission and the Council to listen to us, and, more importantly, to ensure that they understand us."
"Our demands are not unrealistic; neither are we engaged in politics here."
"They are proposals by European citizens, considered and debated at length."
"We therefore call for them to be studied."
"Further work will of course need to be undertaken when it comes to the final agreement, but for the moment we simply need to be free to define our own position."
"We set out to turn this work into an opportunity for a wide-ranging debate to strengthen the important link between science and society. We set out to convince people that, although science does not have all the answers, we cannot hope to tackle the world' s greatest problems without science, research and researchers."
"I hope that our work will have made a positive contribution in this regard. I also hope that it will provide the Commission and the Council with proposals from the European research sector which will form the basis of a Sixth Framework Programme on Research and Development for Europe in 2002."
", draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to express my thanks to the rapporteur, and also my gratitude for the debate he has stimulated."
"He has really tried to make a reality of the wide-ranging citizens' debate of which he speaks."
"He has tried to involve many people, within and outside Parliament, and in research circles, in order to have an intelligent discussion here and prepare a good compromise."
"From the point of view of the Committee on Budgets, I must say, I support the rapporteur, but I am being pulled in two directions, because I at the same time have to announce that my group has misgivings and will not vote in favour of this resolution in its entirety."
"I am here, then, primarily playing my role as draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets."
"It has to be said on this point that the budget for this Sixth Research Framework Programme ranges between the right limits."
"A slight increase was achieved, but at the same time the allocation was not exceeded, in other words the programme is, in budgetary terms, within proper and sensible limits."
"I think we can achieve real European added value with this proposal."
"We also had discussions with the Commission about possible simplification of the procedure, that also being one of our Committee's concerns, so that approval might be granted more quickly."
"The Commission has made good proposals on this point, and we are very confident that this speeding-up of procedures can be achieved in order that the partners in projects can access their funds more quickly."
"At the same time, our side urged once more that proper account should be taken of the smaller project partners and that smaller projects should not fall by the wayside in a slimmed-down procedure, because it is in the sphere of the smaller projects that a lot of important work has been done."
"There is one bitter pill for our group above all others to swallow, and that is the issue of renewable energies and the issue of the Euratom resources."
"Speaking from my group's point of view, I have to say that we have problems with the fact that renewable energies have not been developed as they should have been, and that too much has been approved, especially in the fusion field."
"Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the Caudron report, I should like to offer the rapporteur our Committee' s congratulations and thanks for the job he has done, which was not a simple one."
"His report provides a balanced discussion of all the main arguments on which the European institutions should concentrate their attention as regards scientific research and the potential for technological and social development."
"The Committee on Freedoms particularly stresses the need for the public promotion of research to be done with the greatest possible transparency and involvement of the citizens."
"A European knowledge-based society, like the one the Union is proposing, requires not only huge-scale initiatives in literacy, including scientific literacy, for all the citizens but also an increasingly intense, active involvement of the citizens in decisions regarding the direction that investment in this field should take."
"Non-specialist citizens, in other words, should not just enjoy or, as is often the case, suffer the results achieved by science, but should also join with the experts in deciding on the objectives that research should pursue."
"We believe the validity of a European science policy should be measured especially on this criterion."
"The Caudron report quite rightly addresses these aspects."
"I believe the Caudron report also invokes the transparent and democratic nature of decisions on scientific research when, instead of invoking principles of natural law, which are, in fact, only held by certain authorities, it refers, in the case of the ethical problems of research, to charters of rights, the documents which have effectively been approved and sanctioned by our Institutions."
"This means, for instance, in the field of stem cell research, respecting the feelings of a large number of European citizens by ruling out the production of stem cells for research, but allowing research to be conducted on those supernumerary cells that would otherwise be destroyed."
"On this and other matters I believe we should go with the Caudron report."
"Mr President, the European Commission is proposing an appropriation of EUR 17 billion, fully recognising the importance of research and technological innovation in Europe."
"Unfortunately, research projects today often do not achieve the hoped-for success which would allow them to compete at an international level, and the European Union does not hold enough attraction to lure back the top researchers who have chosen to work abroad."
"The new scheme should bring in some changes: firstly, concentrate financial aid on a restricted, specific number of priority subjects for Europe; secondly, invite researchers to collaborate more closely; and thirdly, increase the mobility of researchers by creating a working environment in Europe that is attractive to them."
"These priorities form the framework for the 42 amendments tabled by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, many of which have been incorporated, for which I thank the rapporteur and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, which is competent in this matter."
"These amendments concern employment, health and safety at work, access to work for the disabled, small and medium-sized enterprises and European Community research centres."
"With regard to employment, we have seen an amendment adopted which seeks to extend research to the development of operating systems and computer hardware in Europe in order to increase employment and stop us from being so heavily dependent on the United States and Japan in this area."
"This is a key sector for the new economy and would entail considerable risks for the sake of economic and employment growth."
"Then we asked for action in the field of health and safety at work, in order to encourage access for the socially excluded and disadvantaged, such as people with disabilities."
"Research support for small and medium-sized enterprises has also been accepted with very favourable terms, it has gone up from 15 to 30 %, and the same may be said of support for JRCs, which are to receive EUR 725 million."
"In conclusion, Mr President, I must move in favour of approval, since science and research are there to serve the people, for that right to life that no one is entitled to jeopardise."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has worked intensively on the research framework programme."
"We have submitted many proposals on sustainable development, food safety and other subjects, which were, thankfully, generally adopted by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy."
"We focused on medical research, as we believed that it was in this area that there was the greatest need for change to the Commission's proposal."
"The Commission's suggestion that only biotechnology should be promoted in the health context is too narrow."
"Other research fields, too, promise much for health and need to be supported."
"I thank Mr Caudron, the rapporteur, for his commitment to this as well, and also the shadow rapporteurs, in particular Mr van Velzen, for whom this was also a matter for concern."
"It is regrettable that the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy could not follow us as regards the ethical boundaries of medical research."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy spoke out clearly in favour of research and for the curing of illnesses, but also in favour of clear boundaries for the sake of human dignity."
"In particular, our Committee demands the exclusion of exploitative research on human embryos from the research framework programme."
"This ban is necessary not just because human life is involved, but also because we must counteract the danger of the female body being seen as raw material for industry."
"Embryo research is not possible without women's egg cells being made available, and the donation of egg cells puts a woman under great strain and at medical risk."
"It is for this reason that many feminists, too, are opposed to exploitative embryo research."
"As I have said, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy could not follow us down this road, and so, together with Mr Fiori, I have tabled an amendment that follows the line taken by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, which is also taken in the United States."
"'Yes' to stem cell research, but 'no' to exploitative embryo research."
"The Americans can be accused of many things, but not of being hostile to research."
"I therefore ask for support for Amendment No 332, tabled by Messrs Fiori, Liese and others."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Caudron for his report."
"The Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport welcomes it for a number of reasons. It particularly welcomes the fact that the report deals with a number of matters which concern our committee."
"These include the technology and methods used to convert products and works into a digital format, the protection and development of our historic and cultural heritage. We are also pleased that it deals with drug taking, as our committee is also responsible for youth and sports."
"Other areas of concern contained in the report include the history of Europe, distance learning and mobility for researchers. I regret that digital cinema, the cinema of tomorrow, has disappeared from this list."
"It might have required specific research. I hope that specific programmes will be able to make good this omission."
"I would also like to say that I am delighted the life sciences have been recognised as a scientific subject and are not regarded simply as an instrument for other sciences."
"The life sciences constitute a distinct discipline and the fact that the Sixth Framework Programme has recognised this is a great step forward."
"Perhaps the first title of the seventh thematic area: 'Cultural and social research' was the most appropriate."
"I am sorry it has been changed to 'Citizens, democracy, social and political institutions' ."
"I think the first title was better."
"If we had used the title 'Cultural and social research' , it might have been easier to include research on women, and not just research carried out by women, as in the paragraph 'Science and society' ."
"Mr Caudron, I regret the fact that research 'on women' and the thinking included in your intermediary reports were not retained in its final version."
"I have been involved in drawing up reports which have gradually transformed the notion of centres of excellence. The latter became the stairway of excellence."
"We, the members of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, were very concerned that research should not be confined to an elite. Rather, when it comes to building the European Research Area, research should be shared amongst younger researchers, a range of relevant institutions, and universities."
"I note that there have been adjustments here too."
"I am glad that the paragraph 'Science and society' has doubled. The matter of research 'by women' is at the heart of this paragraph."
"The Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities has an interest in this subject, but so does the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport."
"Mr President, as draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, I submitted a series of amendments which principally endeavoured to enshrine the principle of gender mainstreaming in the Sixth Research Framework Programme, which is in any case the largest programme, for which we are voting approximately EUR 17 billion."
"Concentration on other topics has meant, as Mrs Fraisse has already explained, that there has been less research into gender issues and less emphasis upon opening science and research to the full range of people with the right potential."
"In 1999, 66% of the research workers in the State sector and 72% of those in higher education were men."
"In only a few countries did the proportion of women exceed 40%, and that was in Ireland and Greece."
"Only in Portuguese higher education, with 53%, was a balance achieved."
"Women are particularly underrepresented, at 9%, in academic teaching posts in Germany."
"The highest levels were in Finland with 36%."
"It is therefore in the European interest and adds value if women are involved in research and teaching at every stage, from planning, via decision-making to project management, as well as in EU initiatives for prizes and competitions in all disciplines."
"I had already demanded this in this House in connection with the McNally Report on women and science, and, in order to implement it, the Commission set up a Gender Unit, which now has some early successes to show."
"Focused efforts have achieved a percentage of nearly 40% of women involved in the EU's research bodies and the same proportion receiving Marie Curie scholarships."
"We must, then, build on the successes of the Fifth Research Framework Programme, one contribution to which might be the doubling of the budget in the 'Science and Society' subdivision, and here, too, there is a need for research into gender issues."
"One final remark: In my language, the entire draft has to be revised in gender-neutral language, because we are setting the course for the future, above all for young women scientists."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to address the rapporteur and congratulate him on the outcome, but also on the excellent working relationship."
"You have found an innovative method, for which we are very grateful."
"Needless to say, that also applies to the shadow rapporteurs, Messrs McNally, Piétrasanta and Plooij-van Gorsel."
"We worked well together."
"I should also like to extend a word of thanks to my own fellow MEPs who have invested a huge amount of energy in this dossier."
"This is truly a joint outcome, and I therefore hope that the Commission, as well as the Council, is prepared to take this outcome seriously."
"Indeed, we have developed a structure by means of which, within the restricted margins available to us, everything has become clearer."
"More emphasis has been placed on bio-sciences; a better link has been established between research on the human genome and related diseases; far more attention has been devoted to a coherent package of industrial policy, information society, nanotechnoloy, as well as aviation and aerospace."
"Additionally, food safety has been accorded considerably more attention."
"Furthermore, unlike the Commission, we have given transport a much higher place in our list of priorities, alongside more attention for energy."
"Agriculture is also more involved."
"In my view, the package is looking better now all in all."
"The budget is also of major importance in my opinion."
"We have expressly adhered to our pledge to the Council that we would not increase the budget."
"We have slightly shifted the priorities."
"We would therefore make an urgent appeal to the Council to accept our budget now and not to start bargaining, for we will then have a war on our hands."
"Next, we should be emphatically aware that although the EU' s contribution to research in the Member States carried out by the national governments and industry is limited, it is still of fundamental importance."
"If, specifically, the EU can play a complementary role, the added value will be significant."
"Not for nothing did we include a fourth instrument to guarantee the smoothest possible transition between the Fifth and Sixth Framework Programme and to allow minor projects too to take place."
"More than 15% has been set aside for small- and medium-sized enterprises, and that too is one of our priorities."
"The decentralisation of the Sixth Framework Programme is important, but it is just as important not to weigh down the newly integrated projects, centres of excellence, with an enormous amount of red tape."
"That is why I believe our amendments are excellent."
"One final point: we have struggled greatly with the ethical principles."
"Indeed, on the one hand, it is important to create a framework within which research is to take place, but on the other hand, it is important, by means of further research, to create space for solutions to be found for existing illnesses with a genetic hereditary factor."
"Our greatest challenge was to strike that balance, and I hope that we have succeeded in this."
"Mr President, I thank the rapporteur, Mr Caudron, and Commissioner Busquin, who have both helped us to work efficiently, as have the shadow rapporteurs."
"The Sixth Framework Programme is the first implementation of the European Research Area, which itself is a consequence of the Lisbon Summit and its wish for us to have a successful knowledge-based economy, because of the strong correlation between research and development and economic success - inadequate in most EU countries outside Scandinavia, I should say."
"We welcome the emphasis on looking for European added value, not scattering the limited funds over the whole range of research carried out."
"So I am glad that we are now targeting cutting-edge research, particularly in areas like nano-technology, which will be very significant in the future."
"There are, however, some gaps in the proposals which we wish to see filled."
"They include, of course, health, other than strictly post-genomic research, non-nuclear energy and land and water transport."
"I come to international activities, because the research framework programme must look outside the EU as well."
"It is essential that there is both earmarked money for international cooperative research - we suggest EUR 400 million - and mainstreaming across all the research, particularly on HIV/AIDS malaria and tuberculosis."
"We must involve the countries that suffer from those scourges in the research."
"The sums allocated in the Commissioner's proposal for science and society were inadequate."
"We propose to double the spending on science and society."
"We do not think that having one specific programme with one management will lead to transparency and adequate monitoring."
"I therefore hope that our suggestion will ensure that we are able to have both openness and good management of each individual part of the programmes."
"Although we welcome networks of excellence and integrated projects, we must maintain more familiar mechanisms at the early stages."
"We must at all costs avoid the creation of scientific cartels."
"I am pleased with the new mission of the JRC."
"I served on Mr Davignon's panel and it is certainly consistent with the panel's views."
"As far as the Euratom section of the Sixth Framework Programme is concerned, I have very grave doubts as to whether the ITER project will be implemented and my personal view - this is not the view of the rapporteur - is that extra funding is not therefore needed."
"It will be available in any case."
"The framework programmes are one of the big success stories of the European Union."
"Let us build on their past success."
"Mr President, I would first like to thank Commissioner Busquin for the way these proposals were prepared, for listening to the views of others and for his excellent collaboration."
"I would also like to extend my sincere thanks to Gérard Caudron. He listened attentively to all the political groups and to the shadow rapporteurs, and others."
"We have worked very well together. I believe that he did everything he could have done."
"Although there have been differences of opinion on some conclusions, the work was completed to a high standard. My thanks also go to my fellow shadow rapporteurs."
"In my opinion, this report on the Sixth Framework Programme on European Research is the big report of the moment, despite its faults."
"It has European added value, it is innovative as the Commissioner wished, it has networks of excellence and integrated projects."
"We have a lot to do."
"We have also made significant progress on matters concerning young people, grants and women and preventing brain drains."
"We cannot ignore all the innovative proposals in the Sixth Framework programme."
"There are three issues of great concern to the Greens."
"Firstly, the ethical questions."
"We do not want the European Union to fund the modification of the human genetic inheritance and the creation of human embryos for therapeutic reasons."
"We also want to see a ban on financing research using supernumerary human embryos and the stem cells of supernumerary embryos."
"From what I have heard, I think all the political groups will reach a compromise on these points."
"Secondly, we would like to see an assessment of the effects of new technologies, like electromagnetic radiation for example, on populations, on health and so on."
"Thirdly, we would like to achieve a fairer balance between research on renewable energies and research on nuclear energy."
"I would like to reiterate the sentiments of Eryl MacNally. We do not want to see an increase in the nuclear energy or the ITER project budgets."
"That is very long term. We would however like research credits for renewable energy to be more on a par with those for nuclear energy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, I want to emphasise that I am not speaking on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party."
"There are a good few of our members who have genuinely attended to this issue, who are on the way here to our debate today but who will not perhaps be in time for the vote."
"I personally believe that we shall be adopting too many amendments."
"If we examine research programmes and research issues, there is scarcely any research programme in the whole of Europe that is so driven by politicians."
"That is in total contrast to, for example, the assessment made by Manuel Castells - yes, it is legitimate to call him a sociologist - together with the Finnish philosopher Pekka Himanen as to why Finland is successful as an information society."
"In their perhaps otherwise rather vague book, they observe that our technology and innovation policy are successful because we have a complete and autonomous centre for technical development."
"That is something which I think invites reflection."
"In other contexts, it is usual to applaud Finnish innovation policy."
"I think that a certain lesson can be drawn from this."
"In addition, I want to emphasise an aspect of this proposal that particularly bothers me, namely that the social research proposed would certainly be allocated to the wrong place, under the Information Society DG."
"Social research does not belong in that context."
"I do not properly understand how this has happened."
"We are also aware that interest in research issues has, to a very large extent, revolved around stem cell research."
"Today, we can adopt a position on the Caudron proposal in peace and quiet."
"I personally view the committee' s proposal as being well balanced."
"The committee' s proposal also shows the modesty and respect that is required when we debate research issues."
"I think that those who say that we should now concentrate first and foremost upon stem cells from adults are not showing the required modesty faced with this new area."
"In the course of the work in the Temporary Committee on Human Genetics, I learned that we know extremely little."
"We must adhere to the old principles and proceed further within the various frameworks."
"Furthermore, I learned that the research projects for both forms of stem cells are dependent upon each other."
"It must therefore be possible for them to be given the same priority."
"That, I believe, is extremely important if we are to be able to move ahead as a successful society."
"I hope that these comments are not too alarming, but that they lead to reflection on the part of all who are interested in our researchers' really being able to carry out good research."
"Mr President, the amount of EUR 17.5 billion of EU membership funds will be used in the next few years on scientific activities through the framework programme."
"The size of this sum indicates how significant the matter in question now is."
"Codecision procedure removes power from the Commission and brings it to Parliament."
"In this matter it is particularly well-founded."
"There are good grounds to support Mr Caudron' s model on programme coordination and administration as well as informing and listening to Parliament in decision-making at levels more detailed than that of the framework programme."
"The primary research areas selected by the Commission are well-founded as are also Parliament' s complementary priorities, which are not all mere information technology and artificial intelligence."
"The health of a human being depends on what he eats."
"It is justified to use funds to research the whole of the food chain."
"The new biotechnology involves the ethical foundations of all kinds of life, and therefore technology must also be complemented by results from human sciences."
"Science must not be dependent on the ethics of big corporations, and that is why it must receive public funding."
"When the health of the environment depends greatly on energy production, several adjustments made by Parliament endeavour to improve the research into new forms of energy."
"It would be justified to direct more funds into the research of fusion energy than what the Commission is proposing."
"There is need to build a new Tokamak for the joint use of all Member States and Switzerland, Canada, Japan and Russia."
"When funding is cut, this important project is delayed, further delaying the opportunity to produce energy by fusion power, which even in the current circumstances is going to be postponed by as much as fifty years."
"When the framework programme was drawn up, not enough attention was paid to the activities of the Joint Research Centre of the EU."
"It will also use scientific resources."
"During the coming five-year period its position within the research community of the EU and its Member States must be clarified; research resources must not be wasted."
"Mr President, I should like to express concern at the Commission emphasis on large integration projects, which would impact badly on small community-based enterprises as promoted within the framework of rural development programmes and research in the agricultural and associated food sector."
"It is now clearly established that the EU-assisted programmes, such as Leader, have the potential to create sustainable employment in rural areas where more centralised programmes would have failed."
"I do not have the time to concentrate on the need for ongoing research in the food sector and the potential of new technology in improving product diversification, quality and consumer satisfaction."
"How soon can we expect a clear and definitive view on the potential or otherwise of genetic research as applied to practical farming?"
"Delays in this area are leading to confusion on the part of consumers and may well be depriving European agriculture of the tools necessary for sustainability, quality and competitiveness."
"What have we learned from the recent scares such as foot-and-mouth and BSE?"
"Will we know what to do to avoid a repetition of the demoralising experience of a foot-and-mouth epidemic out of control?"
"Finally, and not for the first time, I want to express my concern about research on human embryos."
"This Parliament must exercise the most stringent controls in that area."
"Mr President, the Caudron report is threatening to become problematic from a Christian-ethical point of view."
"Controversial activities should not receive active support from the Union. Moreover, the community of values which, after all, the EU aspires to achieve, will definitely be at risk."
"Intervening in life created by God is non-negotiable."
"That must be the basic principle."
"In this light, the funding of research activities on surplus embryos with Community money cannot be justified in any way."
"Citizens would then be forced to contribute towards research which is punishable in a Member State such as Germany and which a number of national parliaments have declared themselves openly against."
"Neighbouring countries of a Member State which apply less stringent rules find themselves facing a related dilemma."
"A shift of European research to the relevant Member State undermines the effectiveness of the rules."
"A situation should not, however, arise in which ethical differences are exploited as a competitive factor."
"That could also lead to a brain drain."
"In this respect, the establishment of one European Research Area will function as a catalyst. That is why I make a serious appeal to you to support my amendments."
"They aim to prevent this."
"Europe must commit to finding a solution to this pending cross-border issue."
"Has the Commission looked into this?"
"Finally, within the research framework of cross-border problems, it is not funding but cooperation which deserves a central role."
"The funding of research into surplus embryos only complicates this cooperation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I fundamentally welcome the Commission's proposal for the Sixth Research Framework Programme, above all the Europe-wide coordination and the emphasis laid on basic research."
"Two points cause me concern."
"The first is that, when it comes to the definition of fundamental ethical principles, the mind of this House is divided between, on the one hand, banning embryo stem cell research outright and, on the other, permitting it."
"Where the boundary lies between a mere heap of cells and a human life is something we all no doubt have to decide for ourselves."
"It is a choice with far-reaching implications, one to be made on the basis of conscience."
"I would remind you, though, that research on embryo stem cells is prohibited in several Member States, including Austria."
"To use EU funds to finance research in one Member State which would be banned in another is unacceptable."
"The second thing that concerns me is that research funds totalling EUR 1.2 billion are being made available within the framework of the Euratom programme, over two-thirds of which go to nuclear research."
"Safety issues play only a subordinate role."
"I consider increased research into non-nuclear energy sources to be imperative."
"I regret that there is no reference to it in this report."
"- (EL) Mr President, the European Union's Sixth Framework Programme covers high-priority areas and areas of pioneering research from which we expect quantum leaps in science."
"I should like to draw your attention to the pioneering area of research into the human genome."
"This research is expected to have future applications in four areas of medicine: first, hereditary illnesses, secondly, the most common fatal illnesses, namely cancer, cardio-vascular and degenerative neural illnesses, thirdly, an understanding of the mechanics of various illnesses, which will lead to new, more efficient treatment and drugs and, fourthly, the prevention of disease."
"New knowledge about human genetics will help us understand at which points genetic dynamics are vulnerable and open to environmental factors and pressure and the way in which we live, thereby allowing us to develop new strategies for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of the illnesses which I have already mentioned."
"Stem cell research may well have new applications in treating illnesses such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, leukaemia and many others."
"However, the boundaries on research in these fields must be marked out if we are to avoid ethical problems."
"This was the point of the amendment which I tabled together with Mr Nisticò and Mr Purvis."
"This amendment will allow the pioneering research which I have described to progress while striking the balance needed in order to avoid ethical problems."
"So we can look forward to the beneficial medical applications which this research promises."
"I trust that the European Parliament will support the line being marked out and strike the right balance between progress and ethical considerations."
"Mr President, I would like thank the rapporteur for his good method of preparation, in which he has been willing to take into account colleagues' views."
"Several of us Members have been concerned about the possibilities of SMEs to participate in the framework programme, because the Commission' s original proposal does not make these opportunities concrete enough."
"The Commission proposes so-called horizontal activities, in which it will be very difficult for small and medium-size enterprises to participate, at least at the initial stages."
"Therefore it is necessary to make adjustments approved by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy to the direction that the already existing Craft programme arrangements will continue to take."
"The same applies to preparation funds."
"Enterprises have already become used to these measures, which have produced plenty of good results."
"Why should a good arrangement be abolished?"
"Amendment No 265 concerns this matter."
"A share of 15% funding from enterprises has been proposed."
"Also this fact must be made concrete in the actual guideline funding schedules, when decisions on them are made at a later stage."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his hard work and for the many additions to the Commission's proposals, particularly on health and disease and sustainable transport."
"However, this was undermined in committee by what Mr Van Velzen has already referred to as the joint result."
"The proposals on health and transport emerged very much weakened."
"Our citizens will want to know why we want to spend more on space research than on sustainable transport."
"It is not their priority."
"On ethics in biotechnology, the proposals allow funding of research into the alteration of the germline of human beings."
"This is unacceptable to mainstream science."
"The Greens have tabled an amendment which is congruent with the position of most researchers in the field and this must be supported."
"On stem cell research, the production of human embryos for research is unacceptable and it is very unacceptable to most of our citizens as well."
"The Temporary Committee on Human Genetics has come to very useful conclusions here and its report should have been taken before this debate."
"However, amendments have been tabled in line with its proposals and these must also be accepted by the House, otherwise we will be in deep conflict with our citizens."
"As regards GMOs and plant genetics, the proposals that were adopted in committee would put genetically-modified foods on our table and will be forced on European consumers, quite contrary to what many want."
"This is again a recipe for conflict and it was not in the Commission's proposals."
"Regarding energy, equivalent funding for renewables and nuclear is required."
"We have allocated over EUR 1 billion for nuclear funding and nowhere near the equivalent for renewable energy."
"This again is completely unacceptable to our citizens."
"If we are not to have a conflict between science and society, which the Commissioner has been very anxious to avoid, we will need to revise these priorities."
"For example, proposals on fusion are out of date."
"Both the US and Japan are pulling out of this research completely."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have before us a very important text, the substance of which will not only determine how the European Union applies research in practice, it will also set the tone for guidelines and practices in all the Member States, especially those like Greece which, to all intents and purposes, have no national research programme of their own."
"One of the weak points identified in research in the European Union is its poor application and yet the European Commission's proposed overall budget does not respond to the need for a bold increase in funding and, unfortunately, the Committee on Industry, despite proposing research activities, has not increased the budget."
"A second important point is orientation."
"The draft before us leaves little room for free research which may not bring in results which can be directly applied in practice but which helps to increase our knowledge and acts as a basis for future applications."
"This being so, we feel that the Committee on Industry's proposal to reduce expenditure on so-called priority 8 is not a move in the right direction."
"This does not, of course, mean that we disagree with the seven thematic priorities proposed."
"The third major issue is who is to benefit from funding."
"The structure of the proposed programme is such that it benefits companies, both directly and indirectly, because the guidelines are tailored to their needs."
"In our view, corporate research should be funded from company profits, not the public purse."
"We are also afraid that small research teams will have trouble finding funding, although the Committee on Industry's amendments will help here."
"One comment on the Euratom programme: whatever our reservations about the safety of nuclear fission, we need to be equally hopeful that the continuing debate will provide a long-term solution to the energy supply problem."
"From this point of view, I welcome the fact that the Committee on Industry has recommended an increase in funding for the ITER reactor."
"Finally, what worries me is that the so-called ethical issue has become much more important than it deserves and has even had a disorientating effect."
"Public funding for research is no way to resolve this sort of problem."
"It would be a serious oversight on my part if I failed to thank Commissioner Busquin and his staff and, of course, our rapporteur, Mr Caudron, and all the shadow rapporteurs on their tremendous work."
"Mr President, Mr Caudron and Mrs McNally both mentioned the fight against AIDS, TB and malaria."
"EUR 400 million have been set aside for this purpose, but the money appears in the budget under 'integration of European research' in Amendment No 339."
"Could the Commission please tell me whether this means that the money can only be spent in Europe or whether it is possible to use this money to finance the pan-African malaria vaccine-testing network, which, unlike the EU, is ready to test the malaria vaccine now?"
"If the EUR 400 million can only be spent in Europe, can the Commission tell me whether mainstreaming will make it possible to fund the African network?"
"If not, I would urge Mr Van Velzen to reconsider accepting an oral amendment to Amendment No 339, which would place the EUR 400 million under international activities."
"We are discussing a research programme which will end in 2006."
"By then, if we do not finance the pan-African network, more than 400 million people may have died in sub-Saharan Africa and in other poor countries, and more than 50 years of development policy efforts are likely to be ruined by then."
"This is extremely important, so even if Mr Van Velzen does not support this oral amendment, I hope that the plenary will."
"Thank you, Mr President, and I should also like to thank the rapporteur. The Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Development is of crucial importance for the Member States and for the Union as a whole."
"Research ought to be aimed at development."
"This is how we must follow up the declarations made at the Lisbon European Council. We were charged with turning the European Union into the most dynamic and successful economy in the world, whilst also aiming at full employment."
"After all, what use would research be if we did not make that our common aim?"
"In my view, the preparation and adoption of the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Development provides the ideal opportunity to implement this conclusion of the Lisbon Summit and to give substance to the European Charter for small enterprises. Enterprises play an important role in disseminating scientific innovation."
"I am therefore delighted that substantial resources, substantial compared to the immense requirements of other areas, have been devoted to growing businesses, especially small businesses and craft industries."
"We must support and encourage research and innovation in SMEs, and also facilitate access to the best technologies, including those of the traditional sector too."
"It will then be possible for the enterprises to respond to the challenge of full employment."
"I should, however, like to refer in particular to the biotechnology industry, to which we must pay special attention because it is involved with the science of living beings."
"Regardless of the stage of its development, no human being, whether an embryo or an adult, should ever be used as material with which to treat another human being."
"Funding research into embryo stem cells or supernumerary embryos would be contrary to the principle of human dignity. This principle is affirmed in several of the founding texts of the European Union and more recently, in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Furthermore, such research is now no longer required because encouraging results have been obtained through the use of adult stem cells to treat incurable diseases."
"Mr President, in line with Lisbon and Stockholm Summit declarations and with the report of this Parliament on the future of the biotech industry, the life sciences are a top priority of the Sixth Framework Programme."
"This priority is upheld in Mr Caudron's excellent report."
"Parliament must continue to be consistent and add its support to the progress which our scientists and researchers can provide."
"Yet as representatives of the people of Europe, we in this Parliament must also define the limits which will provide an appropriate ethical context for this progress."
"Genetic research promises much in preventing and curing many of man's most dreaded hereditary diseases."
"But genetic engineering for this purpose must not extend into eugenics."
"Embryo research must not lead to the deliberate creation of embryos for research, though we may accept that early stage supernumerary embryos genuinely resulting from in-vitro fertilisation, from spontaneous miscarriages or from therapeutic abortions for the mother's health, and which are destined for destruction in any case, can legitimately and ethically be available for research in Member States where there is strict regulation and supervision."
"The amendment submitted by Mr Trakatellis, Mr Nisticò and myself - No 333 - seeks to restrict and define more exactly than the existing text where these limits lie."
"I commend it to the Parliament."
"Mr President, I will start by saying something about money."
"The EUR 17.5 billion are in my view insufficient, above all when you consider the ambitious goals that Europeans are always setting themselves."
"It is certainly far too little when you consider the imminent enlargement of the European Union."
"These funds are one day to be invested for 25 or even more Member States, and that is not enough."
"That, though, is how things are these days."
"I hope in any case that the Council will approve at least these EUR 17.5 billion, or else, and here I agree with Mr van Velzen, there will be trouble."
"European research policy is very much seen in terms of participation in the research programmes."
"I want to vigorously urge the Commission to do everything possible to make the submission of applications and their processing easier, so that the researchers can spend their time on real research rather than on filling in forms."
"My third observation is on fusion."
"We wrangle about this over and over again, and I respect the different opinions that are held on the subject."
"The only thing I cannot accept is that this research will not bear fruit for a very long time."
"We urge the young to start early on providing for old age, even though, from a young person's point of view, old age is a long, long way away."
"We are talking here about the same sort of provision."
"Whether a fusion power station is eventually built or not, is for those who come after us to decide."
"We should, however, give them the option."
"I have always considered it very important that the European Union should concern itself with highly sensitive questions that had formerly been beyond our scope, for example, new methods of detecting and removing landmines."
"It is fortunate that we have had a programme of this sort within the European Union for a number of years, and it has achieved noteworthy successes."
"My heartfelt plea is that this programme should be continued, ambitiously developed and coordinated, if possible, by a single office within the Commission."
"I am thinking here of the Joint Research Centre, whose achievements to date deserve to be highlighted."
"An attempt is similarly being made, incidentally, to involve European Union research in the elimination of weapons of mass destruction, be they nuclear, biological or chemical."
"I would remind you that the Commission will be making a statement this afternoon about the banning of biological weapons, which has to do with the fight against terrorism."
"In the former Soviet Union, today, there are still enormous stockpiles of biological and chemical agents that cannot be destroyed for lack of the necessary funds and often also of the necessary technology."
"This is an opportunity for the European Union to do something for the security of Europe and of the world."
"As far as bioethics is concerned, I urge support for the proposal by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, which simply takes account of the different understandings of the law on this subject in the Member States, and we as European legislators cannot supplant the Member States on this point."
"Such a respect for sovereignty is reflected in this proposal."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to endorse the congratulations and words of thanks to Mr Caudron."
"Mr Busquin, the Sixth Framework Programme has the great ambition of establishing a European Research Area, and I truly hope that the small, yet excellent, research teams which we even have in the more peripheral regions will be able to play a role in this."
"In European research, we must take a step forward both qualitatively and quantitatively speaking."
"Female researchers must have a part to play in this and in the next few years, forge ahead to take up leading positions in the research programme."
"Research which attempts to solve the mysteries of life remains important. That is not only applied research, but also fundamental research."
"There is no doubt that bio-genetics will create new opportunities in future in the fight against incurable diseases, such as Alzheimer' s, Parkinson' s and some forms of cancer."
"Within the parameters set out in the Caudron report, particularly in Amendment No 22, and under strict ethical supervision, including that of parliaments, we are of the view that it must be possible to finance stem cell research within the Member States' legal framework."
"It is of the utmost importance for us to outline this ethical framework and for the European Parliament and the Member State parliaments to follow the developments in this field, for we must avoid at all cost that everything is allowed for some, as long as it is commercially viable, while nothing is allowed for others."
"We must be led by our conscience to jointly outline this framework, even if we fail to see eye to eye on this matter."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the Italian radical members unreservedly support the Caudron report and congratulate the rapporteur on bringing such a difficult and significant task to a successful conclusion."
"The task is significant because it opens new horizons for European research."
"This is sorely needed, because our research is stagnating, our continent and our Union are not at the cutting edge."
"By this, I mean scientific research and research in many other essential fields, not only scientific progress, but also employment, which are beneficial to the economy and to the progress of human kind."
"From this perspective, we are particularly pleased with the position adopted by the Committee on Industry regarding research into human genetics. Tremendous progress has been made everywhere and more is being achieved every day."
"Researchers and scientists are working away in laboratories. They are responsible individuals, not at all unbalanced, as many believe."
"They hope very soon to make it possible for untold millions of human beings to escape a dreadful fate. These people would then be able to resume a normal life and regain their dignity as human beings."
"Diseases such as Alzheimer' s, Parkinson' s, diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular disease constitute vast research areas still to be explored. I have in mind stem cell research in particular."
"The Caudron report presents us with this new challenge, which is dealt with in depth."
"Since Galileo, ever since time began in fact, scientific progress has always challenged the established order."
"Indeed, given that it ushers in a new order, the one previously in place is bound to collapse."
"Nonetheless, certain Members of this House have voiced their opposition to all this. They are trying to prevent what I believe is obvious progress."
"In any case, even if Parliament rules against the report, progress will continue."
"Clearly, millions and millions of human beings are at risk and threatened with death."
"There is, however, a strong chance that these new technologies could produce cures or improved treatments."
"This is why I say yes to the Caudron report, yes to the hope that European research may rise to the challenge presented by the United States and other world economies."
"With this in mind, we should invest in European research capable of taking our values to even greater heights. Our scientists must be allowed to work in the most promising domain possible, namely embryo stem cell research."
"Frankly speaking, this is the issue which will very shortly highlight the rift between us."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the future is at stake here. It cannot be held up because it is already upon us."
"Sooner or later it will overcome."
"Mr President, I want first to express my thanks for the exciting, inspiring and business-like work in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy."
"It has been a delight to participate in the work on the framework programme."
"I also want to thank Commissioner Busquin for the way in which he began the discussion with new ideas about the European Research Area."
"I have seen how the ideas floated by the Commissioner have taken root in the countries of the EU and created a new dynamic of a kind we had not known before and which I would to a large extent ascribe to the Commissioner' s initiative."
"I am very pleased about the opportunities under the framework programme also to involve countries which do not directly receive aid from the European Union, for example, even Iran and Taiwan can participate, to cite two extremes, if the countries themselves pay and if we find that they add value to the programmes."
"That means exchanges involving young people in areas that are important for the future."
"It provides the opportunity for new creativity and new understanding within research, something that will be very valuable, especially in the world of today."
"With regard to nuclear research, I believe that Europe should promote this in areas which can contribute to our actively participating in the elimination of weapons of mass destruction, weapons grade plutonium, etc."
"We have facilities."
"We have knowledge that can be made use of."
"The international mood today is such that there is now a possibility of having these things destroyed."
"Let us make sure that they are destroyed, and allow Europe to take part in their destruction."
"Finally, I hope that the Commissioner, together with his Director-General, will take the lead when it comes to the simplification that is necessary if small and medium-sized companies, together with university departments, are happily able to participate in the programme without experiencing financial difficulties."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for the Sixth Research Framework Programme is an ethical minefield."
"Amendment No 22, providing for Community funds for embryo research, is utterly unacceptable, being a flagrant offence against human dignity."
"Embryos must not be degraded to the level of being research material."
"Embryo research is banned in four Member States, including Germany."
"We must not permit the use of Community funds to finance something that is punishable in these Member States."
"Even research on embryo stem cells would offer an incentive to create even more surplus embryos, and we decisively reject it for that reason."
"The proposal even offers support to germline therapy."
"This would mean the European Parliament distancing itself, politically and scientifically, from the rest of the world, for nobody in the scientific community is demanding or promoting germline therapy, far from it, they are calling for it to be outlawed."
"So I ask you to let us clear these ethical mines from the research framework programme and make the programme we adopt a responsible one."
"Mr President, first of all I too should like to thank Commissioner Busquin and the rapporteur, Mr Caudron, for the excellent work that has been done with a view to the approval of this Sixth Research Framework Programme."
"This document is, I believe, so excellent and innovative that it is almost a sin that the debate in Parliament should concentrate on ethics and the use of stem cells, important though that issue may be, while losing sight of all the novel, highly significant elements present in this Sixth Framework Programme."
"I believe that identifying the eight priority thematic areas for research is an innovative, important and positive idea; there is, however, a danger that small and medium-sized European enterprises might be excluded from the identification of areas structurally more suited to large businesses."
"Mr Caudron' s proposal of the instrument of the stairways of excellence seems to me to be a valid compromise, and I therefore agree with it, although I still ask the Commission and the Commissioner always to pay the greatest attention to the requirements of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The danger that European research funds might end up being monopolised by large companies, which, by definition, are those that perhaps need them least since they patently already have the capacity to propose and run research programmes, is still very real."
"If, however, we wish to build that knowledge-based society that was sketched out in Lisbon, research must permeate our whole society and therefore impinge, first of all, on small and medium-sized European enterprises."
"Lastly, to conclude, a remark on the Euratom programme: I agree with the appropriations proposed in the report; we need to give the green light to the ITER project, which must not, however, be confused with the nuclear power schemes we know today."
"Here we are talking about research and the future of clean energy."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to thank Commissioner Busquin for his extraordinary commitment and for the enthusiasm he has managed to raise in the European Parliament for the creation of a European Research Area."
"I should also like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Caudron, as well as the shadow rapporteurs, Mr Van Velzen and Mrs McNally, for their contributions and the respect they have shown towards those individual Members who have sought to improve this framework programme with their amendments."
"The text originally proposed by the Commission has been considerably supplemented and rejigged, now both specifying more clearly the research priorities in Europe in the various sectors and rejigging the initial financial architecture."
"With regard to the biomedical sector, I must express my satisfaction with the EUR 500 million increase given to biomedicine, not just for genome and post-genome research but for all research aimed at adding to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms at the basis of diseases as well."
"I should like once again to affirm a fundamental idea already expressed by Mr Trakatellis, which is that no research in Europe can be more important or deserve greater priority than that which concerns people' s health and their physical and mental suffering."
"That is why I now ask Commissioner Busquin, on behalf of the whole scientific community and of a number of Nobel prize-winners, such as my friend Renato Dulbecco, Rita Levi Montalcini and John Vane, to maintain this increase in funding for biomedical research for the next five years."
"Through scientific research we can at last, thanks to new technologies, combat terrible, hitherto incurable diseases such as cancer, AIDS, Alzheimer' s, Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, heart disease and so on, not least by using advanced technologies, as specified, for instance, in the Trakatellis, Purvis and Nisticò amendment, which embodies a good balance that should gain the consensus of the whole House."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by thanking Gérard Caudron for his difficult work."
"As we might say in German, it is easier to guard a sack of fleas than draw together the different interests in this House, and I would therefore like to express my sincere thanks for his successful efforts in this regard."
"With the research framework programme, we want to make a contribution to enhancing the competitiveness of European industry."
"We want to underpin and support our European policies through research."
"However, we also want to bring research closer to citizens."
"I am pleased, therefore, that in this latter area, we have been able to make some improvement to the Commission's proposal through three important steps."
"As part of this process, it is important, in my view, for us to ensure that research complies with the principle of sustainable development as set out in Article 6 of the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Gothenburg Council Conclusions."
"We must bring ecological criteria into line with social and economic criteria, and so it is only right and proper that research should be subject to this principle too."
"This is reflected in a number of the amendments relating to energy and sustainable transport."
"I also think it is important, and necessary, to interconnect research and society, firstly by examining every research project to determine the effect of research on society: in other words, by carrying out technology impact assessments, and secondly, by actively including citizens in the research dialogue and strengthening this dialogue between research and society."
"It is only right and proper, in my view, for us to increase the available resources in this area."
"The third building block to bring research closer to citizens is undoubtedly to enhance the opportunities available to SMEs, universities and small research institutions for participation in this process, as they, of course, offer great potential for innovation, and many people, many Europeans, are involved."
"We must therefore ensure that the processes are simple, transparent and speedy, and above all, that those who are rejected also receive a response which signals that researchers are taken seriously."
"If we are able to realise these three dimensions: sustainability, dialogue between research and society, and an effective approach to SMEs, then, I am sure, research will find a place not only in the minds of Europeans, but also in their hearts."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to begin by thanking the Commissioner for his outstanding work."
"Of course, I would also like to thank our rapporteur, Mr Caudron, for his two excellent reports."
"I would like to express my appreciation of the positive and constructive cooperation within the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy as well."
"I too found this a very enjoyable experience, thanks, not least, to the sterling work carried out by our shadow rapporteur."
"I would like to raise two issues."
"Firstly, genetic research: genetic and biotechnology offer great opportunities in medicine and the environment, and it is certainly right to give massive support to these areas at European level."
"However, as soon as human embryos become the subject of research, I believe that for ethical reasons, clear limits must be set."
"Some Member States, including Germany, have banned the use of human embryos for research purposes, and this naturally includes associated activities such as the cloning of human life."
"I think that our consideration and respect for other Member States make it incumbent on us to exclude activities which obviously raise serious issues of ethical responsibility from joint European research funding, and I therefore urge this House to vote for Mr Posselt's Amendment No 334 or Mr Liese's Amendment No 332."
"The second issue which I would like to address briefly is fusion research."
"I wish to voice my clear support for the funding of fusion research."
"I believe that nuclear fusion can be developed as a future-proof technology."
"It produces virtually no carbon dioxide emissions which impact on climate."
"It also produces very little in the way of radioactive waste, and in particular, in contrast to nuclear fission, has no significant harmful effects over the long term."
"In this respect, we Europeans should take the opportunity afforded in this area, in which we have a unique status worldwide - to continue appropriate research. We should not cut the budget but leave it, at least, at the level originally proposed."
"Mr President, as someone who suffers from a neurological complaint, to wit Parkinson's disease, I am naturally biased in this matter, but I am a little shocked by the frequent use of terms like 'unacceptable' and 'dignity' applied to people who wish to find a solution through medical research to the terrible problems facing those who suffer from neurological disease, such as Alzheimer's, motor neurone and Parkinson's."
"There is no dignity in dying of motor neurone disease and there is precious little dignity in suffering from Parkinson's either."
"So I want to commend to the House the view of the sufferer as well as the view - if there is to be one - of the person who is concerned above all about preserving the embryo."
"If I thought that an embryo had the same human rights as a child or an adult human being, I would not, of course, not be in favour of anything that meant the destruction of human life."
"But the laws of our Member States by and large accept that there is a difference between an embryo, a fertilised egg and an adult or child who is already a human being."
"The human rights of the one are not quite the same as the human rights of the other."
"That is what the law says in most of our Member States."
"I do not believe that the founder of the Christian religion, who set great store by healing the sick, would inhibit those who simply want to cure sick people."
"I cannot believe that this is the intention of the Christian ethic."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to begin, of course, by congratulating the rapporteur Mr Caudron."
"I know from experience how much work is involved in bringing a framework programme to a conclusion, at least in draft form."
"We will now formally adopt this programme today or tomorrow."
"It is a time for great words, and great words are needed."
"I would also like to take this opportunity to express my thanks for the cooperation with the Commission."
"Paper does not blush, however."
"We will have a good programme, but the work is only just beginning."
"What are we going to do with all these objectives set out on paper?"
"How will we achieve these goals?"
"At the moment, this is written not so much in the stars as in the heads of the civil servants or, indeed, the Commissioner."
"We therefore urgently need more precise details of this entire project."
"We urgently need the specific programmes."
"That is the first point."
"We also urgently need further cooperation with the Commission if these specific programmes have to be amended by this House."
"The second point is this: there is no sense in allocating EUR 17, 18, 16 billion - the figure has not yet been finally decided - if these funds are not used where they are most needed, that is, in the universities, in industry, and in the SMEs."
"It is therefore vital to ensure that the rules governing participation in this framework programme are practicable, in line with the realities of the research world, and meet the needs of companies seeking to develop their innovations on the basis of this funding."
"After all, we should not forget that research and innovation are not ends in themselves."
"The purpose of research and innovation is to bring products to market and improve our competitiveness."
"This can only be achieved if there are significant levels of participation, if the allocation instruments are transparent, and if everyone, from Finland to Sicily and Greece, knows what his or her position is."
"The real work therefore starts here, not only for the Commission staff but also for us."
"After the framework programme means before the next framework programme, but, above all, it means during implementation."
"This House must therefore look very closely to determine how much continuity exists between the Fifth and Sixth Framework Programmes, how reliable the instruments used by the Commission are, and how this money is spent."
"We will also carry out an ex post audit."
"Thank you very much. I look forward to further years of cooperation."
"Mr President, I am in favour of research."
"We all want to find cures for illness and I am sure that in each of our families we have personally experienced the sadness of incurable disease."
"Over the past year in the Temporary Committee on Human Genetics and Other New Technologies we discussed various ways of finding answers to these medical problems."
"We voted last week to support the funding of uncontroversial stem-cell research using placenta, umbilical cord and adult stem cells."
"We voted with cross-party support to ban funding of research resulting in the destruction of human embryos, any kind of cloning, the use of surplus embryos and germline intervention."
"The majority, therefore, in the temporary committee, whose aim it was to draw up ethical guidelines for the European Union, rejects the research funding suggested in the Caudron report."
"EU funding should not be promoted for controversial research, banned in four Member States, my own country included."
"Respect for the dignity of the human person is a fundamental principle upheld in all European and international agreements."
"I urge that we do not desert this principle."
"Many citizens, myself included, believe that there is a more acceptable, ethical and moral way forward than the one which leads us to destroy one innocent human life in order to cure another."
"I urge you to reject the funding suggested in the Caudron report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, research policy is one of the areas in which we clearly need more involvement by Europe."
"Munich is one of the most modern locations for research in the European Union, and Franz Josef Strauss set a course 30 years ago which has ensured that there is still an aerospace industry today."
"As a location for research, Munich has never suffered from the fact that research policy has always set clear ethical limits."
"On the contrary, these clear ethical limits include banning research on embryo stem cells, the import of embryo stem cells and the creation of embryos for research purposes, for such techniques are nothing but cannibalism."
"Even if human life is saved through the killing of other human life, I believe this is ethically unacceptable."
"It is cannibalism."
"I am delighted that in all its decisions since 1988, since the Ghergo report, the European Parliament has adhered to this position by a clear majority and that the German Bundestag's Study Commission adopted this line, also with a clear majority, on Monday evening, referring in this context to the Fiori report which we adopted last week by a substantial majority in our Committee on Human Genetics."
"I think it would be most regrettable if this important, high-quality research framework programme were associated with any attempt to undermine the European Parliament's clear ethical line on embryo protection and the protection of human life."
"I urge to you to vote for the Scallon/Posselt amendment, and if this is not adopted, to support the Liese/Fiori compromise amendment and reject all the other amendments on this issue."
"The European Parliament's reputation is at stake: a reputation associated with its position, for more than 10 years, at the forefront of those who strive to protect human life."
"Mr President, the sixth framework research programme is a serious and fundamental attempt by the European Union to achieve its strategic objectives, that is, to become the most competitive knowledge-economy based area in the world over the next ten years."
"It will also help it to benefit from progress being made in other corners of the world, while helping it to contribute towards the development of mankind."
"We all have to meet this challenge, at both European and national level. This means bold funding for research in all sectors, coordinating research at European level, in contrast to the current fragmentary approach, and disseminating it throughout the economic and social fabric."
"Our success in achieving our political and development objectives will depend directly on how we use the results of research for the benefit of the health and quality of life of our citizens, full employment and social cohesion."
"I should like to focus on the need for research in the social sector."
"Our development depends first and foremost on the viability of our social model."
"The social agenda which we have adopted and are currently applying is the basis for this policy."
"Economic and social change has led our economy and society into an impasse."
"Ageing, widespread poverty and social exclusion, large numbers of accidents at work, the need to successfully integrate large groups of citizens such as the Roma, the need to integrate the disabled into the job market, the constant need to help women enter the job market, new risks to employees' health and our increasingly multicultural society in Europe are such that we need scientific research on which to base our policy over coming years."
"This will encourage European countries with no tradition of social research, which are the very countries which face the worst development problems."
"Finally, I should like to stress the need for public information and consultation on all our research objectives."
"Research in all sectors, from biotechnology to social research, is carried out a long way from the ground, in closed laboratories or study firms."
"Our citizens are unable to read the articles not just in scientific journals, but also in the broadsheets."
"We need to make an effort to ensure that information is provided on a systematic basis."
"Mr President, the report and the framework programme have been extensively modified since they were first presented to this Parliament."
"Citizens should be aware of this extensive transformation, so that they can see the good cooperation between the institutions."
"I think that this is due, to a large extent, to Mr Caudron' s flexibility and capacity to listen, and this is also true of rapporteurs from other political parties, such as Mr Van Velzen, who has been listening throughout and welcoming the amendments and various suggestions from all Members."
"I have never worked in a committee where all requests have been treated in this way and incorporated."
"I would like this spirit to be maintained throughout the implementation process, because it is clear that this is a European project that needs to continue growing and expanding."
"I also have to say that this journey has been carried out on the basis of a policy that aims to reduce work, reduce the work of the committee and to create fewer projects, but larger ones, and Parliament has been able to break down this centrality with regard to large projects, large companies and various research programmes that are essentially covering work that on many occasions is quasi-public with regard to the large research centres or large industries, such as the aeronautical industry."
"Parliament has been able to open this project up in more directions, extending its range of priorities to territories that, up until now, were not covered or that were not considered important."
"There are various innovations which citizens should be aware of: one of these, the most important one in my opinion, is the introduction of a fourth instrument."
"Introducing a fourth instrument means opening the door to smaller projects, facilitating the entry of SMEs and making the European Research Area a possibility, for Europe comprises many small States and Research Centres."
"The average European team has no more than six people, whilst an American team consists of 24 people."
"Europe needs protection measures and incentives that are suited to its dimensions."
"Europe is still a collection of individual initiatives."
"For this very reason, the escalier d' excellence seems to be very effectively set out in Amendment No 305."
"We have also introduced important aspects of relevance to culture."
"Cultural heritage belongs to the world of non-renewable resources."
"When the tomb of a mediaeval King disappears, with its costumes and clothing, or when we lose track of a wrecked ship at the bottom of the sea, new technologies have to be used to recover these relics."
"Architecture, engineering, the structure of buildings, are all in the realm of science."
"We have supported the safeguarding of cultural heritage and we think that the European Union should also continue to do so."
"Mr President, honourable Members, we have reached a critical point in the process of adopting our new framework programme on Research."
"The European Parliament' s opinion at first reading does indeed constitute a milestone along our way."
"I would like to add my voice to those who have congratulated Mr Caudron, the rapporteur."
"I should like to say to him in all sincerity that the quality of the report and the spirit with which he has imbued it, the energy and the work he has put in are all exemplary in the context of such a difficult task."
"As Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl pointed out, it was a complex task but Mr Caudron brought it to a successful conclusion and I would particularly like to thank him for that."
"I also wanted to emphasise that this work was the product of a joint effort and the shadow rapporteurs from other groups were involved in this."
"I shall not name individuals but I am sure you are all aware of those who have made a constructive contribution to the task in hand over the last few months, as I mentioned earlier."
"I have in mind also, of course, the rapporteurs of the various committees and obviously, the ITER Committee as a whole, and its Secretariat. They were also involved in the work."
"I do believe that what we have before us is a high quality joint endeavour."
"In this connection, you will be aware that a number of amendments have been tabled."
"I shall not attempt to outline the Commission' s position on each individual one because I would need the floor for two hours."
"You will find the relevant information in an exhaustive table to be lodged with Parliament' s clerk immediately."
"Generally speaking, I should like to emphasise that the Commission has widely supported the opinions of the ITER Committee. It is a statistical operation and could perhaps be queried."
"In fact, however, out of the 334 amendments the Commission has accepted 248 as they stand, in part or in principle."
"That equates to three-quarters."
"You will be able to study the explanations given for each amendment, and the reasons why others cannot be accepted. This can be because they are already there in the proposal."
"It is important to be aware of that."
"I would therefore simply like to present to you the Commission' s positions on major issues as defined in the context of the amendments adopted by the ITER."
"I shall refer to the structure of the framework programme, its scientific and technological content, the instruments for its implementation, the overall budget and its distribution, and the ethical issue."
"In conclusion, I shall say a few words on the management of the programme, because, as we have emphasised, this is clearly the key issue."
"As regards the structure of the framework programme as a whole, the Commission shares Parliament' s views as expressed in Amendment No 36 tabled originally by Mr van Velzen."
"I am delighted that Parliament and the Commission are of a single mind concerning the concept of a single specific programme for all the main thematic areas. This should result in multidisciplinary coherence and a strategic vision of research in Europe."
"The arrangement also allows for Parliament to closely monitor the implementation."
"Each of the eight priorities will in fact have a separate budgetary line on which Parliament will be able to exercise its budgetary control."
"With regard to the scientific and technological content, most of the amendments, namely Amendment Nos 30 to 294, relate to the scientific content."
"We wish to signal our agreement with a series of suggestions by Parliament concerning priority numbers 2 'Information society technologies' , 3 'Nanotechnologies' , 4 'Aeronautics' , and 7 'Citizens in the European knowledge-based society' ."
"We have in mind for instance Mrs Schroeder' s amendments concerning respect for privacy in the field of information technologies, and also the Committee on Employment' s amendments on research to support the Lisbon objectives."
"Most notably, the Commission agrees to reorganise the content of priorities 1 'Genomics and health' , 5 'Food safety' , and 6 'Sustainable development' , along the lines suggested by Parliament."
"As regards priority 1, namely broadening the scope to include the study of the genomes of all living organisms and strengthening the elements of medical research, particularly regarding cancer, in two separate sections along the lines suggested by Mr van Velzen and particularly in the spirit of Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines' and Mr Caudron' s amendments, we can accept all that is involved."
"I should also like to respond to Mrs Sandbaek' s comments on poverty-related diseases and immunisation against AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. Clearly, provision has already been made for this, as Mrs McNally pointed out."
"Such provision is within the framework of international policy, and the technological platform for AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis is exactly in line with the spirit of Mrs Sandbaek' s question. That question had indeed already been dealt with."
"As regards priority 5, the agricultural research aspects linked to food safety will be strengthened, in keeping with a number of the amendments suggested by the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on Fisheries."
"Mr Pietrasanta' s and Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl' s amendments will also be taken into account in priority 5: Food safety"
"Priority 6 will be restructured as suggested by Mr Caudron, Mr Lange, Mr Hyland and Mr van Velzen. There will be three distinct sections encompassing issues related to the environment, transport and energy."
"Renewable energy will, of course, be included in the chapter on energy. A number of specific aspects of various forms of renewable energy will be emphasised."
"The Committee on the Environment and the Committee on Transport also expressed themselves in favour of a change of this nature."
"The sustainable development priority will therefore be subdivided into three sections dealing with these three aspects."
"Before turning to more general points, I should add that the Commission also accepts or takes into consideration a number of amendments concerning both content and general policy."
"By way of example I could refer to Mr Glante' s amendment on the involvement of the candidate countries, Mrs McNally' s amendment excluding research into weapons and Mr Linkohr' s amendment on research linked to security matters which could be dealt with under the title of research into emerging themes and in the framework of the Joint Research Centre."
"We also have small and medium sized enterprises very much in mind. Mr Rovsing and Mr Carraro quite rightly reminded us of their role this morning."
"Clearly, small and medium sized enterprises will have a specific role to play in the next framework programme."
"As regards the instruments, the Commission broadly endorses the approach enshrined in Parliament' s amendments."
"The basic thought is indeed to make it possible for the more classical instruments currently in place to be used alongside the new, more integrating instruments for a specific period."
"That was in fact what Mrs McNally proposed."
"Hence the Commission' s suggestion in its proposal on the rules of involvement, to resort to specific targeted actions and coordination actions under the heading of the stairway of excellence envisaged by Mr Caudron, the rapporteur."
"The proposal will be in line with at least the spirit of this idea of a stairway of excellence."
"Nonetheless, it is essential for the new instruments to remain the main priority tools for implementing this part of the framework programme. Only through their structuring effect will a genuine European Research Area become a reality."
"Concerning the Budget, I should like to thank the Parliament for having gritted its teeth and demonstrated budgetary realism by remaining within the limits of the Commission' s proposal. In real terms this represents a 17% increase as against the overall budget for the previous framework programme."
"I think I already mentioned how significant this is inasmuch as the figures proposed by the Commission were arrived at following a needs assessment and in the light of the financial perspective and the possibilities provided under heading 3 of the internal budget policies."
"We believe that the Member States will adopt this same approach at Council as it is a logical, coherent and reasonable way forward."
"As for Parliament' s proposal to increase the global envelope by EUR 100 million, that is not a substantial additional amount."
"Nevertheless, we feel we should retain the decisions already taken, in order to avoid inter-institutional trading."
"The Commission therefore wishes to retain the initial global position of EUR 17.5 billion in the interests of interinstitutional consistency."
"We shall then have to consider how to deal with the fusion issue."
"In connection with the latter, it would be wise to demonstrate flexibility when interpreting the principle of reserved use of EUR 200 million for ITER."
"All activities relating to ITER are, in fact, concerned, not simply with the construction of the machine. In this way it will be possible to maintain the potential for present and future research."
"It would also be wise to interpret fusion in an even more positive manner."
"I have taken Mr Linkohr' s image on board with pleasure."
"It is however the case that in the next twenty years very interesting research will be conducted also on materials and on how to effect magnetic confinement. This will be in addition to still more wide-ranging research, going beyond fusion and relevant to the development of new technologies in a whole range of other sectors."
"This therefore is the type of presentation we are aiming at. Furthermore, it is in line with what was voted for at the ITER Committee."
"I should now like to say in this connection, that jointly with the Member States, the Commission will set up a working group charged with setting targets in the less distant future, taking 2020 as a guide."
"This is a long way off, but in a sense 2020 is also quite close."
"Such an initiative would bear considerable fruit too. Indeed, a number of Member States broadly supportive of the 2020 end date for material essential to fusion put just such a proposal to Council."
"As for distribution of the framework programme budget allocation, the Commission will support the general direction of the guidelines proposed by Parliament."
"This follows almost inevitably from the Commission' s acceptance of the amendments to content."
"Clearly, if we accept amendments to content in certain areas we must, of course, fund them."
"When research extends to areas which were not anticipated at the outset, the budget must, of course, keep in step, otherwise it will fall to a critical level."
"Nonetheless, the scope of the adjustments we envisage is less extensive than what Parliament proposed."
"This is so as not to go beyond real needs insofar as they can be calculated, but also so as not to completely starve of resources the activities under the so-called eighth priority."
"Additional information is called for and we shall provide it."
"Why not risk depriving these activities of resources?"
"The reason is that such activities are of considerable significance."
"In particular, they concern research relevant to the reform of the common agricultural policy. This is one of the major aims of Community policy."
"It is important in itself and increasingly so in the context of enlargement. Also involved are the implementation of policy on fisheries and the epidemiological aspects of public health, security and justice."
"These are all issues which cannot be dealt with appropriately under the heading of other priorities. The latter are more specific and come under what could be described as more clearly targeted research programmes."
"This represents a field of action, an effort to support research and development areas related to community policies. Adequate funding must be made available."
"I also have in mind Mr Verheugen' s call for support for all policies relating to enlargement, notably in the area of life sciences."
"With regard to ethics, we did consider the amendment adopted by the ITER committee in the report drawn up by Mr Caudron."
"We are quite prepared however, to consider the amendments tabled at plenary."
"This is indeed a sensitive issue. The text the Commission proposes to insert into the decision specifically excludes from Community funding research aimed at creating human embryos purely for research purposes or in order to create stem cells."
"This is in addition to excluding research into human reproductive cloning, and research aimed at modifying the human genetic heritage."
"As I understand them, these amendments are also intended to exclude the transfer of cell nuclei amongst other processes."
"I refer to the amendments tabled by Mr Nisticò, Mr Trakatellis and Mr Purvis."
"I trust I am not trying your patience."
"I should like to make two last points. Firstly, coordination has not been given the importance it deserves."
"Mrs Maes, I do believe that the coordination of national programmes is a key element in the construction of a genuine European Research Area, and I mean national and regional programmes."
"You will be aware that we issued a communication on 'regions and research' , and EUR 400 million will be allocated to it."
"This may be used to support coordination activities, particularly in a number of clearly identified areas to which several of Parliament' s amendments refer."
"I can tell you for instance that childhood diseases and diabetes are now included under the framework of coordination of national policies. I have in mind the amendment tabled by Mr Nisticò, Mr Fiori and Mr Bowis."
"The same applies to seismic risk, with Mr Caudron' s and Mr Nisticò' s amendments, to fossil fuels and maybe also to ecosites and Mr Piétrasanta' s amendment."
"I am not however sure that the latter will be adopted."
"Clearly, there is action with regard to coordination of national policies."
"I shall now refer to management."
"The management of framework programmes has come in for criticism and rightly so. The Court of Auditors is one of these critics."
"In particular, it had criticised the complexity of management."
"We are therefore firmly committed to a single aim in this regard: to simplify management for the scientific community, and for small and medium sized enterprises."
"Simplifying, however, also means limiting constraints and accepting a degree of flexibility out of regard for public money and the observations made by the Court of Auditors."
"We shall therefore prepare the proposal."
"We have taken the initiative with the new instruments."
"In particular, the issue of rules of participation is very important and you will be called upon to determine them."
"I should say to Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl that we are currently engaged in a debate on these rules with the players in the scientific community, enterprises and Parliament."
"That is our next task."
"In conclusion, I should like to thank Parliament. I believe an important task has been concluded."
"As a result, it will now be possible for us to move towards the European Research Area that I am sure we are all aiming to create."
"Thank you for your work and for your contribution."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you for your speech, Commissioner Busquin."
"I believe everybody here would like to thank you just as warmly for the very proper manner in which you have conducted your relations with our institution."
"Mr President, since the Commissioner has now indicated that he will be adopting so many of Parliament' s amendments, I have one pertinent question for the Commissioner."
"Does that also mean that you will now first be fine-tuning the specific programmes which you have drafted earlier before they can be discussed in Parliament?"
"Obviously, it follows that in the next few days specific programmes will be adjusted to bring them into line with any amendments adopted."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"EU/Latin America relations"
"The next item is the report (A5-0336/2001) by Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on a global partnership and a common strategy for relations between the European Union and Latin America [2000/2249(INI)]."
"Mr President, on a point of order, I would like to bring to your attention, and I hope this will not take up part of my speaking time, that I have received no news relating to the absence of the Commissioner responsible, Mr Patten."
"I was wondering whether the presidency had received any news of his absence and if it could provide any information."
"I cannot see the Commissioner here, which is very strange because he always comes to debates on foreign policy when he can."
"I would like to know whether the presidency or the Commission have any information that justifies, as will surely be the case, the absence of the Commissioner responsible, Mr Patten."
"Mr Salafranca, from the point of view of the presidency I cannot answer your question."
"The Commission is, however, present in the person of Commissioner Bolkenstein, who will, of course, speak on behalf of the Commission at the end of the debate."
"I do not know whether Commissioner Bolkenstein intends to answer your question straight away."
"Commissioner."
"Mr President, my colleague, Mr Patten, is at present in New York attending the General Assembly of the United Nations."
"I hope that Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra will take this as sufficient apology for his absence and that he will be happy with the answers I give him and other Members in the debate that follows."
"I shall certainly do my best."
"Thank you, Commissioner Bolkenstein."
"I think Mr Salafranca, like the rest of us, has been given a clear and satisfactory answer."
"Mr President, I would like to thank both yourself and also Mr Bolkestein for his kindness and his cooperation."
"I naturally understand the reasons he has given for Mr Patten' s absence."
"As you all know, the Heads of State and Government of the European Union, some time ago, in June 1999, decided to form a strategic global partnership between the European Union and Latin America."
"More than two years have passed since that date and the truth of the matter is that we have to admit that no great progress has been made in reaching this objective set by the Heads of State and Government."
"This, Mr President, is precisely the reason why the European Parliament has wanted not only to discuss, but also to adopt an own-initiative report in order to add fuel to the debate on the next summit, the second of the Heads of State and Government, which will take place next spring, and present a document that could offer a strategic vision with regard to these relations, in order that the European Union will not arrive at this summit empty handed, at least with regard to the responsibility of our institution."
"I would like, in the first instance, to praise the spirit of cooperation that the political groups have shown me during the production of this report, which has been approved by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy by an overwhelming majority (48 votes for, 0 against and 2 abstentions)."
"I would also like to thank the committees who were asked to give their opinion for their cooperation."
"In this report, Mr President, we are asking for something of fundamental importance: that is that, just as the European Union has a common strategy for relations with Russia, with the Balkans, with non-EU countries in the Mediterranean or with the Ukraine, it should also have a common strategy for relations with the countries of Latin America."
"This strategy, Mr President, in my opinion, should involve three aspects: in the political sphere, a revision and updating of the biregional agenda; secondly, a renewal and updating of political dialogue at ministerial level; and thirdly, the constitution of a transatlantic, Euro-Latin American assembly, through the signing of a Euro-Latin American charter for peace and the implementation of a Euro-Latin American political and security partnership."
"In the economic, financial and commercial field, Mr President, we think that the European Union should complete the agreements that are currently under negotiation with Mercosur and Chile."
"These agreements need to be concluded in a balanced fashion and, naturally, as quickly as possible, depending on their own merits."
"We think that there can be no distinction, at least from the European Union' s point of view, between first- or second-class countries or groups of countries."
"For this reason, we are asking the Commission, in the medium term, to put forward some negotiation guidelines with the aim of reaching new agreements with the Andean Community and with the countries in Central America."
"I am talking, Commissioner, about the short and medium term, given that in the short term we believe, here in the European Parliament, that the facilities granted by the Community Generalised System of Preferences have to be maintained."
"In the same respect, Mr President, we are asking for the implementation of a global interregional association agreement that can give institutional support and total geographical coverage in relations with the subcontinent, in order, amongst other things, not to be second rate when compared with the developments that are being made in the United States."
"We are also requesting the creation of an area of shared prosperity through the strengthening of regional markets between now and the year 2010."
"I would like to add, Mr President, that it is a shame that there should only be one country in Latin America which, although we have diplomatic relations with it and apply the Community Generalised System of Preferences to it, is not linked to the European Union by means of an agreement."
"I am, naturally, referring to Cuba."
"For this reason I think that - in the spirit of the doctrine of the European Union in general and in the spirit previously adopted by this Parliament in the Newens report in particular, we should seek a formula which, within the framework of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, would allow us to progress in order to find an institutional formula in our relations with this country."
"In the social and cultural field, Mr President, we are proposing an emphatic and ambitious development cooperation policy in the social, culture, education, emigration, internal affairs and justice fields, with a whole series of concrete initiatives, that I will not explain here right now for lack of time."
"Mr President, I believe, and I think that my fellow Members believe the same, that the commitments made at the Rio Summit and the whole strategy formulated around the new commitment with Latin America should take shape as quickly as possible and give a strong impetus to relations with this region, although this should not be done to the detriment of economic sectors and the civil society."
"The next summit of Heads of State and Government will have to result, in our opinion, in a palpable success, sending a clear message with regard to this new European commitment with Latin America."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra on his clear and comprehensive report."
"It is indeed time for the European Union to revise its strategy on relations with Latin America."
"There is still a great deal of room for improvement, especially in the field of economic cooperation, and for us Socialists, this also includes Cuba, a country with which we must finally commence negotiations on a framework agreement, without any preconditions."
"Economic cooperation must include and take account of appropriate social and ecological minimum standards; after all, we do not want to worsen the social inequalities in Latin America but help to defuse them, for these countries are still marked by massive variations in social conditions."
"There are wealthy industrialised enclaves surrounded by regions with crippling poverty."
"We therefore also call, in the field of structural development, for measures to achieve sustainable economic development which promote SMEs in particular."
"Above all, wherever it is necessary and appropriate, the groups concerned and civil society, especially indigenous ethnic groups, must be included from the planning stage onwards."
"This applies especially to the Puebla Panama project."
"The European Union should only participate in this project on the basis of clearly defined substantive agreements."
"Technology and knowledge transfer, but also the opening of the European market to the partner countries' products, are further steps which must be taken quickly."
"This House wants an equal economic partnership with the citizens of Latin America, not just with a handful of major corporations."
"Mr President, the terrorist attacks of 11 September have finally brought it home to us that global crises have global consequences and that the European Union can no longer afford any eurocentrism."
"This does not mean downgrading the importance of EU enlargement and the stabilisation of the Balkans; it simply means that the Rio process must not suffer the same fate as the Barcelona process or the policies on the Mediterranean."
"It should not take a terrorist attack for us to give relations with these marginal areas of Europe or the Latin American region, a region which has strong historical and demographic links with Europe, the attention they deserve."
"The European Parliament's own-initiative report by Mr Salafranca is therefore timely, coming as it does in advance of the Rio follow-up summit in Madrid in May next year."
"We need to develop a strategy and give greater priority to our policies on Latin America at every level in order to combat poverty on this continent, consolidate democracy, tackle organised crime and drug trafficking, and, finally, to protect our economic interests."
"The conclusion of the association agreement with Mexico has had a positive impact on the European business presence in that country, which has benefited both sides."
"The association agreement with Chile will, we hope, be signed in Madrid in May."
"Unfortunately, the negotiations with Mercosur are not progressing as smoothly. I hope that in this context, the Commission and the European Parliament will do their utmost to overcome the hurdles concerning Argentina and Brazil."
"Free trade is not a one-way street, and more or less concealed protectionism should be a thing of the past."
"We must also increase awareness of the Latin American region."
"The establishment of a Centre for European and Latin American Studies would be a welcome step."
"What Latin America needs, however, are not only association agreements but general strategies to promote an investment-friendly climate, and this can only be achieved if there is political stability and an end to capital flight."
"Not every dollar earned should be transferred directly to Miami."
"Mr President, the Salafranca report comes at an opportune moment."
"The implementation of a global partnership and common strategy with Latin America, driven by Europe, is something that has always been worthwhile, but now more than ever, since 11 September, when international relations are clearly in a state of upheaval."
"This strategy and partnership driven by Europe comes at a time when a partner, in a different region, is going through difficult times, of which we are all aware."
"However, as Europeans, we should have clearly defined ideas."
"The partner to which I am referring will get through its bad patch over time and will once again turn its attention to Latin America."
"It has a right to do this, but Europe has values and interests that are not always the same as those of the United States."
"We only have to mention the mere existence of Mercosur or Alca or, simply, the different positions we maintain with regard to areas such as the death penalty or the Permanent Court of International Justice."
"With regard to the objectives of the common strategy that have been mentioned, it is laudable, of course, to aim for the implementation of a Euro-Latin American area of peace and stability, in addition to the signing of a peace charter, a task that in my opinion would be difficult to achieve, but not as difficult as reaching equivalent objectives, such as those sought by the Barcelona process for Euro-Mediterranean cooperation, whose execution has not so far made it possible to solve the Middle East conflict."
"On the other hand, I applaud the intention of sharing prosperity through the creation of a free trade area by 2010, or thereabouts."
"However, I would like to allude once more to the Barcelona process in order to warn that the process that we are hoping to achieve for Latin America should take account of inequalities, that is to say, the different economic weight of the partners, because this could lead to trade being free for all, in theory, but, in practice, being subjected to the most onerous of burdens, that is to say, true inequality that as we all know can be widespread throughout Latin America."
"This could mean that our supposed free trade will become nothing more than a slogan."
"So, if our intention is to create a partnership between members who are supposed to be equal, when it is obvious that they are not, it is important that we can resort to a fundamental instrument."
"I am referring to a genuine development cooperation policy, which is the only thing that can minimise, although I fear this will not happen before 2010, the enormous socioeconomic differences that exist today between the European Union and Latin America and even between Latin American partners themselves."
"Lastly, I would like to remind the ultra-liberals that not only is development aid compatible with free trade, but that it requires it, except when free trade is understood to be solely based upon cynical and even cruel inequalities."
"On occasions, decent trade is not possible without efficient and transparent development cooperation providing the basis for a free, but fair, game."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can only express my hearty congratulations to Mr Salafranca on the thorough work he has done."
"It is true that to give real substance to all that was decided in Rio de Janeiro by the first Summit between Heads of State and Government of the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean, the solemn declarations must be made concrete by transforming them into facts, strategies and opportunities that can give new life to the dialogue between the European Union and Latin America."
"We should not be surprised, then, that the Salafranca report states firmly that the only way the European Union can establish a genuine, bi-regional strategic partnership is to launch a new joint strategy with force and determination, and that the best time to do so may be precisely at the Madrid Summit in May 2002."
"It is right, therefore, to lay the foundations straight away and to find the simplest instruments that can be most readily understood by the citizens of both the European Union and South America."
"The creation of a single EU-Latin American Transatlantic Assembly will be most welcome; it must have the broadest remit, including, particularly, the fight against poverty and social exclusion, and the fight against drugs and organised crime, and it must also focus greatly on the basic sector of education, culture and free trade which, as the previous speaker pointed out, must come about without generating inequalities."
"The strategy, as the rapporteur suggests, could be one of a single bi-regional solidarity fund, clearly identified and thus more easily controlled."
"But apart from the technical financial instruments, what is fundamental is that there should be clear political will, that we should take on a greater burden, that the Union can and must commit itself to implementing a strong development cooperation policy."
"The historical, cultural and blood ties that link so many Europeans to Latin America mean that whenever one of us is in Latin America, Mr President, we feel at home."
"These ties impose a moral as well as a political obligation on us to continue to uphold with renewed vigour the specific nature of Europe' s role, which is based on the strength of those values that have been at the root of our project for integration."
"It is also for these reasons that, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, I confirm our full support for this report."
"Mr President, the common strategy on Latin America is a strategy that may contain highly novel elements for Europe in this ever more complicated world."
"This novelty will be seen in the way the relations between Europe and Latin America are to be organised around three themes: the first is the debate on the rules of the game in the process of globalisation and, particularly, the question of democracy and the reduction of poverty; the second is the question of regional political integration; and the third is the joint management of major environmental crises."
"In this sense, although we in our group support the general approach taken by the Salafranca report, it contains a few elements which we believe still reflect a view that does not give enough attention precisely to the novelty of the issues we should be responding to."
"In particular, my group strongly questions the emphasis placed on the commercial dimension of relations between Europe and Latin America, especially the need for them to be subject to the current rules of the World Trade Organisation, rules which are widely challenged not only in Latin America but in Europe too."
"Secondly, we do not agree with the a priori positive assessment of the Puebla-Panama plan, which is a plan for large infrastructure works which will have considerable social and environmental impact."
"Before the European Union joins the financial community in contributing to the success of this plan, as called for in the report, I think we should carefully assess this impact."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate and thank Mr Salafranca for his report, which is very comprehensive, well-written and apt, because it is only when the enlargement process has been completed on paper, that we realise that there are still two issues that have yet to be resolved: Euro-Mediterranean strategy and this matter of Latin America."
"And it is precisely Latin America, with its growing organisational process, that offers more possibilities and at the same time has international repercussions that we should view positively."
"The influence of the European Union on Latin America within the United Nations in terms of finding peaceful solutions for conflicts, is, my view, a cause for hope, when compared with the militarisation and aggressive use of force practised by the United States at this time."
"I think that this issue is both important and appropriate, and Parliament is showing us that we are working in real time."
"For this reason and without reservations, our group will be supporting Mr Salafranca' s report."
"We do not agree upon certain, very specific, issues, but we will deal with these when the time is right."
"We are thinking here of the inclusion of Cuba, which for us is of fundamental importance, and also the choice of a peaceful solution of the Colombian conflict, which is what the European Union wants to see."
"Mr President, the countries of Latin America and the European Union have a cultural basis in common, which greatly facilitates the mutual relations between our peoples."
"Despite, however, certain promising prospects opened up by the first EU-Latin America-Caribbean Summit held in Rio de Janeiro in 1999, along the lines of a strategic partnership on an economic, social and ecological level, the concrete results so far achieved have been far from satisfactory."
"The reasons for this shortcoming are varied in origin and responsibility for it lies in different places."
"For the part that lies with us, there seems at times to be a kind of European self-inhibition, perhaps due even to the geo-strategic primacy, and not only that, of the United States throughout the American continent."
"As we know, the countries of Latin America are confronted with joining the American free trade area, which may happen from 2005 onwards (so we are nearly there!)."
"Now that there is a clear need to establish strong partnerships on the international scene, now more than ever, since the end of the Cold War, the European Union must not shirk any of its responsibilities or the challenges placed before it."
"One of the most important is precisely that of being able to define coherent joint strategies and endow them with effective political content."
"Thus the proposals presented in this own-initiative report by Mr Salafranca, whom we congratulate on his excellent work, deserve all our support."
"Not only because they explain and list practically all the aspects that have to be taken into consideration in a joint strategy to intensify EU-Latin American relations, but they also deserve our support because they come at just the right time, prior to the preparations for the second Heads of State and Government Summit to be held next May."
"Mr President, it seems to me that something is sorely missing from the report we have before us."
"I refer of course to the Native Americans, and by that I mean the indigenous peoples of this subcontinent. We tend to overlook them all too often, because they prick our conscience somewhat."
"How can we discuss relations with that part of 'Latin' America and fail to refer to these people?"
"Where it did not wipe them out, our so-called civilisation reduced most of them to poverty."
"In its opinion, the Committee on Development and Cooperation has, quite rightly, highlighted this omission."
"To take an example, item 50 of paragraph g of the report envisages a financial contribution by the Union to the Puebla Panama plan."
"How can such an idea be entertained when the plan covers areas with a majority Native American population, in Chiapas and Guatemala, yet the American Indians have not been consulted?"
"I would be hard put to vote in favour of this report."
"Mr President, the establishment of a common strategy between the European Union and Latin America, as decided in Rio de Janeiro in 1999, is a matter of justice that will finally give the appropriate dimension to interregional relationships that have historically been undervalued."
"The Socialist Group in the Committee on Development and Cooperation agrees with the objectives set out in the resolution proposed by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, for which I would like to congratulate Mr Salafranca."
"In our opinion, we need to increase the content of the political agenda and deepen dialogue at all political and institutional levels, within the framework of a true partnership."
"We think that the signing of association agreements with the Andean Community and Central America is necessary, with the aim of creating a Euro-Latin American free trade area."
"We also consider, however, that we need to give priority to the resolution of development problems in many Latin American countries, where there are 200 million poor people."
"We are particularly concerned about the Andean area, Central America and the Caribbean."
"In the Andean area, instability, institutional violence, problems of drug trafficking and the management of migratory flows have to be dealt with from a global perspective, that integrates development cooperation, trade liberalisation, institutional transformation, human rights and the rights of indigenous peoples in particular."
"The creation of a Euro-Latin American area of peace and stability has to be founded upon the principles of human rights, democracy and the fight against drug trafficking."
"In Central America, aid to social development and the fight against poverty have to take precedence over any other initiative, such as the information society."
"To do otherwise would be to put the cart before the horse."
"I would also like to make a special reference to the Caribbean and, specifically, to Cuba, as have other Members this morning."
"Cuba is not part of the Cotonu Agreement nor does it have an institutionalised relationship with the European Union."
"We think that development potential in Cuba, where, for some time, European companies have been investing, and the situation of its people merit treatment from the European Union that goes much further than the indifference it has shown to this country until now."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Salafranca on his magnificent report and also Mr Kreissl-Dörfler for his opinion, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on this subject."
"The Salafranca report is, generally speaking, very comprehensive and quite ambitious."
"I am only going to make one point, relating to paragraph 60, referring to the need for the Commission and the Council to provide adequate funding; and I would like to relate it to the report presented to us yesterday by the President of the Court of Auditors on economic management in the year 2000."
"In this report, in paragraph 5.5.8, something very serious is pointed out: that more than 25% of commitment appropriations allocated to Latin America in the year 2000 could not be used, because of administrative shortcomings."
"It was not made very clear in the Court of Auditors report whether administrative shortcomings were restricted to those countries receiving Community aid or the Community' s administration itself."
"In response to the Commission, a series of measures have been referred to which would prevent this taking place this year or next, and Mr Salafranca himself refers to another issue, which is the need for extra personnel in the Directorate-General for Latin America."
"Some time ago the Director of this Directorate-General told me personally, and I am talking about more than ten years ago, that the Directorate did not need more money, but more staff."
"I still have no idea whether this particular bottleneck has yet been resolved."
"Finally, one of the proposals put forward by the Commission is to strengthen delegations' decentralisation functions."
"I would also like to insist upon something Mr Salafranca has also stressed, which is that a very large country in Latin America with which we have a privileged relationship, Ecuador, still has no delegation, despite previous agreements and commitments made by this Parliament and the Commission itself."
"Mr President, in the time available, as Mr Salafranca will understand, I would like to concentrate on paragraph 7 of the resolution on the urgent and overriding need to keep support for the peace process in Colombia as a priority within this strategy."
"In particular I want to state two points."
"First, that the pledge made by President Pastrana personally to this Parliament on the dismantling of paramilitary groups has not been, and is not being, honoured."
"So say the UN special representative on human rights, the Mexican observer commission and the relations of ten fishermen killed in Santa Marta, and of the 18 people forced face down on to the ground and shot dead by paramilitaries in Buga within the last month alone."
"This is a continued gross abuse of human rights and, as my own UK ambassador has said, in these troubled times the guerrillas and the paramilitaries are both terrorist groups and should be combated through all means as part of the current anti-terrorist programme."
"We feel that particularly due to the killing of the British backpacker Jeremy Parks on 28 October."
"The Belgian Presidency rightly included action against paramilitaries as one of its four priorities in Colombia, in August of this year."
"Could the Commissioner please tell us in his reply what progress is being made as a result of the pressure that is being applied."
"Secondly, we support Commissioner Patten's proposal for a peace laboratory at Magdalena Medio."
"It is a major contribution towards the peace process, in contrast to the American military aid in Plan Colombia, which we have roundly condemned."
"But this Magdalena Medio region has been subject to an incursion by those same guerrillas."
"They are there, threatening campesinos that they must plant coca or they will die."
"They are there running their own businesses, having their own taxes and they want to co-opt NGOs to ensure that our European money goes to them to undermine the peace process rather than to support it."
"I call on the Commissioner now to show how he will introduce control and verification mechanisms so that our European money will achieve progress in the peace process, and not be abused by the paramilitaries to undermine our very aims."
"Welcome"
"I should like to extend a welcome to a delegation from the Mercosur joint parliamentary commission."
"The delegation, headed by its acting president, Mr Washington Abdala, is composed of twelve members of the upper and lower houses of Uruguay, Paraguay and Brazil."
"During this visit, the delegation members will take part in the fourth interparliamentary meeting between this joint parliamentary commission from Mercosur and the delegation for relations with the countries of South America and Mercosur."
"These meetings began in 1996."
"Relations between Mercosur and the EU are going through a very important period, since the negotiations for a free trade area have reached their sixth round and are proceeding at a fast pace."
"On behalf of the European Parliament, therefore, I welcome this delegation and express this Institution' s support for a profitable outcome to the negotiations."
"EU/Latin America relations (continuation)"
"Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra for his excellent report."
"I should like to express my recognition of the arduous task that he has undertaken, namely to synthesise the different aspects of our relations with Latin America."
"This report looks forward in an ambitious effort to give more vitality and further impetus to our already intense relationship with Latin America."
"The report takes a comprehensive approach to the objectives that should be pursued within the wider scope of our relations and the Commission completely shares this focus."
"Political, economic and cooperation aspects cannot be dissociated from each other if we want our relationships to develop in a balanced way."
"In this context, one of the major advances in recent years has been the establishment of a strategic bi-regional association, agreed upon at the first summit for Heads of State and Government of the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean."
"The report underlines the importance of the priorities decided upon at the summit and uses them as a springboard to propose specific objectives in the political, economic, social and cultural fields."
"In the political field, we support and share the desire to enlarge our bi-regional political agenda and to update the ministerial political dialogue."
"Political dialogue is the central instrument for structuring and giving content to the strategic association."
"This strategic association builds on common values which include diversity, tolerance, humanism and solidarity; it should allow both regions to assert their common positions and converging interests on international and multilateral issues of great transcendence."
"Many of these issues are addressed in the report and some of them, such as the prevention of conflicts and the fight against terrorism, have just taken on a new meaning."
"In the economic, financial and commercial field, I cannot but share your wish that the negotiations in progress with Chile and the Mercosur conclude with success as soon as possible."
"The entry into force of the agreement concluded with Mexico is already having a very positive impact on our commercial relations and on our investment."
"But I believe that we should be careful about using the same schemes that we are applying to Mercosur, Chile and Mexico for other regions of Latin America."
"We should always take into account the particular characteristics of each region, its level of economic development, the structure of its commerce and the level of regional integration which it has reached."
"For this reason, we have undertaken a thorough study of our present and future commercial relations with Central America and the Andean Community."
"On the basis of that study we shall be able to decide how to continue developing our economic and commercial relations with those regions."
"Turning now to the cooperation issues dealt with in the report, I should start by mentioning the positive impact that the implementation of the external aid management reform will have."
"The new programming and management mechanisms will increase the coherence, complementarity and efficiency of cooperation programmes."
"I should also like to make it clear that the emphasis on social aspects - in particular health, education and the fight against poverty - is a priority for the Commission too."
"We are currently promoting a forum for an exchange of ideas between the different actors in civil society on issues relative to social equity, so that its conclusions may be submitted to the Madrid Summit."
"Social equity should be central to the dialogue between Heads of State and concrete initiatives in that field ought to come out of this summit."
"I am grateful for the support given to Commission initiatives in the fields of education and culture."
"Before the end of the year, the Commission intends to adopt an ambitious scholarship programme so that postgraduate Latin American students can complete their studies in Europe."
"I am equally grateful for the support of the rapporteur and this Parliament for the programme aimed at enhancing the participation of Latin America in the information society."
"I hope I have made it clear that the Commission shares the majority of the objectives set out in the report and that we very much appreciate the quality and ambitious nature of the proposal it contains."
"I nonetheless wonder whether it is necessary to adopt a common strategy to achieve those objectives."
"We must bear in mind the dynamic nature of our relations."
"That dynamism results to a large extent from the vast array of regional and sub-regional mechanisms available to us."
"These allow us to develop a flexible political dialogue which is easily adaptable to current circumstances and priorities."
"The vitality of our relations is largely the result of our decision to move forward on the basis of a strategic association built upon a relationship between equals."
"The priorities of that strategic association are defined by the Heads of State and Government of both regions."
"I therefore believe that before launching any new initiatives we should ensure that the process we have just started continues to develop and builds progressively on the present dialogue and association relationship."
"I should like to thank Parliament for this valuable contribution."
"With reports such as this, Parliament continues to present a clear vision of what our relations should be with a region which is developing closer political and economic links with the European Union."
"Finally, I am fully aware that some questions were addressed to Mr Patten."
"I am sure he would like to provide written answers to the questions from Mr Medina Ortega in particular, but also to those from other speakers, and I assure Parliament that it will receive a full reply within the next few weeks."
"Mr President, my sense of nobility obliges me to respond to the positive and constructive speech by Mr Bolkestein."
"As rapporteur, I would say to him that I almost did not miss Mr Patten' s absence."
"I would also like to express my thanks to all of my fellow Members."
"For reasons of accuracy, I would like to refer to a point that has been made in this debate that the great omission from this report was the failure to mention indigenous peoples."
"I would like to quote directly from paragraph 27, which ""calls for the new common strategy to make education, health and culture its priorities and to provide for targeted measures in support of those Latin American countries which require them, with particular attention paid to ethnic minorities and indigenous groups""."
"Therefore, to say that there has been an omission, when we are asking that the maximum priority within the new common strategy be given to indigenous peoples, seems to me to be a clear contradiction, although, naturally, I respect the opinion of all my fellow Members."
"Thank you, Mr Salafranca."
"I am afraid the Member who made this observation is not present and was therefore unable to hear what you said, but he will certainly be informed."
"Shipbuilding"
"The next item is the report (A5-0373/2001) by Mrs Riis-Jørgensen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on a temporary defensive mechanism for shipbuilding [COM(2001) 401 - C5-0393/2001 - 2001/0153(CNS)]."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report on the proposal for a Council regulation concerning a temporary defensive mechanism for shipbuilding is extremely important, for shipbuilding is a strategically significant sector in the European Union."
"I would like to take this opportunity to present the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which, regrettably, does not coincide with that of the rapporteur."
"I wish to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Riis-Jørgensen, for her outstanding work, especially in view of the very short time available to her."
"I would therefore like to thank her, even though she has difficulty in accepting the legality of this proposal."
"Naturally, my Committee has examined this issue and concludes that the right legal basis has been selected and that the concerns regarding the proposal's legality are unfounded."
"I therefore wish to comment briefly on the content of the proposal and the report."
"It would be remiss of me, however, if I omitted to mention the constructive cooperation with the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy."
"I think we have put forward a sound proposal."
"I very much hope, too, that the Commission will adopt the amendments proposed by this House."
"The conclusions of the Industry and Energy Council of 5 December 2000, in accordance with the 1998 Council decision, confirmed the ending of operating aid for shipbuilding from 1 January 2001."
"However, it was pointed out at the time that if the negotiations with Korea failed, the Commission could adopt a different position after a review."
"We must recognise that Korea has failed to honour the 2000 agreement in terms of price discipline and subsidies."
"The Commission therefore had to examine whether, in the event of the failure of negotiations with Korea, which continues to violate current trade agreements by granting state subsidies, a temporary defensive mechanism should be proposed for European shipbuilding."
"The proposal has now been submitted because the negotiations failed, and the proposed defensive mechanism must be evaluated."
"From the Committee's point of view, the proposal is inadequate, as it is restricted solely to container ships and tankers for transporting petroleum products and chemicals (excluding stainless steel tankers)."
"The proposal allows operating aid of 6% and, in special cases, of up to 14%."
"A dispute settlement procedure is also to be initiated before the World Trade Organisation (WTO)."
"These aid measures are to be applicable only until the conclusion of proceedings, that is, until 31 December 2002 at the latest."
"We believe that the European Parliament should maintain its position that a dispute settlement procedure should be initiated."
"However, this proposal on a temporary defensive mechanism is in need of improvement, since the three segments referred to only account for 20% of European shipbuilding."
"Yet almost every segment in the European Union is affected by Korea's unfair competition practices."
"In particular, those categories of ships which will also be the subject of the complaint to the WTO must be included."
"Only then will our message to Korea be clear and convincing."
"In this respect, Commissioner, I believe that your support for Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 is essential."
"The duration envisaged is also inadequate, in our view."
"We therefore propose that the defensive mechanism should be applicable at least for the duration of the current Regulation on aid to shipbuilding, Regulation 1540/98, which expires on 31 December 2003, or possibly until the conclusion of the WTO proceedings."
"As the European Parliament, and as the European Union, we must not allow unfair trade practices to damage European business and put jobs at risk. Otherwise, these unfair practices will emerge in other sectors too, impeding growth and threatening jobs."
"At the same time, however, we must strike a careful balance between justified defensive mechanisms and anti-market protectionism benefiting certain sectors through State aid, which impedes fair competition."
"I believe that the Committee's proposal takes account of these concerns. I would ask you to support the draft report, and I appeal to the Commission to state its willingness to adopt the amendments."
"Mr President, I speak on behalf of the draftsman of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, Mr Valdivielso de Cué, not because he does not support the report, but because he cannot be here today."
"The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy supported the proposals put forward by Ms Randzio-Plath by a very substantial majority: 39 votes in favour to 9 votes against."
"The intention is to send out a clear signal against South Korea's dumping policies, which in recent decades have driven European shipbuilding to the brink of collapse by maintaining subsidies and benefits for companies in receivership."
"For a year now, we have pursued a policy which aimed to reach agreement with South Korea."
"A protocol to this effect was drawn up on 5 June 2000."
"South Korea did not honour it."
"In December 2000, we agreed to appeal to the WTO panel."
"South Korea did not respond."
"For this reason, the Commission quite rightly decided in July that temporary assistance of up to 14% may be paid by the national authorities, not from the European purse, for a specific number of ships until the end of 2002."
"This is the issue today."
"In line with Ms Randzio-Plath's proposals, we want to extend the categories of ships to include ferries for trains, persons and road vehicles, as well as natural gas and petroleum gas tankers, and we want to extend the term until 2003; in other words, we are in favour of a two-year period."
"We ask you to endorse this draft report and clearly reject the Liberals' motion which calls for the entire draft report to be dismissed."
"South Korea has the solution in its hand."
"None of us wants long-term subsidies."
"However, this is our only opportunity to exert pressure on behalf of the European shipbuilding industry on this difficult issue."
"The debate is now suspended and will be resumed this afternoon at about 4.45 p.m., after the debate on the international situation in which the Commission will take part."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Vote"
"The next item is the vote."
"Procedure without debate:"
"Recommendation for second reading on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 70/220/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States on measures to be taken against air pollution by emissions from motor vehicles (11253/1/2001 - C5-0474/2001 - 2000/0211(COD))."
"(The President declared the common position approved)"
"Report (A5-0364/2001) by Erik Meijer, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on action by Member States concerning public service requirements and the award of public service contracts in passenger transport by rail, road and inland waterway (COM(2000) 7 - C5-0326/2000 - 2000/0212(COD))"
"Mr President, I have an oral amendment to Amendment No 75."
"After the vote on Amendment No 130: President."
"Unfortunately Mr Fatuzzo, that means that Amendment No 75 falls."
"Mr President, it is not 'unfortunately' , because what I wanted is contained in that amendment - it concerns pensioners."
"(Laughter and applause)"
"We aim to please."
"Before the vote on the draft legislative resolution:"
"Mr President, I should like to ask you to postpone the vote on the legislative resolution further to yesterday' s communication by Commissioner de Palacio that she would not accept what is now being decided upon by a large majority in Parliament."
"In my opinion, we should set aside some time to consult further with Mrs de Palacio on this matter, because if we do not, although she may present a draft regulation in a few months' time, the regulation will be in a form different from that which has now been accepted by Parliament."
"That is why I propose postponing the vote on the legislative resolution."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my side has admittedly lost in a key vote, but the process must continue."
"We must now ensure that the Council forms an opinion."
"If we prevaricate and postpone this issue, the Council can continue to hide behind its inaction."
"I therefore propose that we reject the rapporteur's motion and now hold the final vote so that the ball is the Council's court."
"We still have the second reading and the mediation process."
"A delay at this point will not help: we want to move forward on this issue, and so I ask you to reject Mr Meijer's motion."
"Mr President, I wish to endorse Mr Jarzembowski's remarks for another reason."
"The plenary has substantively amended a Commission item by a large majority."
"The Commission must also accept, for once, that this House may substantively amend a Commission item."
"I am therefore in favour of continuing the process."
"(Parliament rejected the proposal to postpone the vote)"
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"President."
"Before we move on I would like to congratulate Mr Poettering who I understand has just been re-elected leader of his group."
"(Loud applause)"
"Report (A5-0354/2001) by Georg Jarzembowski, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision on market access to port services (COM(2001) 35 - C5-0078/2001 - 2001/0047(COD))"
"Before the vote on Amendment No 47:"
"Mr President, now that we have adopted Amendments Nos 48 and 49, I would like to ask the Liberal Group whether Amendment No 47 automatically lapses."
"That is my question, as we have agreed that the Commission must put forward appropriate proposals."
"I assume that Amendment No 47 now lapses."
"I think it lapses but if the Liberal Group wants to support me I am very happy to receive their support."
"(Laughter and applause)"
"- (NL) Mr President, unfortunately, the rapporteur is right."
"I thought that my amendment was far superior, but I accept that, as his amendment has already been adopted, it makes no sense to vote on mine."
"However, I would point out that the Commission has stated that his amendment is not accurate whereas mine is."
"Amendment No 47 falls."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Report (A5-0359/2001) by Luis Berenguer Fuster, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on insurance mediation (COM(2000) 511 - C5-0484/2000 - 2000/0213(COD))"
"Before the vote:"
"Mr President, I should like to make a point about the PPE-DE recommended voting list."
"There was a mistake in Amendment No 8 as a result of a mistake in the original draft, which has now been corrected."
"So Amendment No 8 should be supported by the PPE-DE Group as a recommendation."
"Similarly, Amendments Nos 57, 13, 46 and 47 have a mistake in the English language translation which renders it nonsensical."
"The word 'by' should be replaced by 'to' in the relevant paragraph (c)."
"The rapporteur, Mr Berenguer Fuster, supports me on both counts."
"We will ensure that the language versions are corrected and correspond to one another."
"Mr President, Amendment No 55, rather than being an oral amendment, in fact adds text that must have been forgotten, since this text does not appear."
"Therefore, the following words should be added to the end of the text of Amendment No 55: 'will have to give the name of these insurance companies' ."
"Are there any objections to that oral amendment?"
"(Parliament accepted the oral amendment)"
"Mr President, in my opinion, Amendment No 60 is not incompatible with Amendment No 41 and can be voted on as an addition."
"I would like to hear the opinion of the proposing group."
"Mr President, this proposed amendment works perfectly well as an addition, and can therefore be voted on as an addition."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"President."
"Colleagues, we shall only vote now on the two Caudron reports."
"The remaining items will be held over to the vote tomorrow."
"Mr President, we are in the middle of taking a vote."
"I merely wanted to point out how absurd these foreshortened sessions are, without a Friday."
"It is never possible to deal satisfactorily with the agenda."
"(Sustained applause)"
"Mr President, due to the large number of votes outstanding, I urgently request that we begin early enough with the votes tomorrow morning; otherwise, we will not be able to deal with everything."
"Mr President, it was announced that Amendment No 35 would not be dealt with as it does not concern all the language versions."
"However, it relates to the introduction of gender-neutral language throughout the proposal, and I would ask you to ensure that gender-neutral language is used in the entire research framework programme."
"We will ensure that all the terms used are gender-neutral."
"Before the vote on Amendments Nos 322 and 333:"
"Mr President, as I understand it, adopting the Committee' s amendment on the same issue invalidates the other two amendments."
"It refers to the same paragraph."
"I am sorry. I cannot agree because we are voting on additions."
"Mr President, the principles included in the Caudron report are exactly identical to those in the amendments tabled by Messrs Liese, Nisticò, Fiori and Trakatellis, except that in those amendments, one more element has been added, namely the fact that we must also take account of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child."
"That is the only point added, and I therefore hope that our socialist friends, as well as others, will vote in favour of this amendment."
"Thank you for that clarification."
"Do you agree, Mr Caudron?"
"Mr President, I agree with what Mr van Velzen has just said."
"He is right about that minor addition."
"We can therefore vote on it, and I vote in its favour."
"Thank you."
"The rest comes later, once we get to other parts of Amendments Nos 332 and 333."
"All we are voting on is that section at the moment."
"Mr President, I think the rapporteur wants to comment."
"Mr Caudron, Mrs McNally is reading your mind."
"I certainly wished to comment. When one is seated in the second row one can be seen more easily than when one is rather further away."
"He does however advise voting against the third part, contrary to a note sent to the presidency. As is abundantly clear, the third part clearly states that work should concern stem cells from embryos or foetuses resulting from spontaneous miscarriages or abortions undertaken to safeguard the health of the mother."
"That is outdated wording."
"I am indeed sorry. It does appear that in this debate we are reworking the debate on abortion and this is causing me considerable concern."
"Mr Caudron, you are possibly confusing two parts."
"We are voting at the moment on part 3 - stem cells."
"You have raised the issue of embryos at this point."
"We are only voting on the stem cells aspect of this amendment at the moment - section 3 of the amendment."
"No, Mr President, I am not mistaken. It is indeed in Paragraph 3, in the last part of Paragraph 3."
"I am not referring to Paragraph 4."
"To be absolutely clear, it is the words: 'to ensure the mother's health may be funded' ."
"Yes, Mr President, that is the part I did not wish to be voted on."
"At least I am clear now."
"Before the vote on amendment 330: Turmes (Verts/ALE)."
"Mr President, this amendment is about technology assessment."
"In principle all the groups agree, but our amendment is a bit rigid on the financial implication."
"It says: 'a minimum of 3%' ."
"So I propose an oral amendment which will read: 'activities in all thematic areas should be supported only if a certain percentage of the respective project is used for technological impact assessment' ."
"That is very clear."
"Are there any objections to that oral amendment?"
"(Parliament accepted the oral amendment) Amendment No 33:"
"Mr President, could I perhaps invite the rapporteur to present his oral amendment to 335?"
"It was agreed with the rapporteur that the word 'and' would be replaced by 'or' ."
"That is an extremely minor oral amendment, and I know that the rapporteur is in agreement with this."
"Do you mean 'fish or animal' , or is it 'new or improved' ?"
"Mr President, my reaction will indicate how much work I put into this report."
"The draft oral amendment tabled relates to the second part of Amendment No 335, 'new or improved races' , and I feel it is indeed more appropriate to use 'or' rather than 'and' , because the human race could not really be subsumed under 'new and improved races' ."
"Alright, 'new or improved' ."
"Are there any objections to that oral amendment?"
"(Parliament accepted the oral amendment) Amendment No 320:"
"Mr President, as regards 320, I can go along with the proposed addition concerning quality as regards nutrition. I cannot however accept the deletions contained in this amendment."
"If those who tabled the amendment agree, I can accept the addition to the text."
"Do the Greens accept the oral amendment as an addition?"
"(The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance accepted the oral amendment)"
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Report (A5-0355/2001) by Gérard Caudron, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council decision concerning the multiannual framework programme 2002-2006 of the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM) for research and training activities aimed at contributing towards the creation of the European Research Area (COM(2001) 94 - C5-0171/2001 - 2001/0054(CNS))."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"President."
"That concludes the vote."
"Report Meijer (A5-0364/2001):"
"Mr President, we have approved the new regulation on action by Member States in the liberalisation of public transport services by rail, road and inland waterway, in order that this may be consolidated as a new single European market."
"And, with regard to this, our Parliamentary Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has tabled various amendments aimed at preserving aspects relating to the environment and sustainability in the transportation market, such as the rational use of energy and the fulfilment of standards on the control of emissions which contaminate the atmosphere, greenhouse gases, noise, etc, as well as giving priority to alternative forms of transport which make a better contribution to the much hoped-for reduction in traffic congestion."
"We have argued for the need to defend the quality of transport services, whether these be run by public or private companies, and we have stated that social conditions with regard to the health and safety of employees in these companies should be closely linked to the quality of services offered."
"We also think that liberalisation should not lead to an abandonment of the idea that passenger transportation is a social instrument and which supports the weakest groups in society, such as schoolchildren, trainees, pensioners and those living with some kind of disability, all of whom should continue to be protected through restrictions on ticket prices."
"Ticket prices should be standardised in order to facilitate the integration and interoperability of different transportation methods, including cross-border transportation, where timetables and service networks also need to be coordinated."
"Transport should be cheap and available throughout all regions, and should also guarantee a service to less populated and less prosperous areas at moderate prices."
"Finally, it is not acceptable to liberalise urban, suburban and regional transportation whilst remaining, as some governments are, opposed to the liberalisation of state transportation, as for example the passenger railways."
"Although it should be controlled, this market should be open to free competition throughout the EU."
"Mr President, I express my personal satisfaction, as a Member and as the representative of the Pensioners' Party, for the approval of amendment 130 in this document, which regulates public service in transport by rail, road and inland waterway throughout Europe."
"Amendment 130 was tabled by the Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, whom I thank for tabling it, and voted on before the oral amendment, which, like the Greens' amendment, sought to extend the possibility of granting free travel on public transport to pensioners."
"I therefore thank all the Members who voted for it, particularly the European Members of the Northern League - Mr Gobbo, Mr Borghezio, Mr Speroni - and of course above all the Members of the Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left who tabled the amendment that has been voted on, and also all those, notably including the socialists, who voted for it."
". (FR) We consider this draft regulation to be a real threat to the urban public passenger transport service in that it abolishes the freedom to manage our territorial communities."
"Calling this fundamental principle into question in many Member States, possibly even going as far as constitutional recognition, is detrimental to free choice and, more importantly, to the free organisation of local public services, thus affecting service itself."
"However, we can only agree with the exclusion of long-distance rail services due to the exclusive rights without compensation that apply to them."
"We also approve all the amendments aiming to preserve the social clause."
"However, for reasons of safety and coherent management, which would be jeopardised by the division of the lines, we consider the inclusion of local rail services within the scope of the regulation to be unacceptable."
"That is why we propose that this text, which is neither acceptable nor desirable for the continuity of the local public passenger transport service, be rejected."
". (FR) For ages, governments all over Europe have been closing rail services to the benefit of private companies throughout the road transport sector, leading to the tragic accidents in the Mont Blanc and Saint-Gothard tunnels and the tremendous human and social cost of all, more 'normal' , accidents."
"Today, the road networks are at saturation point, so some private investors are turning to rail in order to make new profits there, aided and abetted by both the European authorities and national governments."
"Neither users nor the general population can expect to benefit from the privatisation of public services."
"Nor will workers in the sector, who are denouncing and fighting privatisation and its devastating effects on employment and working conditions."
"It is true that the rapporteur is concerned about the damage done by unbridled liberalisation and suggests the possibility of opposition by local communities. However, he is nonetheless among those who see privatisation as a fait accompli and the dismantling of public services as inevitable, and who are only trying to regulate the process somewhat."
"As we are in favour of the development of public transport both on international routes and in regional and local networks, we do not want to support the dismantling of public services directly or indirectly, since this dismantling, even if it is regulated, is detrimental to users and to workers in the sector, and constitutes a severe social decline."
"That is why we have not voted for this report, and we would say once more that public services everywhere must be designed and implemented to respond to the needs of the user, not to make money for private companies."
"This report seeks to improve the Commission' s proposal, which, despite its name, effectively seeks to privatise passenger transport."
"Although important proposals have been approved, and we voted for them, the fact is that the introduction of competition may jeopardise established rights for users, such as travel passes, and for staff, something that has not been sufficiently safeguarded in this report and will certainly be even less so in Commission and Council practice."
"Thus, even greater obstacles to user mobility may be created, although certain proposals approved by Parliament along different lines are to be welcomed."
"Furthermore, there is no proper guarantee of coordination between the various means of transport, and adequate answers are not given to those users located in less profitable areas: private companies may consider them unprofitable and then cancel services there."
"Lastly, the vote against the legislative resolution is also justified on account of our fears regarding the implementation of the Commission' s position and the consequences for staff and users, which may jeopardise a quality, low-price service."
"It should also be noted that, although the Commission is backing the privatisation of transport services, part of these services will continue to be supported by public money, which is unacceptable."
"The proposal clearly states that its aim is to develop competition in the field of transport provision."
"Contrary to what it states in several places, everything shows that within the framework of so-called 'regulated' competition, the results of opening up the market have not been positive, and nor has the efficiency of services improved."
"Quite the opposite."
"The overall process of liberalisation runs counter to improving the service for passengers, to improving working conditions, to respect for the environment, traffic safety and a regional planning policy that is not imposed by market restrictions."
"We are stating our opposition to any liberalisation of transport, and our support for maintaining the status of transport as a public service, and for cooperation between public companies at European level."
"We are against any State aid being allocated to private operators who are not, moreover, prepared to make the necessary investment in infrastructures."
"What is more, we are in favour of the immediate re-nationalisation of all the private railway lines and networks in Europe and in favour of the re-nationalisation/municipalisation of urban and local transport."
"The underlying problem is that it is impossible to compromise with market logic."
"When it is applied, it is to the detriment of another logic, that of public service, which explains why we have voted against this report."
"Report Jarzembowski (A5-0354/2001):"
"Mr President, open access to the port services market and equal opportunities in this field are not only appropriate but also a requirement of the Treaties on which the European Union is founded."
"Regulation and control are needed in this particular field to ensure that no State provides financial assistance to its ports, since this is a serious threat to free competition between Community ports."
"However, there are certain aspects which should not be exclusively regulated by the EU."
"Member States and their constitutional bodies with competencies in this field should maintain their capacity to include their own specific standards for the invitation to tender for contracts for supply of port services and for the protection of workers affected."
"Additionally, pilotage, mooring and the handling of cargo, including stowage and trans-shipment, since they are compulsory services, should not be included in the Community Directive liberalising port services, but their regulation should remain under the control of the Member States and their port authorities, for reasons of the safety of maritime traffic."
"In an airport, there would be chaos if there were more than one company providing air traffic control."
"In a port, there should only be one authority for pilotage and one for mooring, for the same reason."
"As you know, Mr President, I was born in Genoa and lived in Genoa until I was 21."
"I admired the port of Genoa every morning when I looked out over the city, since I lived in a very well-known district up high, from where I could enjoy precisely this beautiful view over the port of Genoa, which is nonetheless a very busy port, like so many in the European Union."
"Well, in this document, which regulates the organisation of the port, port services and safety, I would like to have found greater commitment and greater financial involvement by the European Union so that all the ports in Europe without distinction, northern European ports and Mediterranean ports, could be financially supported just as our competitors in South Korea do with the shipyards in their country."
"We, too, should help our ports and our shipping."
"Opening up port services to competition, at least in the way proposed by the Commission, will have a number of serious, adverse repercussions:"
"a) on the quality of port services and the standards applied, because they will have to compete and will recruit unskilled staff;"
"b) on working conditions and the employment prospects of port workers, thereby jeopardising their health and safety, curtailing their vocational training and undermining their skills;"
"c) on the safety of transport by sea and the environment, due to the generally lower standard of services provided."
"Although the Committee on Transport's motion represents an improvement, with the amendments adopted, it is still thinking along the same lines as the Commission and has even reduced the scope for public-sector controls, which is why I voted against it."
"The generally-worded title of the Community directive before us conceals an important step towards the privatisation of ports, especially the services which they provide, such as pilotage, towing and docking ships, loading and unloading and storing goods and moving passengers."
"The aim is not to improve the port services provided; it is to sell off yet another publicly owned sector to big business and hand a complete infrastructure over to the private monopolies so that they can make use of and profit from it."
"The unavoidable consequences will be a reversal in labour relations and rights and a tragic drop in safety standards for workers, for passengers on board ships and in the services provided."
"We want to stress from the outset that we are opposed and completely reject both the directive and the Jarzembowski report."
"We refuse to be party to a line of thinking that accepts privatisation as inevitable and endeavours to rescue a few individual services."
"On the contrary, we steadfastly support the argument for public port services and ports whose operations are integrated into an overall development plan which develops the potential of each country, supports the economy and employment and guarantees the safety of human life in port and at sea."
"These are highly sensitive issues for Greece, with its large number of island complexes and its sovereignty in the Aegean, a sensitive area from the economic, social and national security standpoints."
"We would also point out that multipurpose ports such as Piraeus, which support and serve the shipbuilding and repair industry, can only do their job efficiently if they remain in the public sector."
"This endeavour is more than infuriating or provocative."
"It is an attempt to intervene in the operational unit itself, that is, the port, and to prohibit it from doing what any enterprise does, that is, from operating as a single entity."
"It breaks up and imposes internal competition between services provided by the same service provider."
"At the same time, the directive talks about prerequisites for 'public services' but leaves them at the mercy of the private sector."
"The Communist Party of Greece is fighting, alongside the workers, for uniform, 100% public-sector port services, so that they are able to operate, develop and connect with other sectors of the economy."
"If we want properly operating ports, safety, coordination and development, we need to support a single, vertically-integrated service, with each activity helping and supporting the other."
"Otherwise, the smooth and efficient operation of the sector will be at risk, any attempt at coordination will be doomed to failure and safety will be thrown to the winds because it will be subject to the laws of profit and competition and will have to rely upon the goodwill of the enterprises."
"That is why we voted against the Jarzembowski report."
"The draft report presented to us is unacceptable in its current form."
"First, because it provides a confused response to the fundamental questions of competition between European ports and financial transparency in the allocation of grants to these ports."
"But also, and in particular, because the indiscriminate liberalisation of all port services constitutes a dangerous threat to safety, the environment and employment."
"To safety, because opening up to competition highly specialised services such as piloting, requiring specific skills adapted to each port, carries the potential risk of seriously jeopardising the safety conditions in which these professions are exercised."
"To the environment, because liberalisation does not allow it to be taken into consideration sufficiently."
"On these two points, the report and the directive contradict the 'maritime safety' and environmental risk reduction reinforcement policy launched by the European Union following the Erika disaster."
"Lastly, such liberalisation poses a threat to employment, because opening up port services to competition, in particular those employing the most staff, such as freight handling, carries the risk of plunging the European ports into a dangerous downward spiral with regard to social benefits."
"This tendency would be unsustainable in areas that are often vulnerable or in labour market areas that are already severely affected by industrial restructuring."
"I cannot, therefore, approve all the provisions that would lead to port services being opened up to competition with no compensation or safeguards."
"That is why I voted for all the amendments aiming to exclude port services such as piloting, mooring and freight handling from the scope of the liberalisation proposed by the directive."
"As these amendments have not been adopted, I voted against the report."
". (FR) First of all, I would like to thank both our rapporteur for the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, Mr Georg Jarzembowski, and the Committee as a whole for the high quality of their work."
"I have several reasons for voting against this report."
"To me, voting against this report means first of all rejecting the liberalisation of intra-port services, that is to say going against the obligatory privatisation of handling and mooring services."
"As piloting is the only intra-port service to have been recognised as an obligatory public service and as an activity requiring great care with regard to safety, it is the only intra-port service that will continue to be controlled by the Member States, and that will, therefore, be excluded from the scope of the directive."
"I simply cannot comprehend, however, that mooring service providers, who provide an internationally recognised service of general interest by providing indispensable assistance both with regard to prevention in the field of environmental protection and in implementing the best possible level of safety, will from now on be subject to competition."
"To me, voting against this report also means rejecting liberalisation between ports, that is to say, rejecting competition between ports, competition which can only have disastrous and harmful effects, with regard to both the quality of services rendered and the working conditions themselves."
"Voting against this report therefore means arguing for increased cooperation between ports, recognising that ports are a full and complete factor in regional planning and that as such, they must not be subjected to competition that could lead to their eradication."
"These, in short, are the two main reasons that have led me not to deliver a final vote in favour of this report."
". (FR) This proposal to liberalise port services is of immediate concern to us due to its potential practical consequences."
"We feel it is completely inappropriate to seek to open up all port services to competition regardless of their type, given that some of them, due to their specific obligations, are of a public service nature."
"Apart from national differences regarding the very concept of public service as applied to port services, optimum safety must be ensured in all Member States. They alone can define and control this by means of public service tasks, professional qualifications, restrictions or the definition of their activities."
"The economic logic in favour of users must never take priority over safety in the widest meaning of the word: personal, environmental or material."
"Therefore, we consider that this proposal must exclude all services that are of a public service nature according to the standards of each Member State, be they piloting, mooring or other services."
"This is not the case, so we are voting against this text."
". (PT) Our vote reflects our position on a deeply controversial report, which has not been accepted by any sector of port services."
"As we know, the Commission proposal seeks to open up major areas concerned with port safety to competition and does not guarantee workers' rights."
"Although the report itself contains some positive references, it retains negative aspects that give some backing to the Commission' s position."
"For countries like Portugal, this proposal could have highly detrimental effects on a sector that has already been affected by other, equally detrimental measures, and we have therefore voted against it."
". (FR) Having attacked public rail transport, Mr Jarzembowski, the rapporteur, is now attacking port services."
"The logic behind this, which is still the same, is a direct result of the process of liberalising telecommunications, transport, energy and postal services."
"This involves placing the organising bodies, infrastructures and professionals carrying out public service tasks, often in a public context, under the yoke of the market."
"Three hundred European Union ports and all port services such as freight handling, piloting, towage, mooring, embarkation and disembarkation services would be affected by this directive."
"However, a recent opinion poll confirmed by the success of the European dockers' strike of 6 November shows that these proposals meet with the mass rejection of port service workers."
"The long amendment war that took place within the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism may have meant for now that competition will no longer be within ports but between them, but these results are not satisfactory."
"Moreover, because we demand that public service obligations regarding safety, regularity, continuity, quality, price and harmonisation with the system that is most favourable in terms of social protection for port workers and respect for the environment, be fulfilled, we have rejected the Jarzembowski report."
". The majority of British ports are well run and prosper because private operators have taken over from cash-strapped local authorities and are running the ports as successful businesses."
"The proposed European Commission directive to increase competition in port services in the EU threatens to reverse this."
"It would leave British ports vulnerable to takeovers similar to the takeover of various electricity firms by Electricité de France."
"It would impose unnecessary bureaucracy on an already highly competitive and successful UK ports market."
"It would threaten the independent, commercially based and subsidy free nature of British ports."
"I would like to see private operators exempted from the scope of this directive."
". (FR) Mooring services are a general interest service as recognised by the judgment of the Court of Luxembourg of 18 June 1998."
"Within this context, the port authority may require mooring services to handle any safety problems with no obligation for remuneration."
"Mooring services provide all ships with the same quality of service, due to an extremely extensive knowledge of the port in which the service is provided."
"The permanent nature of the service, the professional qualifications of the workers, their knowledge of the specific local features and the essential role played by mooring services in port and maritime safety make this activity an essential determining factor in environmental protection."
"The deterioration of the merchant fleet as a whole and the increasing over-use of frequently faulty boats and equipment show the extent of the essential role to be played by mooring service providers in years to come, due to their technical skills and wide knowledge of their place of work."
"Mooring services, like piloting, must therefore be excluded from the European directive, and that is why the group of the Greens has voted in favour of Amendments No 66 and 67 of this report."
"), in writing. (NL) Mr President, the introduction of the port package has clearly given European port policy a new lease of life."
"The report on market access to port services has caused a great stir in the European Parliament, not least because the European Commission proposal predominantly deals with competition within ports."
"The wish from the EP, dating back to 1997, to reach a Regulation on competition among ports has been completely overlooked."
"In this connection, a request has been made for clear rules on financial transparency and State aid in the port sector."
"The Dutch People' s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) within the ELDR Group wants to guarantee more transparency for government funding and has asked the European Commission to present a proposal to this effect prior to the entry into force of the present directive."
"Otherwise, we would start to question the directive' s added value for European ports and their users."
"Opinions in my group are divided as to which services should fall within the scope of the directive and which should not."
"The VVD backs the rapporteur where he wants to limit the directive to the technical-nautical services."
"However, in our view, pilotage services should be included in the directive."
"Cargo handling services are by their very nature land-based and do not belong in this directive."
"Furthermore, port authorities and users are required to make relatively sizeable investments in infrastructure and superstructure."
"The tendering of the cargo handling aspect will mainly lead to red tape."
"This administrative burden is not proportionate to the result and creates uncertainty within investing authorities."
"It also creates an obstruction for urban planning authorities of the local councils, to which most ports in the Netherlands still belong."
"The VVD is against including the cargo handling services in this directive."
". (FR) I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work on this highly sensitive dossier."
"Unusually, the division here has not been political but national, and the compromise brokered is generally positive."
"This directive was necessary because port services must be opened up to competition and European ports require European legislation on port services."
"If competition is encouraged, it is essential that it be organised by an appropriate framework."
"However, account must be taken of the specific nature of each activity."
"I am thinking of piloting and mooring services in particular, since these, for safety reasons, must continue to be governed by the port authorities."
"This method of management works very well in France and even if these activities are open to competition in other European countries, I am in favour of their current exclusion from the scope of the directive."
"These are port services of general interest."
"If these services are kept within the scope of the directive, the concept of port authority loses all meaning."
"On the other hand, I approve of the liberalisation of freight handling, since this is a commercial service and opening it up to competition should be synonymous with increased employment."
"Lastly, I have supported the provisions in favour of greater transparency in financial relations between ports and Member States."
"In the name of legal certainty and fair competition between European ports, it must be possible to subject grants paid by national authorities to detailed inspections."
"Report Berenguer Fuster (A5-0359/2001):"
"Mr President, I voted for the regulation of insurance mediation."
"I take the opportunity to hope that the European Union will also soon regulate the mediation of public insurance."
"'What is public insurance?' you will ask, Mr President."
"Naturally it means social security and sickness benefit."
"In this area too, citizens have the right to be properly informed about what the public sector offers them for their future lives as pensioners, and how much they must pay now, as workers, in order to have a pension tomorrow."
"Moreover, the information service for workers and pensioners about their right to a pension should be regulated throughout Europe, to enhance it in every possible way."
"Cross-border insurance mediation will increase consumers' options to choose between various insurance providers."
"The directive proposal we have in front of us now allows insurance intermediaries to operate also in other Member States."
"When making choices between various providers, EU citizens must nevertheless be confident that we, as European legislators, guarantee consumer protection by making sure that persons practising insurance mediation are highly qualified."
"The report on the insurance mediation directive, which we in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs have been working on, is generally satisfactory."
"We ensure that insurance intermediaries have the necessary professional competence, liability insurance or other equivalent insurance as well as adequate financial capacity."
"Any insurance intermediary must also be a person of good repute, who has not been made bankrupt."
"Simultaneously, however, we must ensure that EC regulations do not cause any unnecessary bureaucracy."
"Our committee has made several amendments, which according to the opinion of expert advisors clearly make the directive more sensible and give Member States the option to make decisions in consideration of national circumstances."
"We have achieved compromises, which the majority of Member States in the Council seem to be inclined to support."
"It is important not to apply the directive to any persons whose principal professional activity is other than insurance mediation."
"By this I mean in particular, travel agencies, who also offer their customers travel insurance as part of a travel package."
"They make the customer' s life considerably easier and in Finland, for example, they are under the supervision of the authorities."
"In connection with travel insurance accident insurance is also often sold, which include provision for compensations in the event of death."
"It has been very beneficial to specify that these are not life insurances referred to in this directive."
"It would also have been more beneficial not to apply the directive to intermediaries, who work under the responsibility of their insurance company, or for whose activities the company is responsible on the basis of international legislation and for whom the company also provides appropriate training."
"As it unfortunately has been impossible to allow part-time agents, who act under the responsibility of their company, to be totally excluded from the directive, it nevertheless is good to relax the registration liability in the way our committee has proposed."
"The relationship of Amendment Nos 14 to Amendment Nos 13 and 6 remains unclear, because Amendment No 14 allows for example travel and animal insurances to be totally excluded from the directive, while in other sections intermediaries providing those insurances are excluded from registration liability only."
"If further amendments are still allowed, I would like to propose that Amendment Nos 18 and 22 be removed."
"Insurance mediation by banks is no different from the rest of the mediation activity, and would not need regulation of its own."
"Report Caudron (A5-0376/2001):"
"Mr President, what is this subsidiarity that is talked about so much in the European Union?"
"Subsidiarity, you tell me, Mr President, means that one should act at a European level when that gives the greatest advantage and the greatest benefit to all the citizens of Europe."
"So how should we carry out scientific research in Europe?"
"With fifteen different projects from fifteen different States, which tomorrow will be fifteen plus the twelve that are joining, which makes twenty-seven, or would it not be better to have a single research fund?"
"Is it better to make a single decision on how to spend the money of all twenty-seven European Union Member States, the 15 current ones plus the 12 candidate countries, or to leave twenty-seven different chapters of the budget?"
"We should decide to have a single European research fund."
"Mr President, I voted against the report, as some of the outcomes of the vote are incompatible with my own ethical and moral views."
"Furthermore, I cannot understand why only marginal approaches exist for research in agriculture and forestry even though it is vital, for the future of agriculture and forestry, to set the necessary research priorities in this area in particular."
". (FR) This report is completely in line with the policy of the European institutions, where it emphasises aid to employers under the pretext of research and where it aims to strengthen the link between research and private interests, even if it sometimes cloaks this link in ecological or regionalist attire, according to fashion."
"Nor is this report free of concessions to certain obscurantist ideas, whether religious or otherwise."
"As for the budget for the Sixth Framework Programme, this penalises, in financial terms, research units whose work has been judged not to be a priority as it has little potential for profitable use by the private sector in the short or medium term."
"The only reason we have voted in favour of this report is that we do not want to prejudice certain research strands supported by the report, which are seeking to make scientific, medical or technological progress, and nor do we want to risk depriving researchers in the public sector of the funding they need."
"We have also adopted all the amendments that could represent progress in relation to the current situation."
". (PT) Despite the efforts of the rapporteur and most of the members of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, there is no guarantee that there will be no discrimination against countries and regions whose business structure does not have the economic ability to take part in programmes aiming at the rapid transfer of knowledge in technological innovation, even though there may be scientific resources."
"Thus the efforts to ensure cohesion enshrined in the Treaty will not be enough to combat the loss of competitiveness that this will entail."
"The assumption behind the aims of the Lisbon strategy was full employment and exclusion, and not the opposite."
"Without being able to share in knowledge and take part in programmes, the less favoured regions will be left a long way from economic and social convergence."
". (FR) I voted in favour of this report."
"I am a long-time supporter of research work at European level."
"I am also pleased by Parliament' s stated desire to create and develop this interdisciplinary Community area."
"In France, in particular, we are seeing a worrying drop in the number of researchers."
"As a result of disappointing national policies, the most talented researchers often go abroad and only too rarely return."
"The measure included in this report on the mobility of researchers and assistance with returning home will also, I hope, help to compensate for the shortcomings of some governments."
"Stimulating research also means ensuring an independent training policy based on existing competences at European level."
"Although the task of the legislator may be to provide a framework for research, there is a risk that this will be too restricted."
"A Europe of discovery must also be fostered and work on biotechnologies, which represent the future, should be encouraged."
"Similarly, the fundamental European research at the heart of the competitiveness of our industries and the substantial work undertaken by small and medium-sized enterprises and industries, whose input we know to be necessary to discovery and innovation, must also be supported."
"Research also affects the everyday life of all Europeans and priority areas, such as food safety, the fight against the major serious diseases and improving public health, show the desire to associate research and wellbeing."
"I am also pleased to note the support that is proposed for the development of research into childhood illnesses, a field in which national policies have often failed."
"That is why I call on the Commission to publish proposals on paediatric medicines."
"Research and development are of crucial importance if Europe is to become a continent characterised by economic growth and sound welfare."
"International competition, especially from the United States, increases the need for new and intensified research efforts."
"In its proposal in connection with the Sixth Framework Programme, the Commission has identified several important problems and research areas which Europe needs to concentrate on."
"Obviously, it is important that Europe' s researchers cooperate and that research efforts are coordinated to some degree."
"It is also very important that we should not only make it easier for researchers to travel but also facilitate the distribution of research results."
"What worries us is that the framework programme involves a very considerable centralisation of research."
"Major resources are being invested in a small number of selected areas."
"Research is thus being directed in an unfortunate way because the Member States' own research routes will be governed by the Commission' s priorities."
"For small countries with limited research budgets, the EU is thus in danger of becoming one of the main bodies that funds research, something which would give rise to an unfortunate degree of centralisation."
"As liberals, we applaud the principle of independent research."
"From the point of view of efficiency, independent research has shown itself to be far superior to politically directed research."
"In the long run, societies which provide researchers with large room for manoeuvre when it comes to choosing subjects and methods achieve better results than societies in which the politicians determine the direction to be taken by research."
"The principle of the independent pursuit of knowledge has, for centuries, strongly characterised research in Europe."
"Universities and other institutions of higher learning have an important role to play in cooperating with industry and the public sector, but their most important task must not become that of taking orders from the latter."
"We believe that the Sixth Framework Programme would give rise to undue centralisation of independent research."
"We have therefore chosen to abstain from voting on the Caudron report."
"- (FR) As a member of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and of the Temporary Committee on Human Genetics ( 'Bioethics' ), I have attached particular importance to this report, in its two main aspects:"
"the conditions for support granted to research in Europe, and"
"the ethical framework within which the European Parliament plans to conduct it."
"As the amendments show, the essence of the debate concerned the part relating to 'ethics' applied to biotechnologies."
"Insofar as the majority of votes approved the instrumentalisation of humans by authorising the use of human embryos, in this case conceived within the context of the treatment of infertility by in vitro fertilisation, to the detriment of the promotion of human dignity and integrity, I consider that the ethical framework adopted by a majority at first reading gives a negative tone to the report as a whole, including the technical provisions."
"In conclusion, despite good technical provisions, the supposedly 'ethical' provisions mar the report as a whole by failing to respect human life."
"Various Dutch fellow MEPs have made statements in the media to the effect that the Liberal Group refuses to prescribe ethical limits for scientific research."
"Our voting behaviour has proved that this is nonsense."
"First of all, adopted Amendment No 41 has a liberal pedigree."
"It demands that both during the implementation of the programme and for the results, the ethical basic principles, such as protection of human dignity, data and privacy are adhered to."
"Additionally, with regard to stem cell research, the guidelines drawn up by the ESF ethical committee must be observed."
"Furthermore, our group wanted to adopt Amendment No 22 of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, which prevents funding being channelled into research activity aiming at human cloning for reproductive purposes, the creation of embryos for research purposes and eugenic modifications in the genetic heritage."
"Unfortunately, the restrictive text of Amendment No 322 has been adopted in which therapeutic cloning has been ruled out."
"We regret this, precisely because therapeutic cloning offers genuine opportunities for patients suffering from Alzheimer' s, Parkinson' s, AIDS or diabetes."
"We have therefore abstained from the final vote."
"Report Caudron (A5-0355/2001):"
"Mr President, I was very young, I must have been ten or eleven, when someone gave me a beautifully illustrated Walt Disney book."
"Its title was 'Our friend the atom' , and it was illustrated in that marvellous way that Walt Disney used to illustrate his universally famous works, as we might call them."
"I was fascinated by that science book, which was so well explained to a young person like me."
"Since then I have been in favour of nuclear energy and so I have voted for this document, especially because it promotes study and research into the nuclear sector in Europe, which, in my view, we should increase further."
"Mr President, I view the expiry of the Euratom Treaty as an opportunity for Europe to phase out nuclear energy."
"Yet today's vote on the Euratom programme has endorsed follow-up funding for nuclear research."
"This is set out in Amendment No 12, for example, which provides funding for research into the safety of existing reactors (with priority for reactors in the candidate countries), as well as reactors of the new generation."
"In other words, it safeguards future nuclear power plants."
"Yet research should be targeting non-nuclear energies, especially renewable energies, in order to make a contribution to the progressive phasing-out of nuclear energy in Europe."
"This is why we rejected not only Amendment No 12 but also the entire Euratom programme in today's vote."
". I warmly welcome this report by Gerard Caudron, which recommends changes in the allocation of spending to the Commission's proposal for the EUR 16 bn research budget."
"It is high time that the programme's health research agenda was broadened to include more common diseases: most people have had contact, close or otherwise, with diseases such as cancer, degenerative diseases and cardiovascular diseases."
"By allocating money to research these illnesses, the EU would be seen to be working for real causes that affect real people's lives."
"The ethical, legal and social aspects of research issues are increasingly important, if not as important as actual research."
"Therefore, by calling for the funding in these areas, the committee is showing an awareness of the importance of these modern-day issues."
"The call to allocate money to the information society demonstrates a real commitment to substantiate the Union's stated ambitions laid out at the Lisbon so-called dot-com summit, to make the EU one of the most competitive and dynamic economies in the world."
"There is no other option: if the EU wants to become a credible global player in the new economy and the information society, substantive amounts of money should be invested in this domain as soon as possible."
"Finally, the allocation of money for research should always be informed by a consideration for the environment."
"By funding research into renewable energies, this report shows itself to be balanced and environmentally sound."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.51 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Madam President, during this afternoon' s vote, there was unfortunately some confusion with regard to the Jarzembowski report."
"The view adopted by my group was that if cargo handling was not included in the directive, we would vote against it."
"We thought that that was the case, but that appeared not so."
"Hence the confusion."
"It was our group' s intention at the end, during the final vote, to vote in favour and not against, as we did, and I should like to have this minuted."
"Mr Sterckx, we gladly note your group' s wishes."
"International situation"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the international situation."
"Mrs Durant, President-in-Office of the Council, now has the floor."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, since the attacks on 11 September the international situation has entered a serious crisis."
"The purpose of my statement is to update you on the crisis and inform you of the initiatives that the Council has taken and will take further."
"I will therefore concentrate on the question of Afghanistan, which lies at the heart of the current crisis, after which I will also discuss the situation in the Middle East."
"With regard to Afghanistan, when the Council found itself faced with an emergency situation it reacted with determination and clarity."
"At its meetings of 21 September and 19 October, the European Council defined the framework of the European Union's action, which comprises two main elements. The first is solidarity with the United States and support for the actions taken as part of its legitimate defence and in compliance with UN Security Council Resolution 1368, on the understanding that these actions must be targeted and endeavour to spare the civilian population."
"The second is to contribute to the anti-terrorist coalition formed under the aegis of the United Nations."
"In late September, the troika visited Pakistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Egypt, where it had in fact met the Arab League leaders."
"Recently, it visited countries in Central Asia."
"The EU-Russia Summit of 3 October and the European Conference of 20 October were an opportunity to discuss the action to be taken at international level."
"The November meeting of the General Assembly will offer a further opportunity to reinforce this coalition."
"In concrete terms, the European Union's strategy towards Afghanistan follows five broad lines: attaching priority to emergency humanitarian aid, the central role of the UN, the quest for a just and lasting internal political settlement, the importance of a reconstruction plan for the country and, lastly, the need to give the stabilisation plan a regional dimension."
"It should be noted that the General Affairs Council of 17 October in Luxembourg and the informal summit of 19 October in Ghent clearly approved these five strategy lines."
"With regard to emergency humanitarian aid, to date we have mobilised some EUR 320 million to deal with the crisis of the refugees and displaced people and with the effects of the famine."
"The main difficulty is access to the people in need, which requires full cooperation from Afghanistan's neighbouring states."
"The presidency has taken various steps to that end."
"With regard to the release and distribution of the aid, there is close cooperation between the Member States' cooperation agencies, ECHO and the various international humanitarian organisations, such as the HCR, the World Food Programme, the ICRC and the many NGOs."
"The second strategy line is the central role of the UN."
"The European Union recognises the United Nations as the sole body with the international legitimacy to seek an internal political solution."
"The United Nations will also have a determining role to play in the implementation of a reconstruction plan for the country."
"The European Union therefore supports the UN Secretary-General and his representative for Afghanistan in their efforts."
"It is also most interested in the plan that has just been submitted by Mr Brahimi, the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative."
"The Council is coordinating its efforts with a view to deciding how best it can contribute to the implementation of this plan."
"On the question of an internal political settlement, the European Union believes it is important for the future Afghan authorities to be elected by the Afghans, for them to be representative of the ethnic groups on the ground and for them to respect and promote human rights, humanitarian rights and the rule of law in general; finally, they must refuse to cooperate in any way with terrorism and maintain harmonious relations with neighbouring states, thereby contributing to general stabilisation."
"For the time being, the European Union prefers not to openly advocate any one solution over another, leaving this to the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General and to the Afghans themselves."
"Regarding the reconstruction plan, in the light of internal political developments in Afghanistan, the European Union believes it is urgently necessary to draw up a reconstruction plan for the country."
"It wishes to be involved, together with many other actors, including the donor countries and international organisations."
"It also believes that this will be a long-term undertaking that will require a long-term commitment by those participating in the plan."
"With regard to regional strategy, the European Union believes there can be no lasting peace in Afghanistan unless a regional approach is taken."
"In other words, Afghanistan's neighbours, together with certain other powers in the region, must be convinced that peace in Afghanistan will also be to their advantage."
"Legitimate account must also be taken of these states' security concerns, so as to avoid any further repetition of the foreign interference that has so often undermined Afghanistan and fuelled its internal conflicts."
"The European Union regards the following countries and international organisations as having an essential role to play in any regional strategy with regard to the Afghan question: Pakistan, Iran, India, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, China, Russia and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference."
"Obviously we cannot discuss the latest developments. Events have speeded up over the last few days with the capture of Mazar-I-Sharif and Kabul."
"These events show that the Taliban regime and the terrorist networks are gradually losing control of Afghanistan."
"They represent another step towards achieving the international coalition's objectives, namely to root out the terrorist networks."
"During these crucial hours for Afghanistan's future, Mr Verhofstadt, the President-in-Office of the European Council, reiterated the Council's position yesterday, namely that there will be no stability in Afghanistan until a government can be established that is stable, legitimate, democratic and representative of all ethnic groups."
"This government will also have to adhere fully to the principles of human rights."
"He also pointed out that the United Nations must play a key role in helping the Afghans to form a government."
"The European Union intends to support the United Nations' plans to that end and strongly urges the Northern Alliance to contribute unreservedly to these efforts."
"Moreover, the EU is prepared to help Afghanistan draw up and implement a vast reconstruction plan, a vital guarantee of a return to peace."
"This project in no way affects the priority given to emergency humanitarian aid, which the Afghan people now need more urgently than ever."
"Finally, the President-in-Office of the European Council stressed the regional dimension of the Afghan issue."
"While the Afghans must, of course, themselves decide who will govern in the future, at the same time, all the other countries in the region will have to feel reassured by this new Afghan government."
"It is with this in mind that the President of the European Council, accompanied by the President of the Commission, will be visiting India and Pakistan on 23 and 24 November."
"With regard to the Middle East, the European Union continues to be deeply concerned by the situation there."
"The violence and lack of trust between the different parties have prevented a resumption of the political dialogue that should begin with the implementation of the Tenet plan and the Mitchell report recommendations and should conclude with a just and lasting solution to the conflict, based on UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and the principles set out in Madrid and Oslo."
"As part of its strategy of relay diplomacy, the European Union, whether in the form of representatives of the Member States or of the Council, is always present on the ground."
"Thanks largely to the activities of Mr Solana, the High Representative, Mr Moratinos, the Special Envoy, and several European ministers, after many false starts, the Peres-Arafat meeting finally took place on 26 September."
"Unfortunately, the Israelis and the Palestinians did not succeed in this renewed attempt to call a ceasefire."
"The Euromed Conference held in Brussels on 5 and 6 November was an opportunity for a wide-ranging exchange of views on the question of the stability and security of the Mediterranean region."
"It allowed the participants, amongst other things, to take a further step towards resuming a high-level dialogue that could, eventually, restore the trust that would be needed before negotiations on the final status could resume."
"The President of the European Council and the President-in-Office of the Council will be heading for the Middle East again this week."
"They will be accompanied by the President of the Commission and by Mr Solana, the High Representative, whose important role is acknowledged by all the parties involved."
"This mission, which comes under the mandate the informal Council of Ghent entrusted to the Belgian Presidency, will offer an opportunity to remind the parties, once again, of the European Union's clear position on the goals the final negotiations must seek to achieve."
"These are, for the Palestinians, the constitution of a viable and democratic State and an end to the occupation of their territory; for the Israelis, the right to live in peace and security within internationally recognised borders."
"The European Union will also point out that the quest for a global and lasting peace in the region means taking due account of the Israeli-Syrian and Israeli-Lebanese aspects of the conflict, which must be resolved on the basis of the same principles."
"To conclude, as you can see, up to this point the European Union has not stinted its efforts to seek a rapprochement between the various points of view in the Middle East and it will continue along this track for as long as is necessary."
"Furthermore, the European Union continues to keep a very close watch over the development of the situation in Afghanistan and throughout the Central Asian region."
"As a member of the anti-terrorist coalition, it will continue its action to combat all forms of support for international terrorism."
"Madam President, Mrs Durant, ladies and gentlemen, as you know the situation in Afghanistan is changing very quickly."
"Every hour brings its fresh share of dramatic news."
"The military strategy against the Taliban has proved successful."
"Yet it is important to emphasise that despite the encouraging developments of recent days, the task is far from completed."
"The military campaign has not yet achieved all its objectives and we have always made it clear that we regard humanitarian and diplomatic issues as vitally important."
"In the light of what has happened, we will have to redouble our efforts in this regard."
"Moreover, even greater efforts will have to be made to establish a broad-based government for the Afghan people."
"As Mrs Durant emphasised, we strongly support the process conducted by the United Nations, under the aegis of Ambassador Brahimi."
"Furthermore, we must exploit the new military situation and intensify our humanitarian efforts."
"The Commission is playing an active role on both these fronts."
"Last week, Commissioner Patten met Mr Wolfensohn, President of the World Bank, and this week he has held talks with Ambassador Brahimi in New York."
"The Commission will cooperate closely with the World Bank and the other parties involved with a view to evaluating the needs and contributing to the reconstruction work in Afghanistan."
"The Commission does not propose to speculate at this moment on the exact amounts of money involved."
"First of all the international community will have to assess urgent needs and, in consultation with the Afghan people, define exactly what is needed."
"Meanwhile, we are trying to ensure that the EUR 52 million in aid allocated under the ECHO programme for 2001 and the EUR 22.5 million earmarked in 2001 for displaced persons will indeed reach those who need it."
"In addition, thanks to the World Food Programme, we are now providing EUR 23.5 million in food aid, that is, about 36 300 tonnes, and we are granting the NGOs EUR 4.5 million for supplying the population with food, seeds and tools, that is, a total of EUR 100 million in aid this year."
"Furthermore, we have already decided, at the very least, to maintain these levels in 2002."
"As you know, the Commission has spared no effort since the events of 11 September."
"As you also know, in the space of a few days we presented new measures to combat terrorism in Europe and, in particular, proposed a common definition of acts of terrorism, a European arrest warrant to replace the cumbersome extradition system now in force between the Member States, more stringent rules on money laundering and, lastly, legislative provisions to ensure that the assets of an individual or an organisation can be quickly frozen throughout Europe as soon as they are identified as a potential source of finance for terrorism."
"Moreover, the Commission hastened to take measures to improve aviation security, ranging from access to the cockpit to luggage checks."
"At the same time, the European ministers jointly decided that the Member States should try to protect the airlines from the worst consequences of 11 September, for instance, by giving them insurance cover against acts of terrorism, something the commercial insurance companies were no longer offering, while avoiding a war of subsidies, which would distort competition."
"The European Union is also distributing massive humanitarian aid both within and outside Afghanistan."
"The Union and its Member States have already mobilised EUR 310 million to alleviate the sufferings of the Afghan people."
"This effort, which only the United States has surpassed, has largely gone unheeded, but it has already saved lives."
"Furthermore, the ECHO humanitarian aid office has been remarkably diligent in acting on its undertakings."
"Under the aegis of President Romano Prodi, the Commission is also involved in crucial diplomatic efforts; Mrs Durant has already described Mr Prodi's itinerary over the coming days and weeks."
"This clearly shows that Europeans want to take a balanced, international diplomatic approach."
"As you know, in the days immediately after the attacks, Mr Chris Patten, accompanied by Mr Louis Michel, the Belgian Foreign Minister representing the Belgian Presidency of the EU Council, and Mr Solana, travelled to Pakistan, Iran, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Syria."
"Wherever they went, the message they heard was the same: mankind as a whole must unite in the fight against terrorism."
"They discussed the need for closer cooperation within the region."
"The Union has already taken an important trade decision by improving the access of Pakistani exports to Europe and we hope we will soon be able to conclude a free-trade agreement with the six Gulf Cooperation Council states."
"Furthermore, we will be putting forward proposals on the conclusion of a trade and cooperation agreement with Iran."
"We will also play our full part in the efforts to relaunch the peace process in the Middle East, not only by giving financial support to the Palestinian Authority, which is beset by enormous difficulties, but also by trying to ensure the implementation of the Mitchell report that the European Union co-signed."
"As Mrs Durant pointed out, this week Mr Peres and Mr Arafat both attended the Euro-Mediterranean Conference held in Brussels."
"As you can see, the European Union is pursuing a common foreign policy, but this is not a single policy."
"Each country, each institution, draws on its own assets and pools its own resources for the sake of the common cause."
"The action the individual Member States decide to take underpins the common effort, and vice versa."
"The fact that the Member States take independent measures, especially in times of crisis, is not a sign of failure on the part of the Union. It illustrates the very nature of the Union."
"In conclusion, let me tell you, on behalf of the Commission, that we are all aware that the events of 11 September have changed the parameters and we have recognised that the attacks on New York and Washington were attacks not only on the United States but also on every free and open society."
"The threat is a common threat, which is why it needs a concerted response."
"The European Union, and the European Commission in particular, are making their full contribution to this common objective and we intend to continue along these lines."
"Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the day before yesterday, an aeroplane crashed over New York, and once again, we all held our breath because we were afraid that it was another terrorist attack."
"Thankfully, it was not an act of terrorism, although it was a truly horrific incident."
"However, Monday's fears show that terrorism is affecting our lives and that we cannot simply continue with 'business as usual' ."
"We must therefore make it clear that we regard terrorism as an enormous challenge, an intellectual, political, economic and, indeed, a military challenge."
"I welcome your comments, Madam President-in-Office of the Council."
"They tie in precisely with the keywords which I have written in my notes: we must dismantle the terrorist networks."
"This is the task now being undertaken in Afghanistan."
"We have all seen the pictures, which show the joy on people's faces in Kabul but also the dead bodies, obviously the victims of massacres. We therefore appeal to the Northern Alliance, which was led by Ahmed Shah Massoud, a responsible leader whom we welcomed here in April, to conduct itself in Afghanistan and in Kabul in a way which demonstrates that it is a good representative, also for human dignity and a better future for this suffering country."
"What we now need, and I agree with the President-in-Office of the Council on this point, is action from the United Nations."
"I welcome the fact that our American friends are involving the United Nations in this way."
"However, what we also need, and the European Union must play a key role here, is an alliance, a coalition for the reconstruction of Afghanistan."
"We must not repeat the mistake of the 1980s and 1990s, when we left Afghanistan to fend for itself. We must give Afghanistan our help."
"The European Union's role throughout this conflict, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, has been rather pathetic."
"Of course, the military issues are primarily national issues."
"We are not yet at the point where we, Europeans, can genuinely take on a joint role."
"However, I am extremely embarrassed by the conduct of some of the European Union countries over recent weeks."
"First of all, there was a tripartite meeting during the informal summit in Ghent, and then there was the meeting in London."
"I must say that I found this embarrassing."
"We do not have any self-appointed chiefs within the European Union; we have a European Union with a Council Presidency and a Commission."
"In London, the representatives, even the President-in-Office of the Council, invited themselves, and I found that especially embarrassing."
"Great Britain, France, Italy, Spain, Germany, the Netherlands and the Belgian Presidency attended the meeting in London;"
"Greece, Portugal, Austria, Finland, Sweden, Luxembourg, Ireland and Denmark did not."
"I would have expected the Belgian Presidency, which I hold in high esteem, especially the Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, to protest about this meeting, as it should have been the presidency's task to invite Member States to a meeting of this kind instead of having to request an invitation to go to London."
"I hope that different procedures will be adopted in future and that this kind of division within the European Union will not happen again."
"Of course, we have to learn from our mistakes."
"I hope that we will learn from these mistakes as well."
"From our group's point of view, it is essential that we act jointly, not only at the level of intergovernmental cooperation."
"We want joint action from Europe, and we expect resolute and courageous action from the Council Presidency in this context too."
"We will support the Council Presidency if it responds in this way, and we will also support the Commission."
"Mr Busquin, I call upon the Commission, its President and all its members: please make Europe's voice heard!"
"The Commission must get involved; it must state its opinion, and it must not simply accept what we have witnessed in recent weeks and months."
"We have a chance if we take this resolute stance, and I can say on behalf of our group that we will be resolute in our support for the Council Presidency and the Commission if the shared interests of the European Union are stated clearly."
"We call on you to take this action."
"If you do so, you can be sure of our support."
"Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, little more than two months after the attacks of 11 September, we have all understood, including the United States, that, in order to confront global terrorism, we need to create a policy with many dimensions: military, security, intelligence, humanitarian, I would add cultural, and others."
"And we need a common will: that of the coalition, whose framework or basis is the United Nations."
"The news over recent days confirms that hope is beginning to come to Afghanistan, and we must state one thing very clearly: the primary victims and hostages of the aggressive fundamentalism of terrorism have been the Afghans, and particularly, the Afghan women, because it is they who have suffered most from this situation."
"This is demonstrated by the television pictures we are seeing of women, and men, but particularly women, who can now move around with their faces exposed."
"That is my first point."
"We now have the obligation, through the United Nations, to seek a political solution to the Afghan situation, firstly, and to the whole complex problem of Central Asia."
"The European Union must continue to cooperate in terms of humanitarian aid and cooperate with the UNHCR in order to deal with the problem of the refugees and displaced persons, and also so that, under the auspices of the United Nations, there is a plan for stability and future democracy in Afghanistan."
"Secondly, we must continue to intensify our action, so that the European Union can respond to terrorism."
"Police cooperation is improving."
"Just yesterday, eleven people from Bin Laden' s network in Spain were arrested in my country, and this is happening every day in other countries of the Union."
"In general, we are guaranteeing the rights of people who want to fight our democratic and pluralist system, and this is to our credit, but it causes problems."
"And in Parliament we are trying to move ahead quickly, together with the Commission, to create a common anti-terrorist policy."
"We must continue in that vein."
"Thirdly, we note that we lack the capacity to act jointly in a military sense."
"Up to a point, we have compensated for that lack by means of other policies, but that does not justify this vacuum in the security and defence policy."
"Rather than looking back to see who was at the meeting in Ghent, or, bringing to mind that old film, 'Guess who' s coming to dinner' , working out who was in London and who was not, what the European Parliament has to say to the Council and the Commission is that we want the security and defence policy to be included in the Treaties."
"I will take this opportunity to say to the Commissioner that my group, and, I believe, the whole of Parliament, hopes that the Commission, using its powers as guardian of the Treaties, and also its powers of initiative, will take a clear approach in relation to Laeken and the Convention by raising these issues."
"We will support them in that and, in this way, we will be able to overcome the current situation: updating our security and defence policy, updating the Petersberg tasks and stating it jointly."
"That must be our response."
"I would like to make a final comment, Madam President, on an absolutely essential point which we were able to raise in the Euro-Mediterranean forum, which followed the forum held by the Council, where we were able to speak with our colleagues, parliamentarians from both sides of the Mediterranean."
"We heard voices - Arab, Israeli and European - agreeing that we have to continue working, and the European Union is playing a central role for the first time, in order to create an Israeli State with secure borders together with a Palestinian State which also has secure borders."
"This is the only possible basis for a stable solution in the Middle East."
"We, in Parliament, must therefore decisively support the work of our representatives, both here and in the Middle East."
"Madam President, the war in Afghanistan is clearly now producing military dividends, as has been seen in the past 48 hours in the extraordinary scale and speed of the collapse of the Taliban, although they still remain potentially very powerful in large parts of the country and the terrorists they have been succouring remain hidden from view."
"However there are aspects of the war and not just the terrorist aspect which have been kept hidden and one group I should like to mention - to which, Madam President, you paid tribute on Monday - is the journalists who paid the ultimate price to tell us the story."
"We know so little about modern war and we are so excluded by the powers-that-be that without the commitment and professionalism of journalists we would know nothing."
"We need to reiterate that debt of gratitude."
"What we know from the comparative success in Mazar-i-Sharif and now in Kabul, and even reports of the front line extending to Kandahar, is that new challenges are presenting themselves."
"The international coalition - particularly the United States and not least its President - has assumed that the Northern Alliance is in some ways biddable, that it will do certain things and not others."
"So we were told with some certainty that it would not take Kabul."
"But it is there."
"It seems to me that it is not quite so biddable as many in the coalition suggested or hoped."
"It makes all the more urgent the diplomatic initiative to generate respect for the rule of law and a stable governmental process, even if not yet a stable government."
"It becomes more urgent because new freedoms are emerging even as I speak, as we can see in the television pictures from Kabul."
"But we also hear of new fears, because Afghanistan has a brutal history and the brutality was not just the work of the Taliban."
"So there is a great need for urgency."
"The second challenge is the humanitarian one, which preceded the war but has been compounded by it."
"Now that there is a larger swathe of territory not subject to Taliban control, we must visibly and urgently assess what needs to be done and be present on the ground."
"Our support for the humanitarian effort needs to be translated into practical action."
"The Commissioner spoke of extraordinary amounts of money, which I think he said were largely unrecognised."
"Unfortunately Europe's contribution is often unremarked in these situations, and we have to have a visible presence on the ground and show our solidarity, not just in the military campaign but also in the humanitarian effort."
"I have two final comments."
"One concerns the Middle East."
"I salute the quiet but effective diplomacy of Mr Solana and his colleagues, the Belgian Presidency, the Commission and others, because, while America has been looking in another direction, we have managed to de-escalate the worst of the tensions, a necessary prelude to the Mitchell process which is the path to a viable peace."
"Colleagues have referred to the European security and defence policy."
"My group is strongly in favour of it and welcomed the moves in that direction."
"We thought that was what ESDP was, until we discovered recently at Downing Street that it is European security and dining policy."
"Madam President, I should like to hear your comments on the European security and dining policy, which runs counter to the concept of a European security and defence policy that is for all and not just for some."
"Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I shall confine my contribution to Afghanistan."
"It is extremely difficult to question the military course of affairs because the situation is so extremely fluid."
"I should nevertheless like to ask one question in this connection, namely with regard to an element which, in my view, will remain high-priority for the foreseeable future."
"It concerns the idea of sending a UN peace-keeping force to Kabul to ensure that the situation there does not get out of hand."
"Has the Council discussed in any way or at any time the fact that European countries, or the Union perhaps as a whole, would make a contribution to the UN peace-keeping force, or does the Council hold the view that it would be best if this UN peace-keeping force were to comprise representatives from Muslim countries only?"
"In other words, is future involvement by the EU provided for in this UN peace-keeping force?"
"I should now like to turn to the humanitarian aspect."
"It is clear that there are still many needs and it is also evident that the invasion of large parts of Afghanistan by the Northern Alliance enhances the prospect of granting this aid."
"Does the Commission know whether at the moment, or over the next few days, all aid which the Commission wishes to grant is being delivered promptly and adequately, or are there still obstacles?"
"If so, what are they?"
"Finally, I should like to touch upon the political and diplomatic dimension."
"My group fears that the politicians will be trampled underfoot by the military."
"The fact of the matter is that the military conquests have preceded the political ones."
"My group is concerned that finding a political solution could be frustrated or perhaps even made impossible if the Northern Alliance continues to advance southwards."
"I know that the European Union and the EU Member States, alongside UN representative Mr Brahimi, are involved in finding what you refer to as a stable government."
"What is the EU' s specific involvement at the moment, and in the next few days, in finding this political solution which, in my view, takes priority over anything else?"
"This might well be higher on the list of priorities than a military solution."
"If no political solution is found, any military invasion could well be in vain."
"I should like to finish off with a comment on London."
"I am not so much concerned about the fact that countries that make military contributions, and that want to discuss this, meet in London."
"What does worry me is the fact that the agenda of London also featured the Middle East policy."
"I would ask you, among others, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, whether Middle East policy is drafted in London or in Brussels."
"Mrs Durant, Commissioner Busquin, let us not disguise our pleasure at once again hearing the sound of music on the streets of the Afghan capital and a woman's voice broadcasting on Radio Kabul."
"It does us all good to read the sense of liberation on the faces of the Afghans and the rout of some of the most obscurantist and cruel oppressors the world has seen."
"Let us however, without further ado, take a good look at all the aspects of the situation today, to make sure that our hopes are not soon overshadowed by a new nightmare."
"Firstly, the fighting is, alas, not yet at an end."
"The Taliban have regrouped in southern Afghanistan and near the border with Pakistan, where they will go to any lengths to try to save, at whatever price, the remnants of their power and capacity to inflict harm."
"It would be a disaster if they managed to gain support for their deadly cause from Pashtun groupings, who might feel rejected by the new leaders of Afghanistan."
"As for the various rival factions that make up the Northern Alliance, we must beware of idealising them."
"The way women are treated in some of the provinces under its control gives real cause for concern."
"Furthermore, its past conduct, only five years ago, and the disturbing information we have received from Mazar-i-Sharif unfortunately suggest that there is a risk that sooner or later they will embark on a bloody settling of scores in the reconquered territories."
"Experience shows that what were once effective aids to military action can turn into serious obstacles to a political solution."
"From the outset, the political issue has been the determining factor."
"Secondly, we must look at the distress of the Afghan people, exhausted by five years of terror, months of drought and misery, followed by five weeks of intensive bombing."
"The UN estimates that seven and a half million people are at risk of famine in this devastated country."
"In fact, Mr Lakhdar Brahimi, the UN Special Representative, has repeatedly called for a rapid end to the war for this very reason."
"What the country does need, however, is emergency aid and development aid on a large scale."
"For let us not forget that international opinion was mobilised specifically in order to neutralise the terrorist networks, to cut off the sources, mainly financial, that feed them and also to destroy the social and political breeding ground on which they thrive."
"To date, we have certainly not achieved this just and ambitious aim and any failure to find a political solution to the Afghan problem would only take us further from attaining it."
"This explains the role that an international player such as the European Union, and particularly the UN, must fulfil through its Member States, as well as within the framework of our relations with the American leaders and with the countries of the region. This will enable a political solution to be found that comes from all sectors of Afghan society and from Afghanis who, until now have been the chief victims of the Taliban, must now be among the agents of change."
"Madam President, there is a taboo word that I have not heard mentioned in this hour of debate and which I do not hear in the negotiation meetings held in Rome or Peshawar, in Islamabad or New York."
"It is a taboo which I, or rather we, intend to confront: women' s participation, the substantial participation of women in the provisional government of Afghanistan."
"The United Nations Secretary General hopes for an ethnically balanced transitional government."
"The Council, in the person of Mrs Durant, has told us she hopes for a fair and lasting composition."
"But what justice are we talking about?"
"What balance are we talking about?"
"Millions of Afghan women have not only been the primary victims but have also been the major architects of non-violent opposition all these years throughout the world."
"You know them: they are the women from Negar and RAWA; they have been here in the European Parliament; they were the ones who ran the country before the Taliban."
"They made up 40 per cent of the medical staff, 50 per cent of the teachers, 70 per cent of the administration, while the men were off making war."
"Yet around the negotiating table I only see men with beards, some longer, some shorter, but I have not seen any of those fantastic women we have met any more."
"Well, I know very well that I will be greeted with smiles and grins everywhere."
"I know very well how I felt when faced by those smiles in ' 97 and ' 98, when this Parliament and the Commission were, to my knowledge, the only institutions that supported the campaign 'A flower for the women of Kabul' in 1997."
"This courage of ours - of yours, ladies and gentlemen - I believe should continue."
"Now, enough of the gossip, the discrimination, the exclamations of 'women, poor things' !"
"No, enough of that!"
"We want Afghan women to take on conspicuous political responsibility in the reconstruction of their country in the transitional government."
"I know this will not be enough; I know public opinion needs to be mobilised."
"Therefore on 24 November we are promoting a day of fasting throughout the world, a world satyagraha, precisely so that women can at last form a part of this provisional government."
"I hope this proposal of ours will not be received with the usual derision."
"Often, those who concern themselves seriously with human rights have much greater vision, application and objectivity than those who always believe they know it all and think that the world today can go on simply with the traditional Realpolitik."
"Things are not like that."
"The human side, people are the architects of their futures."
"What future can there be, however, without half of the population?"
"Therefore: 24 November, world satyagraha day, so that women can form part of this provisional government."
"Madam President, last April, when we received Commander Ahmad Shah Massoud in this Chamber, he told us that the fall of the Taliban regime was inevitable given that the Pakistani government would find itself unable to provide it with any political and, in particular, military aid."
"All that Massoud asked of the international community and the European Union was to exercise effective diplomatic pressure on Pakistan to stop it from interfering in any way in the domestic affairs of Afghanistan."
"He was counting on his awareness of the Afghan people's exasperation with the Taliban when he predicted that it would rebel, including in the largely Pashtun southern territories."
"He assured us that he had set up an Alliance network throughout the country that would guarantee the establishment of a broad-based government of national unity."
"The speed of events over the past 48 hours has surprised only those of our learned experts who, without ever having been on the ground, professed that the anti-Taliban Alliance was made up only of a bunch of warlords who were just as barbaric as the Taliban themselves, and even more dangerous because inspired only by a hunger for power that would inevitably trigger new quarrels among themselves."
"Echoing the anxiety shown in Islamabad, these same experts, totally certain they are right, are still spreading the word via the media that the Northern Alliance represents only a very small percentage of the opinion of the Afghan people, who are supposedly still attached to the peace that only the Taliban have managed to bring them."
"The jubilant popular demonstrations in Kabul, the rebellion now underway in Kandahar itself, the signs of the return of thousands of refugees suffice to show that these prophets of doom were misled."
"The Members of this Chamber who had the intelligence to listen to Massoud will certainly rejoice."
"Yes, the situation remains politically fragile."
"It is up to the international community, and within it the European Union, to help establish this united government, which the former king, Zahir Shah, is willing to support."
"Yes, we must also give the Afghan people all the material aid it needs to recover from a disastrous humanitarian situation, in which, as Mr Wurtz said, we fear for the survival of 1.5 million Afghans who are at risk of famine and for the health of more than 6 million who are now at risk of serious malnutrition."
"We hoped that the Council and the Commission would be prepared to give undertakings along these lines without delay."
"I thank the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner for confirming this."
"Madam President, Afghanistan is currently going through a time of uncertainty that will prove crucial for the future."
"The end of the Taliban dictatorship opens the door to a process of democratic reconstruction, which, however, is still far from a foregone conclusion."
"We will probably see Islamist guerrilla warfare on the Algerian model, against which massive bombing is pointless and will have to be halted."
"The European Union must adopt a strong and clear stance for, as Mrs Emma Bonino and Mr Francis Wurtz said, Afghan women must not be sacrificed in the process of political reconstruction."
"The participation of women is the key to the lasting reconstruction of Afghanistan."
"They will have to be present as from the first negotiations and will have to participate in a new government as from the first day."
"That is the only solution that can guarantee the protection and respect for the rights of women and all human rights."
"The European Union could not endorse a proposed government that did not take account of this crucial dimension."
"The integration of women is also a first step towards democracy."
"Unfortunately, this democracy cannot accommodate warlords who have proved guilty of repeated human rights abuses, a wide range of acts of violence and who, whatever side they are on, are more concerned with defending their ethnic group than with the future of their country."
"We must put an end to the reign of impunity."
"The Afghans must be represented by a mixed, democratic government that represents all the ethnic groups and respects human rights."
"Madam President, recent events have demonstrated to the world that the military strategy being pursued by the American government in Afghanistan is working."
"The removal of the Taliban from power in Afghanistan is a legitimate objective."
"The Taliban is harbouring Osama bin Laden, an international terrorist who has committed heinous acts of terror, not only this year, but in recent years too."
"Harbouring terrorists is a crime in itself."
"The fall of key strategic cities in Afghanistan this week will certainly help in the process of eroding the power of the Taliban."
"But much work remains to be done if the Taliban are to be defeated in the near future."
"They are a military force to be reckoned with and they have extensive military experience."
"I hope that the Taliban regime can be defeated and replaced by a broader alliance of political groupings in Afghanistan."
"This is not going to be an easy task, but it must be vigorously pursued as a military option."
"Under UN Resolution 1373 it is incumbent on us all to ensure that those involved in perpetrating such vile acts of terrorism in America last September are brought to justice."
"We too must prevent further terrorist attacks, and this can only be achieved if the international community continues to work closely together."
"One issue which clearly needs to be addressed in the context of the war in Afghanistan relates to the humanitarian needs of the Afghan people."
"The international community, under the auspices of the United Nations and through the European Union, must bring forward a visible and viable strategy to guarantee that humanitarian supplies are delivered to the Afghan people."
"A visible humanitarian strategy must be an absolute priority if the Afghan people are going to be able to live through a very cold winter."
"There must be a safe and consistent delivery of humanitarian aid to those in need."
"This can only be carried out with the involvement of the international community and key non-governmental organisations."
"In time the United Nations and the European Union should be given positive roles as new political structures develop in Afghanistan."
"We must all play our part in guaranteeing that international terrorism is defeated."
"Clearly, a multi-faceted approach is needed if we are to guarantee that the roots of international terrorism are tackled head-on."
"In conclusion, it is very important that we reiterate the message that the war against terrorism is not a battle against Islam."
"There are millions of Muslims living within the Union who are fully integrated within our societies and who contribute positively to the development of the European Union."
"The European Union as a political entity is a friend, and will always be a friend, to the Muslim people."
"We must reaffirm this message at every opportunity."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it has been shown that the strategy pursued in Afghanistan by the coalition against terrorism is the right one."
"It has also been shown that this is not merely a matter of hunting down terrorists, but also liberating a nation from a government which is far from popular among its own people."
"This has been shown quite clearly, and I think we should say so in all frankness in order to make it clear in this way that we have nothing against an Islamic people; on the contrary, we want to work with it to build a future in freedom."
"Of course, this also means, and this is borne out by Afghanistan's history, that we should work together with its own government and respect its decisions, and that it is not our task to involve ourselves in the details."
"I think this is also extremely important if the task of creating a government of reconciliation in Afghanistan is to be mastered successfully."
"Here, the European Union must take an active role with its conflict prevention and civilian crisis management capacities and help organise the reconstruction of the country on this basis, as long as this is what the parties involved want."
"In more general terms, the events of recent weeks have shown that in the areas where the European Union functions effectively, it can make a significant contribution."
"I do not believe that the coalition against terrorism would have operated as effectively in the Middle East without the European Union and the visits by its troika."
"On the other hand, we must acknowledge that in the military field, where we are particularly weak, we have continued to rely heavily on bilateralism and directed solutions. I think it is clear that in all areas of security and defence policy, we must move more resolutely towards a community approach."
"It must become clear that even the larger Member States, which think they still have a role to play, actually had no influence on all the strategies which have been enforced. We must therefore accept that we will only have a role to play if we act jointly, if we achieve our common goal of establishing a 60 000-strong rapid deployment force by 2003, and if we underpin our conflict prevention and crisis management capacities credibly with this third component."
"I also think that this must, to a substantial extent, be discussed in the light of Laeken and in the context of the post-Nice process."
"Time and again, when we are active in the foreign policy field, we see the extent to which our inadequate structures prevent us from bringing our full weight to bear."
"I am thinking in particular of the frequent organisational chaos in the Balkans and the competition not only between Solana and Patten but also between the parallel structures which were established and which, as experience has shown, work against and not with each other."
"These structures must be rationalised, perhaps in the hands of the Commission with their own legitimation via the Council."
"In my view, these are the lessons we have learned from the last two months, and we should call on the governments in our countries to respond appropriately. I believe it is necessary, in the interests of the future viability of our nations, to cultivate this community method to a greater extent in future in the field of foreign and security policy too."
"Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I hope you will forgive me if I go over my speaking time by half a minute."
"Since Mr McMillan-Scott is not here, we could possibly steal half a minute of his time."
"First of all, I should like to say that, unfortunately, the objective of the fight against international terrorism has not been achieved with the fall of Kabul nor will it be by a possible fall of Kandahar soon."
"We must, of course, focus on many other criteria."
"Of major importance are, naturally, the tracking down of terrorist cells in, inter alia, Europe, the freezing of financial sources of international terrorism and the whole discussion, also in our society, around the question as to what groups are, in fact, active in our society and how we can call a halt to their activities."
"In my view, a large number of conditions must also be created in Afghanistan in order to be able to remove this kind of breeding ground for international terrorism."
"A multi-ethnic government is logical, but we must also manage to find a special solution for Kabul, of course."
"Peace must be established with the countries around Afghanistan to ensure that an area of stability and peace is created."
"The refugees must be able to return home and a massive amount of money must be invested in the reconstruction of Afghanistan."
"Finally, we must ensure that a government is put in place that respects human rights."
"That is a total package."
"The causes can be found indirectly in the Middle East."
"Although that is not the case, that argument is being used by Bin Laden."
"I therefore believe that the Middle East peace process needs an extra boost and I also wonder whether the time has come to do this now."
"I would direct this question to the President-in-Office of the Council, if she happens to be listening."
"I would especially ask you whether you, together with the Commission, could not ensure that a UN resolution on a Palestinian state could now be laid down at long last?"
"Has the time not come for pushing for breakthroughs on this score, as we did years ago with Israel?"
"I also wonder whether an evaluation is not needed of the role of Saudi-Arabia in the funding of all possible institutions in western Europe which one would be right to question?"
"The position of Syria has already been mentioned."
"As our President has already pointed out, I also believe it is useful and necessary to help the young Assad to play the far more positive role which we had all expected of him, but which, through all kinds of circumstances, he was unable to fulfil."
"As, however, Syria plays a crucial role, a great deal more needs to be done there."
"If we as the EU want to play a part, also in the peace process as a whole, we must be careful what action we undertake, for example, in connection with the arms sales or the supply of goods for dual use to Iran."
"Israel is monitoring the proceedings with great concern, and I believe that these kinds of signals are of the utmost importance."
"Finally, nearly everyone has already said it, and I am not about to repeat it, but it is unacceptable for the European Union to continue to send out a disintegrated picture."
"We must show a united front and act at Community level in terms of external, peace and security policy."
"If we still fail to get the message, how can we then expect to play a role on the world stage?"
"I therefore make a dramatic appeal, also to the presidency, to make huge strides forward on this score."
"Madam President, I am very glad we are holding this debate today, at a moment when the situation in Afghan is changing by the hour and, I hope, for the better."
"I know that Europe has two obligations towards Afghanistan."
"Together with the UN, we must press for a political settlement of the conflict, aimed, as Guy Verhofstadt said, at the establishment of a stable, legitimate and democratic government that is very broadly representative of all the ethnic groups and abides by the principles of human rights."
"Yet I believe we also have a second duty towards Afghanistan, an urgent duty."
"We know that the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan is a tragedy."
"It is the result of the combined effect of a war that has been devastating this country for 23 years and the drought that has plagued it for the past three years."
"We know that seven million people were dependent on humanitarian aid even before the military operations began."
"We also know that up to 100 000 children may die this winter unless adequate supplies reach them in the coming weeks."
"That is why we call on Europe to take urgent, large-scale measures in face of this humanitarian tragedy."
"In the framework of what we hope will become a process of permanent consultation between the European Union, the United States, Afghanistan's neighbouring states, the specialist UN agencies and the NGOs working in Afghanistan, we call, as you, Madam President, have also done on several occasions, for the creation of safe humanitarian corridors through which emergency food aid and shelter for the displaced Afghans can be brought in."
"This is not only an urgent requirement; it is quite simply the duty of the peoples of the European Union, whom we represent here."
"Madam President, I will reply or, at least, try to give some kind of reply to the comments made during this debate, which is all the more interesting because it is being held at a moment when we have very high hopes while at the same time having little idea of what the outcome will be."
"Let me first take you back to the famous meeting in London that several of you mentioned and remind you that this meeting was certainly not arranged at the presidency's initiative."
"The presidency is responsible for inviting and chairing the meetings of the Fifteen."
"The Ghent meeting, by contrast, was convened for military reasons or, in other words, those who wished to meet in Ghent cited military reasons."
"In regard to the London meeting, let me also point out that the presidency was invited to that meeting but as I said, the meeting was not held at its initiative."
"Once he had been invited, Mr Verhofstadt, the President of the European Council, naturally contacted his various colleagues immediately to ascertain their individual positions."
"He was strongly encouraged to go to London and at the COREPER meeting the following day, he immediately undertook to report back on everything that would be said in London and chose to be accompanied by Mr Solana, since he felt that these issues were indeed most important and related to security."
"So these are a few facts about the context of this meeting in London. Allow me to repeat that the European Union obviously plays a diplomatic and political role but also a humanitarian one - and I am saying this not just by the way but as a definite statement."
"I declared in my introductory statement, as Mr Busquin also declared on behalf of the Commission, that we attach great importance to humanitarian questions, not only at the level of words or financial resources, but also and above all at the level of deeds."
"We are making sure that we take action here."
"You may be certain that the presidency of the Council and the Commission are determined to make very concrete, specific and urgent progress in terms of responding to the situation and endeavouring to do so very visibly."
"It is indeed important, over and above the action to be taken, for people to know and see that the European Union wants to play and will play a role in this respect."
"I agree with Mr Poettering that Europe must speak with one voice."
"I can assure you that the Presidency of the Council has done its utmost to ensure this, in particular at the London meeting. It was a meeting we did not convene but prior to which the presidency was asked to consult the other Member States and to attend together with Mr Solana."
"That is what I have to say on London, Ghent and these matters."
"In reply to Mr Lagendijk's question about, amongst other things, the United Nations force and the post-Taliban regime, the Council has not yet discussed the participation of the European Union as such in a United Nations force and has not, therefore, determined its position at this stage."
"Therefore I cannot give it."
"Conversely, regarding the stabilisation of the post-Taliban regime, I think that will necessarily require consultation with the countries of the region under the aegis of the United Nations and therefore of the Security Council."
"Since we are discussing this post-Taliban regime, which we all hope will be stable, multi-ethnic and democratic, while also knowing that the road will be a difficult one, let me put particular emphasis on a question which I and the Presidency of the Council feel very strongly about, namely the gender question."
"We must indeed aim at a representation and a government that are more democratic, stable, etc. But we must also take the gender question into consideration."
"Neither I nor the Presidency of the Council would find it comprehensible if Afghan women, who were the first victims of the Taliban regime and who suffered a great many deprivations, especially of their rights, while taking on huge responsibilities, were excluded from the formation of this government and its future activities."
"Lastly, I think nearly all the speakers pointed out that we very much need to adopt a more integrated European stance on common security."
"We need to act as a community."
